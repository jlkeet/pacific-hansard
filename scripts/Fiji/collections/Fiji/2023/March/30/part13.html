<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – PERFORMANCE AUDIT ON LICENSING AND  
<br/>MONITORING OF RIVER GRAVEL AND SAND EXTRACTIONS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  on  the  Performance  Audit  on  the 
<br/>Licensing and Monitoring of River Gravel and Sand Extractions which was tabled on 30</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  as  the  current  Chairperson  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Public Accounts, I take this opportunity to move a motion for debate in this august 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  review  of  the  Performance  Audit  on  the  Licensing  and  Monitoring  of  River 
<br/></span><span>Gravel and Sand Extractions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Review Report was prepared by the previous Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>after the audit by the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) and was circulated to all of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the primary objective of the Performance Audit that was 
<br/>carried  out  by  the  OAG was  to  determine  whether  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources 
<br/>(MLMR) have effectively regulated the river gravel and sand extractions through the proper system 
<br/>of  contracting/licensing  and  monitoring  in  order  to  ensure  good  governance  and  sustainable 
<br/>development in the sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  SDGs,  this  Performance  Audit  falls  within  the  ambit  of  SDG9  -  Industry, 
<br/>Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG16 – Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; SDG12 – Responsible 
<br/>Consumption and Production; SDG15 –Life on Land and SDG14 – Life Underwater.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are aware, river gravel and sand extractions fall under the extractive 
<br/>industries  sectors  in  Fiji,  in  addition  to  mining,  petroleum,  hard  rock  quarrying  and  groundwater 
<br/>resource  extractions.  Extractive  industries  consists  of  any  operations  that  remove  oil,  gas,  metal, 
<br/>mineral  and aggregates from the  earth  and/or sea.  The seven  steps of  extractive industries value 
<br/>chain, includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Legal Framework;  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Resource Exploration;  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Awarding of Contracts and Licences;  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Monitoring of Operations;  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Collection of Revenue;  
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Resource Management; and  
<br/>(7)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of Sustainable Policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development of mineral or minerals and aggregates from the earth and sea play a major role 
<br/>in Fiji’s domestic development, especially in the areas of infrastructure, construction of buildings, 
<br/>road, agriculture and disaster reconstruction, as well as supporting a large number of Fijian small and 
<br/>medium-sized domestic enterprises.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>581 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The mining and quarrying of development minerals in Fiji is dominated by crushed aggregate, 
<br/>gravel and sand, used for construction and to a lesser extent, limestone used for agricultural purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that Fiji’s 5 Year and 20 Year National Development Plan expresses 
<br/>the need to revise and update the monitoring and evaluation of mining and quarrying operations for 
<br/>better oversight, in areas such as environmental safeguards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, river gravel and sand extractions are forms of mining, yet gravel and sand 
<br/>are absent from the definition of minerals under Fiji’s Mining Act 1965, for it to be considered a 
<br/>mining  activity.  With  that  restriction,  the  extraction  of  gravel  and  sand  from  rivers  is  regulated 
<br/>through  the  State  Lands  Act  1945  and  the  Rivers  and  Streams  Act  1880  and  its  subsequent 
<br/>regulations. Gravel and sand have often been termed as development minerals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Franks,  Pakoun  and  Ngonze,  2016  provides  a  general  definition  of 
<br/>development minerals which has been adopted in the </span><span>UNDP 2018 Baseline Assessment Report</span><span> of 
<br/>Fiji’s development minerals which stated that, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development  minerals  are  minerals  and  materials  that  are  mined,  processed, 
<br/></span><span>manufactured and used  domestically in  industries such as  construction,  manufacturing 
<br/>and agriculture.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>UNDP 2018 Baseline Assessment Report</span><span> is the product of Fiji’s first ever comprehensive 
<br/>assessment  of  development  minerals  in  Fiji.  The  study  has  identified,  amongst  other  issues,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the significant and acute negative social impacts associated with river gravel and sand 
<br/>extraction operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite these negative impacts which have been supported by sufficient anecdotal evidences, 
<br/>there is still an increase of river gravel and sand extractions. These include regulated and unregulated 
<br/>extractions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These surges in river extractions have been impelled by the demand for sand and gravel for 
<br/>both, domestic and international markets. International trade of gravel and sand resources are mostly 
<br/>done with our neighbouring island nations, such as Kiribati. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were three major findings by the OAG which was supported by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee. 
<br/>First is Assessment of Potential River Gravel and Sand Extraction Sites.  This refers to the assessment 
<br/>process of potential river gravel and sand extraction sites and then to maintain a database,  which is 
<br/>always needed prior to receiving applications for extractions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted in its review that although there is a 
<br/>centralised information system in place for the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, there is no 
<br/>centralised database that records all potential river gravel and sand extraction sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Audit Report highlighted that all rivers are assumed to have gravel, thus all rivers are 
<br/>potential extraction sites, and this has been highlighted as a governance issue. Therefore, there are 
<br/>currently no processes in place to pre-determine whether gravel from a particular river is viable for 
<br/>potential extraction or not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, decisions for extractions are entirely based on whether to approve or decline 
<br/>an  application  for  licence  to  extract  which  is  received  by  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral 
<br/>Resources through the Department of Lands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>582 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pre-requisites  for  approval  are  based  on  provision  of  inter  alia  approved  Environmental 
<br/>Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  Report,  Rock  Resource  Assessment  and  Volumetric  Assessment.  The 
<br/>Audit  also  noted  that  there  is  no  database  because  there  is  currently  no  data  available  with  the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for all current and potential river gravel extraction sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second  is  Licensing  System  for  Extracting  River  Gravel  and  Sand.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/>Committee  was  informed  that  given  the  huge  demand  for  river  gravel  and  sand,  there  will  be  a 
<br/>likelihood of consequential rise of over-exploitation and illegal extractions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commends the Ministry of Lands’ effort in managing and administering the 
<br/>licensing process in an effective and efficient manner and in compliance with applicable procedural 
<br/>guidance.    However,  the  Committee  noted  from  the  Audit  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  there  is 
<br/>sufficient  evidence  to  confirm  the  significant  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  these 
<br/>extractions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, we have the river gravel and sand extractions, and we are moving more into hard 
<br/>rock quarrying.  The plan and systematic transition from the river gravel and sand extraction to a 
<br/></span><span>network of hard rock quarries would, therefore, be a more environmental undertaking, considering 
<br/></span><span>the impacts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Audit  highlighted,  Sir,  there  is  strong  evidence  to  indicate  the  significant  negative 
<br/>impacts of river extraction at the social and environmental level.  Apart from the implications, there 
<br/>is an increased number of extractions being carried out both, regulated and unregulated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regulated extractions are those companies and individuals operating with valid licence, while 
<br/>unregulated extractions are those companies and individuals that are extracting blatantly without a 
<br/>licence.    Unregulated  extractions  also  include  companies  and  individuals  that  are  extracting  with 
<br/>expired licences.  Unregulated extractions are deemed illegal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Audit  also  highlighted  that  addressing  unregulated  extractions  is  a 
<br/>challenge  and  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  do  not  have  any  policy  in  place  to 
<br/>penalise offenders.  Further, it was noted that while proposals have been discussed to address the 
<br/>unregulated ones, the Ministry has been advised by the Solicitor-General’s Office that they can only 
<br/>penalise offenders under the Penal Code or refer them to the Department of Environment under the 
<br/>Environment Management Act 2005. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, legal engagement is established with the licence holder through 
<br/>approved licence conditions.  Yet, it is a setback for the Ministry when dealing with those extracting 
<br/>without a valid licence because legal engagement does not exist due to absence of a valid licence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry advised that the current practice has compelled them 
<br/>to report matters of illegal extractors to other agencies, who have powers to penalise, such as the 
<br/>Department of Environment, if they breach an environmental condition, or to the Police under the 
<br/>Penal Code. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Audit Report clarified that the limitation of imposing penalties for illegal 
<br/>extractors who do not hold valid licences emerges from restrictions in the legislation surrounding 
<br/>river gravel and sand extraction.  The Ministry of Lands noted that the legislation does not have a 
<br/>prosecution clause which can be used to penalise offenders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  other  hand,  the  Ministry  elaborated  that  if  river  gravel  and  sand  were  regarded  as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mineral under the Mining Act, the Ministry, through the Department of Mineral Resources, would 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>583 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have the legal backing to legalise offenders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UNDP 2018 Baseline Assessment Report of developing minerals in Fiji 
<br/>identified the following activities as composing of Fiji’s demand profile and this includes transport, 
<br/>infrastructure development, concrete manufacturing and export of aggregates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Audit noted that Fiji’s transport infrastructure development and concrete manufacturing 
<br/>constitutes the internal demand pool for development of mineral aggregate such as gravel and sand 
<br/>sourced from rivers as well as aggregates sourced from hard rock.  On the other hand,  exports of 
<br/>aggregates make up the external demand pool for aggregates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third major finding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is on the monitoring of extraction operations.  In 
<br/>terms  of  the  monitoring and  reporting  processes  and  procedures  of  the  Department  of  Lands,  the 
<br/>Committee  was  informed  that  there  was  lack  of  coordination  between  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and 
<br/>Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Waterways and Environment.  Both Ministries could explore 
<br/>ways in which illegal operations could be referred to the Ministry of Waterways and Environment 
<br/>on the possibility of imposing penalties under the Environment Management Act 2005 for damages 
<br/></span><span>and pollution to the national environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Audit found that the Ministry of Lands has not been collecting and verifying self-
<br/>reported information of extraction activities by the licensee, such as tally records from river, gravel 
<br/>and sand extraction companies.  The Ministry has also acknowledged that this is something that needs 
<br/>to be improved as it is part of the licence condition which needs to be complied with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Audit also noted that the Ministry is not undertaking 
<br/>proper  verification  of  self-reported  information  on  the  gravel  extraction  companies  as  necessary 
<br/>evidence were not provided during the audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the submission of monthly returns to the Ministry is left to the discretion of 
<br/>the  operators.    The  Ministry  does  not  follow  up  with  the  operators.    The  Committee  was  further 
<br/>informed that the main reason for not carrying out stringent monitoring of the monthly returns was 
<br/>because  the  Ministry  does  not  have  the  capacity  in  terms  of  staffing  and  other  resources  to  be 
<br/>monitoring full time.  They also do not have access to the operators’ registers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted the Audit findings and require serious consideration 
<br/>by  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Mineral  Resources.    In  this  regard,  the  Committee  recommends  the 
<br/>following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee notes the gender parity in the senior management of the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources and commends the Ministry for fulfilling SDG 5 which is Gender 
<br/>Equality. 
<br/>The Ministry to transform manual record keeping to electronic centralised database system 
<br/>for river streams and resources around Fiji. 
<br/>The current fees levied by the Ministry needs to be reviewed and brought on par to what 
<br/>has been paid by the extractors of river gravel on iTaukei land. 
<br/>The Ministry should consider digital technologies for monitoring purpose, such as drones. 
<br/>The Ministry in conjunction with iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission should conduct 
<br/>regular  trainings  and  workshops  on  Financial  Literacy  and  Resource  Management  for 
<br/>resource owners. 
<br/>The Ministry should carry out awareness programmes with the landowners on the impact 
<br/>of river gravel and sand extractions to the environment targeting SDG 15 - Life on Land.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry should also expedite the finalisation of the two Manuals namely; the River 
<br/>Gravel Extraction Guideline and the National Development Mineral Policy Guideline that 
<br/>are yet to be finalised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  acknowledges  the  progress  made  by  the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources in consultation with relevant stakeholders, to ensure that 
<br/>the Audit and Committee recommendations are fully implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  we  look  forward  to  the  Ministry’s  update  on  the  finalisation  of  the  River  Gravel 
<br/>Extraction Guideline and the National Development Mineral Policy Guideline.  With those words, 
<br/>as the Member moving the motion, I thank you for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>before I offer the floor, I would like to inform this august Parliament that we have 10 honourable 
<br/>Members who want to participate in this motion; that is very interesting.  We started off from six 
<br/>yesterday and then it went up till eight, but now we have 10.  As usual, we will begin the batting by 
<br/>the Members of the Opposition: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.A. Maharaj; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J. Usamate; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport; 
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J.N. Nand; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. V. Lal; and 
<br/>(10)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to keep it short.  The Report basically 
<br/>focussed on three areas, mainly the assessment of potential river gravels and sand extraction sites, 
<br/>licencing systems for extracting river gravels and sand and monitoring of extraction operations.  As 
<br/>everyone is aware, for the development of any nation, these are very important resources that are 
<br/>actually extracted from rivers, and we need to do it in a very sustainable way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the primary objective of the audit was to determine whether the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Lands and Mineral Resources effectively regulates the river gravel and sand extraction through the 
<br/>proper  system  of  contracting  licencing  and  monitoring,  in  order  to  ensure  good  governance  and 
<br/>sustainable development in this particular sector.  River gravels and sand extractions fall under the 
<br/>extractive industry sector in Fiji, in addition to mining, petroleum, hard rocks, quarrying and ground 
<br/>water resources extraction.  The mining and quarrying of development minerals in Fiji are dominated 
<br/>by  crushed  aggregates,  gravel  and  sand  used  for  construction  materials  and  to  a  lesser  extent 
<br/>limestones used for agriculture purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for information on potential river gravels and sand extraction sites can be 
<br/></span><span>further  improved  through  development  of  a  centralised  database  and  this  was  one  of  the  major 
<br/>discussions between the Committee and the Ministry.  Moreover, while the Ministry of Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources in compliance with the licencing system of river gravel and sand extraction, it is 
<br/>fair or moderate the quality of decision in an area of concern due to the gaps in the SOP, which is 
<br/></span><span>compounded by the absence of a structured and a thorough review process.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>585 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now, I will be speaking with regards to the recommendations made by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/></span><span>The Committee notes the gender parity in the Senior Management of the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources and commends the Ministry for fulfilling Sustainable Development 
<br/>Goal (SDG) 5 - Gender Equality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was the first time that the Committee was caught by surprise when the presenters actually 
<br/>presented themselves led by a lady as a Permanent Secretary and the Director being a lady, and the 
<br/>whole team actually were dominated by ladies when they came to do a presentation before the Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee.  I do not think ever in my term as Chairman we had such a strong team coming 
<br/>in, dominated by ladies to present before the Public Accounts Committee.  For that, we commend 
<br/>the Ministry for looking into SDG5, which is basically Gender Equality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/></span><span>The Ministry to transform manual record keeping to electronic centralised database system 
<br/></span><span>for all rivers/streams and resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now living in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century, the manual record system does not work.  This kind of data 
<br/>needs to be shared with the landowners as well, so that landowners are well versed as to who the 
<br/>contractor is and who are the people being given the licence to extract gravel in their area.  It is not 
<br/>just the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, sometimes they are the extractors and some of the 
<br/>landowners as well in lieu of some money, they turn to go sideways and allow people to extract.  It 
<br/>is a very comprehensive sector that we are looking at and having manual record systems does not 
<br/>help.  Having a digital database can be easily used to disseminate information for the information of 
<br/>the general public, especially, the landlords.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/></span><span>The current fees levied by the Ministry of Lands and Resources needs to be reviewed and 
<br/>brought on par to what is being paid by the extractors of river gravel on </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We saw that there was a big difference to what the Ministry of Lands and Minerals Resources 
<br/>charged for extracting gravels on </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land.  That needs to come to par because at the end of the 
<br/>day, the portion that is paid to the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, a portion of that goes 
<br/>to the landlord as well.  So, for those landlords whose lands have gone to the Ministry of Lands as 
<br/>State land, they are not getting as much as what the landowners are getting on an </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land.  So 
<br/>that needs to be brought to par as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/></span><span>The  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  should  consider  digital  technologies  for 
<br/>monitoring purposes such as drones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we know that extraction does not take place where accessibility is not a problem.  Most 
<br/>of the extractions taking place are in the interior of Naitasiri or Nadroga/Navosa and it is very difficult 
<br/>for the monitoring team to reach those places.  One thing that we have seen, the illegal operators get 
<br/>to get this information that the regulators will be there to do the inspection.  So, before they are at 
<br/>that particular point where the illegal extraction is taking place, the excavator is out from the river 
<br/>and standing on the side of the riverbank.  Then the powers to do anything with the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources does not work because at that point in time there was no operation or illegal 
<br/>extraction taking place.  With the help of drones, they can pinpoint where these illegal operators are 
<br/>operating and be taken to task.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 5</span><span>
<br/>The  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  in  conjunction  with  the  iTaukei  Land  and 
<br/>Fisheries Commission should conduct regular trainings and workshops on financial literacy 
<br/>and resource management for resource owners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  another  area  of  concern  whereby  we  see  some  extractors  going  directly  to  the 
<br/>landowners offering them a sum of money, and then doing illegal extraction.  If we are able to actually 
<br/>carry out this financial literacy training with the landowners, they will only realise that the amount 
<br/>of money they have obtained for a particular illegal extraction, the right value is much more to what 
<br/>they have received.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an example, they are given cash of $20,000 and they take 1,000 cubic metres of gravel but 
<br/>1,000 cubic metres of gravel, rightfully the landowners should have received $200,000, just as an 
<br/>example.  So, they are not getting the right value of the resources that is extracted from their rivers.  
<br/>This  might  not  relate  to  the  Report  directly,  but  exactly  this  is  what  is  happening  in  terms  of 
<br/>deforestation in Bua as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to capture the illegal operators who do logging by directly going to the landowners.  
<br/></span><span>There is a process in place, and we need to ensure that monitoring is in place so that the landowners 
<br/>get a fair share of what they are entitled to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 6 
<br/></span><span>The</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources should carry out awareness programmes with 
<br/>the landowners on the impact of river gravel and sand extractions to the environment targeting 
<br/>SDG15 - Life on Land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most times we have seen extraction taking place in the interior lands but if we go downstream, 
<br/>there are a lot of villages that are affected by the extraction that is taking much further inland.  So, 
<br/>what happens is the silt that flows down the stream affects the livelihood of all those villages and 
<br/>settlements that rely on the river for their livelihood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 7</span><span>
<br/>The  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  should  expedite  the  finalisation  of  the  two 
<br/>Manuals,  namely  the  River  Gravel  Extraction  Guideline  and  the  National  Development 
<br/>Mineral Policy Guideline that are yet to be finalised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, while phasing out river gravel and sand extraction is blurred 
<br/>though desired, improvement in this area of geological exploration or similar surveys, licencing and 
<br/>monitoring  needs  to  be  actioned  by  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  with  more 
<br/>consultation  and  collaboration  between  the  Ministry  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  in  order  to 
<br/>ensure that safeguarding of the environment and the society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight some of the measures taken by the  Ministry, and we 
<br/>appreciate that the Ministry in actually working towards it. The Ministry was finalising a proper plan 
<br/>of actual work required including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Resources and capacity prior to seeking funding to start with the collection of relevant data 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to develop a digital database. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  Ministry  was  working  on  a  Cabinet  Paper  for  the  formulation  of  a  National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development Mineral Policy.

<br/>General  for  vetting.  That  will  address  the  issues  of  sustainable  extraction  practice  and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister may in response can elaborate on what is happening 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with these three recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with those words, I support the Report and the recommendations by the Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee. I believe this is a very thorough review and in-depth recommendation and I 
<br/>hope the Ministry will implement these recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Just  to  help  with  the  explanation  given  already  by  honourable  Maharaj 
<br/>when he mentioned landowners and then he mentioned resource owners and there is the Native Lands 
<br/>Fisheries Commission,  some </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> are affected and this was part of a very elaborate Report that 
<br/>was tabled in Parliament by the Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka in the last term, that is along the 
<br/>Sigatoka River Bank. So, I am just throwing that in just to be able to help you, honourable Members 
<br/>because these are all affected.  They are part of the resource and the landowners as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Before I start, I join the rest of the Members of Parliament this 
<br/>morning who spoke and wished all Fijians a happy </span><span>Ram N</span><span>a</span><span>vami</span><span> today and to sons and daughters of 
<br/>Fiji who are also away overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I perhaps give credit to where credit is due to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who had produced a very comprehensive Report for us to come and discuss in the Parliament today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the extraction of sand and gravel from rivers is mandated under the Rivers and 
<br/>Streams Act of 1880. I think the nearest date to that would have been the Cession of Fiji to Great 
<br/>Britain in 1874 so this would have been one of the earliest laws that were imported from Great Britain 
<br/>at that time.  And the State Lands Act of 1945 which then defines or contain provisions of foreshore, 
<br/>rivers, streams as well as soils under waters of Fiji.  So, the powers of the Director Lands to approve 
<br/>the issuance of licence for removal of lime gravel, sand and commons stones are provided for under 
<br/>Regulation 29 of the State Lands Leases and Licences Regulation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for the financial year of 2022-2023, there are 34 active licences and 30 expired 
<br/>licences. So, all in all throughout the period, there would have been a total of 64 licences issued for 
<br/>extraction of river gravel and river sands. I have a very detailed information of that, and I can supply 
<br/>to Parliament if it is so needed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Performance Audit was in response to the rise in number of gravel and sand extraction 
<br/>and the environmental and societal impacts and effects of these extractions.  These extractions may 
<br/>have been licenced and as we all know, there are cases where extractions had been illegally carried 
<br/>out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Performance Audit was also to ensure that the Ministry was effectively regulating and 
<br/>monitoring river gravel and sand extractions through proper systems and processes and to ensure that 
<br/>there is a sustainable management of this very important resource. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry notes the repercussions that such Report may  have on ordinary 
<br/>citizens  and  the  understanding,  roles  and  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral 
<br/>Resources.  It is only fair to say bottom line, such audit strives to achieve and ensure excellence in 
<br/>our service delivery to the public in terms of provisions of construction materials, and also with the 
<br/>view of boosting the nation’s economy.

<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this note, the Ministry expresses its gratitude to the Committee for the brilliant content of 
<br/>the Report showcasing  accuracy and high  quality  reporting on one of its service deliverables and 
<br/>without  bias,  proposing  innovative  ways.  The  Ministry  of  Lands  based  on  researched  data  and 
<br/>information and therefore we are in support of the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts  made  seven  general 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations in this Report which I will present in Parliament this afternoon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  recommendations  were  well  received  by  the  Ministry,  and  we  are  working  towards 
<br/>achieving our mission which is to effectively administer and regulate the land and mineral sector 
<br/>through sustainable and transformative legislation and guidelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, I seek the indulgence of all Members of Parliament to report briefly on each of the 
<br/>seven findings, and this is where I would want, two of them are here but I will mention the other two 
<br/>as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/></span><span>The Committee notes the gender parity in the Senior Management of the Ministry of Lands 
<br/></span><span>and Mineral Resources and commends the Ministry for fulfilling Sustainable Development 
<br/>Goal (SDG) 5 - Gender Equality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that instance, Mr. Speaker, I wish to acknowledge the previous Ministers for Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources – Mr. Ashneel Sudhakar, Ms. Mereseini R. Vuniwaqa (my cousin), honourable 
<br/>Koya and honourable Usamate my previous predecessors. Thank you very much for working hard to 
<br/>ensure that there is gender balance in the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Maharaj  spoke  about  how  they  were  all  shocked  when  the  Ministry 
<br/>representatives came to present before the Standing Committee.  His shock is nowhere near mine 
<br/>when I first went to the Ministry after being elected as the Minister and having to attend my first 
<br/>briefing, and there was I think only about three males and the rest of the conference room was filled 
<br/>by women. I thank the two honourable gentlemen who are here as well as two previous Ministers in 
<br/>the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry supports gender equality and the Ministry now within the senior management 
<br/>level  have  nine  women  and  this  could  be  witnessed  throughout  the  organisation.  The  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary is a woman, Director Lands is a woman, Director Geospatial is a woman, the Chief Valuer 
<br/>of the country is also as well as many other who occupy top management level within the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2  
<br/></span><span>The Ministry to transform manual record keeping to electronic centralized database system 
<br/>for all rivers/streams and resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, there is an existing database currently now being maintained by the Ministry of Lands, in 
<br/>particular,  the  Mineral  Resources  Department  which  collates  all  requests  for  resource  survey  by 
<br/>communities who have an interest in this activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will be making a Cabinet submission for the formulation of a National Mineral 
<br/>Development Policy and strategies to implement the audit recommendations are being planned upon 
<br/>the approval of the NDM policy. This will assist the Ministry in pursuing the baseline surveys of 
<br/>rivers  and  streams  albeit  this  will  require  quite  a  bit  of  funding,  I  am  looking  at  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance for specialised equipment and also for technical expertise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>

<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>589 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the identification of potential sites due to change in river/stream morphology 
<br/>and replenishment rates of the resource must also be considered as that obviously changes.  What 
<br/>can  be  potential  site  today?    Overtime  change  due  to  natural  processes  and  other  factors  such  as 
<br/>climate change and human activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, funding requests which were made by the Ministry submitted last year 
<br/>for a river gravel sand volumetric assessment to collate baseline data for major rivers and streams in 
<br/>Fiji.  This is important for river systems that are being extracted. Unfortunately, from my briefing, 
<br/>this was not approved by the previous Government and I am not too sure why, with the advice that 
<br/>this was to be undertaken by the FRA and it is not even come where near their core function. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/></span><span>The current fees levied by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources needs to be reviewed 
<br/>and brought to par to what is being paid by the extractors of river gravel on </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will be resubmitting, it has already been submitted but we are 
<br/>going to be resubmitting to Cabinet a proposal to increase gravel and sand royalties and recompense 
<br/></span><span>for the loss of </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> rights.  Submission, if for the review for fees to be on par with the current 
<br/></span><span>charges that are levied by iTLTB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB charges $6.61 per cubic metre for dry land gravel and sand.  
<br/>The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources levies $2.50 for State land and for rivers and gravel.  
<br/>I am told $2.50 that we charge is really for the “A” type of gravel and sands from rivers and streams, 
<br/>$2 is kept by the State $0.50 is given to the landowners.  So, $2.50 charged by the Ministry of Lands, 
<br/>$6.61 charged by iTLTB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Lands’  decision  which  is  far  back  as  1997,  so  there  has  not  been  any 
<br/>amendment to that figure from 1997 up until today and that is something that we are going to be 
<br/>bringing to Cabinet for reviewing very shortly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/></span><span>The  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  should  consider  digital  technologies  for 
<br/>monitoring purposes such as Drones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  Fiji  Police  Force  so  that  there  is  some 
<br/>coordination in  attempting  to  see that illegal  activities or illegal  extractions are minimized, if not 
<br/>abolished  altogether.    Unfortunately,  with  every  memorandum  that  the  Ministry  sign  with  other 
<br/>departments or other ministries is subject, of course, to availability of resource and availability of 
<br/>funds.  There are already plans, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to head in the direction where we would be seeking 
<br/>for budget approvals for provision of funding so that we could purchase more drones for purposes of 
<br/>ensuring that no illegal extraction of river gravels and sands taking place in the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 5 
<br/></span><span>The  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  in  conjunction  with  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  Lands  and 
<br/>Fisheries Commission (ITLFC) should conduct regular trainings and workshops on financial 
<br/>literacy and resource management for resource owners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry closely works in conjunction with the iTLFC for community 
<br/>consultation with those who own fishing rights along streams and rivers which are usually arranged 
<br/>by the license applicants or those who wish to come and apply for a license to extract.  However, the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Lands,  welcomes  this  recommendation  for  a  coordinated  approach  with  the  iTaukei 
<br/>Lands and Fisheries Commission and other relevant agencies with a sole objective of sustainably

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>managing this natural resource and also not to ignore the benefit that would accrue to those who own 
<br/>fishing rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 6 
<br/></span><span>The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources should carry out awareness programmes with 
<br/>landowners on the impact of river gravel and sand extractions to the environment targeting 
<br/>SDG15 – Life on Land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  the  Ministry  in  this  regard  welcomes  this  recommendation  for  a 
<br/>coordinated  approach  with  ITLFC  and  other  responsible  ministries  to  be  able  to  meet 
<br/>Recommendation 6.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last recommendation Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources should expedite the finalization of the two 
<br/>Manuals  namely,  the  River  Gravel  Extraction  Guideline  and  the  National  Development 
<br/>Mineral Policy (NDMP) Guideline that are yet to be finalised.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  River  Gravel  Extraction  and  Management  Guideline  has  been 
<br/>formulated. The Guideline is to ensure sustainable extraction practices and processes are in place 
<br/>before  issuing  river  gravel  and  sand  extraction  licenses.    The  guideline  is  awaiting  the  final 
<br/>endorsement of the Office of the Solicitor-General. For the National Development Mineral Policy in 
<br/>collaboration with UNDP and the Pacific Community, we will be together formulating the NDMP as 
<br/>mentioned  in  the  beginning.    So,  a  draft  Cabinet  Paper  is  currently  undergoing  consultation  for 
<br/>comments from stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude once again, I thank the previous Standing Committee on Public 
<br/>Accounts that sat  and deliberated and provided us this thorough paper today and I commend this 
<br/>Report to the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  hope  that  you  will  take  on  board  water  as  a  mineral  as  well  in  your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Policy Guideline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- We are, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to talk to this motion.  
<br/>I will start off by thanking the Members of the Committee that produced a very comprehensive Report 
<br/>and I endorse the comments made by the honourable Minister in that respect.  I think I also welcome 
<br/>the Report that was the basis for the discussions which was the work that was done by the Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General.  It was basically a third-party audit of what is happening in the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes as Minister, we do not get to get into the details of what goes on, so it always 
<br/>good to get a third party to come in and look at your processes and procedures to see whether they 
<br/>are actually being done and if some of them are not up to par.  I think for us as legislatures, these 
<br/>kinds of reports are very good.  It gives us an insight and opportunity to see what is working well, 
<br/>what is not working well and how that needs to be improved so that we can deliver better services to 
<br/>the people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  sector  that  we  are  talking  about  here  are  the  aggregates.    Gravel  and  sand  are  very 
<br/>valuable sector in this country.  When you talk about construction, talk about development or talk 
<br/>about progress in the country, it will always require aggregates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>591 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I remember correctly, when that report that came out from UNDP on aggregates said that 
<br/>the value of what we get from the aggregates far surpasses was much higher than what we normally 
<br/>get from what we see as valuable things like gold, silver, et cetera, their impact is far wider, so it is 
<br/>a very, very critical sector for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on terms of the recommendations, I would like also to 
<br/>express  on  the  first  recommendation  about  the  makeup  of  the  Senior  Management  Team  in  the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands, I would like to repeat the comments that made here by the honourable Maharaj 
<br/>and the Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Ministry  of  Lands,  we  have  very  strong  leadership  by  women  from  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary - Dr. Taga, a lot of the directors - Director Corporate Services, Director Lands, Director 
<br/>Geospatial Information and Management Systems, the old Director for Land Use - </span><span>Radini Talatala</span><span>
<br/>Taraivini Ratumudu, some of the Divisional Land Managers - Mereadani in the North; very strong 
<br/>participation of women at the top echelons of this Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the point is, the Ministry did not set out to do that.  What the Ministry did, it just hired 
<br/></span><span>the best people for the job.  So, it seems that some of the things that we are doing here in Fiji is 
<br/></span><span>leading us to have more women being trained and are made available to take up the right positions 
<br/>in these Ministries.  I think that is a reflection also of what we have been trying to do to make more 
<br/>opportunities available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been changing the laws.  I think a few years ago, we change the laws in Vatukoula 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to allow women to do all the different kinds of occupations that were not allowed in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now seeing that more of our graduates coming out of universities are female.  At the 
<br/>moment, men are still dominant in this Parliament.  I think there might be a time in the future where 
<br/>we might be the minority species or whatever.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  I  would  also  like  to  congratulate  also  the  management  team.    It  is  not  only  a  strong 
<br/>management team with majority of maybe 70 percent or 80 percent women, but very effective and 
<br/>very efficient in the way they have carried out their work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of the recommendations that have been here have been spoken to and everything that I 
<br/>would say would be repeating the sentiments that was given by the honourable Minister. I would like 
<br/>to thank the honourable Minister for the contribution that he has made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some things that I will talk about very briefly. One, as we listen to this, we will hear 
<br/>that every minister is saying, I need this for my Ministry.  That is true for this Ministry, the Ministry 
<br/>of Lands, and it is true for every single other Ministry.  A lot of the issues that have been talked about 
<br/>and the solutions to these problems had been developed but they could not be funded because there 
<br/>is always the issue of competing priorities, and that is what you will see throughout. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Level 4 talks about digital technologies, getting drones and some of that work was undertaken 
<br/>in getting drones and doing that sort of work by honourable Koya when he was in place.  But there 
<br/>is always an attempt to try to get equipment to try to get the finances to allow us to deal and make 
<br/>improvements to things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the big challenges that we find is illegal extraction.  A lot of illegal extraction takes 
<br/>place because a company, not the landowners but those that have the rights to the </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> because 
<br/>here, we are not talking about landowners.  The rights to the streams is governments.  The rights of 
<br/>the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>owners to use the </span><span>qoliqoli, </span><span>these are the people that they get sometimes and they work in

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cahoots and that leads to the illegal extraction.  That is something that we really need to find a solution 
<br/>to.  How do we cut that down?  That must be something that we must start with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the ways to do it is to work together with the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>owners.  Help them to have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>companies that will extract, and that is something we have been doing.  How do we do that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For instance, one of the things that the former Government has been doing for landowners if 
<br/>you have land, we help them to be able to develop that land so that they can get the benefits from the 
<br/>land - subdivisions, et cetera, like you have in Yadua.  That Grace Road that is there, all that land 
<br/>that was developed was paid for by Government so that the landowners do get the benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the ways that we can work together with the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>owners here is to help them to 
<br/>do these extraction.  The illegal extraction is because some of those </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>owners are working in 
<br/>cahoots with others, so that is something we need to get down.  That is something that we really need 
<br/>to address over time, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that the Ministry of Lands has been very good at trying to upgrade is its 
<br/></span><span>Performance Management System (PMS).  That is very good, and I think the findings of these audits, 
<br/></span><span>seeing the weaknesses in how processes have been operated and identifying the gaps is going to help 
<br/>them strengthen to be able to deliver much better for the people of this country in terms of managing 
<br/>this very important resource that we have - sand and gravels from our streams. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I wish the Ministry and the honourable Minister well in what he is going to do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the team there, and thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the Report that is before 
<br/>us.  I would like to commend the Chairman and the members of the Public Accounts Committee that 
<br/>prepared the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My comments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are going to be very brief this afternoon.  First of all, I would 
<br/>just like to give us a small description of what used to be in the Dawasamu River before and after.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past, about 2004 and 2005, if you used to go to the Dawasamu area, you would be able 
<br/>to see the bottom of the Dawasamu River.  Nowadays when you go, it is opaque, you cannot see the 
<br/>bottom of the River.  This shows that something is not right upstream and that is always the case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  we  go  up  to  Vorovoro  and  Delakado  in  Dawasamu,  we  will  see  companies  that  are 
<br/>extracting rocks from the River.  I think there has been some contracts that had been signed  in the 
<br/>past.  As we know rocks in the water are mini-ecosystems for thousands if not millions of organisms 
<br/>of freshwater lives around that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is vital for progress, but the question we must always ask is, 
<br/>at what cost?  We must not allow political expediency to take precedence over proper consultative 
<br/>procedures.    When  development  considerations  take  precedence  over  the  environment,  then  we 
<br/>should be ready for the repercussions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry that I head has seen all of these and I am sure when the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition used to be acting in that position also knows this as well.  It has had a very devastating 
<br/>effects on the fisheries downstream the Dawasamu River.  Livelihoods are being affected and so as 
<br/>the local rural economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Nakavu, Namosi, I have heard reports of places in the rivers where they used to go for

<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>593 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>picnics.  They no longer can because a company has been given licence to go and dig for gravel there.  
<br/>That is something that we would probably like to ask if can be considered as part of the Report, if 
<br/>some form of rehabilitation process could be considered to be part of the Report as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen in some areas in the Wainibuka area, I have had villagers come up to me and 
<br/>complain about how they are not able to use their own gravel as they used to do in the past.  They 
<br/>say that the Surfing Decree has been used against them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  was  their  traditional  fishing  ground.    The  fact  that  they  are  not  allowed  to  use  them 
<br/>implies  that  the  State  knows  better  than  the  traditional  custodians  of  how  to  take  care  of  their 
<br/>traditional fishing grounds.  And that is something that we have been doing without any trouble for 
<br/>thousands of years so give us some credit for what we are able to do with our own </span><span>qoliqoli.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  thing  that  our  colleagues  from  the  other  side  like  to  do  sometimes  is  they  are  very 
<br/>technological savvy and doing it well.  They seem to enjoy glorifying some things that look fleshy 
<br/>and  new,  whilst  hiding  some  of  the  things  that  are  not  too  presentable  and  come  up  with  broad 
<br/>generalisations that make them look good whilst bad mouthing everyone else.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What they do not seem to realise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the important things in life, if they 
<br/>are to remain embedded and immovable in our societal structures, they begin with ideas, concept of 
<br/>truth or fairness, of goodness are all ideas and intangible, and yet we know exactly what good and 
<br/>bad is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you  try  to  implement  or  develop  models  without  these  philosophical 
<br/>concepts grounded in the values we all hold highly, then we should expect those developments to fail 
<br/>miserably.  We think, then we do, we do not do, then we think.  Unfortunately, that is how some of 
<br/>the  developments  have  happened  in  the  past  and  that  is  why  we  are  suffering  from  some  of  its 
<br/>consequences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  the  gist  of  the  motion  that  is  before 
<br/>Parliament begs the question; how do we stop illegal extraction?  That is what this audit is trying to 
<br/>answer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  see  the  Audit  findings  and  the  questions  and  queries  that  the  Auditor-General  had 
<br/>posted to the Ministry of Lands, I talked about how we can ensure compliance and enforcement.  I 
<br/>think this is one of the key areas and the former Chairman had stated that there were three things that 
<br/>were identified by the auditors, and the first is the policy and the last time it was in the Committee it 
<br/>was a Cabinet paper. Perhaps, the honourable Minister will take it up on how they will collect data 
<br/>or the information that is needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second is the guideline that is still with the Office of the Solicitor-General.  The third and 
<br/>one that is in operation now is the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  The SOP determines how 
<br/>an application is approved and some of the basic requirements is the waiver of fishing rights, access 
<br/>agreement,  identification  of  the  stockpile  area,  approved  EIA  and  payment  of  the  environmental 
<br/>bond.  This is the area where landowners come in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  the  EIA,  discussions  and  consultations  need  to  be  open  and  the  landowners  need  to 
<br/>know the amount of compensation that needs to be paid to them as part of the environmental bond.  
<br/>That is the start. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When it goes to operation, the other thing that we really need to look at is that, if we are really 
<br/>going to counter illegal extraction, I urge Government to look up the new legislation that was passed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>594 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the Ministry of Forestry, sections 34 and 35, that looks into the powers of inspection and powers 
<br/>of arrest.   That legislation not only empowers Forestry Officers but also the Police the powers to 
<br/>inspect, arrest and to receive complaints on illegal logging.  If that could be taken on board to give 
<br/>teeth to the current operation that is there at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Lands at the moment do not have any enforcement arm.  What they have now 
<br/>is only a system on how to detect through drones the illegal sites and illegal extractions, but after you 
<br/>catch them, what do you do?  What remedy is there?  That is something that probably can be taken 
<br/>on board that will act as a deterrent to stop those who are into illegal extraction and illegal operations.  
<br/>That is one thing that I suggest that they take on board and I urge the relevant line Minister if a Bill 
<br/>can come through the Attorney-General because that will be the solution of these illegal extractions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  thing  on  awareness  is  that  we  are  happy  that  the  honourable  Minister  has  now 
<br/>announced that there is a legislation that will be taken forward as a Cabinet paper to increase the rate 
<br/>from $2.50.  From their consultation, they are trying to bring it into par with the rate that iTLTB is 
<br/>paying at $6.61 per cubic.  But, again, the consultation will involve the extractors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have this argument of financial difficulties, but through those consultations and all the 
<br/></span><span>payments  they have, plus still recovering from  COVID-19, these are some of the things that will 
<br/>come up in the consultation, and if they will be able to agree to a particular rate.  It moves from $2.50 
<br/>to the new rate that should come out after the consultation.  After that, how much from the agreed 
<br/>new  rate  after  consultation  will  be  for  the  landowners?    How  much  will  go  to  the State?    At  the 
<br/>moment $2 goes to the State and 50 cents to the fishing right owners because of the access.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that we need to look at is the stockpile area.  Once we have these companies 
<br/>when they are extracting from the river, they need a land beside the riverbank to be their stockpile 
<br/>and that is the Native land - the agreement with the landowners.  That is the area where there needs 
<br/>to be some awareness and financial literacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From that point on, the amount the landowners get from the royalties, how do they use that 
<br/>to economically empower them?  We need to see that that activity is reflected in their livelihood, 
<br/>businesses and how they move into investing through Unit Trust, plus other things that they would 
<br/>like to build as a community, to improve their livelihood and proper housing.  These are other things 
<br/>that should be felt or should be a reflection when converting all these resources into money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I always advise our landowners back in Macuata, </span><span>na gauna ga sa tavuki kina na qereqere me 
<br/>sa vatu, tou ’ua ni qai muri na vatu, ‘tou muri na i lavo, vanua sa muria na i lavo baleta saraga ya 
<br/>sa oti va’adua o vatu, na i lavo ga sa i sosomi ni vatu. </span><span> That is how we should set our mindset as 
<br/>landowners because that particular gravel or that particular rock will not come back, that is gone.  
<br/>How do we convert that into investment that will be beneficial not only for us, but for the future 
<br/>generation who will be filling up </span><span>Vola ni Kawa Bula</span><span>?  Our numbers are increasing but the amount 
<br/>of resources that are registered in Native land register is the same.  That is something that we have 
<br/>to look at, moving into the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, if you look at the other side, the contractor’s side, this is an area I will be 
<br/>looking forward to the response by the honourable Minister for Infrastructure after this who will be 
<br/>speaking  on  the  motion.    The  connection  from  the  contractors  or  the  extractors  to  the  particular 
<br/>industry that, that contractor or extractor is supplying too.  It could be a construction industry or a 
<br/>company that is contracted under FRA that does tarsealing on the road, that will depend, and it is a 
<br/>chain.

<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>595 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  amount  that  FRA  gives  to  that  particular  tender,  goes  down  to  the  extractor  and  that 
<br/>amount will determine how much they are able to pay the Ministry of Lands and how much will go 
<br/>to the royalties.   We have heard the idea of bringing back the PWD, but if the PWD comes back, 
<br/>you have to ensure that there are still quarries that will be there that PWD will need to buy those 
<br/>gravel or metal aggregates that will have to pay the same rates.  So, the more jobs that is available 
<br/>from FRA to the contractors, more money will trickle down as royalties to the landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment there are many contractors around through the FRA and subcontractors who 
<br/>are without jobs.  Their machines are down, they have difficulties in payment because of the current 
<br/>policy of transition, but I hope that there will be a solution that be looked upon, given if the FRA 
<br/>stops paying that to contractors and other tenders that will come.  That will all trickle down to the 
<br/>landowners because that goes down the royalties and the amount that the landowners will actually 
<br/>benefit in this whole operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that we will look into how we develop landowners and also how to empower us, using 
<br/>this industry, the monitoring and enforcement, protecting our environment and everything that we 
<br/>know that will be beneficial to us and everyone will benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  on  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance Audit Report on Licensing and Monitoring of River Gravel and Sand Extractions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  it  is  a  very  critical  and  useful  Report,  and  it  has  been  an  ongoing  issue  with  our 
<br/>communities, especially those living beside the rivers and we have seen a lot of media coverage on 
<br/>this.  We have spoken about various issues in the recommendations, but reading through the actual 
<br/>Report, if we go to Page No. 29, there is a very interesting recommendation there. I will just read it 
<br/>out:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  strongly  consider 
<br/>the 
<br/>recommendation  presented  in  the  UNDP  2018  Baseline  Assessment  Report  on  Fiji’s 
<br/>Development Minerals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  recommended  that  the  Ministry  should  undertake  a  Programme  of 
<br/>Works  to  support  the  development  of  a  network  or  hard  rock  quarries  in  strategic 
<br/>locations, considering the holistic demand for development of minerals in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Programme should consider as proposed in the Baseline Assessment Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government incentives and improving access to finance.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Government  of  Fiji  should  develop  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  the 
<br/>phasing  out  of  river  gravel  extraction,  with  the  exception  of  certain  areas  where  it  is 
<br/>beneficial to Fijian communities supported by thorough scientific studies.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think that is a very important guideline for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, if you go to Page 15 of the actual Report, that justifies the environmental 
<br/>impacts of river gravel and sand extraction and that has been alluded to by our Minister for Rural 
<br/>Development. There are various reports there which they have based it on. For example, Nature Fiji 
<br/>Maraqeti  Viti  -  the  report  to  the  National  Environmental  of  Council  Meeting  on  continuing 
<br/>destruction of Fiji’s rivers and streams in the Fiji State of Environment Report 2013.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Baseline Assessment under the ACPU Development Minerals Programme, et cetera, one note 
<br/>there, “exceeding the substantial level of extraction can lead to major impacts, removing boulders 
<br/>and rocks dramatically changes the hydraulics characteristics of a river.” That is critical, Sir, not only 
<br/>for this but also in terms of our water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just going around the country in the last few weeks that is something I have noticed - soil 
<br/>erosion  from  the  extraction  and  also  from  deforestation  in  most  of  major  streams  which  is  also 
<br/>impacting on our water levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also point us to that issue – incentivising river gravel and sand extractions.  When you look 
<br/>at that recommendation for rock quarries, there is table there on Page No. 26 - comparing the start-
<br/>up cost, hard rock quarry and they have listed there the machines needed - crusher, et cetera, it comes 
<br/>to $3.7 million.  But for river extraction, it comes to $2.5 million. So, there is a gap in that which is 
<br/>cheaper to operate river gravel extraction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the third point I wanted to mention was from the perspective of the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>landowner or 
<br/>resource owner, as you have mentioned. When this was discussed, one of them raised this and let me 
<br/></span><span>read it out.  This is in August 2022.  It says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Finally, this Government has come to its sense at the eve of the Election by reverting 
<br/>to pre-2015 conditions with regards to the issuance of river gravel extraction licences to 
<br/>iTLTB. It has been exhausting in trying to renew the licence every year and it takes months 
<br/>before expiry to prepare renewal application in order to fulfil all mandatory requirements 
<br/>as required by the Ministry of Lands, the issuing authority - almost begging and pleading 
<br/>at every door offices for approval and endorsements of every vetting agencies which, of 
<br/>course, not to mention the fees and expenses that is incurred with this exercise. It runs into 
<br/>a couple of thousand dollars.  With the recent performance bond of over $6,000, it becomes 
<br/>discouraging.  However, positive outcome is the extension period of up to five years and 
<br/>the reversion of the licencing authority to iTLTB.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, that is the feedback from one of the landowners in terms of their participation in this extraction 
<br/>business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have personally seen the effects of this. There is sand extraction along the Rewa River near 
<br/>where  my  home  is,  Wainibokasi  and  Muana  Village,  and  we  have  personally  seen  the  riverbank 
<br/>erosion in the last 10 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Muana Village, they have lost about 10 to 15 metres because of the operations of sand 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>extraction which has been there for a number of years regarding that operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue  in  these  areas  is  the  dumping  of  old  equipment  by  the  gravel  and  sand 
<br/>extractors. They have not  been removed and they are left there  rusty. There has been out  quite a 
<br/>number of locations. As I mentioned I have seen it personally, Muana Village in Rewa, Wainibokasi 
<br/>and several other areas.  I have raised this with the former Minister of Environment, Dr. Mahendra 
<br/>Reddy,  and  that  is  an  issue  which  also  needs  to  be  monitored  and  acted  upon  as  we  go  forward.  
<br/>Thank you, Sir, and I commend the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate. Before I begin, I would 
<br/>like  to  thank  the  previous  Members  of  the  Public  Accounts  Committee:    the  former  Chairman, 
<br/>honourable  Maharaj,  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro,  honourable  Ro  Teimumu  Kepa,  honourable 
<br/>Virendra Lal and I was the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee.

<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>597 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Sir, I would like to acknowledge your contributions in the Public Accounts Committee.  
<br/>For  quite  a  bit  of  time  you  were  in  the  Committee,  and  it  was  an  honour  to  work  with  you,  and 
<br/>together we all learned a lot during our deliberations and our time in the Public Accounts Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the Secretariat team, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>led by Savenaca Koro, Mateo and Susana.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  moving  on,  after  receiving  the  Report  from  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-
<br/>General, the Committee went through the Report and formulated some questions that were sent to 
<br/>the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for their responses. We went through the responses and 
<br/>decided that the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources appear before the Committee for a public 
<br/>consultation.  It was a very good consultation, and we had the opportunity to learn a lot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will dwell on some of the key findings of the Report, one of 
<br/>them is assessment of potential river gravel and sand extraction sites.  It was noted that although there 
<br/>is a centralised information system in place, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources does not 
<br/>have a centralised database for potential river gravel and sand extraction sites.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is encouraging to note that the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 
<br/>are  having  discussions  with  various  stakeholders  on  conducting  our  baseline  survey  for  the  river 
<br/>systems in Fiji and very soon they will come up with a satisfied database. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  major  finding  of  the  Report  was  the  monitoring  of  extraction 
<br/>operation.  It was noted that while actions are being taken against illegal extraction of river gravel 
<br/>and sand, there is a need for relevant stakeholders to coordinate in order to impose harsher penalties 
<br/>on offenders and send clear signals on the consequences of not abiding by laws, terms and conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources is working with the 
<br/>Ministry of Waterways to work out a standardized formula on the amount that has to be paid to the 
<br/>Ministry of Waterways and Environment for any environmental damaged caused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  the  current  Committee  members  all  the  best  in  their  future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliberations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Virendra Lal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  very  brief  because  I  think  everyone  has 
<br/>covered most of the areas that needed to be provided with a detailed explanation.  But just in short, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Committee on a very comprehensive report and as we can all see, 
<br/>it is a place that requires a lot of attention so we can get it right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most important tools in getting all that is being asked off in the 
<br/></span><span>Report would be the digitization of this particular area and not just that, probably the whole Ministry.  
<br/>It is actually a big exercise that had been undertaken a while ago and still incomplete but once we 
<br/>get that done, it would help substantially in trying to unravel the issues that have arisen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just quickly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the area is fraught with difficulty with respect to unregulated 
<br/>extractions out of the rivers purely because as raised by honourable Usamate, you will find that a lot

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of these happens in cohorts with people because these are big pieces of machinery that are extracting 
<br/>gravel, it is not done without someone else being attached to it. Sometimes it is done at night, and it 
<br/>is actually quite glaringly obvious that it is an illegal extraction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The laws that are currently in place, (again I agree with what is being said) do not assist the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands in trying to prosecute these people.  But if you look at it, it is really out and out 
<br/>theft from the State and there needs to be a serious look at how we can prosecute these people and 
<br/>also  maybe  how  we  can  actually  ensure  that  every  load  that  comes  out  of  any  river  extraction  is 
<br/>actually certified.  I say that because the importance of that load that actually goes is to do with our 
<br/>own infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of the loads of gravel that have gone out of all the rivers out of Fiji is to do with our 
<br/>own infrastructure. Some of you may know, some of you may not know, even the gravel that goes 
<br/>out, not all is permitted to be used on our roads, for example.  It has to have a particular moisture 
<br/>content, et cetera.  All of that that needs to be done through a geotech specialist and through our own 
<br/>Mineral Resources Department.  There are many parts to the equation that need to be looked at in 
<br/>terms of how we actually are going to stop the illegal extraction of this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as much as I hate saying this, it is actually brazenly done because those that 
<br/>do it know that even if they fall foul of it, nothing will happen to them.  Even our police, there is a 
<br/>shortfall in how we deal with this. So, the different grades that exist within the river, this is what I 
<br/>mean, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there needs to be a proper record.  The MRD is a very sufficient, a very   
<br/>competent office and a very competent department that can do a whole lot of work that will assist the 
<br/>State in ensuring that we know where we can extract gravel from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From an environmental perspective also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think still exists, there is a serious 
<br/>lack of coordination between the Ministry of Environment and also the Mineral Resources Division 
<br/>and the Ministry of Lands.  I think they were just being territorial, but it does not assist in terms of 
<br/>when the applications are before the Ministry of Lands and even during monitoring periods. Now, 
<br/>with respect to that, I think more coordination is needed to ensure that we are all on the same page. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  in  short,  I  think  pretty  much  covers  what  I  wanted  to  say  because 
<br/>everyone else has actually covered it, but it is certainly a commendable Report and I think this is 
<br/>something is important for all of us to look at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a lot of encouragement from this side of Parliament when 
<br/>we were in office to ensure that the Fiji Roads Authority also was quite involved in all of these.  I 
<br/>think  quarries  was  one  aspect  that  was  being  looked  at  so  that  the  actual  license  be  given  to  the 
<br/>quarries, the quarries for the quarries be given to FRA and they could start sub-lease it so we would 
<br/>be moving away from trying to get the gravel out of the rivers and streams because that affected us 
<br/>environmentally.  That is something that can be looked at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very short.  I just want to take us back to 
<br/>a retreat we had in the first Parliament at Momi where the UN had put together a programme for 
<br/>parliamentarians on the benefits of what we call the “Low Value Minerals and Materials” (LVMM).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  quite  an  illuminating  retreat,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  discovered  that  the 
<br/>contribution to a country’s wealth through the LVMM is much higher than the high value minerals.  
<br/>We tend to think that gold, silver and all that are more desirable or are higher in terms of creating 
<br/>wealth for a country, but what we learnt from that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was that its gravel, hard rock 
<br/>and sand contribute more to the wealth of countries than the high value minerals.

<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>599 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I remember correctly, it was almost 70 percent to 30 percent; 70 percent of the wealth of a 
<br/>country is Low Value Minerals and Materials (LVMM).  It was quite illuminating, and I remember 
<br/>there was this officer from the Ministry of Lands and Minerals who in his presentation was lamenting 
<br/>the fact that the gravel in the waterways and rivers of Nadi had been totally depleted when he saw 
<br/>that  against  the  development  in  the  Nadi  are.    I  am  a  tourism  person,  I  saw  the  development  of 
<br/>Denarau and all those huge complexes in Nadi and he said, “when I see all that and I see the depletion 
<br/>of the gravel from Nadi, it saddens me”.  At that time there was no appreciation of the value of the 
<br/>LVMM and for the equitable return to the owners of the gravel in the Nadi area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we hear quite a lot of viewpoints today in terms of the environment and 
<br/>development.  I think this is a dialogue that we need to have because we need development and the 
<br/>LVMM are a huge part of what we need to develop, but then we also worry about our environment.  
<br/>We need to strike a balance here on how to proceed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot rule out development because we want our environment to be totally a hundred 
<br/>percent.  I think during that period, we were talking about the element of restoration.  If you take out 
<br/>from a stream or from a river, you must replace, you must make good in some form.  So, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, for a developing country like ours, with the resources that belongs to the landowners, we need to 
<br/></span><span>develop them, we need to reward them, at the same time consider the environment.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot wealth out there, Mr. Speaker, I believe our people do not really realise what 
<br/>they have.  We drove through once the hinterland of Naitasiri on the way to Monasavu when we were 
<br/>in the Economic Affairs Committee to visit the EFL installations up in Nadarivatu.  We drove past a 
<br/>bridge in the Village of Lutu and the rocks in there was like a rugby field.  The kind of rocks is highly 
<br/>in demand for quarrying, and I was just asking myself, do they know the value of what they have 
<br/>here?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, there will be those who say that do not touch it because the river will be affected 
<br/>downstream  and  all  those  issues,  but  we  have  to  understand  that  these  rocks,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>actually dislodged by nature from the higher elevated areas and they roll down into the streams and 
<br/>they are carried by the force of the river downstream.  This is a dialogue that we need to have, we 
<br/>need to have this dialogue: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>It is needed for the country for development; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>The benefits can accrue in a big way to the landowners; and  
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>We need to balance it against the environment that we want to protect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just hope that from this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can have a dialogue and be comfortable that 
<br/>in what we do in terms of our minerals.  Again, I still want us to remember that, when it comes to 
<br/>minerals, there is more wealth created through LVMM than the high-quality ones that we normally 
<br/>think are the answer to all our problems, the gold, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ask that we have a dialogue on this one of these days, learn from what we 
<br/>have accomplished and then be comfortable on the way we develop our minerals and other materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think a lot of the issues have been covered 
<br/>quite extensively by the speakers before me.  The two things I wanted to say, of course from the 
<br/>development  point  of  view  and  from  an  economic  point  of  view  and  from  the  point  of  view  of 
<br/>infrastructure development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Gravel and sand are the two most important components, particularly roads, bridges, jetties 
<br/>and  wharves;  these  are  absolutely  important.    The  point  that  we  need  to  understand,  and  I  was 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Performance Audit on Licensing and  
<br/>Monitoring of River Gravel &amp; Sand Extractions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>listening to all the honourable Members, I think the process seems to  be too cumbersome.  If the 
<br/>Lands Ministry is involved and we know the history of Ministry of Lands and how they deal with a 
<br/>lot of these issues, not only just leases but also licenses for gravel extraction or sand extraction on 
<br/>State land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we were debating Bill No. 17, one of the things that I said 
<br/>that the iTaukei Land Trust Board (iTLTB) was more efficient than the Ministry of Lands Department 
<br/>in terms of dealing with the consents and mortgages and what was the need for it.  If you are trying 
<br/>to  balance  it  with  the  development  needs  and  the  environmental  needs,  I  can  tell  you  there  is  a 
<br/>government  funding  allocated  for  project  officers.    Over  the  last  five  years,  on  average  of  about 
<br/>$100,000 has been allocated, whether that is enough or not, how many project officers who monitor 
<br/>these things starting from the point of view of having the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
<br/>and the report clearly shows that the quality of EIA is very bad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think with the new Minister for Lands, I am hoping that the Lands Ministry will take charge 
<br/>and look at all the processes right from the application for licenses, EIA and the rates that are going 
<br/>to be charged.  If we do not streamline the processes, we will be dealing with these all the time.  Part 
<br/></span><span>of the reason why there is illegal extraction is because of these cumbersome processes.  I know the 
<br/></span><span>two former honourable Ministers should be able to explain why over the years they have not been 
<br/>able to sort that out.  I am hoping that our honourable Minister for Lands is going to deal with this 
<br/>and perhaps look at how quickly and efficiently the monitoring is done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and 
<br/>Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  and  I  have  had  so  many  complaints  from  businesses, 
<br/>investors about the efficiency within the Lands Ministry in the past.  We are now beginning to see 
<br/>all these talks about one-stop-shop, investment facilitation, ease of doing business - all these is linked 
<br/>with how efficient the Ministry of Lands can be and how they can work effectively to deal with the 
<br/>iTLTB and the Lands Ministry itself in terms of issuing this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point that honourable Minister for Infrastructure made again is in the Report and is an 
<br/>important one.  If we want to move away from river extraction of gravel and sand, then we got to 
<br/>look at what is the incentives that we need to provide for development of hard rock quarries which 
<br/>can be then transitioned from river extraction of gravel and sand to something like that and then we 
<br/>can solve the environmental problems.  That is the point I want to make from the point of view of 
<br/>infrastructure and government funding to monitor some of these processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  will  call  upon  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accounts to speak in Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  all  the  members  who  have 
<br/>contributed to the debate this afternoon.  It is pleasing to hear that the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources is working on all the recommendations to not only improve governance but to take it to 
<br/>another level - to improve monitoring and also provide value returns to all including Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are working to move away from manual records, they will be reviewing the fee upwards 
<br/>to be on par with iTLTB from the current $2.50.  They will work to stop or try to stop the illegal 
<br/>operators by providing better monitoring system and they are already working with the stakeholders 
<br/>especially  the  iTaukei  Lands  and  Fisheries  Commission  (TLFC)  for  the  proper  use  of  fees  or 
<br/>compensation and also carry out proper awareness on the impact of extractions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are also working on the two important guidelines that will be the guide or framework 
<br/>for not only river gravel and sand extraction, but all our minerals.  Those guidelines will be the key

<div><span>going forward.  We all agree today that the current value we get from gravel, sand and rock needs to 
<br/>be reviewed, so at the end of the day, resource owners, water owners and </span><span>qolili </span><span>owners are not only 
<br/>resource rich but also cash rich.  With those final comments Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this 
<br/>opportunity.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- For the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting 
<br/>times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension 
<br/>motion.
