<div><span>That the Consequential Bills –

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  Are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there any speakers on the motion?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As no Member wishes to speak on the motion, I now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing much to add, except to say, 
<br/>‘thank you’, to the Opposition for understanding that all these Bills are Consequential Bills, they give 
<br/>effect to the Budget and I have presented it today to ensure that the honourable Opposition Members 
<br/>have enough time.  Essentially, you will have about two weeks to go through all these Bills, so we 
<br/>could have a good debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, friends and members of the public, I now intend to adjourn Parliament 
<br/>for some morning refreshment and tea, perhaps.  It is almost 12 o’clock but then, again, we will recall 
<br/>Parliament at the sound of the bell.  The House is now adjourned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 11.53 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Amended 2023 Parliamentary Sitting Calendar  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 12.48 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just before I invite the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, 
<br/>there are some climate action notes that I wish to share with you, honourable Members.  For this 
<br/>short  moment,  please,  allow  me  to  just  elaborate  on  some  notes  that  Parliament,  through  the 
<br/>Secretariat, has enabled to prepare for this climate action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, I would like to advise that the Fijian Parliament is accelerating its green 
<br/>parliamentary initiative by phasing out the use of single-use plastic bottles in the Chambers during 
<br/>all parliamentary sittings.  As you have seen from this morning, these are being replaced by reusable 
<br/>water bottles that are in front of you.  This marks the Fijian Parliament’s concrete step in joining 
<br/>Parliaments for the Planet Campaign to reduce its carbon footprint and become a greener Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Today  is  also  the  International  Day  of  Parliamentarianism.  On  this  International  Day  of 
<br/>Parliamentarianism, I can assure all Fijians that Parliament will continue to adopt new technologies 
<br/>and  means  of  communication  to  make  Parliament  as  accessible  as  possible  to  the  people  of  Fiji.  
<br/>Parliament will continue to look for ways to innovate and boost public participation in this new Term 
<br/>of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will engage in actions that will increase public understanding of its functions, processes 
<br/>and practices, and we will continue to ensure that Parliament adopts greener policies and embrace a 
<br/>culture of sustainability, so as to help address the climate crisis and pave the way for stronger climate 
<br/>action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, if in any case you lose your parliamentary water bottles, or you do not 
<br/>bring it during parliamentary sittings (I note that the honourable Member is laughing already), please, 
<br/>kindly take note that you will be issued only with water flasks.  These are not for souvenirs, you can 
<br/>take it home with your name identified at the bottom of your water bottle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, you are also welcomed to bring your own preferred water bottles or 
<br/>flasks as you please, and I have noticed that being in use already.  As such, that is all that we would 
<br/>like to inform and remind you of.  What we have here is not a souvenir, it is for your own personal 
<br/>use in the Chamber, while at the same time we try and adapt ourselves to the greener climate action 
<br/>plans that the Government has already committed to.   
<br/></span></div>
