<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament adopts the amended Sitting Calendar for the year 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I 
<br/>speak on the actual motion,  I beg the indulgence of Parliament, as I feel  it is only appropriate as 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Women to acknowledge a great woman, whom we all know, and who was farewelled 
<br/></span><span>today.  I speak of a life well lived - Ms. Taufa Mereia Vakatale.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Ms. Vakatale was the first of many things, but there are a few things I wish to 
<br/>outline today.  She was a member of the pioneer students of Adi Cakobau School.  She was the first

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hailing from Yavu Village of Batiki Island with maternal links to Somosomo in Gau, she is 
<br/>survived by a daughter and four stepdaughters, three granddaughters and numerous grandchildren.  
<br/>She was a woman leader who, whilst being a public figure, remained a disciplinarian at home and 
<br/>work, who still knew how to have fun.  She lives on, not only in the lives of her family, but also in 
<br/>all of her friends and those whose lives she touched during her time with us.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  to  the  Sitting  Calendar,  on  Thursday,  16</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023,  when  we 
<br/>adopted the Calendar for the current Session of Parliament, I had mentioned that we were mindful 
<br/>that due to an unforeseen circumstance, that we were able to readjust some of the Sittings and this 
<br/>would  be  tabled  in  Parliament.    It  was  to  allow  some  flexibility,  and  this  has  been  the  accepted 
<br/>practice in the last two terms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  can  confirm  that  the  Business  Committee  agreed  and  approved  the 
<br/>amendments or readjustments to the Sitting Calendar for the year 2023, which was circulated to all 
<br/>honourable Members this morning.  The readjustments were for the Budget Announcement to be 
<br/>done today and the Budget Debate to be reduced to one week, as from the previous two weeks, as 
<br/>was approved earlier on 16</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to put on record that the discussions were held 
<br/>without the Opposition at the time, as the Business Committee had met before the uplifting of the 
<br/>Suspension by the Acting Supervisor of Elections and Registrar of Political Parties.  So, I plead with 
<br/>the honourable Members to support and approve the proposed amended Sitting Calendar with Friday, 
<br/>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023, as Budget announcement day and Monday, 10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 to Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, 
<br/>as one week of Budget Debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Sitting Calendar will allow all the six Standing Committees to continue 
<br/>with their Committee work on the Annual Reports that are currently pending with the Committees 
<br/>and Bills that may be moved in this Parliament for consideration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given that we are just six months in office as a new Government, we are 
<br/>proposing to make positive changes to ensure that services to the people are improved.  So, with the 
<br/>proposed amendments to the Sitting Calendar, the Government will be able to execute and implement 
<br/>its plans, policies and programmes, and the Standing Committees to undertake and discharge their 
<br/>functions as mandated in the Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  in  this  respect,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  honourable  Members,  that  the  proposed  Sitting 
<br/>Calendar before Parliament be supported as it is one that will greatly ensure that the Fijian Parliament 
<br/>will continue to undertake its legislative, representative and oversight functions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this motion to Parliament, and I seek all honourable Members’ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support to the proposed amendments in the Sitting Calendar for 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.

<div><span>         Amended 2023 Parliamentary Sitting Calendar  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  take  this  time  to  convey  our 
<br/>condolences to Ms. Taufa Vakatale and her family for the work that she has done for our Fiji and the 
<br/>Fijians at large, and if the family can accept our condolence on behalf of the Opposition Chambers 
<br/>as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to the motion with regards to the 2023 Sitting Calendar and as 
<br/>rightfully  said  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Government  in  Parliament,  the  June  Sitting  was 
<br/>deferred, unfortunately, because at that point in time, the Opposition Members were suspended so 
<br/>we were not aware of the  rulings and decision that was taken by the Business Committee.  Further 
<br/>on, we had a discussion in the last Business Committee Meeting whereby it was discussed that the 
<br/>deferment will be inserted in the future Calendar Sitting so we are looking forward to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform Parliament on the decision from the 
<br/>Opposition that we are totally against the reduction of Budget Debate Sitting from two weeks to one 
<br/>week.  None of the Opposition Members agreed on that because we felt that two weeks is sufficient 
<br/>enough  to  discuss  the  first  Budget  by  the  new  Coalition  Government  and  since  it  is  a  Coalition 
<br/>Government, there is a lot of input coming from the three Parties so we needed more time to scrutnise 
<br/>the Budget thoroughly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still on that, in addition to opposing the reduction of the number of days of the Budget Debate 
<br/>from two weeks to one week, we expect this year’s Calendar to be reduced from ten weeks to eight 
<br/>weeks, and next year’s Calendar as agreed in the Business Committee, will increase from ten weeks 
<br/>to twelve weeks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Maharaj.  I am taking that as a joke because we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have not deliberated on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Being Opposition Whip, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- If there are no other comments, I now call on the Leader of the Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Parliament to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note the 
<br/>comments that have been made by the honourable Opposition Whip in his role as Whip, and I thank 
<br/>him  for  that.    I  take  that  they  are  not  opposing  this  amended  Sitting  Calendar,  so  I  thank  the 
<br/>Opposition for their support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing further to add.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed.
