<div><span>2023-2024 APPROPRIATION BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow Members of Parliament, a very good 
<br/>morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  welcome  all  Fiji  citizens  who  have  joined  us  this  morning  via 
<br/>television, radio, live streaming on the Parliament website or through our various </span><span>Facebook </span><span>pages.  I 
<br/>will try to keep this address as short as possible.  However, I realise that people want to know the 
<br/>critical measures in this Budget which will affect them, but I aim to get through this Address in less 
<br/>than two hours.  We have a Budget Supplement and Budget Estimate for the finer details that will be 
<br/>online as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to try first to set the scene of the Government’s current financial 
<br/>situation and the State of the Economy as well as the Government’s priorities in the coming financial 
<br/>year.  Then I will outline Government’s revenue measures and policies and the allocations made to 
<br/>our various government ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji gave their verdict on 14</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022.  Our people 
<br/>voted for change, people voted for freedom after an era of unnecessary and sometimes brutal control 
<br/>and suppression of their opinions.  They wanted their voices to be heard, they wanted to be involved 
<br/></span><span>in the running of their country and to have a say in what their government should do for them.  They 
<br/></span><span>wanted their government to be more accountable and their leaders to treat them with respect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone in this Parliament is paid for by the taxpayers.  We are 
<br/>here to serve the people of Fiji.  We are not here to rule over them.  Our people want a democracy 
<br/>that exists not on paper but in practice.  They want respect for human rights, media freedom, rule of 
<br/>law and good governance. They want water in their taps and better health facilities. They want better 
<br/>roads, undisrupted  electricity, and improved transportation. They want  their children to  get  better 
<br/>education, affordable housing, and improvement in living standards. They want better paid jobs. The 
<br/></span><span>Coalition Government also</span><span> </span><span>wants this for them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are just a few of the many reasons why people voted for change. And 
<br/>this has led to the People’s Coalition Government - a government of the people, by the people and 
<br/>for the people led by the honourable Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, the people’s Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as part of that change, let me start with how the National Budget process will
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>change.  I promised a few days ago that we would deliver the Budget on time. This is not a small 
<br/>point. We know that in past years there have been delays, sometimes for hours in the delivery of the 
<br/>Budget, whether from disorganisation or indecision, I do not know. But this was disrespectful, not 
<br/>just of the Members of this Parliament but to all the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  this  same  disrespect  reflected  in  a  government  which  made  decisions  at  whim  and 
<br/>without consultation, which rammed almost all its legislation through this Parliament under urgency 
<br/>provisions and without proper consultation and which insulted and threatened those with differing 
<br/>views. This is the first thing that has changed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last month, the honourable Prime Minister’s remark to the people of a village in Vanua Levu 
<br/>was  quoted  in  the  media  where  he  thanked  the  previous  government  for  the  work  it  had  done  in 
<br/>national development. He pointed out that national development was now the responsibility of his 
<br/>Government. He said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “… after us there will be another team. We all play a role, and we should hear 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>each other out and help out in whatever way we can.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is respectful and gracious leadership. This is leadership that respects 
<br/>what our predecessors have done, and which understands that governments other than ours will hold 
<br/>power one day. I hope that we on our side, now that we are in power, can remember that, as the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister said, we all have a role to play.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  everyone  expects  me  today  to  talk  about  economics.  Let  me  remind 
<br/>everyone of the old maxim, well understood by good scientists, good environmentalists, and good 
<br/>economists that everything is connected to everything else. We cannot progress until we have rebuilt 
<br/>trust and unity. We must rebuild an environment in which people are encouraged to speak out, to 
<br/>complain,  to  suggest  alternative approaches  and to draw our attention to  the things  that matter to 
<br/>them. We must rebuild confidence in our business and productive sectors that we will respond to 
<br/>their needs, not just lecture them about what we think they are doing wrong.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  want  to  do  this  with  humility,  with  an  openness  to  criticism  and  a 
<br/>willingness to listen. We know that in the term of this Government things will go wrong. We will 
<br/>make mistakes. We will not hide from them. We will not pretend that we are perfect. We trust the 
<br/>people to understand that not everything will go well. But this is part of rebuilding trust, confidence, 
<br/>public participation in government and good leadership must be at the core of every government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want change to be reflected in the Budget process. After I complete this 
<br/>Address, Parliament adjourns until Monday, 10th July, 2023, for the Budget debate. I want to advise 
<br/>the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  his  team  that  in  the  coming  week,  the  Ministry  of  
<br/>Finance Officials will make themselves available to meet the Opposition Parliamentarians if they 
<br/>wish,  to  clarify  any  aspects  of  the  Budget  and  to  give  them  any  information  they  require.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this is because we want the Opposition to be informed and to contribute constructively 
<br/>to the Budget debate. We respect the Opposition as representatives of the people, just as we are.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us face a few uncomfortable facts. We are a six-month-old Government 
<br/></span><span>with a mandate to deliver change. What we have walked into is a deeply grim state of affairs. We 
<br/>have a national economy that is on the mend again after COVID-19. The Macroeconomic Committee 
<br/>is  predicting  an  8  percent  growth  for  the  2023  calendar  year,  mainly  on  the  back  of  better-than-
<br/>expected tourism receipts. Before we engage in too much congratulation on this, we should remember 
<br/>that this is merely a return to the state of our pre-COVID-19 economy.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1015 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is catch-up growth to get us back to where we started in 2019. The real challenges for 
<br/>economic growth start now.  Let us face another uncomfortable fact. In the last 10 years, despite all 
<br/>the boasting and big talk about booms and “never before this” and “unprecedented before that”, our 
<br/>average economic growth has been little more than 3 percent per annum.  That is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>not enough to significantly improve lives and incomes in our country. We must do better than this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  remind  everyone,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  COVID-19  pandemic  was  not  the 
<br/>underlying cause of all our problems, COVID-19 certainly made them worse. But this has been a 
<br/>decade of missed opportunities.  Poor revenue and spending decisions for years, including during the 
<br/>COVID-19  crisis  have undermined Government  finances  and now left  the Government  deeply  in 
<br/>debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National infrastructure has been ignored with highly visible consequences. Our Government 
<br/>has been left, Mr. Speaker, Sir, scrambling to fix infrastructure problems for which no money has 
<br/>been budgeted, because for years there has been no money for maintenance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  last  decade,  we  had  spent  over  $600  million  on  the  TELS  Scheme,  but  that  was 
<br/>supposed to be a revolving fund of repaid money to support the next generation of students so that 
<br/>we can continue to provide them the support.  It was not being repaid because they could not find 
<br/>jobs or paid low wages and salaries.  There was a mismatch in workforce needs and what our students 
<br/>were getting qualifications for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It remains a mystery to us how $120 million was spent on the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> national digital platform 
<br/>and  we  now  have  to  find  out  where  this  ridiculous  amount  of  money  went.  My  colleague,  the 
<br/>honorable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communications, has this firmly in his sights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we inherited a public debt of close to $10 billion, almost the size of our 
<br/>entire economy. In the upcoming financial year, we must find a staggering $1 billion to service this 
<br/>debt.  That  is  about  $536  million  interest  to  service  this  debt.    We  need  $536  million  for  interest 
<br/>payment and another $516 million for principal repayments alone. In other words, $1 out of every 
<br/>four in this Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, must now be spent on servicing Government debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During my one-on-one consultations on the Budget with Coalition Cabinet Ministers, who I 
<br/>also want to commend for their considerate understanding, this was the same starting point of the 
<br/>discussions  about  their  plans  for  the  new  Budget  year.  Our  ability  to  spend  on  capital  works, 
<br/></span><span>maintenance,  upgrades  and  incentivise  our  precious  human  capital  that  we  are  losing  daily,  is 
<br/></span><span>crowded out by </span><span>dinau </span><span>or debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we inherited a national health system on the verge of collapse. In the last 
<br/>few days, we have learned that the new Navua Hospital, built 10 years ago, on which completion was 
<br/>never properly certified cannot keep the power and water going. It will need an overhaul which will 
<br/>cost more than $10 million. But this is just one example of the crisis we face in almost all our health 
<br/>facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Colonial War Memorial (CWM) Hospital still has no laundry, years after a fire there. 
<br/></span><span>Levuka  Hospital’s  mortuary  has  finally  failed.    Most  of  our  hospitals  are  in  shocking  physical 
<br/>condition. The toilets are not working. There are long queues of people waiting for hours in need for 
<br/>urgent  health  care.  Medical  equipment  is  not  working.  Essential  drugs  and  medicines  are  not 
<br/>available on time. We lack 800 nurses.  Doctors and other exhausted health professionals are treated 
<br/>poorly and not listened to when they offer solutions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the consequence of 
<br/>years of serious neglect of health infrastructure and services.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we inherited a disaster in the water sector. Thousands of households still 
<br/>struggle with daily water disruptions. Half of the water that we collect and treat for people to use is 
<br/>lost because it leaks through an aged pipe network. We will need hundreds of millions of dollars to 
<br/>fix it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  how  did  we  get  into  this  mess?  For  more  than  10  years,  a  two-men 
<br/>Government did not raise or save enough money due to prudent financial management.  But those 
<br/>two men still wanted to spend, they were focused on the TV cameras and the political goodies, they 
<br/>did not want to hear bad news and kept it hidden if it arrived.  They threatened and intimidated people 
<br/>who wanted to bring problems to the attention of the public, and yet, neither of these two men are 
<br/>now in this Parliament to account for their actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For all that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we now look to the honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>his team.  We want to work with them on finding solutions to our problems.  We must first, however, 
<br/>understand why we are in this difficult position and learn lessons for the future.  Some people will 
<br/>accuse me of talking only about the past but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the past, this is our present.  
<br/>As a doctor once told me, 90 percent of our patients’ diagnosis is his or her history, because it is now 
<br/>that we must find the money to fix these problems.  It is now that we must find the money to meet 
<br/>our  debt  servicing  payments.    Our  present  and  future  choices  are  now  restricted  by  those  poor 
<br/>decisions of the past.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the problems that have accumulated over 15 years.  
<br/>Many of them will need time to fix and for that, we will have to ask our people for patience and 
<br/>goodwill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Let me now talk about how we are going to deal with these challenges.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>nations are not built by politicians and leaders making grand speeches and opening new buildings, 
<br/>they are built by people on the foundations of unity and mutual cooperation.  Most nation builders 
<br/>work  quietly  out  of  the  limelight.    They  serve  their  communities  as  good  employers,  as  public 
<br/>servants  who  work  long  hours,  as  provincial  and  district  councillors,  in  charities,  religious 
<br/>organisations and NGOs, in </span><span>pro bono</span><span> professional work.  These are the people we must empower.  
<br/>These are the nation builders who we, as a Government, must serve.  This Government values our 
<br/>people, their ideas and aspirations.  We believe in consultation and dialogue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first necessary step we took in Government was to bring the people together to hear their 
<br/>ideas  and  concerns  after  16  years  in  which  they  had  not  been  heard.    We  had  a  very  successful 
<br/>National Economic Summit where key stakeholders including private sector, trade unions, academia, 
<br/>civil  society  organisations,  women’s  groups,  youth  organisations,  development  partners  and  the 
<br/></span><span>general  public participated in  a free and open dialogue process  which will help  to  shape national 
<br/></span><span>priorities for inclusive and sustainable development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  14-member  Fiscal  Review  Committee  was  appointed  and  conducted  their  own 
<br/>consultations and deliberations with public servants, economic experts and other people.  In a short 
<br/>nine-week span, they produced a comprehensive report with over 100 recommendations to reset our 
<br/>fiscal priorities towards sustainability, stability and resiliency.  I take this opportunity to thank the 
<br/>Chairman, Mr. Richard Naidu, and 13 other sterling members, for their service to this nation.  The 
<br/>outcomes of both the Economic Summit, the Fiscal Review Committee and the Education Summit 
<br/></span><span>and  other  plans  from  which  the  outcomes  will  contribute  towards  the  framing  of  our  umbrella 
<br/></span><span>National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, 
<br/>the Asian Development Bank and all our development partners that provided clear and honest views 
<br/>and recommendations during the Government’s transition process.  It was at those moments where 
<br/>it dawned on us just how right we were when we used to ask the hard questions about money when  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1017 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we sat on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The news media plays and crucial role in this entire dialogue process.  One of our first acts in 
<br/>Government  was  to  repeal  the  repressive  Media  Industry  Development  Act  that  has  plagued  the 
<br/>media industry and kept the people in the dark.  We want people to express themselves freely.  We 
<br/>want to hear their concerns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have moved quickly to rebuild confidence and trust between the public 
<br/>service  and  the  Government.    As  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  said  on  Wednesday  night  that 
<br/>permanent appointments in the Civil Service have been reinstated and the retirement age has been 
<br/>moved from 55 years to 60 years, providing civil servants with the employment security they need 
<br/>to do their work.  That work is to provide honest, independent advice to their Ministers without the 
<br/>fear as they used to say of being sent home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in our first few weeks in Government, we redeployed $100 million to support 
<br/>our families and other urgent priorities including a $200 “Back to School” payment for children from 
<br/>low-income households.  We provide additional funding to continue the 10 percent reduction in bus 
<br/>fares until the end of July 2023.  We did this mainly to give the assurance to our people that even 
<br/>with the new Government, they would continue to be supported through challenging times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have begun to rebuild trust with our leading university, the University of the South Pacific 
<br/>(USP).  Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us pause to reflect on how backward and petty Fiji looked 
<br/>only six months ago.  It was involved in a pointless fight with USP.  It had held back more than $80 
<br/>million  in  committed  funds,  money  that  Fiji’s  own  students  needed  for  their  education.    It  had 
<br/>deported USP’s Vice-Chancellor all because some people did not like him.  No government should 
<br/>abuse his power over public funds in that way.  And so, even though funds are tight, we have begun 
<br/>the process of paying USP wat we owe.  We are Government, we represent the people of Fiji.  We 
<br/>must  be  seen  to  be  trustworthy  and  ready  to  keep  our  promises  even  to  people  with  whom  we 
<br/>disagree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just as important, Mr. Speaker, is the initiative that the honourable Prime Minister has begun 
<br/>to rebuild relationship between Fiji and other countries in the region, which were nearly destroyed 
<br/>by the arrogance and disrespect of our previous leaders. We must regain the trust of our neighbours.  
<br/>Our very existence depends on us, all working together to solve the critical problems posed by climate 
<br/>change and environmental degradation.  Fiji used to be seen as a leader which could bring the region 
<br/>together.  That is the position to which Fiji must return.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we provided additional funding to the Fiji Roads Authority for urgent road 
<br/>works.  We supported other quick infrastructure upgrades including some of our health facilities.  We 
<br/>successfully held Girmit Day commemorations and celebrated Ratu Sukuna Day, thus reaffirming 
<br/>the unique rights and places of people from our major ethnic groups.  These were powerful events 
<br/>which have set us on a path of national reconciliation.  They demonstrate that as a Government, we 
<br/>embrace our cultural, ethnic and religious diversity.  We are not afraid of it.  We do not ignore or 
<br/>suppress it, we celebrate it.  We take strength from it.  We know that we can build unity from it and 
<br/>that is where, as a Government, we must begin the task of rebuilding.  As I have said, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>everything is connected to everything else.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we unveil our plans with clear strategies and financial commitments 
<br/>for the next fiscal year.  I have already talked about rebuilding, and this is our vision: “Rebuilding 
<br/>Our Future Together.”  That, Mr. Speaker, is really the theme of this Budget.  It is my honour and 
<br/>privilege to present the first National Budget of the People’s Coalition Government.

<div><span>         2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget is an outcome of the numerous consultations and dialogue we had with a diverse 
<br/>group  of  stakeholders  all  across  Fiji.    We  have  talked  to  various  industry  groups,  private  sector 
<br/>businesses  and  entrepreneurs.    We  have  heard  from  our  youth,  our  women,  our  elderly  and  the 
<br/>vulnerable.  We have met the trade unions, civil society groups and other grassroot organisations.  
<br/>We have listened to many experts locally and internationally.  We have worked with our development 
<br/>partners, multilateral agencies and lenders.  We have had long hours with the civil servants, including 
<br/>Ministers and Permanent Secretaries over the last two months, including long and tough negotiations.  
<br/>I also extend my deepest appreciation to the Permanent Secretary and Ministry of Finance staff who 
<br/>have worked tirelessly, and I suspect with some relief that these days they are not on call at random 
<br/>hours  of  the  night,  and  that  many  of  them  can  have  some  semblance  of  quality  time  with  their 
<br/>families, because we put this budget together in a more organised way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  almost  a  decade,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  we  reconvened  the  Cabinet  Sub-Committee  on 
<br/>Budget chaired by the honourable Prime Minister and comprising the three honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers.  The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Budget oversaw the overall formulation and finalisation 
<br/>of  the  National  Budget.    I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/>leadership,  the  support  and  the  comradery  of  my  two  fellow  Deputy  Prime  Ministers.    This  is 
<br/>consultative Government, not one or two-men government; those days are over.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even with the major challenges the Government faces, the Budget is set against the backdrop 
<br/>of a renewed sense of optimism and confidence.  As I have said, our economy is recovering faster 
<br/>than we had expected and is now projected to grow by around 8 percent this year.  Given the trends 
<br/>we are seeing, growth may be even higher.  Not everything is ideal, higher interest rates threaten the 
<br/>global economy, and this also puts pressure on us and the interest we may have to pay on our loans 
<br/>from offshore.  It may also put pressure on our exchange rates, making imports more expensive.  The 
<br/>economies of Australia and New Zealand show signs of slowing, so we will review our projections 
<br/>later this year when we have more concrete statistics available with us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tourism industry has been doing extremely well with a strong rebound 
<br/>in visitor arrivals which will return to pre-pandemic levels or even exceed that.  Yields in the tourism 
<br/>industry  are  increasing  as  our  tourists  are  spending  much  more  than  before  and  staying  slightly 
<br/>longer, but we know that we cannot depend on tourism alone. We have all learned that bitter lesson 
<br/>in the last three years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, investment levels are picking up with a pipeline of major projects that are 
<br/>getting off the ground.  The banks have informed us that demand for credit is  increasing, and we 
<br/></span><span>know of some major projects that will soon materialize.   Our foreign exchange levels remain strong, 
<br/></span><span>standing at over $3.4 billion as of yesterday, equivalent to almost 6.1 months of retained imports.  
<br/>The exchange rate is stable and well protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our financial sector is sound with a strong capital position.  Liquidity levels are more than 
<br/>adequate to support investments sitting at almost $2.5 billion.  Remittances crossed the billion-dollar 
<br/>mark last year and are increasing further, likely to cross the $1.2 billion mark by the end of this year.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not only fitting at this juncture to extend the Coalition Government’s deepest 
<br/>gratitude, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> and </span><span>dhanyavaad</span><span> to all our families and friends abroad who continue to 
<br/></span><span>support our people here in such a moving and a heartfelt way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the fiscal  front,  this  Budget  stabilizes our revenue and debt  levels  and puts  them on a 
<br/>sustainable path.  We began the fiscal year in July 2022 with a debt to GDP ratio of 88.8 percent.  
<br/>We are projecting this to reduce to 79.3 percent of GDP by July 2024. But the bad news is that this 
<br/>ratio is still too high.  We have too much Government debt for the size of our economy.  As I have

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>biggest challenges.  We must continue to carefully manage our revenue spending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  total  expenditure  is  $4.3  billion.    With  a  projected 
<br/>revenue of $3.7 billion, our fiscal deficit is set at $639 million equivalent to 4.8 percent of GDP.  This 
<br/>is a major reduction in the deficit.  In the last four fiscal years the average deficit has been 9 percent.  
<br/>This deficit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is higher than, I would have expected personally, however, we are at 
<br/>a critical point.  We must continue to cushion the blow on our people.  We must catch up on all the 
<br/>lost years without investment in infrastructure and maintenance.  If we do not do this, our future path 
<br/>of economic growth will be affected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, we are pursuing further fiscal consolidation, that is, better value spending 
<br/>and cost savings to ensure that we urgently bring down government debt parameters to a sustainable 
<br/>level.  But to achieve this, we will have to swallow some bitter medicine now otherwise we could 
<br/>end up in a worst financial situation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every government has to collect taxes to fund public expenditure. It is a 
<br/>delicate task to ensure that we collect the right amount and not over tax the economy and our people, 
<br/>but revenue adequacy is critical in the running of the government.  It is equally important that in this 
<br/>process of collecting revenues, our tax system is simple, easy to administer, transparent, efficient and 
<br/>equitable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot deny the fact that for many years the government 
<br/>was bereft of vision to raise funds other than to keep on borrowing until debt hit the roof.  Popularism 
<br/>and electioneering were their only option.  They cost the government and the nation billions of dollars 
<br/>in lost revenue, pushing debt to unstainable levels.  This also  meant the deterioration and lack of 
<br/>maintenance of government infrastructure and poor service delivery.  The government simply did 
<br/>not have enough money to fix its assets and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  very  clear  from  the  World  Bank  Public  Expenditure  Review,  various  international 
<br/>Monetary Fund Reports, the report of the Fiscal Review Committee and from the deliberations of the 
<br/>National Economic Summit and all the expert views, the Government cannot continue to run with 
<br/>the current low levels of revenue generated through its low tax regime.  Now, we have a debt overload 
<br/>that we must urgently confront.  Business as usual cannot continue and from the feedback that I have 
<br/>received, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our people understand that.  They may not like it, but they understand the 
<br/>problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to put an end to this problem quickly and decisively.  The time to 
<br/></span><span>act is now and if we do not, we will be clearly on the path to fiscal disaster.  We will only further 
<br/>weaken Government’s ability to perform its core functions including to fix our deep infrastructure 
<br/>challenges including water, health, roads and bridges and to protect our most vulnerable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have tough choices.  We fully understand the expectations of the people, particularly on 
<br/>the prices of food and basic items, but we will be making some tough decisions that were side-stepped 
<br/>in the past.  We are here to make the right decisions for the nation.  It is a choice between bearing the 
<br/>burden now or burdening our future generations with more debt.  It is also about ensuring that our 
<br/></span><span>next generation get the health, education and the employment opportunities they need now.  We have 
<br/></span><span>to invest in our future generations, our young people, to ensure that they will be more productive in 
<br/>the future.  It is our moment to put a down payment for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Against this context, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now announce key revenue and tax measures.  
<br/>Effective from 1st August, 2023, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will only have two rates of VAT.  The 21 
<br/>items on zero VAT will continue.  We have added prescribed medicines to the list to make it 22 items 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now, the items on zero VAT will include:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Flour; 
<br/>Rice; 
<br/>Sugar; 
<br/>Canned fish; 
<br/>Cooking oil; 
<br/>Potatoes; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Onion; 
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>Garlic; 
<br/>9.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Baby milk; 
<br/>10.</span><span> </span><span>Powdered milk; 
<br/>11.</span><span> </span><span>Liquid milk; 
<br/>12.</span><span> </span><span>Dhal; 
<br/>13.</span><span> </span><span>Tea; 
<br/>14.</span><span> </span><span>Salt; 
<br/>15.</span><span> </span><span>Soap; 
<br/>16.</span><span> </span><span>Soap powder; 
<br/>17.</span><span> </span><span>Toilet paper; 
<br/>18.</span><span> </span><span>Sanitary pads; 
<br/>19.</span><span> </span><span>Toothpaste; 
<br/>20.</span><span> </span><span>Kerosene (cooking); and  
<br/>21.</span><span> </span><span>Prescribed medicines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The supply of all other goods and services effective from 1st August, 2023 will attract a VAT 
<br/>rate of 15 percent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 15 percent VAT is not new, it was payable on all goods and 
<br/>services between 2011 and 2015, except on six basic food items, it was zero.  Therefore, 15 percent 
<br/>is not a new measure.  As the honourable Prime Minister said in his National Address on Wednesday 
<br/>night that we have to bite the bullet, but in a few years, all of us will discover that it is a magic bullet 
<br/>that may give a short-term pain but result in long term gain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  measures  will  generate  additional  VAT  collections  estimated  at  $446  million  for 
<br/>Government,  but  this  restructuring  will  make  the  VAT  system  simpler  to  administer,  eliminate 
<br/>ambiguity  and  improve  VAT  compliance.    While  we  generate  additional  revenue  for  public 
<br/>investment,  we have  chosen to  ensure that the  poor are protected  with  a  continuation of the zero 
<br/>rating and various rating expenditure support measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strongest feedback we have received is about lowering food prices.  So, 
<br/>to assist households on this, the Government will reduce fiscal duty from 32 percent to 15 percent on 
<br/>canned  Mackerel  (except  canned  tuna),  corned  mutton,  corned  beef  and  beef  products,  canned 
<br/>tomatoes, prawns and duck meat.  Fiscal duty on sheep and lamb meats will be reduced to zero.  Beef 
<br/>meat, the duty is being reduced from 32 percent to 15 percent.  The Government will also reduce 
<br/>import excise on  chicken portions  such as  wings, drumstick, legs, feet,  thighs, et  cetera,  from  15 
<br/>percent to zero percent.  The reduction of duties will provide ordinary households with a range of 
<br/>choices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now turn to corporate tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We will increase the corporate tax rate from 
<br/>the current 20 percent to 25 percent. New companies eligible for reduced corporate tax for listing on 
<br/>the South Pacific Stock Exchange will have that tax rate increased from the current 10 percent to 15 
<br/>percent.  For clarity, this will be for new companies and only for a period of seven years.  These 
<br/>corporate tax rate increases will add about $73.5 million in revenue.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are encouraged by the feedback that we have had from the business sector, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  Most businesses understand Government’s fiscal situation and they need to contribute more.  In 
<br/>return,  however,  they  want  the  Government  to  improve  the  regulatory  environment  and  business 
<br/>processes - I will come back to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are keeping an open mind on shareholders’ income and 
<br/>whether we will in future implement an imputation system or a simpler tax on dividends.  This is a 
<br/>matter on which we will be consulting widely before the next Budget, before we make any decisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Departure tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will increase from the current $100 to $125 effective from 
<br/>1st August, 2023 and will further increase by an additional $15 to $140 effective from 1st January, 
<br/>2024.  This will add a total of $30 million towards our overall tax revenues.  We are signaling these 
<br/>increases as early as we can so that the tourism industry can plan for them in their wholesaling and 
<br/>other commercial arrangements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are going to increase the excise tax on alcohol and tobacco by 5 percent,  
<br/>while the excise on carbonated/sugar-sweetened beverages will be increased from 35 cents per litre 
<br/>to 40 cents per litre.  Mr. Speaker Sir, alcohol taxes were reduced by 50 percent during COVID-19, 
<br/>while taxes on tobacco were kept unchanged. We are mindful that alcoholic beverages are an integral 
<br/>part of our tourism industry. So, we are starting with a very small increase, compared to the massive 
<br/>reduction we had two years ago.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  efforts  to  curb  NCDs  and  promote  healthy  living,  a  domestic  excise  of  40  cents  per 
<br/>kilogramme  or  per  litre  and  import  excise  of  15  percent  will  be  introduced  on  juice  (including 
<br/>carbonated  drinks,  Frubu,  Tampico,  Pulpy,  Just  Juice  and  Marigold),  ice  cream,  sweet  biscuits, 
<br/>snacks and sugar confectionery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motor vehicle import excise duty will increase on all new and used passenger vehicles by an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>additional 5 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  intend  to  touch  briefly  now  on  a  serious  matter  of  good  governance,  in 
<br/>connection with Capital Gains Tax. In 2021, just a few weeks after the beginning of the 2021-2022 
<br/>financial year, the previous Government introduced a special exemption on the 10 percent Capital 
<br/>Gains Tax levied on the disposal of shares by shareholders before 1st May, 2011. The Government 
<br/>did that without explanation and, of course, under urgency as it did everything.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, that Government also introduced an even more special measure. Any taxpayer who 
<br/></span><span>owed Capital Gains Tax from a previous unexempted transaction but had not yet paid, it was not 
<br/>exempted from paying the debt.  The exemption did not work in the other direction. If you were a 
<br/>compliant taxpayer and you had paid the tax, you did not get it back but if you were a taxpayer who 
<br/>owed the tax because you had not paid it, you were suddenly exempted from payment. In Opposition, 
<br/>we asked the same question that we ask now – why and for whom was that special benefit and special 
<br/>tax exemption?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that special law for certain special taxpayers or should I say, one taxpayer, was 
<br/></span><span>one of the most disgraceful and corrupt pieces of legislation ever to be brought before this Parliament.  
<br/></span><span>It  was  a  sign  of  just  how  self-serving  the  previous  Government  had  become  and  how  poor  our 
<br/>governance had become. A government that is making special laws for its chosen special people is a 
<br/>government that does not deserve to be in office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this random change to the Capital Gains Tax regime designed to help a specific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>set of special taxpayers ended up costing the Government till today almost $70 million in lost 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>revenue. We are now going to get this right and right this wrong and remove the exemption.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Social Responsibility Tax will be simplified by merging it with the PAYE 
<br/>structure, along with a 5-percentage point reduction on each band for those earning above $270,000 
<br/>effective from 1st January, 2024. This would mean, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that our maximum marginal 
<br/>tax rate will be reduced from the current 44 percent down to 39 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has been losing significant revenue from a range of tax and 
<br/>custom concessions that have been in place in Fiji for a very long time. Given the fiscal challenges 
<br/>facing  us,  we  have  reviewed  these  concessions  and,  in  some  cases,  varied  the  rates.  Customs 
<br/>Concession Code 236 which currently allows all manufacturers to access duty free raw materials and 
<br/>other machinery and equipment will have a concession rate increased from zero percent to 3 percent. 
<br/>Still a concession, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but Government will get 3 percent duty from all these imports.   
<br/>Similarly,  for  Concession  Code  231  which  is  available  to  manufacturers  for  import  of  packaging 
<br/>products, that concessionary rate will also be increased from zero to 3 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Code 235 allows hotels and resorts to import building materials, furnishings and 
<br/>fittings, room amenities, kitchen and dining room equipment, utensils and outdoor equipment all duty 
<br/>free.  We will increase the fiscal duty on this concession from zero to 3 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Concession Code 117, which allows for a reduced duty of 10 cents per litre of fuel for hotels, 
<br/>manufacturers, cruise vessels and mining companies will be removed and a normal rate of 20 cents 
<br/>per litre on diesel will apply. Concession on smartphones will be removed and replaced with a fiscal 
<br/>duty of 5 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  completely  remove  the  tax  incentives  available  for  warehouse 
<br/>development.  This  was  introduced  as  a  temporary  incentive.  It  will  also  help  reduce  tax 
<br/>administration  using  this  incentive  which  we  have  noted  in  the  last  few  years.  We  are  also 
<br/>restructuring the ICT incentive to tighten the definition and eligibility criteria and align the maximum 
<br/>tax holiday period to 13 years in line with other incentives.  Removing 
<br/>customs 
<br/>concessions will help us collect much needed revenue by around $35 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>few 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from tax raising measures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are announcing a number of measures 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to improve tax administration and supporting ease of doing business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Expenditures,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  years,  the  government  has  spent  a  lot  of  money 
<br/></span><span>building  new  infrastructure  and  assets  with  little  focus  on  value  for  money  and  a  lot  of  wastage. 
<br/></span><span>Worse, it has taken its focus off maintenance of our existing infrastructure. This is now suffering 
<br/>from years of neglect and has badly deteriorated. So, we are now in a catch-up mode on maintenance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public infrastructure assets, Mr. Speaker Sir, we all know are the foundation of a country’s 
<br/>economic development and let me assure you that the highest priority of the Coalition Government 
<br/>for the next few national budgets is going to be maintenance of this infrastructure. We have put aside 
<br/>over  $200  million  for  maintenance  of  our  hospitals,  health  centers,  schools,  public  buildings, 
<br/>government quarters, roads and bridges and water infrastructure. But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not just 
<br/></span><span>about throwing more money at every problem. We are completely changing our approach towards 
<br/></span><span>this. Our focus now will be on efficient and effective use of every single dollar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are going to cut wastage and unnecessary spending by starting ourselves and we will start 
<br/>this from the Ministerial level to set an example. Apart from our 20 percent reduced pay, we are 
<br/>significantly cutting down on Ministerial travel allowances that were put in place by the previous 
<br/>Government. They amounted to actually in some sense looting taxpayer funds ironically by Ministers 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who should be guarding them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, all Coalition Government Ministers and all Members on this side support these 
<br/>reductions, starting with the honourable Prime Minister himself who has taken the biggest cut.  For 
<br/>the travel allowance of the honourable Prime Minister, the current 250 percent per diem loading will 
<br/>be reduced to only 100 percent. Ministers will have their top up reduced from 200 percent to only 50 
<br/>percent.  For  Assistant  Ministers,  the  top  up  will  be  reduced  from  the  current  100  percent  to  25 
<br/>percent. Apart from these major reductions, we will remove all the exorbitant incidental allowances 
<br/>that are currently provided while they are on duty travel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  improving  water  services,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  poor  maintenance  and  upgrade  of  our 
<br/>existing water infrastructure has resulted in 47 percent of treated water getting lost along the pipeline 
<br/>due to leakage. This has caused major intermittent water supplies across Fiji.  However, in the last 
<br/>few months, Mr. Speaker Sir, we have seen some major improvements. Water disruptions have been 
<br/>reduced and we now have a good plan not just for the next year but also for the long term. The new 
<br/>Water Authority of Fiji Board has hit the ground running, with a clear mandate to get things done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  scaling  up  our  investment  in  the  water  sector  with  an  increased 
<br/>budget of $250.8 million. Yes, this year we will put a quarter billion dollars into the water system. 
<br/>This is a major increase of almost $60 million compared to the current budget. This includes $118.1 
<br/>million in operating expenditure and $132.7 million for capital expenditure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rewa River Water Project is expected to be completed by the end of 
<br/>July with full commissioning expected by October this year. This has been a major investment and 
<br/>we will see major improvements in supply after the full commissioning of the project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are allocating $51.2 million for the completion of the project. The total cost 
<br/>of the project is approximately $400 million. I thank our financing partners, the Asian Development 
<br/>Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Green Climate Fund for their grant support towards 
<br/>this project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $53.9  million  is  allocated to  improve water sources and implement  new 
<br/>disaster resilient infrastructure including water treatment facilities with a focus on reducing leakages, 
<br/>$6.4  million  to  improve  wastewater  operations  and  $4.8  million  allocated  for  asset  management 
<br/>within  WAF.    Another  $4.6  million  is  allocated  for  the  digital  transformation  in  the  water  sector 
<br/>which will help manage water disruptions.  A further $3.8 million is allocated for emergency response 
<br/></span><span>in the event of water disruption.  We are allocating $7.9 million to focus on improving access to 
<br/></span><span>water supplies in rural areas which has been neglected for some time as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the magnitude of the challenge we have in the water sector, it is going 
<br/>to take time and cost over $500 million in replacement of the 40 year old pipe system which is leaking 
<br/>underground.  We are working with the Asian Development Bank for a major institutional revamp 
<br/>of WAF, including governance, investment planning, asset management, infrastructure replacement 
<br/>and  upgrade  review  of  water  tariffs,  investment  in  our  people  and  improving  customer  services 
<br/>management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has as promised restored tripartite arrangement 
<br/>that we had for many years with the workers and we will use this to ensure the rights of workers are 
<br/>respected  through  dialogue  and  consultation  with  government  and  employers.    The  previous 
<br/>Government  had  deprived  our  workers  of  hundreds  of  millions  in  their  FNPF  contribution  by 
<br/>reducing  their  contribution  rate  from  18  percent  to  10  percent.    We  will  restore  the  18  percent 
<br/>effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2024.

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is the largest employer in the country, employing over 35,000 
<br/>civil servants.  As the largest employer, we are committed to looking after the welfare of our people.  
<br/>We are working together with the workers representatives to review the overall pay and benefits of 
<br/>our civil servants.  We know that this has not been done for almost five years and our hardworking 
<br/>civil servants and teachers, police, medical professionals have not received a pay rise for some time.  
<br/>In the next six to nine months, we will holistically review the civil service remuneration and pending 
<br/>the review of the salary structure of the civil service, will be readjusted to commensurate with the 
<br/>work they do for the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will review the current minimum wage rate in 
<br/>the next financial year.  We want our workers to receive a fair and just living wage through a proper 
<br/>consultative process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Social protection, Aftercare Fund and Government pensions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the moral 
<br/>responsibility of any compassionate government to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society, 
<br/>the poor persons with disabilities, elderly, children or other disadvantaged persons are well supported 
<br/>by the State.  We need well equipped responsive institutions and laws that ensure that our vulnerable 
<br/>are not left out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is committed to building a responsive, inclusive and well 
<br/>targeted social protection system which is at the heart of the one of the Coalition Government’s key 
<br/>development agenda.  In this Budget, the funding allocation for the Ministry of Women, Children 
<br/>and Social Protection is increased from $147.7 million to $200.2 million; a major increase of $52.5 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more than 90,000 people on social welfare will directly benefit from  an 
<br/>increased monthly allowance of 15 percent and 25 percent.   For those at the age of 70 years and 
<br/>above and are on social pension system, they will receive a 25 percent increase.  This means that the 
<br/>monthly allowance will increase from $100 a month to $125 a month effective August 2023.  Those 
<br/>between the age of 65 to 69 years will have their monthly allowances increased from $100 to $115.  
<br/>As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Social Pension Scheme is  being  allocated  a large budget  of $78.2 
<br/>million, an increase of $23.2 million, to cater for the needs of our 54,200 senior citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the military regime in 2011 unilaterally and illegally reduced the pension 
<br/>rate for many FNPF pensioners and broke the contractual arrangement between the Fund and the 
<br/>pensioners.  They went even further to pass a law to restrict those pensioners from challenging that 
<br/></span><span>in the court of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is over a decade, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and these pensioners have not received justice.  Today, 
<br/>we are going to correct this wrong and give some justice to the more than 1,500 pensioners who have 
<br/>been put on the reduced pension rates.  Effective from August 2023, those 1,500 FNPF pensioners 
<br/>will be able to access the Government Social Pension Allowance of $125 if they are above the age 
<br/>of  70  or  $115  if  they  are  between  60  years  to  69  years.    The  FNPF  will  work  together  with 
<br/>Government to identify and put these pensioners on the Social Pension Scheme on top of what they 
<br/>received from their current reduced FNPF pensions.  This will cost us around $2.2 million per year 
<br/></span><span>and we are happy to provide that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Protecting our vulnerable children and their childhood would be a key priority for us.  In this 
<br/>Budget,  a  sum  of  $100,000  is  allocated  to  cater  for  the  establishment  of  a  new  Department  of 
<br/>Children.    In  addition,  a  sum  of  $19.9  million,  an  increase  of  $6.2  million  is  allocated  for  child 
<br/>protection allowance.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, family assistance previously known as Poverty Benefit Scheme is allocated 
<br/>a budget of $45.6 million.  This is an increase of $11.5 million from the current financial year and 
<br/>will  accommodate  the  15  percent  increase  across  the  board.    A  total  of  26,000  households  are 
<br/>expected to be assisted with this increased allocation in this financial year.  A total sum of $43 million 
<br/>is  allocated  to  cater  for  Disability  Allowance,  bus  fare  subsidy  for  elderly,  disabled,  electricity 
<br/>subsidy  to  households  below  $30,000  income  and  insurance  for  social  welfare  recipients.    Over 
<br/>$100,000 people are expected to benefit from this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A funding of $500,000 is allocated to the Women’s Plan of Action and a further allocation of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$200,000 is provided to support smaller women organisations for their advocacy work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the funding for the  Ministry of Women, Children and Social 
<br/>Protection, to support our ex-servicemen, a sum of $14.9 million is allocated for the Fiji Servicemen’s 
<br/>Aftercare Fund to assist 10,226 ex-servicemen and their families including a 15 percent increase in 
<br/>their allowances.  For over 2,000 government pensioners, a total budget of $37 million is provided 
<br/>which will also cater for the increase in monthly allowance by 15 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> empowerment and development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is 
<br/>determined to empower the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and help lift their living standards.  For a long time under the 
<br/>previous  government,  they  did  not  receive  the  attention  that  they  should  have.    We  are  going  to 
<br/>change that, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts has been allocated a budget 
<br/>of $38.6 million, a major increase of $23.2 million from this year’s allocation.  To strengthen </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>administration  and  our  provincial  councils,  a  grant  of  $10.8  million  is  allocated  to  fund  the  14 
<br/>Provincial Councils, including $4.3 million to fund the salaries and wages of 182 Provincial Council 
<br/>Officers and their operational expenses of around $6.1 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  now  reviewed  the  allowances  of  the  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Koro,  Mata  ni  Tikina  </span><span>and  also 
<br/>allocated  allowance  for  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Yavusa</span><span>  due  to  the  important  role  they  play  in  the  village 
<br/>administration and leadership.  The </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>monthly allowance will be increased from $100 
<br/>to  $150  per  month  for  all  1,181  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Koro  </span><span>for  which  a  total  sum  of  $2.1  million  is  being 
<br/>allocated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  </span><span>Mata  ni  Tikina  </span><span>quarterly  allowance  will  be  increased  by  $150  per  quarter  which  is 
<br/>equivalent to an increase of $50 per month for the 262 </span><span>Mata ni Tikina.  </span><span>This increase will be on top 
<br/>of the current quarterly allowance for the </span><span>Mata ni Tikina.  </span><span>Currently, the </span><span>Mata ni Tikina </span><span>is eligible 
<br/>for  either  $100,  $175  or  $195  depending  on  the  geographical  area  they  serve,  and  some  are  also 
<br/></span><span>eligible for certain travel and incidental allowance.  A sum of $585,800 is being allocated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  recognise  and  support  the  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Yavusa  </span><span>in  decision-making  and 
<br/></span><span>vanua </span><span>administration, a monthly allowance of $100 has been allocated for 648  </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa 
<br/></span><span>under the Vanua Leadership Allowance with a sum of $0.8 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support beautification and general improvement of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> villages and settlements, we 
<br/>are  introducing  a  village  development  programme  with  a  funding  allocation  of  $2  million.    The 
<br/>Government will provide two-thirds towards any eligible project while villages and settlements will 
<br/></span><span>contribute one- third.  The maximum Government support will be $10,000 per village per year and 
<br/></span><span>the programme will be administered by the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs who will soon finalise the 
<br/>criteria and guidelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $4 million is allocated for iTaukei Land Development to have landowners 
<br/>with the development of their land for commercial purposes.  Previously, this allocation used to be 
<br/>funded under Head 50 but now we have moved this under the administration of the Ministry of the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On improving our health services and infrastructure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>the delivery of health 
<br/>services in Fiji has been far from satisfactory as I said earlier and in fact it has been in a state of decay. Over 
<br/>the years there has been a complete lack of investment in improving the infrastructure of not only the country’s 
<br/>largest hospitals like CWM and Lautoka, but all across our health facilities in Fiji. I have said this publicly 
<br/>and there is no denying that we have never had such bad health services in the independent history of our 
<br/>nation. We are going to give this the highest priority, not only in this Budget but also in all our future budgets. 
<br/>It  is  going  to  be  a  difficult  task  but  we  have  clearly  put  our  focus  on  the  maintenance  of  our  existing 
<br/>infrastructure, and overall improvements in service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  is  allocated  a  budget  of  $453.8  million,  a 
<br/>significant increase of $58.7 million from this year. The salaries and wages budget for the Ministry 
<br/>have increased to $126.4 million and will cater for:

<br/>improve 
<br/>procurement efficiency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  strengthen  capacity  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  additional  positions,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  especially  the  new  positions  of  Nursing 
<br/>Assistants and Nursing Aide will address the current capacity needs within the Ministry. The Nursing 
<br/>Assistant and Nurse Aide positions have been created to support our nurses focus on their core role, 
<br/>where these Aides and Assistants will take over the non-clinical responsibilities like bed making, 
<br/>getting the consumables and other time-consuming tasks that used to keep the nurses occupied. We 
<br/>are also providing $11.6 million for the upgrade of nurses’ salaries and overtime.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>we  are  providing  over  $63  million  for  public  health  programmes,  Emergency  Radiology  and 
<br/>Laboratory Services,  procurement of drugs, consumables, medicines and  purchase of bio-medical 
<br/>equipment and accessories.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are working together with the Ministry of Health to ensure timely and 
<br/></span><span>efficient procurement of drugs, consumables and biomedical equipment accessories. A sum of $2.5 
<br/>million is allocated for Kidney Dialysis Treatment Subsidy. The allocation has been increased by $1 
<br/>million from this year’s level to cater for the increase in the dialysis subsidy from the current $150 
<br/>per session to $180. A sum of $16.4 million is allocated for the upgrade and maintenance of urban 
<br/>hospitals and institutional quarters, permanent walkway for the maternity hospital at CWM, purchase, 
<br/>installation and replacement of ICT equipment and a major interior upgrade of Labasa Hospital.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Finance through the Strategic Planning Office will work 
<br/>closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Ministry  of  Public  Works  to  ensure  efficient  and  timely 
<br/></span><span>maintenance of our hospitals and health centres and this has been a major problem as well as assist 
<br/></span><span>in the strengthening of the Asset Management Unit of the Ministry of Health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot build new hospitals or health centres if we are not able to maintain what we have 
<br/></span><span>right now. Some of the hospitals and health centres do not need large amounts of money to upgrade. 
<br/></span><span>Some simply need a few window louvres, replacement of missing tiles, painting, roof repairs, fixing

<br/>to expand the coverage of healthcare services through an outsourcing model to engage the service of 
<br/>private general practitioner’s, dental operators and medical laboratories during the pandemic and that 
<br/>was a good initiative at that point in time. From 1st August, 2023, only patients with a combined 
<br/>household  income  of  $30,000  or  less  per  annum  can  qualify  for  the  free  services  at  the  private 
<br/>practitioners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On reshaping our Education Sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the education sector is given the highest 
<br/>allocation in this Budget to a tune of $845 million. A lot of haphazard changes and reforms without 
<br/>consultation have caused major problems within the education system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will relook at the overall education system in a 
<br/>consultative  manner,  and  we  have  already  announced,  as  you  have  heard  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  of  Education,  the  appointment  of  an  Education  Commission  and  an  Education  Summit. 
<br/>These forums will take stock of the issues and challenges in the education sector and with proper 
<br/>dialogue and expert guidance chart a way forward for future reforms to lift the standard of education 
<br/>of our children.  The world is experiencing another technological revolution with ChatGPT, Artificial 
<br/>Intelligence (AI) and robotics – yet our children and what they currently learn, are out of step.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  allocated  a  budget  of  $505.4  million,  an 
<br/>increase of $18.4 million. The salaries and wages budget for the Ministry has been increased from 
<br/>$318.1 million to $322.6 million to cater for the funding for the more than 14,000 existing teachers 
<br/>and newly  established 179 teaching  and non-teaching  positions  at  the Ministry of Education.  For 
<br/>qualification upgrade  and step movement, $8.9 million is allocated for salary upgrade of teachers 
<br/>who  have  completed  relevant  qualifications  to  move  to  a  higher  band  in  line  with  the  Teacher 
<br/>Remuneration Setting Policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  rural  and  maritime  location  allowance,  a  sum  of  $5.7  million  is 
<br/>allocated which is an increase of $1.3 million from this year’s allocation. Funding provided will cater 
<br/>for location allowances for 3,355 teachers in 921 remote schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is committed to giving free education and transport assistance to 
<br/>our ECE, primary and secondary school students with a total funding allocation of more than $100 
<br/>million.    In  addition  to  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  again  allocated  a  sum  of  $45  million  to 
<br/>continue “Back to School Support”</span><span> </span><span>of $200 per child for students from Early Childhood to Year 13 
<br/>for the school year 2024. This will benefit over 230,000 students for families with less than $50,000 
<br/></span><span>household income when they start the school at the beginning of 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of $49 million is allocated for overall maintenance and upgrade of 
<br/>schools including construction of </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> affected schools and staff quarters in Vanua Levu. We 
<br/>thank the Australian Government for the generous contribution and for the $30 million towards this 
<br/>project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Technical Education and NTPC Levy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the biggest blunder by the previous 
<br/>government was in the areas of technical education. Failed policies which led to the establishment of 
<br/></span><span>technical colleges cost the taxpayers more than $20 million. All the technical colleges were left in 
<br/></span><span>ruin.  We now have a huge responsibility, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to rebuild our technical education system 
<br/>as well as address the skills gap issue in the country. We are now going to invest in this and work 
<br/>together with existing service providers, including the newly established Pacific Polytech.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are going to revamp the apprenticeship scheme in the next few months and also review 
<br/>the NTPC levy and how best to support and fund skill upgrades in the workforce. The employers

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been suffering from this and the previous government’s hasty decision to remove the NTPC 
<br/>levy was a wrong move.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Funding  for  Higher  Education  Institutions,  Government  will  continue  providing  financial 
<br/>support to our tertiary institutions with a total funding allocation of $103.3 million. We have restored 
<br/>the grant for USP and are committed to clearing the outstanding dues, with the first $10 million paid 
<br/>as soon as we came into Government. A further $20 million is allocated towards the clearing of USPs 
<br/>outstanding grants, on top of the annual grant of $33.5 million in this Budget. In this Budget, USP 
<br/>will receive a total funding of $53.5 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National University will be provided a funding grant of $43.4 million, University of 
<br/>Fiji is provided an increased grant of $2.8 million while the newly established Pacific Polytechnic 
<br/>will  receive  a  funding  grant  of  $1.0  million  and  Sangam  Institute  of  Technology  has  its  grant 
<br/>increased from $114,000 to $614,000, an increase of half a million dollars to accommodate additional 
<br/>nursing students in light of the current shortages. Funding is also provided to Corpus Christi, Fulton 
<br/>College, Montfort Technical Institute, Montfort Boys’ Town, and Vivekananda Technical Centre.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on TELS forgiveness and scholarships, let me now move to TELS debt, the 
<br/>forgiveness and tertiary scholarship funding.  Our critics including the Opposition sitting right here 
<br/>had said that we cannot do this. As we had promised, I would like to confirm that all outstanding 
<br/>TELS debt is being forgiven by the Coalition Government. Let me repeat, Mr. Speaker Sir, all TELS 
<br/>debt  (excluding in  service training) to  a tune of  $650 million,  owed by 53,725 students  who had 
<br/>studied under the TELS Scheme is now written off and none of these 53,725 TELS recipients, their 
<br/>parents, guardians and families will have to pay a single cent back to the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, to ensure that these students serve the nation and do justice to the taxpayers as used 
<br/>to be the practice in the past, they will have to serve a bond.  The bond service will be years of study 
<br/>multiplied by one point five for these graduates.  Those who choose not to serve the bond will have 
<br/>to pay the equivalent cost amount.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, we will provide all eligible students with scholarships under the rebranded 
<br/>Fijian Scholarship Scheme on merit with a total budget of $148.2 million in this Budget.  This will 
<br/>cater for the scholarships of 8,720 new students and funding needed for the 9,148 existing students.  
<br/>Eligibility marks will be based on labour market needs and enrolment capacities of the universities 
<br/>and  their  own  criteria.    The  bonding  for  new  students  under  this  Scheme  will  be  years  of  study 
<br/>multiplied by one and a half times if tuition only, and years of study multiplied by two times if tuition 
<br/></span><span>and allowance is paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  allowances,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  students  under  merit-based  scholarship  will  be 
<br/>eligible for $3,400 per semester, effective from 1st January, 2024.  All students under scholarships 
<br/>other than merit based will receive $2,500 per semester if they study at campus away from home, 
<br/>and $1,500 for home-based campuses.</span><span> </span><span>The full details, eligibility and the selection criteria handbook 
<br/>will  be  available  from  TSLS  soon.    In  the  next  academic  year,  a  new  initiative  by  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government  will  set  aside  three  PhDs,  and  five  Masters  by  Research  Awards  for  study  at  New 
<br/>Zealand universities.  The total PhDs and Masters allocation remains 10 and 20 respectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), in the last eight years, a total of around $3.1 billion was spent 
<br/>by Fiji Roads Authority without any strategic plan, without much priority and without proper costing.  
<br/>This,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  compromised  the  standard  of  infrastructure  including  roads  and  led  to 
<br/>significant  wastage of public funds.  We are going  to  change the approach towards the planning, 
<br/>construction and maintenance of our roads.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to do more with less money.  We need to improve the value for money as there has 
<br/>been a lot of wastage and funding of what I call “novelty type” over designed expensive roads in Fiji.  
<br/>The  new  FRA  Board  is  fully  in  sync  with  this,  and  they  have  been  working  closely  with  the 
<br/>Government  to  rethink  some  of  the  scoping  and  design  works,  rethink  about  the  modalities  of 
<br/>awarding road contracts, including closer monitoring and supervision of contractors.  There is also a 
<br/>need to open up and encourage the participation of local contractors through direct contracting for 
<br/>smaller contracts.  For the next fiscal year, the FRA is allocated a budget of $387.6 million which 
<br/>comprises $14.7 million for operations and $372.9 million for capital expenditures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, major emphasis is being placed on the need to ensure adequate maintenance 
<br/>of Fiji’s road network and as such, an increased allocation of $100.6 million is allocated for road 
<br/>maintenance, $42 million for completed maintenance and emergency works, $60 million is provided 
<br/>for the renewal and resurfacing of roads, $35.4 million is allocated for completion of the ongoing 
<br/>bridge projects, $18.3 million for the rural roads programme, $13.2 million for the upgrade of Queen 
<br/>Elizabeth  Drive,  and  $82.2  million  for  the  Transport  Infrastructure  Investment  Sector  Project 
<br/>financed through the Asian Development Bank and World Bank loans of US$100 million and US$50 
<br/>million, respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Service and Transport is being allocated a sum of 
<br/>$98.3  million.    The  Coalition  Government  has  re-established  the  Public  Works  Department  to 
<br/>improve the state of rural  roads around the  country with  an initial  setup cost  of $5 million.   The 
<br/>Government  maintains  the  commitment  towards  achieving  100  percent  access  to  affordable  and 
<br/>reliable sources of energy.  A sum of $4.1 million is allocated for the completion of 111 grid extension 
<br/>schemes by Energy Fiji Limited.  Additionally, the Department of Energy will continue to facilitate 
<br/>house wiring connections for completed grid extension projects with a budget provision of $3 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture, Mr. Speaker Sir, we know that it plays an important role towards food security, 
<br/>income generation, employment, rural development and economic diversification.  We want to make 
<br/>agriculture a significant pillar of the diversification of our economy.   The Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>and Waterways, therefore, has been allocated a budget of $95.2 million in this Budget, which is a 
<br/>major increase of $37.3 million.  We have a Minister for Agriculture who understands, he has the 
<br/>experience,  and  I  am  very  confident  that  with  this  increased  budget,  we  will  see  a  significant 
<br/>improvement in the productivity within the agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  total  sum  of  $13.9  million  is  allocated  to  fund  the  Agricultural  Marketing  Authority, 
<br/>Committee on the Better Utilisation of Land and commercial agriculture development.  Sir, $47.5 
<br/></span><span>million  is  provided  for  the  Crops  and  Livestock  Research  and  Extension  Services  to  strengthen 
<br/></span><span>agricultural productivity.  For the first time, we are providing weedicide and fertiliser subsidy for 
<br/>non-sugar  crops,  such  as  rice,  ginger,  </span><span>dalo</span><span>,  and  cassava  with  a  funding  of  $1  million  to  boost 
<br/>production of these crops.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  dairy  industry,  Sir,  was  another  big  disaster  and  failure  of  policy  by  the  previous 
<br/>Government, and the dairy industry is on the verge of collapse.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, $5 million is being 
<br/>allocated to Fiji Co-operative Dairy Company Limited and for dairy extension programme but there 
<br/>will be a major review of the industry to understand how we can invest more and take the industry 
<br/></span><span>forward.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, $5.3 million is being allocated for farm access roads, provision of tractors, 
<br/></span><span>and existing agricultural offices and quarters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Waterways is being allocated a budget of $22.1 million to improve the 
<br/>drainage system  around  the country which is  also  in  a very bad shape.   To improve the drainage 
<br/>schemes which has been neglected over so many years, a total of $16.2 million is allocated.  This 
<br/>will cater for major river dredging, coastal erosion protection, watershed management and will cater

<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Government has allocated a sum of $3 million to assist those Fijians 
<br/>whose properties has been damaged and affected by termites in the Western and Northern Divisions.  
<br/>This is one problem that somehow totally scathed the attention of the previous government.  This 
<br/>problem is a serious one now.  What we have done, we have allocated a sum of $3 million to assist 
<br/>those Fijians families whose properties have been damaged and affected by termites in the Western 
<br/>and  Norther  Divisions.    The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  release  more  details  on  the  roll  out  of  this 
<br/>initiative soon.  The honourable Assistant Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and the honourable 
<br/>Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation are heading a task force on looking 
<br/>at how best we can deal with this problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Biosecurity  Authority  of  Fiji  (BAF)  supports  Fiji’s  agricultural  produce  exporters  by 
<br/>providing  information,  inspection  and  certification  to  meet  the  import  requirements  of  overseas 
<br/>countries.  Moving forward, BAF and Ministry of Agriculture need to work together to create farmer 
<br/>awareness  (such  as  farmer  outreach  activities)  of  the  list  of  agricultural  produce  under  current 
<br/>pathways and market access, support market access negotiations and retention of such markets and 
<br/>new export pathways are developed and adopted.  The Strategic Planning Office within the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance will coordinate this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry, the sugar industry is almost near 
<br/>collapse and not much attention was paid by the previous government to revive the industry.  Despite 
<br/>all  the  talk  that  we  had  and  spending  millions  of  dollars  on  paying  salaries  of  CEOs  and  other 
<br/>executive management by the previous government, we have not been able to revamp the industry.  
<br/>The new honourable Minister for Sugar is on to the industry in a determined manner.  A thorough 
<br/>review and assessment on the industry is required and will be undertaken.  The Ministry of Finance 
<br/>through the Planning Office will be working with the Ministry of Sugar, to begin work on a Sugar 
<br/>Industry Strategic Plan soon and to find out the flash points and obstacles that have been there for 
<br/>the industry to be revived once again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry is being allocated a sum of $51.7 
<br/>million  in the new financial year, of which $49.7 million  is  for the Sugar Unit.   With the aim to 
<br/>increase cane production from 1.6 million tonnes to about 1.9 million tonnes, ideally 2 million tonnes 
<br/>by 2024, a sum of $11 million is  being allocated for Sugar Development and Farmers Assistance 
<br/>Programme, New Farmers and Lease Premium Assistance, Fertiliser and Weedicide Subsidy, Farm 
<br/>Incentive Programmes and Cage Bins. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue with the guaranteed price of $85 per tonne and this is the 
<br/>first time, already the full $85 guaranteed price has been paid to the farmers, in fact, more than the 
<br/>guaranteed price and we still have one payment left per tonne with an allocation of $4 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Frequent rain  and flooding have been the major problems faced by the sugar industry and 
<br/>drainage systems in the sugarcane areas and have been neglected or had very minimum maintenance 
<br/>in the last several years.  A sum of $5.5 million is allocated for the drainage for sugarcane farms in 
<br/>the next financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is  undertaking  a thorough review of the responsibilities for 
<br/>Multi-Ethnic Affairs in the area of culture, language, history and arts and will also be responsible for 
<br/>the Girmit commemorations from next year. A sum of $500,000 is being allocated for the preparatory 
<br/>works for gas crematorium for Navua, two sites in the Western Division and one in the Northern 
<br/>Division.

<br/>programme, multi-species hatchery, construction of ice plants and the supply of tilapia fingerlings 
<br/>and prawn frys to farmers in the Western Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the reforestation of degraded forests with indigenous and other species, a sum of $2.5 
<br/>million  is  allocated.  The  funding  allocated  will  be  used  to  address  challenges  and  to  ensure  the 
<br/>survival  of  trees  planted  by  extensive  monitoring,  undertaking  beat  up,  enhancing  quality  seed 
<br/>collection, propagation and planting protocols.  A sum of $2 million is also allocated for the Redd+ 
<br/>and Forest Emissions Reduction Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is being allocated a budget of 
<br/>$30.1 million to enable the Ministry to continue effectively and efficiently administer and regulate 
<br/>the land and mineral resource sector.  The honourable Minister, I am sure, will provide more details 
<br/>on the activities of the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, Mr. Speaker Sir, is being allocated a sum of $52.3 
<br/>million in this Budget.  Tourism Fiji is allocated an operating grant of $7 million and to support new 
<br/>marketing strategies, an increased Marketing Grant from the previous allocation of $30 million is 
<br/>provided in the new financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new honourable Minister for Tourism is on top of the activities within 
<br/>the tourism industry and we are confident that under his leadership the tourism industry will remain 
<br/>a very significant part of our economy for the future.  A new $US200 million World Bank-funded 
<br/>Fiji Tourism Development Programme in Vanua Levu has been approved this week by the World 
<br/>Bank Board.  This new project’s financing of US$61.5 million for the first phase is part of a larger 
<br/>US$200 million package approved for the 10-Year multi-stage tourism programme for Vanua Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A sum of $5 million is being allocated in the next financial year for the Ministry of Tourism 
<br/>to support the implementation of the project. The first phase of the programme focuses on bolstering 
<br/>tourism  in  Vanua  Levu,  including  Taveuni,  by  improving  drainage,  sewage,  and  transport 
<br/>infrastructure, including upgrade of Labasa and Savusavu domestic airports, as well as an upgrade 
<br/>of the 95 kilometre road connecting the two towns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry  of  Trade,  Co-operatives  &amp;  Small  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  is 
<br/>working  towards  strengthening  Fiji’s  position  as  the  economic  and  international  trade  hub  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Pacific  and  will  focus  on  strengthening  and  supporting  the  growth  of  Micro,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/></span><span>Enterprises (MSME) and Co-operatives. As such, the Ministry is allocated a budget of $116.5 million 
<br/>in the next financial year, an increase of $25.3 million from this year’s allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A sum of $9 million is allocated to continue with the development and implementation of an 
<br/>online business and construction business licensing system for the Ease of Doing Business, and the 
<br/>rollout of the 16 agency Ease of Doing business processes which will fully digitise the Starting a 
<br/>Business and Obtaining Construction Permits processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, a sum of $2.5 million is allocated for the Northern Development Programme, 
<br/></span><span>National  Export  Strategy,  Integrated  Human  Resource  Development  Programme,  Trade 
<br/>Enhancement Programme and to assist those with trade skills to enhance their business potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Youth and Sports, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  sports plays a key  role in building  social 
<br/>cohesion and improving Fiji’s image globally.  The Ministry of Youth and Sports is allocated a sum 
<br/>of $19.5 million in the 2023-2024 Budget.

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A sum of $9.7 million is allocated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for overseas sporting tours including the 
<br/>2024 Island Pacific Games, Commonwealth Games, the Rugby World Cup, operations of the Fiji 
<br/>National  Sports Commission,  engagement of sports coaches, hosting  international  tournaments in 
<br/>Fiji, Sports Outreach Programmes, Sports Scholarships and sports grant for persons with disability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>rural and outer island development is one of the top priorities of the Coalition Government as well.  
<br/>We are committed to bridging the development gap between the rural and urban areas.  The Ministry 
<br/>of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management is allocated a sum of $29.1 million 
<br/>to  support  Grant  to  Self  Help  projects,  Community  Access  Roads,  Footpaths  and  Footbridges 
<br/>projects, rural housing and urgent upgrade and renovation of existing divisional quarters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  district  advisory  councillors  and  the  district  chairpersons  play  an 
<br/>important role, serving as a link between the government and the people at the grassroot and provide 
<br/>development  management  link  between  the  communities  and  the  government.  The  advisory 
<br/>councillors allowance has been reviewed and will be increased from $172.50 to $200 per month for 
<br/>the  302  advisory  councillors  whereas  monthly  allowance  for  the  16  district  chairpersons  will  be 
<br/>increased from $207 to $220 for which a sum of around $770,000 is allocated in this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affordable  and  Decent  Housing  for  All,  the  Coalition  Government’s  vision  is  to  provide 
<br/>affordable and decent housing for all communities by 2032 and is aimed at supporting families that 
<br/>struggle to find housing due to rising land and house prices.  The Ministry of Housing is allocated a 
<br/>sum of $25.7 million in the Budget to support the housing sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue with the regularization of informal settlements 
<br/>that will provide long term housing lease to households residing in informal settlements. A budget 
<br/>of  $10  million  is  allocated  that  will  facilitate  the  commencement  of  capital  works  at  Sakoca  in 
<br/>Nasinu, Tavela in Nadi, Field 4 and Tore in Lautoka and preparatory works for nine settlements in 
<br/>Lovu Seaside, Nabare, Delaisaweni in Lautoka, Valewaquyaya in Ba, Vunika in Labasa, Caubati in 
<br/>Nasinu, Wakanisila in Nasinu, Sasawira in Nausori and Nadonumai in Lami.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To encourage home ownership by assisting eligible recipients to purchase or construct their 
<br/>homes, the Government will continue to support the First Home Purchase Programme with a budget 
<br/>of $5 million to target beneficiaries with a combined household income below $50,000 per annum. 
<br/>A grant of $15,000 is available for the purchase of an existing house or unit and $30,000 is provided 
<br/>to  build  a  new  house  or  unit.    For  beneficiaries  with  a  combined  income  between  $50,000  to 
<br/></span><span>$100,000,  the  Government  has  allocated  a  budget  of  $1.5  million  to  support  first  time  home 
<br/></span><span>ownership with a grant of $5,000 if they buy an existing house or unit and $20,000 to build a new 
<br/>house or unit will be provided.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Public Private Partnership (PPP) affordable housing project, a sum of $2 million is 
<br/>allocated for the preparatory works. The PPP project will steadily realise the Government’s vision to 
<br/>provide  over  3,200  affordable  and  high-quality  housing  units  for  Fijian  families.  I  must  say  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  the  preparatory  work  of  this  project  was  started  by  the  previous  government.    The 
<br/>Project is re-shaping the housing sector and will build a new housing market where more ordinary 
<br/></span><span>families can afford to own a home, own a strata title and/or rent properties at affordable rates. We 
<br/></span><span>are currently working with International Finance Corporation (IFC) to finalise the bidding documents 
<br/>for the tender which is expected to be advertised by August 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also discussed this with the banks, and they are eager to participate in supporting 
<br/>the Government with this project by making finance eligible to strata title owners based on their own 
<br/>criteria.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also being informed that a few of the banks have now launched a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1033 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>new product (at least one bank) that has provided me in written to provide credit for agreement-to-
<br/>lease properties and associated costs of surveying, registration and conveyancing fees. This will be a 
<br/>major change by the banks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where they will provide loans for people who have just 
<br/>agreement-to-lease so that they can develop, have it surveyed and get a proper title.  This will be an 
<br/>added boost to the formalization of housing in informal settlements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Local Government is being allocated a sum of $29.3 million in this Budget.  The 
<br/>Coalition Government has already announced that all towns and city councils will now have elected 
<br/>councillors. I am pleased to announce that the Government is firmly focused on facilitating council 
<br/>elections next year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A sum of $3.9 million is being allocated for the new Savusavu Market, around $1 million for 
<br/>the  new  Nakasi  Market,  $100,000  for  the  preparatory  works  for  the  Dreketi  Mini-Market,  $1.3 
<br/>million for the completion of Levuka Market, $3.5 million for the completion of Govind Park and 
<br/>$4.6 million for the completion of Lautoka Swimming Pool.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, both Govind Park and Lautoka Swimming Pool projects were very badly 
<br/>managed, and it was turning out to be a disaster. Government is now left with no option but to provide 
<br/>additional funding to complete these projects with increased cost. We will ensure that the project gets 
<br/>completed in the new financial year and a review will be undertaken by the Ministry of Finance to 
<br/>look at how the projects were implemented, value for money assessment and reasons for the failure 
<br/>of the projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support our Drua Team, we are allocating $1 million for procurement of 
<br/>enhanced  equipment  and  services  required  to  deliver  international  quality  broadcast  required  for 
<br/>Drua’s participation in Super Rugby and other international matches.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Finance is provided a total budget of $89.5 million including an increased 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grant of $45.5 million to the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Finance,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  modernizing  its  systems  and  processes  and  has 
<br/>embarked  on  a  significant  IT  project  to  replace  the  current  Financial  Management  Information 
<br/>System (FMIS) which is almost 20 years old. Under this project, the payroll system which again is a 
<br/>major risk for Government and the Ministry of Finance will also be replaced and integrated with the 
<br/>FMIS. We thank the Asian Development Bank for their invaluable technical support in this transition. 
<br/>A sum of $14 million is allocated for the new system. Apart from this, $2 million is allocated to 
<br/></span><span>complete the implementation of a new Budget Software System. Mr. Speaker, at this day and age, 
<br/></span><span>most of the things in terms of Budget preparation is done manually.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  re-establishment  of  the  Strategic  Planning  Office  will  ensure  better 
<br/>coordination and formulation of a strategic and robust development agenda. The Strategic Planning 
<br/>Office in  fact  previously, Mr. Speaker, we always used to  have a dedicated Ministry of  National 
<br/>Planning.  This  Strategic  Planning  Office  will  help  formulate  a  new  national  development  plan, 
<br/>strengthen the policy and planning within Government, improve coordination among ministries and 
<br/>departments,  appraisal  and  selection  of  public  investment  projects,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of 
<br/></span><span>projects, improve coordination of development projects across Government and strengthen national 
<br/></span><span>workforce planning and economic intelligence analysis. A sum of $3.4 million is allocated for the 
<br/>operations of the office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is working towards strengthening the Fiji Bureau of Statistics with 
<br/>the review of the Statistics Act to give them more autonomy and to ensure that the Statistics Office 
<br/>is well equipped to provide timely and reliable statistics including providing ethnic data as well. A

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget of $7.6 million is provided to the Fiji Bureau of Statistics which includes $2.4 million to cover 
<br/>the most of the 2023-2024 Employment and Unemployment Survey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $36 million is provided for vehicle leasing which is under a comprehensive 
<br/>review  to  determine  the  cost-effective  way  forward  for  Government  to  acquire  the  fleet  and  its 
<br/>management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Civil Service is allocated a sum of $50.6 million in the next financial year. 
<br/>An  Establishment  Support  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  to  ensure  decisions  on  the 
<br/>management of the Ministry’s establishment are transparent, accountable and consistent with good 
<br/>principles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to this, a Shared Services Agreement Policy will be developed in consultation with 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance and implemented to ensure that where possible, ministries and departments 
<br/>are efficiently utilising existing human resources across the common cadres. This will contribute to 
<br/>easier transfers of the staff between ministries allowing for the sharing of knowledge and information 
<br/>in the Civil Service. This used to be done very effectively and efficiently in the past, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Office Space Rental, a sum of $34.5 million is allocated to facilitate the monthly rentals 
<br/>to  landlords  for  the  properties  leased  by  various  ministries  and  departments  and  $3  million  is 
<br/>allocated for the renovation and maintenance of Government quarters and public buildings in this 
<br/>project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration  is  allocated  a  budget  of  $12.4  million.  The 
<br/>Ministry  will  undertake  a  holistic  national  security  defense  review  including  development  of  a 
<br/>security strategy and associated legislative reforms to strengthen national security.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Immigration Department Services have to be improved significantly to build capabilities 
<br/>in addressing immigration-related crimes including human trafficking and streamlining processes to 
<br/>support the private sector and improve the daily experiences of our citizens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Immigration Office is provided with additional 23 new positions to ensure that the service 
<br/>delivery is improved. For the digitisation and modernisation of immigration systems and processes, 
<br/>a funding support of $1.1 million is provided through the Australian Government as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A sum of $1.5 million is allocated for procurement of passports while $300,000 is allocated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the installation of ePassport kits in Immigration Offices and Overseas Missions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  continues  to  maintain  its  foreign  relations  with  more  than  182  countries.  Under  the 
<br/>leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, there has been renewed interest and engagement and 
<br/>sense of optimism and enthusiasm from our regional and international partners. We need to continue 
<br/>enhancing foreign relations, promoting Fiji’s foreign policy initiatives, advancing Fiji’s leadership 
<br/>in the global arena, improving trade performance and maintaining Fiji as a modern hub of the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To further enhance our diplomatic and international relations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sum of $4 
<br/></span><span>million is allocated for the startup costs associated with the re-opening of Fiji Overseas Missions in 
<br/>Washington, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea and setup of a new Embassy in Israel; $2.2 million is 
<br/>allocated for the refurbishment of overseas missions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Prime Minister is provided with a budget of $50.8 million. This funding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will also cater for the Climate Change Division, Department of Environment, Department of

<div><span>Office of the Attorney-General, the Coalition Government, Mr. Speaker, has re-established 
<br/>the  Fiji  Law  Reform  Commission  which  has  not  been  fully  functional  since  2006  and  currently 
<br/>operates as part of the Legal Drafting Department in the Solicitor-General’s Office. The Commission 
<br/>was initially established by legislation in  1979 under the  Fiji  Law Reform  Commission  Act.  The 
<br/>Commission used to undertake systematic review, reforms and development of laws to make them 
<br/>simple, modern and relevant.  Plus, Mr. Speaker, the Fiji Law Reform Commission had the expertise 
<br/>to consult widely and to advice Government on good laws. So, we have allocated a sum of $400,000 
<br/>in this Budget for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independent Bodies, the Government, Mr. Speaker, is assisting with the review of the Audit 
<br/>Act  to  strengthen the Office of the Auditor-General  and make it more independent.  A sum  of $7 
<br/>million is provided to the Office of the Auditor-General in this Budget. To fasttrack the audit backlog 
<br/>which has been an issue over the years, the Auditor-General is provided a new allocation of $722,000 
<br/>for outsourcing some of its audits so that we can bring up to speed all the outstanding audits that need 
<br/>to be done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An independent and well-resourced judiciary is critical for a well-functioning democracy and 
<br/>a good economy. As such, a sum of $50 million is provided towards the funding of our judiciary in 
<br/>this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Parliament is being allocated a sum of $16.3 million, an increase of $7.7 million. 
<br/>This includes $4.4 million for the purchase of equipment and upgrade of the broadcast system which 
<br/>will include a multi-language captioning to enable our Parliament to be more inclusive and increase 
<br/>citizen engagement in our three key languages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total sum of $35.5 million is being allocated to the Independent Commissions. We are now 
<br/>strengthening and tightening the processes and reporting mechanisms for the independent  bodies, 
<br/>commissions  and  statutory  authorities.  Over  the  years,  there  has  been  serious  lack  of  timely 
<br/>submission of annual reports, detailed expenditure breakdowns and utilization reports by many of 
<br/>these institutions. This is not the standard of proper accountability that we expect of independent 
<br/>bodies, and we hope that with appropriate allocation of budget, this will improve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Justice has been allocated a sum of $5.4 million.  The availability of timely and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>efficient access to justice, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is critical to social and economic development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  support  access  to  justice,  the  Ministry  will  be  undertaking  digitization  works  in 
<br/>consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Communications  and  other  relevant  key 
<br/>stakeholders on its legal registries and upon the completion of the digitization, most of the services 
<br/>will be provided online. This will improve efficiency and administration of justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Registrar of Titles is  being  allocated 13 additional positions to  improve 
<br/>service delivery and meet increased customer demand for the services. This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has 
<br/>been a constant source of complaint from the business community as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service (FCS), Mr. Speaker, Sir, is being allocated a sum of $47 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirty new positions with an allocation of $550,000 is being funded in the new financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A sum of $4.2 million is being allocated to cater for food rations for inmates occupied in penal 
<br/>institutions and for the Rehabilitation and Yellow Ribbon Programme to support the rehabilitation 
<br/>programmes for the inmates.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commencement of the construction of the new Supervisor’s Office at Labasa Corrections 
<br/>Centre; 
<br/>Phase 2 upgrade works for Nasinu Cemetery and Phase 4 works for Suva Cemetery; 
<br/>construction of retaining wall (Gabion) at Levuka Corrections Centre; 
<br/>construction of boundary fence for Nasinu Corrections Centre and boundary fence for Suva 
<br/>Women's Corrections Centre; and  
<br/>upgrade  and  maintenance  of  institutional  buildings  and  repair  and  maintenance  of 
<br/>institutional quarters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Police Force has been allocated a sum of $183.7 million. The Force, Mr. Speaker, is 
<br/>increasingly focussed on preventing cybercrimes and combating the distribution and use of illegal 
<br/>drugs. The Force will receive an additional 100 Police Constables, to boost its operations, for which 
<br/>a sum of $2.3 million is being allocated in the Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  improve  police  visibility,  $700,000  is  being  allocated  to  strengthen,  what  we  call,  the 
<br/>Police Beat Patrol in both urban and rural areas.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a new initiative for crime 
<br/>prevention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, the previous Government had constructed new police stations 
<br/>which has cost close to $100 million, while many existing police stations, quarters and posts were 
<br/>neglected. With the focus on maintenance and bringing our infrastructure to a better standard, $3 
<br/>million is being allocated for the renovation and upgrade of Police quarters and posts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we also acknowledge the important role that the Republic of Fiji Military 
<br/>Forces (RFMF) plays in maintaining the security, defence, and supporting peace efforts around the 
<br/>world.  In this Budget, the RFMF is being allocated a sum of $103.1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me,  Mr.  Speaker,  now  cover  some  ground  before  I  finish,  on  future  economic  policy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>measures, particularly in the area of economic growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  came  into  office  six  months  ago,  into  an  economic  environment  which  might  best  be 
<br/>called a policy-free zone. The budgeting and economic policy sphere was secret.  No one, except 
<br/>some people, knew what was happening or what was planned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Criticism of government policy was silenced.  Many people with an interest in contributing 
<br/></span><span>to economic policy had simply given up. Every National Budget was anxiously awaited, with no one 
<br/>knowing what surprises would come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the Coalition Government we have tried to be different. We, and our advisers, 
<br/>have been open about  our thinking.  Our honourable Prime Minister, Deputy  Prime Ministers and 
<br/>Ministers have been open about our thinking.  We have put our thoughts into the public space. We 
<br/>have learned from the criticism and feedback we have received, including those from the Opposition. 
<br/>We have shared our economic decision-making with the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have talked about this many times in Opposition. Over the last 10 years, 
<br/>Fiji has slumped badly on all indicators of the ease of doing business.  But instead of listening to the 
<br/>concerns of investors, the previous Government just blamed everyone else for the bad numbers. So, 
<br/>what will we do differently?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1037 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone talks about improving the business environment, but sooner or later, we have to get 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down to some key issues and processes. What are those?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us first look at the issues that we want to build and invest and, that is, physical capital.  
<br/>Foreign investors wanting to acquire or even lease relatively small areas of land are already frustrated 
<br/>by the slow processing of applications under the Land Sales Act. We need to look at the processes 
<br/>under the State Lands Act, which prevents us from leasing Government land effectively for economic 
<br/>purposes. This includes foreshore leases which are often critical for tourism and similar activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be carefully reviewing processes in both, the Department of Environment and the 
<br/>Department  of  Town  and  Country  Planning,  which  interacts  with  Local  Governments  on  town 
<br/>planning issues. These are the critical agencies to ensure that we process building and development 
<br/>applications in an orderly and planned way. The processes are bureaucratic and need simplifications. 
<br/>We will soon be setting up a working group to advance this process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  a  lot  of  complaints  from  developers  about  access  to  electricity.    So,  we  will  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>zeroing in on this, to identify where the problems are and develop solutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the supply side of energy, Fiji is well off its targets for renewable energy development. 
<br/>We need to urgently ramp up our renewable energy generating capacity. We need to get the right 
<br/>stakeholders together – the renewables suppliers, Energy Fiji Limited (EFL), the Fiji Competition 
<br/>and Consumer Commission (FCCC) and others – to act urgently on this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also need to address the needs of businesses in their daily operations. At this point, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are focused on three issues below.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>As we battle the loss of skills to overseas countries, we have continued to complicate life 
<br/>for local businesses needing to import skills, both short and long-term. This includes, the 
<br/>Immigration Department where - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we believe we can spend a little bit more money on personnel and systems to make 
<br/>the work permit process work more efficiently.  
<br/>we  believe  there  is  scope  to  increase  fees  charged  by  the  Department  and  the 
<br/>economic payback for Government can be very good.  
<br/>we have already taken some steps to ease the pressure on the grant of short-term work 
<br/>permits.  
<br/></span><span>we will also look at wider immigration law reforms which will align Fiji better in the 
<br/></span><span>global economy, and which will take advantage of the increasing mobility of people 
<br/>and economic capital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, we will be setting up another working group on this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>We know that many businesses, large and small, are frustrated by the time it takes them to 
<br/>get routine offshore payments through the exchange control and tax clearance processes 
<br/>between the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) and Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS). 
<br/></span><span>These  two  entities  must  work  together  to  ensure  that  there  is  more  flexibility  in  the 
<br/></span><span>processes that are there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Businesses of all sizes complain repeatedly about the time and bureaucracy involved in 
<br/>simple  periodic  regulatory  process,  such  as  the  National  Fire  Authority,  Occupational 
<br/></span><span>Health and Safety checks, liquor licensing and health inspections.  And I am pleased to say 
<br/></span><span>that the Ministry of Trade under the leadership of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Minister for Trade is already working on this, and an IFC-supported project is now in 
<br/>progress to reform these processes.  I think that will produce some significant results.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are some of the few initiatives on which we are working on, and these 
<br/>are the ones to which different Ministries will give priority to in the next six months, in partnership 
<br/>with other stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  realise  I  have  been  almost  two  hours  on  my  feet,  monopolising  your 
<br/>attention.   I can only thank you for all your patience.  In closing, I think we can all agree that this is 
<br/>a tough,  but  a fair budget  – absolutely a fair and a balanced Budget! We have tried to  look  after 
<br/>everyone within the tight financial resources and fiscal constraints.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The road ahead will not be easy, but we are hopeful that we have laid down in this Budget 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>today will be strong foundation for future recovery growth and prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have laid out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how we intend to raise revenue, despite our grave economic 
<br/>woes by instituting fiscal restraint and discipline.  I have also laid down measures that will address 
<br/>the challenges of rising cost of living and social protection provisions for our most vulnerable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, with this Budget, we can start climbing out of our cycle of debt if we stay on 
<br/>course with this pathway and stay disciplined.  From a debt to GDP ratio of almost 90 percent in the 
<br/>July 2022 fiscal year, we want to drop that to 79 percent debt to GDP ratio by July 2024, and sink 
<br/>that further down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to under 60 percent by 2030.  Once we get down to under 60 
<br/>percent debt to GDP ratio, only then can we have more space for actual progressive spending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  concurrence  of  Cabinet,  I  commend  this  Budget  to  this  august 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation)

<div><span>[A Bill to appropriate a sum of Three Billion, Seven Hundred and Sixty One  Million, Nine 
<br/>Hundred  and  Seventy  Nine  Thousand,  Four  Hundred  and  Four  Dollars,  for  the  ordinary
