<h3>DEBATE ON THE 2023-2024 APPROPRIATION BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>DEBATE ON THE 2023-2024 APPROPRIATION BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That a Bill to appropriate a sum of Three Billion, Seven Hundred and Sixty One Million, 
<br/>Nine Hundred and Seventy Nine Thousand, Four Hundred and Four Dollars, for the ordinary 
<br/>services of Government for the year ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2024, be read a second time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that the honourable Leader of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition is very keen to begin so I will let him have the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate.  We will first hear 
<br/>the response from the honourable Shadow Minister of Finance, after which we will continue with the 
<br/>order of speakers as listed in the Batting Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; </span><span>ni 
<br/>bula vinaka saka</span><span> and a very good morning to you all. I also greet all Fijians who are listening in and 
<br/>all those who are sitting here in the gallery this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  with  much  honour  and  privilege  that  I  present  to  Parliament  our 
<br/>response and to begin the debate on the 2023-2024 National Budget. Undoubtedly, this is a critical 
<br/></span><span>time in Fiji’s history for a number of reasons.  Therefore, the choices and decisions we take at crucial 
<br/></span><span>times as such, are important and not to be taken lightly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why is that, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Simply because our decisions as leaders have implications 
<br/>which can be good or otherwise.  I will make my contribution in the same sequence, as presented by 
<br/>the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics so as to correct the many fallacies in his statement, and I will try to be 
<br/>brief as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in setting the scene, the honourable Minister started off by referring again 
<br/></span><span>to the 2022 General Elections where people voted for a change. According to the honourable Minister 
<br/>they wanted a democracy that exists not on paper but in practice.  They want respect for human rights, 
<br/>media freedom, rule of law and good governance.  They want water in their taps and better health 
<br/>facilities.  They want better roads, undisrupted electricity and improved transportation.  They want 
<br/>their children to get better education, affordable housing and improvement in living standards and 
<br/>better paid jobs.  There is nothing in this list that we have not already addressed.  This was very well
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1047 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said by the honourable Minister of Finance, but the Government now faces the hard reality that it is 
<br/>easily said than done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last six months have given us a glimpse of the change that they promised and they, as a 
<br/>Government, are bringing in, contrary to what has been said, what we have seen in the last six months 
<br/>is  quite  worrying.    Common  ones  are  the  deterioration  in  the  respect  for  the  rule  of  law  and 
<br/>constitutionalism, appointments of senior civil servants, board membership and quality of service 
<br/>delivery and leadership.  Sad to say that we have to prepare for the worst that is yet to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government needs to be reminded that democracy is not only about 
<br/>winning elections, but also about respecting the rule of law, constitutionalism, principles, ethics and 
<br/>values, service delivery and good leadership.  This is why FijiFirst is still the largest single party in 
<br/>this Parliament.  Through its visionary leadership, Fiji  has seen the most extensive developments 
<br/>never  experienced  before  in  its  early  history.    It  is  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  the  incoming 
<br/>government  to  continue  with  the  development  work  undertaken  previously,  whether  it  be  water, 
<br/>electricity, education, housing, health services, et cetera.  Much of this is dependent on the state of 
<br/>the  economy  and  the  Government’s  ability  to  create  the  environment,  not  only  for  stability,  but 
<br/>growth, development, employment creation and improved living conditions.  Again, it is everyone’s 
<br/>expectation that the Government will provide these for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then the honourable Minister went on to say what has changed.  He spoke about delivering 
<br/>the budget on time, and I do acknowledge him for that.  Thank you, honourable Minister.  However, 
<br/>what is disappointing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that it is taking Government well over four months to fill 
<br/>the two FijiFirst parliamentary seats vacated in February this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I say again, four months!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  these  two  Members  are  not  sworn  in  during  this  sitting,  they  will  have  to  wait  till  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>September sitting; that will be over six months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- This is an affront to representative democracy.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>by  not  allowing  the  full  Opposition  to  participate  in  Parliament  debate  and  vote,  the  Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government has completely undermined democracy.  What are they afraid of?  Are they not confident 
<br/></span><span>enough about their budget and deliberately keeping out two seats vacant?  What is more important 
<br/>are overseas travels and meetings or our national priorities, in particular, representative democracy.  
<br/>I  hope  that  the  honourable  Minister  can  commit  to  his  statement  made  during  the  2018  Budget 
<br/>Debate, and I quote; “We will be cutting Ministerial salaries and allowances.”  We will come back 
<br/>to that, but listen; “We will be cutting out the international conferences and jet-setting, we will keep 
<br/>Ministers at home to focus on making life better for the Fijians.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Complete opposite.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That should start with the honourable Prime Minister. What have 
<br/>we inherited?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government should stop making excuses and carry on with the 
<br/>job.  The honourable Minister then talked about a few uncomfortable facts.  Firstly, he stated that we 
<br/>are a six-month-old Government that had walked into a deeply grim state of affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Very true.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- What is this grim state of affairs that the Government is referring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1048 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA- Debt (</span><span>dinau</span><span>).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my response to His Excellency, the President’s 
<br/>Address during the 2023 Parliament opening, I stated and may I repeat today, that we, following the 
<br/>conduct of the 2022 General Elections have handed over a better Fiji than the one we inherited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  is  inheriting  a  far 
<br/>better Fiji from where it was whether they want it eight years or 16 years ago.  We are handing over 
<br/>to you not a perfect, but a better Fiji than the one we inherited.  That is our legacy which we are 
<br/>indeed proud of, and the expectation is for the new Government to continue and make it even better.  
<br/>Let me explain what qualifies me to say that we have handed over a better Fiji.  Again, I am going to 
<br/>repeat myself, first, the 2013 Constitution and the rule of law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2013 Constitution promotes common and equal  citizenry; recognises and protects  the 
<br/>indigenous people of this country, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and Rotumans; and it recognises the uniqueness and 
<br/>protects their lands and ownership of their lands.  Respect for the rule of law is a key ingredient to a 
<br/>successful democracy and plays an important role in creating the environment for development and 
<br/>investment, and some types of basic regulation to prevent fraud and malfeasance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  handed  that  over  to  the  Coalition  Government,  equally  important  are  its  institutions 
<br/>systems and processes in the public sector or what we have established are service standards, effective 
<br/>work systems, effective leadership, transparency, accountability and high productivity.  This is of 
<br/>particular importance too when you want to create an enabling environment where the State supports 
<br/>the economic activity.  I wish to refer here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to inclusive economic institutions that 
<br/>allow and encourage participation by the great mass of people in economic activities that make best 
<br/>use of their talents and skills, and that enables individuals to make the choices they wish.  That too 
<br/>was handed over to the Coalition Government six months ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  function well, the society also  needs other 
<br/>public  services  like  roads  and  transport  networks  so  that  goods  can  be  transported,  a  public 
<br/>infrastructure so that economic activity can flourish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our infrastructure development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, record was  unprecedented.  We handed 
<br/>over a better state of infrastructure to the Coalition Government and most importantly, the economy 
<br/></span><span>itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Look at the hospitals! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- A strong economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1049 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the FijiFirst Government, Fiji recorded its strongest period of post-
<br/>independence economic growth in the decade leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Fijian 
<br/>economy registered its nine years of consecutive economic growth from 2010 to 2018, underpinned 
<br/>by rising productivity, increased public sector investment in infrastructure and development, growing 
<br/>private sector activity supported by high business confidence.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was one of the 
<br/>longest  periods  of  sustained  economic  growth  and  that  will  be  the  challenge  for  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister and the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the longest periods of sustained economic growth in Fiji which led 
<br/>to major improvements in job creation, infrastructure development, improved access to better public 
<br/>services, more income generating opportunities, increased asset and wealth accumulation by Fijians 
<br/>and significant advancement in the overall living standards.  These would be the things that we expect 
<br/>in a Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the majority of the Fijian population became better-off compared to 
<br/>years ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During this period, our GDP doubled from $6 billion to almost $12 billion at the end of 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The GDP per capita on average increased from around $6,600 to over $13,000 per person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  foreign  reserves  increased  to  over  $3.6 
<br/>billion of imports, compared to just around $500 million in 2006.  This is the highest level of reserves 
<br/>in our history and reflects the strong balance of payment position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquidity  levels  in  the  financial  sector  increased  to  over  $2.5  billion,  bank  deposits,  an 
<br/>indicator for personal wellbeing, increased to an amount of $6.1 billion compared to $2 billion in 
<br/>2006. This was a three-fold increase, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  coinciding  with  multiple  tropical  cyclones  caused  an 
<br/>economic crisis of unprecedented scale in Fiji – one of the worst economic contractions in the world.  
<br/>But thank God, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst government under the visionary and able leadership of 
<br/>the then Prime Minister Bainimarama stood firm to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic 
<br/>and laid the foundation for a fast and strong economic rebound. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talking  about  the  rebound,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  our  two  years  of  consecutive 
<br/>contractions, we opened our borders early, our national airline continued to bring in the much needed 
<br/></span><span>tourists, jobs were restored, most businesses are recovering and investors are returning.  That is what 
<br/></span><span>we are handing over, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  After COVID-19, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were rated the third 
<br/>fastest growing economy in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We are on the upward growth trajectory again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>and that is what in our belief the foundation of which the Coalition Government needs to build upon.  
<br/>As  you  very  well  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  businesses,  investors  need  continuity,  consistency, 
<br/></span><span>certainty which the government is expected to provide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How they started their administration?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are all here for the people.  They 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are the ones that voted for us, and it is our duty to serve them and serve them well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the honourable Minister was trying his best to justify the consultative process leading 
<br/>to the National Economic Summit, I again wish to clarify to him and all the honourable Members on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>1050 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Government side that the consultation we undertook was more thorough and widespread too in 
<br/>terms of coverage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we heard the voice of the people through the nationwide consultation on the 
<br/>State  of  the  Nation  Economic  Report  and  the  People’s  Charter  for  Change,  Peace  and  Progress 
<br/>initially by the Bainimarama Government in 2017.  A 45-member National Council for Building a 
<br/>Better Fiji (NCBBF) was established for that purpose. The NCBBF membership was broad-based 
<br/>and inclusive in its composition consisting of representatives and leaders of all major organisations, 
<br/>communities, social, religious, business and political groups in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  forward-looking  State  of  the  Nation  and  Economy  Report  was  to  provide  a  list  of 
<br/>recommendations for changes to our system of government, our constitution, laws, economic and 
<br/>resources development policies, leadership values, community relations and institutional reforms.  I 
<br/>was  surprised  to  see,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  during  the  celebration  on  the  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>,  Mr.  Jone 
<br/>Dakuvula was invited by the organising committee to speak on why that approach did not work.  That 
<br/>celebration was heavily politicised, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the preparation of the State of the Nation and 
<br/>Economy  Report  was  undertaken  through  a  process  of  extensive  countrywide  consultation  and 
<br/>participation - 1,256 consultations in total, covering villages, settlements and organisations, yet the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  boasted  the  Economic  Review  Committee  undertaken  by  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Very poor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- The State of the Nation  and Economy  Report and the People’s 
<br/>Charter were the major guiding documents for the Bainimarama and the FijiFirst government over 
<br/>the recent decade. The wishes of the people enshrined in the People’s Charter and the State of the 
<br/>Nation  Economy  Report  fed  into  the  20-Year  National  Development  Plan,  Ministries  respective 
<br/>strategic development plans and the economic and resources development policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister’s </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> session during official visits and the budget 
<br/>consultations by the Minister for Economy are also forums in which we as a government engaged in 
<br/>constructive dialogue with our communities and organisations.  When the honourable Minister was 
<br/></span><span>in the Opposition, he was asking why the Minister has to go and do the consultations, it is the job for 
<br/></span><span>the officials, but he did exactly the same, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but this time with </span><span>salusalu</span><span> and </span><span>tikka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government road shows, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was a FijiFirst initiative that was well received by 
<br/>the people particularly those in rural and remote communities.  It was not about bringing services 
<br/>down  to  the  people  but  the  empowerment  programmes  and  the  </span><span>Talanoa</span><span>  sessions  were  its  major 
<br/>highlights.  This,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  breached  the  gap  between  the  top-down  and  the  bottom-up 
<br/></span><span>planning processes.  The integrated rural development framework was another model that encouraged 
<br/></span><span>community participation and dialogue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN Resident Coordinator and the Head of UNDP were so impressed 
<br/>with it that they sponsored a few trips to the outer islands in which development partners and officials 
<br/>from  the  multi-lateral  agencies  joined  government  officials  to  visit  and  hold  consultations  at 
<br/>community level.  A model they learned from Fiji and considered it for replication in other regional 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>countries.  That is the level of consultation and dialogue by the FijiFirst Government, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Additionally,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  his  weekly 
<br/>talkback show called “</span><span>Na Noda Paraiminisita”</span><span>- Our Prime Minister, every Fridays.  People talk to 
<br/>him directly and ask questions too.  Additionally, telephone contacts for all Ministers starting from 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister are shared to all Fijians.  That is service at its best! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That is exemplary leadership and that is dedication to the call of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>duty to serve all equally.  His votes say it all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- He is  the leader among  and not  above the people.  He was the 
<br/>people’s Prime Minister.  I hope that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance 
<br/>can learn from it rather than lamenting about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  briefly  summarized  the  political  and 
<br/>economic environment that we, the FijiFirst Government, handed over to the Coalition Government.  
<br/>You can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it was not in a deeply grim state, as portrayed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker,  Sir, during the smooth transition  of power in  December 2022, the 
<br/>expectation of the Coalition Government is to continue and improve from where we had left off and 
<br/>take  it  to  the  next  level.    Our  ordinary  people,  businesses,  investors,  financiers  and  development 
<br/>partners expect continuity. They expect consistency and certainty. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>2023 Budget is so critical for such a purpose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before touching on the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to state my very simple and basic 
<br/>expectations of this Budget.  This is the expectation. One, let us steer the economy to full recovery, 
<br/>back to pre-pandemic level.  We need to preserve the goose, this is important. Let us be reasonable 
<br/>in  our  revenue  generation  targets.    Let  us  tightly  control  our  expenditure.  Let  us  allow  room  for 
<br/>flexibility given the external factors that is identified and exploit new opportunities to broaden and 
<br/></span><span>diversify our economic base and let us address cross-cutting issues such as drugs, climate change, 
<br/></span><span>women empowerment, youths, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my first glance of the Budget I wish to refer to what the honourable Minister 
<br/>stated  or  his  response  to  the  2016  Budget  -  more  politics,  less  economics.  I  say  that  again,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, more politics, less economics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Your words will haunt you, my friend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You want the full article, I can give it to you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand why.  It is the first Budget for the Coalition Government. 
<br/>Two, they made so many promises.  Three, they want to compete, they want to be seen to be better.  
<br/>I hope that we do not kill the goose in the process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have always stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for so long we have been talking about cobwebs, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cobwebs and cobwebs. To get rid of the cobwebs just kill the spider. Right now, our recovery is being 
<br/>driven by tourism.  We must do all in our power to ensure that the growth in tourism is not impeded 
<br/>in  anyway.    We  must  be  mindful  of  the  fact  that  Fiji  is  already  regarded  as  a  high-cost  tourism 
<br/>destination. There are a number of recommendations in this Budget that could further impede our 
<br/>attractiveness as a tourism destination, and this includes the: 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VAT increase of 6 percent that will raise the cost of things bought in hotels; 
<br/>increase of company tax by 5 percent; 
<br/>increase of excise duty on alcohol and tobacco; 
<br/>gradual increase in departure tax; 
<br/>increase in duty for carbonated sweetened beverages on juice, ice cream, sweet biscuits and 
<br/>imported goods and snacks; 
<br/>increase in 3 percent fiscal duty on Concession 235 applicable to existing hotels and resorts 
<br/>and Concession Code 235 applicable to new resorts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the danger that we face. In our quest to raise Government revenue, we could be killing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the goose that is driving our recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government revenue target is driven by what they have already decided 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upfront to spend on. Government is spending money like drunkards in a nightclub.

<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister and I have been in this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament for quite a while.  Every word that he uttered in this Parliament, I remember it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Your words coming back to haunt you.

<div><span>Unveiling the Budget, one of my favourite TV shows is the </span><span>MasterChef</span><span>. What always amazes 
<br/>me is the innovativeness, creativity, talents and skills in those, given the ingredients that they are 
<br/>given, no complaints but they turn those ingredients into the best meals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Too many cooks, no chef.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I looked at the Budget, there is nothing new in this Budget. It is 
<br/>just a repetition of what we have been doing in the past years with a bit of tweaking here and there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the chef has changed in the last six months, but the same chef has been in 
<br/>the panel of judges for the last eight years and there is very high expectation on the very first meal 
<br/>that he will prepare out of the ingredients that he has been given. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have talked about what we have handed over, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is not in a green state.   
<br/>No complaints but, unfortunately, it is the same old menu.  I refer to this Budget.  It is not the magic 
<br/>bullet, it is the magic microwave. Nothing new, just reheating the old menu and serve it to the people.

<div><span>Total estimated revenue of $3.7 billion; 
<br/>Total estimated expenditure $4.3 billion; 
<br/>Estimated Net Deficit $639 million; 
<br/>Additional Debt Repayment of $516 million; 
<br/>Total Gross Deficit of $1.5 million; 
<br/>Net Deficit as a percentage of GDP 4.8 percent; and 
<br/>Nominal GDP $13.3 billion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is a big spending Budget.  It is the largest in Fiji’s history. The net deficit 
<br/>of $639 million is the largest ever deficit outside of pandemic years.  The 2023-2024 Budget will 
<br/>increase the total debt from $9.9 billion to $10.5 billion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government debt had been on the decline prior to the onset of COVID-19 
<br/>and in fact the debt to GDP ratio had dropped to below 50 percent. It only rose as Fiji tried to counter 
<br/>the effects of COVID-19 to ease the impact on our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  The  total  amount  of  debt  will  now  increase  to  more  than  $10 
<br/>billion despite the fact that they have been harping on about excessive debt over the past few years, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. Let me talk about this debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the Budget, we were ridiculed, criticised about Fiji’s debt - excessive, 
<br/></span><span>sa  sivia  na  dinau</span><span>.    They  were  focussing  on  the  nominal  debt.  I  remembered  in  2016  when  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  was  presenting  on  the  debt  to  GDP  ratio,  the  honourable  Minister  said  in 
<br/>Parliament, “let us talk hard facts, let us talk about hard figures, come away from the debt to GDP 
<br/>ratio.”  They were always harping on the nominal debt.  On top of the nominal debt, they loaded the 
<br/>contingent liabilities.  That has been the game plan always; load the contingent liabilities on top of 
<br/>the debt and then they distributed it per capita. Every household or every Fijian has to pay about 
<br/>$10,000 in debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now they are increasing the nominal debt from $9 million, you add the $669 
<br/>million, this is not economics, this is simple mathematics or even arithmetic if you want to call it.  
<br/>Keep it simple.   So, if we are talking about the nominal debt, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are raising the 
<br/></span><span>nominal debt.  But now, the focus is on debt to GDP ratio. We have decreased the debt to GDP ratio, 
<br/></span><span>but you are not telling the Fijians that the nominal debt is increasing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I hope that you are not hoodwinking the people, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>That is the real story about the debt.  Right now, deliberately, they are focusing on the debt to GDP 
<br/>ratio because they have managed to increase their revenue, despite the fact that the nominal debt is 
<br/>going to be increased because of that increase in revenue, the debt to GDP ratio is coming down and 
<br/>that is the key statement ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Psychology spending.

<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Government  debt  had  been on the decline prior to  the onset  of 
<br/>COVID-19. In fact, the debt to GDP ratio had dropped to below 50 percent.  It only rose as Fiji tried 
<br/>to counter the effects of COVID-19 to ease the impact on our people.  The total amount of debt will 
<br/>now increase as I have stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to more than $10 billion, despite the fact that they 
<br/>have been harping on about excessive debt over the past few years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On revenue projection for the 2023-2024 forecast, a 25 percent increase in revenue by various 
<br/>means  that  have  been  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance.    Amongst  this,  he  has 
<br/>included an increase of VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent for all non-zero-rated items.  An increase 
<br/>in companies tax from 20 percent to 25 percent with the exception for those listed on the Suva Stock 
<br/>Exchange for which the increase is smaller and the range of excise tax increases in a number of areas,  
<br/>together with the removal of various incentives that were designed to stimulate investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As pointed out earlier, there are significant weaknesses in the reasoning behind the revenue 
<br/>forecasts because the forecast do not take into account the likely changes in the spending habits that 
<br/>will  happen  once  the  VAT  increases  (kick-in)  and  also  the  impact  of  recovering  departure  tax 
<br/>increases, duty increases, et cetera on the continuity of high tourism arrival forecast that we currently 
<br/>have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were a lot of arguments about the policies that we had while we were 
<br/>in government.  But I think, the legacy is, we improved particularly on the middle income bracket of 
<br/>our community. They were empowered and once they have money in their pockets, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>these are the people who spend.  Consumption goes when they have enough take-home pay. It is their 
<br/>disposable income.  We, of course, acknowledge Government for the allocation particularly for those 
<br/>who  are  receiving  social  welfare.  I  totally  believe  that  it  is  not  big  enough  to  offset  the  increase 
<br/>particularly in the non-zero rated VAT items, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to reduce the number of VAT levels to two levels rather than three levels 
<br/>will of course be a welcoming  relief to  businesses and also  FRCS. The notion, however, that the 
<br/>enhanced  expenditure  support  measures  will  adequately  compensate  for  the  losses  that  the  most 
<br/>marginalised will have to pay as a result of VAT increases is something that we do not fully subscribe 
<br/>to, as I have explained, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has announced that it will reduce fiscal duty from 32 percent 
<br/>to 15 percent on canned Mackerel, corned mutton, corned beef and beef products, canned tomatoes, 
<br/></span><span>prawns and duck meat.  They have also announced that fiscal duty on sheep and lamb meat will be 
<br/></span><span>reduced to zero and that the duty on beef meat being reduced from 32 percent to 15 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Import excise on chicken portions such as wings, drumsticks and thighs from 15 percent to 
<br/>zero percent - all these changes will no doubt raise the choices that our people have.  But on the 
<br/>downside, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are always worried about NCDs in the country. Our colleagues will 
<br/>speak more on the issue.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1055 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two other impacts means that our local suppliers of these food products 
<br/>may well find that they are not able to sell their own products because of cheaper imports. These 
<br/>could then have a negative impact on our strive to broaden agriculture as the base of our economy.  
<br/>Some of these products may also be not very helpful in the drive against NCDs in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note of the companies tax increased from 20 percent  to  25 percent,  companies on the 
<br/>Suva Stock Exchange were eligible for a corporate tax rate of 10 percent. This will now increase to 
<br/>15 percent, which will obviously increase the amount of revenue captured from the private sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it could backfire because some of these ventures could close shop if they 
<br/>are unable to  cope with  the increases in  taxes together with  increases in  duty  for importing good 
<br/>supplied for manufacturing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On that token, the decision by Government to eliminate companies tax from all water bottling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>companies does not make sense at all ...   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- ... because it is entirely focused on helping one company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Why  is  Government  giving  up  revenue  that could  be  collected 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from a whole sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Just to allow one company to get tax credits in the United States 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of America.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- How can this be so? What is wrong? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Prime Minister bending over backwards to do this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You talk about the need to raise revenue and you do the absolute 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opposite and this is hypocrisy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note that the Government may consider taxes 
<br/>on shareholders income in the future. Suffice to say, this is a source of revenue that could be tapped 
<br/>into straightaway, but we do note that this could also have an impact on whether or not businesses 
<br/>decide to stay in business or not.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note the increase in excise tax on alcohol, tobacco, carbonated and sweetened drinks on 
<br/>juices, ice-cream, biscuits, snacks and sugar confectioneries, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  As mentioned by the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance, this may well help address NCDs to a limited degree by encouraging 
<br/>people to move towards more healthier alternatives. However, they will contribute to increase the 
<br/>prices of food stuff and drinks that people pay in general and will also increase the prices of things 
<br/>that tourists pay for when they come to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated already, Fiji is already seen as a more expensive tourism destination. This 
<br/>could have, therefore, a bad impact on the one sector leading our recovery from COVID-19.  Why 
<br/>would any sane government choose to do that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in motor vehicle excise duty by 5 percent will make it more 
<br/>difficult  to  purchase  motor  vehicles.  I  have  talked  about  us  empowering  the  middle  class  of  this 
<br/>country. Most families now have cars which they were not able to own before.  But at the same time, 
<br/>we are mindful of the fact that they may also help assist in maintaining the number of vehicles on 
<br/>our roads which is a major issue because of our road congestion during peak hours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that the social responsible tax will be simplified by merging with PAYE structure 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which basically means that those earning the most income in Fiji will pay less income tax. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- While there is a whole host of things in this Budget that will make 
<br/>it much hard for the poorest in our society, there are these kinds of provisions that are handing out 
<br/>goodies for the most well-off.   I  recommend that  this be reviewed and there should be a gradual 
<br/>increase in taxation rates from salary levels above $100,000 to bring about a more progressive and 
<br/>equitable income tax progression.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  note  the  removal  of  reduction  of  concessions  on  duty  free  raw  materials,  packaging 
<br/>products,  building  materials  for  hotels,  fuel  for  hotels,  manufacturers,  cruise  vessels,  mining 
<br/>companies, warehouse development, all these will raise $35 million in revenue for Government, if it 
<br/>can  be  all  collected.    However,  there  is  a  bigger  opportunity  cost  to  all  these  as  these  additional 
<br/>projected tax measures may well make it far more difficult for struggling business entities in Fiji to 
<br/>survive and flourish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On expenditure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst government invested heavily in infrastructure 
<br/></span><span>development in this country at a level never previously seen.  The honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/></span><span>has done his best to bad mouth these developments, and he has chosen to be blind, but the people of 
<br/>Fiji are not blind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What about the swimming pool? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- They drive on the four-lane highway from Suva to Nadi, they have 
<br/>driven along the Nabouwalu to Labasa Highway, the tourists have driven along the highway from 
<br/>Nadi to Nadi International Airport.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our people have used the new operating theatres in CWM Hospital, Lautoka 
<br/>Hospital and Labasa Hospital, they have the CT scan and the MRI machines, babies have been born 
<br/>in the new Makoi Maternity Unit, people’s lives have been saved because of the extended hours and 
<br/>facilities at Valelevu Health Centre, Bhanabhai Health Centre and the new Nakasi Health Centre.  
<br/>We invested in infrastructure because having good infrastructure improves the quality of lives of our 
<br/>people.  It provides opportunities, encourages and assists further investment into Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1057 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister of Finance says that they will be spending money only to maintain 
<br/>existing infrastructure, $200 million is budgeted only for the maintenance of hospitals, health centres, 
<br/>schools,  public  buildings,  government  quarters,  roads  and  bridges  and  water  infrastructure.    Job 
<br/>creation will be less unless Government invests into bigger capital projects.  Not investing in new 
<br/>infrastructure seems to be a strange thing to be doing, especially in an era where we want to diversify 
<br/>away from just the tourism sector.  We note that one of the two major infrastructure projects could 
<br/>develop a range of new jobs in Fiji, new livelihoods and of course more consumption.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has decided to maintain the 20 percent reduction in Ministerial salaries that 
<br/>was introduced by the FijiFirst Government.  They have decided to also reduce travel allowances.  
<br/>This is to be applauded.  However, I do take note that if one was to reduce travel allowances, one 
<br/>could easily bring expenditures back to the same level just by increasing  the number of trips one 
<br/>takes, and that is what this Government has been doing.  The amount of travel of these have been 
<br/>phenomenal to say the least.  One honourable Minister sitting on the other side is said to have gone 
<br/>seven times overseas in the last six months.  We have been checking all the gazettes and all your 
<br/>movements are noted and recorded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The provision of water has always been a key responsibility of all 
<br/>governments.   The last explosion  of urban migration over the last 20 years has brought  immense 
<br/>pressure  on  our  water  systems.    The  problems  have  been  complemented  by  the  old  distribution 
<br/>network that exists around the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we admit the fact that our infrastructures are old; leaking pipes are normal 
<br/>in the infrastructure that we have.  This is one of the reasons why we established Water Authority of 
<br/>Fiji,  and  that  was  also  one  of  the  reasons  (the  honourable  Tikoduadua  knows)  why  we  have 
<br/>established the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), because of the situation of the infrastructure in Fiji.  He 
<br/>was the first Chairman of FRA, he very well knows the audit report that was done by MWH.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In their recommendations, 130-plus bridges in Fiji were already in a condemned state.  We 
<br/>have rebuilt 60-plus of those 130-plus bridges, but the question is, how many bridges will they build?  
<br/>There is none in the next budget.  Honourable Ro Filipe, they are just continuing with what we have 
<br/>started.  The honourable Prime Minister went to Nayarabale, that was the bridge that we started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  </span><span>Paisa nai hai. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The honourable Prime Minister went to Waibula in Taveuni, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was the bridge that we started. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  </span><span>Khalas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The honourable Prime Minister also went to Naviavia Village.  All 
<br/></span><span>these  are  infrastructures  that  we  started.    The  honourable  Minister  travels  to  Muanidevo  from 
<br/></span><span>Nabouwalu  to  Deketi.  FijiFirst  brought  electricity  from  Seaqaqa  where  it  was  in  2007  down  to 
<br/>Dreketi and even the water, a lot of infrastructure work, and it also creates employment.  You are the 
<br/>Government  now.    You  cannot  judge  the  work  that  we  did  based  on  door  knobs  and  lack  of 
<br/>maintenance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Come on Minister, do some new projects.  Don’t just maintain the old.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister stated that there have 
<br/>been some improvements over the past few months, and he attributed this to a new Board being in 
<br/>place.  Absolute hogwash!  Knowing the Water Authority of Fiji and the water sector quite well, we 
<br/>found that a highly condescending statement to say the least and it demeans the professional nature 
<br/>of the management of Water Authority of Fiji, the plans that they had in place in these past years and 
<br/>the hard work they put in to try and address the issues faced on a daily basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increased budget of Water Authority by $60 million will assist the delivery of water to 
<br/>all our people as long as it is managed well.  I expected more because the honourable Minister, few 
<br/>months into the job, visited the Authority and he was briefed that they will need about $800 million 
<br/>in the next five years to sort out the outstanding issues that are there.  Only $60 million - not enough.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  </span><span>Kaam chalao</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The Viria or the Rewa River Water Scheme is Fiji’s largest ever 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>water project and it was initiated by the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- It will resolve the problems that are faced in the Rewa to Lami 
<br/>corridor.  We note in the Budget that it will be completed in July with full commissioning in October.  
<br/>Let us note that date, the whole </span><span>salusalu</span><span> brigade will be there.  This project showcases innovative 
<br/>financing and mechanisms that this Coalition Government must learn from and use for other major 
<br/>projects.  This is part of the FijiFirst legacy that is being handed over to the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we endorsed the various amounts set aside for key areas including $53.9 
<br/>million to improve water sources and $6.4 million to improve wastewater operations.  We also note 
<br/>the serious challenges that exist across all areas in Fiji for wastewater operation.  The $4.8 million 
<br/>for asset management; $4.6 million for digital transformation; $38.8 million for emergency response 
<br/>and $7.9 million for rural areas will all have to achieve the targets of providing access to clean and 
<br/>safe water to all citizens of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While I am acknowledging all these, at the same time I noted that when they came up with 
<br/>the $200 “School Assistance Programme”, most of the money that was taken out of the Ministries, 
<br/>in order to fulfil that promise probably were taken out from these very key Ministries.  I will read the 
<br/>list after this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had always stated over the years, probably I will just read the list right 
<br/>now, a breakdown of the “Back to School” money and where it came from.  The highest amounts 
<br/>were taken from the Ministry for Health and Medical Services - $9.6 million. The allocation was for 
<br/>the construction of the new CWM Hospital Maternity Unit; land stabilisation and refurbishment of 
<br/>Savusavu Hospital - 1.8 million; upgrade of Labasa Hospital interior - $750,000; biomedical spare 
<br/>parts and maintenance - $500,000; biomedical equipment service fees - $500,000; x-ray material - 
<br/>$1.4 million; appliances - $400,000; Infection Control Programme - $700,000; and Dental Equipment 
<br/>– Urban and Sub-Divisional Hospitals - $900,000. That is just health alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talk about health services but yet, they are taking away money from these very core 
<br/>services of Government.  Sir, a sum of $8.6 million was taken from the Ministry for Housing and 
<br/>Community Development.  I will not go into the list but perhaps just to say that the $500,000 was 
<br/>meant  for the refund for those that owe money for the Lagilagi  Housing, but  that has been taken 
<br/>away.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  I met someone at Nabua a few weeks back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and 
<br/>he asked me, what is happening to our refund? I told him, “Ask the Minister of Finance, he has given 
<br/>that money for the School Assistance Programme.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $7.1 million that was set aside for Water Authority of Fiji, the breakdown 
<br/>was Operating Grant of $4.2 million, no wonder there were a lot of water issues in the Suva area.  
<br/>The Ministry for Agriculture $6 million allocation for machinery outsourcing.  I was confirming that 
<br/>with the honourable Minister this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I note in this year’s Budget they 
<br/>have in fact reduced it from $7 million to $1 million only.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to broaden the economic base, we want to diversify the economy.  Agriculture is a 
<br/>key sector.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they took away $6 million from that allocation and in this year’s Budget 
<br/>they have reduced it by the same amount. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Decreased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total increase to the Ministry but I am talking about machine outsourcing, it has been reduced 
<br/>by $6 million.  I have been told to move on, the list is still there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will give it to 
<br/>them after this, perhaps enough on infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Workers’ Rights and FNPF, the Coalition Government has stated that it will revert to the 
<br/>arrangements  that  were  in  place  for  the  board  membership  of  FNPF  where  they  will  have 
<br/>representatives of workers but perhaps the only thing I want to say is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us bring 
<br/>in people who are fit for purpose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FNPF now intends to take back FNPF reductions to the original 18 percent, the reduction 
<br/>to 10 percent during the height of COVID-19 had only been meant as a temporary way to alleviate 
<br/>the  burden  on  employees  and  members  because  of  the  impact  of  COVID-19  and  we  thank 
<br/>government for that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst government had a long history of looking after the civil servants of the country.  
<br/>They are regarded as part of the way in which government services, to ensure that Fijians are well 
<br/></span><span>looked after. They were at the heart of the COVID-19 battle; they were the unsung heroes of that 
<br/></span><span>battle.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even in the height of COVID-19 the FijiFirst government never reduced their salaries because 
<br/>they were seen as an important part of the way that government continued to provide services to the 
<br/>people of Fiji.  Their salaries were also a way of continuing to maintain their consumption levels.  
<br/>Many civil servants became the life saver for extended families during those difficult times.  This 
<br/>was a strategic decision made by government at that time, but the current Minister had in fact called 
<br/>for their salaries to be reduced during COVID-19 times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  On  Social  Protection  and  After  Care  Fund,  there  has  been  a 
<br/>substantive increase for the social welfare by $52.5 million.  This is a continuation of the massive 
<br/>increase  in  social  welfare  which  emanated  from  the  Bainimarama  boom.    This  is  the  magic 
<br/>microwave which in turn was born out of the nine years of economic growth that was seen in the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>period leading up to 2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These increases will be most welcomed by the most marginalized in our society and by the 
<br/>most marginalized, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I mean the destitute and the poor in our country and we have a 
<br/>responsibility to look after them.  We will not call it freebies as they used to call it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You guys.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We welcome the assistance that is given to them, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>Government has decided and allowed 1,500 FNPF pensioners to access the social pension of $125 if 
<br/>they are above the age of 70 years and $115 between 60 years to 69 years and that comes to $2 million 
<br/>per  year  and  we  are  glad  to  see  that  the  Government  has  come  up  with  a  way  to  assist  FNPF 
<br/>pensioners who were affected by the needed action that was required to preserve the FNPF and ensure 
<br/>its sustainability.  This is a sensible move, and we are glad to see that they have not tried to tinker 
<br/>with FNPF retirement policies in doing this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We take note of the $100,000 set aside for the new Department of Children and the increase 
<br/>in  the  Child  Protection Allowance  of  $6.9  million.    Family  Assistance Scheme  which  used  to  be 
<br/>known as the Poverty Benefit Scheme which was also an innovation brought about by the FijiFirst 
<br/>will have an increase in Budget of $11 million and will benefit 26,000 households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note with concern however that some of the allocations set aside for the 
<br/>disabled  have  been  reduced.    This  includes  the  grant  for  the  Fiji  National  Council  for  Disabled 
<br/>Persons which has been reduced in this Budget by $38,000 and that for Economic Empowerment of 
<br/>Disabled  Person  which  has  had  its  budget  reduced  by  $8,000.    This  is  a  sad  reflection  of  this 
<br/>Government’s flippant attitude towards those who most require assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that there is a 15 percent increase in allowances for ex-servicemen, this will be a 
<br/>most welcomed assistance to them.  I declare my interest here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I am an ex-
<br/>serviceman, but this will be a most welcomed assistance to them especially considering the effect of 
<br/>VAT increases and duty increases seen in this Budget. This continues the phenomenal improvements 
<br/>that FijiFirst put in place for ex-servicemen and even for serving military officers who under FijiFirst 
<br/></span><span>substantially increased their allowances they were paid for Tour of Duties (TODs).    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> empowerment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTaukei Affairs has been given a substantial 
<br/>increase in budget of $23.2 million.  That is a big increase in grants to provincial councils by $6 
<br/>million and, of course, we acknowledge this contribution and perhaps the big challenge is for the 
<br/>Minister particularly in terms of governance issues.  As you are all aware Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was 
<br/>a lot of effort taken in the past to bring all their records up to date particularly audits in the councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also note the increase in allowance of </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> and </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> and the new 
<br/></span><span>allowance for the </span><span>i Liuliu ni Yavusa</span><span>.  These are budgetary transfers that need to be monitored and 
<br/></span><span>managed well so that they do bring about better service delivery to the people that they serve, and of 
<br/>course, we also acknowledge the allocation given to the Advisory Councillors as well.  But one of 
<br/>the concerns that I have and have raised with the honourable Minister that the Advisory Councillors 
<br/>are  not  under  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs.    Advisory  Councillors  are  still  under  the  Ministry  for  Rural 
<br/>Development.  Probably I will come back to that if I have enough time this morning.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1061 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the major developments undertaken by FijiFirst in order to address the asset rich, cash 
<br/>poor tag that was often used to refer to </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners was the budgetary provision set aside for 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land development.  It is to be noted that this is the continuation of the FijiFirst initiative, but 
<br/>it has been moved from the Ministry of Economy to the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.  This fund was 
<br/>set  up  under  the  auspicious  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  incorporated  strict  procedures  and 
<br/>requirements designed to ensure that any money given out for land development would be successful.  
<br/>I hope, honourable Minister, that, that will continue under your watch.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  have  been  several  significant  beneficiaries  of  this  grant  including  Vuda,  Yadua  in 
<br/>Nadroga, Namata in Tailevu, Tavua and the list goes on.  The grant is now to be administered under 
<br/>the Ministry for iTaukei Affairs and as I have stated, we hope that they will manage it to the same 
<br/>degree of objective, professionalism as seen under the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On improving Health Services and Infrastructure, in his Address last week, the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance blatantly lied to the Parliament about the status of health in our nation.  He has 
<br/>no inkling of the vast amounts of infrastructure and systemic improvement that have been made to 
<br/>the health sector over the years including the massive improvement seen in CWM, Lautoka Hospital, 
<br/>Labasa Hospital, the development of specialist facilities and the ongoing incentives put in place by 
<br/>the FijiFirst government to develop Fiji as a health hub for the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  true  status  of  health  in  Fiji  is  to  be  seen  by  looking  at  our  health 
<br/>indicators in Fiji.  For instance, the ultimate indicator of how well we are doing in terms of obstetrics 
<br/>and gynaecology are to be seen in trends on neonatal mortality or the percentage of mothers who die 
<br/>in childbirth generally through investments into infrastructure and equipment, the improvement in 
<br/>staffing  and  systems,  these  indicators  continue  to  improve  year  upon  year.    We  welcome  the 
<br/>Minister’s assurance that health will be given the highest priority in this Budget. A simple perusal of 
<br/>the Budget however shows that it is education that is getting the highest level of budget support in 
<br/>the proposed 2023-2024 Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note the continued increase in the number of positions made available for the health sector 
<br/>including  position  for  nurses,  intern  nurses,  nursing  assistants,  nursing  aids,  midwives,  medical 
<br/>laboratory  scientists  and  additional  support  staff.    There  is  also  support  provided  for  upgrade  of 
<br/>nursing salaries and their overtime.  This will continue the trend that has been instituted by FijiFirst 
<br/>over the past 15 years in improving working conditions and remuneration in the health sector.  I know 
<br/>that one of the discussions particularly is the exodus of our nurses to other places. This is normal. 
<br/>We live in a benefit-oriented society. People are going for better wages elsewhere, but we just need 
<br/></span><span>to continue invest in our people and this is why we see an increase in the remittances that are coming 
<br/></span><span>into the country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is reminded there is a need to look into the salaries and conditions of all other 
<br/>categories of staff employed in the health sector.  The honourable Minister has stated that a fund of 
<br/>$63 million has been provided for public health programmes, emergency, radiology and laboratory 
<br/>services, procurement of drugs, consumables, medicines and purchase of biomedical equipment, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. I hope that this allocation will not be redeployed as he did early this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increased subsidy for kidney dialysis continues the initial work done in this area. But, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in one of his earlier statements in Parliament as well, he insisted that this be free.  
<br/>Thank you for this continued allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that the honourable Minister of Finance has mentioned that the Ministry for Finance 
<br/>will work closely with the Ministry for Public Works to ensure timely maintenance of hospitals.  This 
<br/>also continues what has been utilised all along in the relationship between the officers in the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Divisional Engineers and the Ministry of Health over the past 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government has announced that the outsourcing of GP services will now be 
<br/>limited to families that have combined family income of $30,000. We are glad to see that this FijiFirst 
<br/>initiative is continuing but caution that the limitations will be put in place now, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It 
<br/>does not take into account the inequities that exist between a family of nine earning $31,000 and a 
<br/>family of three earning $29,000. The family of three gets the benefit while the family of nine do not 
<br/>get the benefit.  For the family of three, a household income of $29,000 equates to $9,666 per head 
<br/>whereas the family of nine with a household income of $31,000 equates to $3,444 per head. Under 
<br/>this arrangement, the family that gets $9,666 per head is assisted while the family that gets $3,444 
<br/>per head does not get any assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education sector, we are glad to note that education continues to be given the highest level of 
<br/>funding of $845 million in this new financial year.  The Coalition Government came into power with 
<br/>no idea on what is needed to improve the education sector. FijiFirst has had clear plans spelt out in 
<br/>the National Development Plan on what it will do to address our needs in the education sector.  In 
<br/>his  comments,  the  honourable  Minister  has  hinted  that  the  professional  staff  of  the  Ministry  for 
<br/>Education have net been doing anything to adjusting the curriculum used in our schools to align with 
<br/>the major technological revolutions impacting the world.  Nothing can be further from the truth, and 
<br/>we find this to be a very condescending attitude to the skills and abilities of the professionals that 
<br/>man the Ministry for Education and the sector in general, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  has  established  the  mechanisms  and  structures  which  can  propel  the  education  sector 
<br/>forward in the appropriate way.  We do applaud the technical education and the NPTC levy as well, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address the shortage of trade technicians where there has been a scourge for Fiji 
<br/>sometime and FijiFirst had invested greatly in this sector over the years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were however still significant gaps that needed to be addressed. Over the past few years 
<br/>there have been some incentive investment in the Fiji National  University, in particular, National 
<br/>Training and Productivity Centre of the FNU as a Centre of Excellence for TVET Development. This 
<br/>has been complemented by the assistance given to other TVET providers including Montfort Boys 
<br/>Town, Nadave, Chevalier Institute, Sangam Nursing School, and others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are quite surprised however, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  see how the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance seems to be following over backwards to reach out to Pacific Polytech which is a private 
<br/>company when the NZPTC at FNU has a far more solid reputation, has the facilities and staffing to 
<br/></span><span>be able to deliver the kind of training required. It would seem that the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/></span><span>has a soft spot for the Principal of Pacific Polytech who, by the way, was also part of the organisation 
<br/>for which funds were provided for the Girmit celebrations. This is quite appalling to say the list, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  and  may  I  refer  to  his  earlier  Address,  and  I  quote;  “everything  is  connected  to 
<br/>everything else”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note the comments made about revamping the Apprenticeship Scheme. We note that the 
<br/></span><span>Apprenticeship  Scheme  was  never  lost,  that  it  has  always  been  in  place  but  do  recognise  and 
<br/></span><span>appreciate the focus on apprenticeship and the honourable Minister made a mistake in saying that the 
<br/>NZPTC levy was removed.  It was never removed.  Same thing for the funding of higher institutions 
<br/>and my colleagues will perhaps address the TELS write-off issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Roads Authority, the honourable Minister of Finance has noted the immense investment 
<br/>that the FijiFirst government had put into the road infrastructure over the past eight years amounting

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1063 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to $3.1 billion. Thank you again for continuing, but in his condescending and arrogant manner, he 
<br/>states that investment was not done with any proper costing or planning.  All he must do is to look at 
<br/>the detailed plan targets outlined in the 20-year and 5-year National Development Plan 2017-2037.  
<br/>As usual his remarks are petty and demeaning, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The focus of this Government now is to maintain what FijiFirst had already started. There is 
<br/>nothing new in this Budget; absolutely nothing. There was a great opportunity, here to continue the 
<br/>projects on the four-lane highway from Nadi to Lautoka and the initial planning for the cross Viti 
<br/>Levu Highway, that in the long run would bring about immense benefits and in the short term create 
<br/>a host of employment opportunities.  This is a myopic gutless Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport, we take note of the 
<br/>Government’s decision to re-establish the Public Works Department. At the outset, we must remind 
<br/>everyone of the shenanigans that used to take place at the PWD and the reputation, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to also state that I will talk later about the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF). 
<br/>There have been plans for services provided by PWD to be allocated to the Engineer Regiment of 
<br/>the RFMF. There is a paper already in place, I hope the honourable Minister is aware that after the 
<br/>Maritime Essential Service Centre that is currently being undertaken although there has not been any 
<br/>committed  from  the  New  Zealand  Government  but  the  discussions  that have  already  been  taking 
<br/>place is for this responsibility to be taken over by the RFMF Engineers, particularly, on rural roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister would also be aware that during the time of Ratu Sir Kamisese 
<br/>Mara there was a Unit in the RFMF Engineers called the Rural Development Unit (RDU) and that is 
<br/>why we revisited that during our time. I just wanted our friends on the other side in Government to 
<br/>be aware of the discussions that have taken place in this regard, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Agriculture,  the  agriculture  sector  is  receiving  a  substantive  budget  increase  of  $37.3 
<br/>million. This is welcomed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is a sector that needs to grow as part of our 
<br/>diversification on the basis of our economy.  The funds allocated for AMA and Committee for Better 
<br/>Utilisation of Land (CBUL) are welcomed, together with the assistance for research and extension. 
<br/>These are parts of the Ministry thfat will need to be continued to be strengthened, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to talk about the dairy industry, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The honourable Minister and his 
<br/>deputy are well aware of the issue happening in the dairy sector. We need to separate the role between 
<br/>Fiji Co-operative Dairy Limited and the processing which is the Fiji Dairy Company. I know that 
<br/></span><span>when this reform took place, Rewa Dairy Co-operative then had a big debt of $18 million and they 
<br/></span><span>were not in a position to finance that debt.  That is why the reform took place, but what I wanted to 
<br/>clarify, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no relationship between that reform and the loss of production in 
<br/>milk.  The loss of production is mainly due to Brucellosis and TB.The honourable Minister and his 
<br/>deputy are well aware of that issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Talk to them, talk to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We appreciate the investment into Waterways and note that it was 
<br/></span><span>under the FijiFirst that the role of Waterways was elevated and separate Unit to address the issue of 
<br/></span><span>drainage.  It has gone back to the Ministry of Agriculture where it was previously as Land and Water 
<br/>Resources Management (LWRM) and the honourable Minister I know at one stage was head of that 
<br/>Unit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar, in his discussion on the sugar industry, 
<br/>the honourable Minister has not mentioned anything new by the Government to address the state of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the sugar industry. He does not also refer to some of the fundamental problems that began decline of 
<br/>the sugar industry and that is the non-renewal of leases which was a rallying cry for a significant 
<br/>portion of those who are now part of this Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have just talked about CBUL, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is exactly the allocation to ensure that 
<br/>farmer’s  leases  are  renewed  so  that  they  can  continue  with  the  farming.    But  as  I  have  stated,  I 
<br/>question  the  fact  that  money  for  the  Advisory  Councillors  is  still  with  the  Ministry  of  Rural 
<br/>Development,  and  I  have  already  discussed  this  with  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Affairs.   We all know the politics behind  the work of the Advisory  Councillors, and  I know that 
<br/>probably  this  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance has now decided to give this allocation to the Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Where is the trust?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just touch on sugar for a while.  We note 
<br/>that they will continue with the guaranteed price of $85 per tonne which is quite different from what 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Finance said in 2018.  He called it “shock therapy”.  The shock therapy 
<br/>is to rejuvenate the sugar industry, just give the farmers $100 per tonne.  That is the shock therapy, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  suggested  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Where  is  the  shock 
<br/>therapy?  I know that the honourable Minister looked shocked.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last year, Sir, when we discussed and debated about the allocation in the sugar industry when 
<br/>it  was  reduced,  we  anticipated  that  there  will  be  an  increase  in  the  world  price  of  sugar.    The 
<br/>honourable Minister in this Parliament was complaining about the allocation that went into the sugar 
<br/>industry, that is exactly what is happening today.  The world price is increasing and that is exactly 
<br/>what  we  had  anticipated  last  year  and  thus  the  allocation  in  the  Ministry.    I  hope  that  this  shock 
<br/>therapy will materialise in the next Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, you write it down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I declare my interest, I am a cane farmer as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have skipped a few, Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps my colleagues will talk more on it.  On the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, the Rural and Maritime 
<br/>Development  has  undergone  massive  increase  under  the  FijiFirst  government  as  we  sought  to 
<br/>improve living conditions away from our urban centres in order to reduce urban drift.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are aware that this will continue to be a challenge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but over the 16 years 
<br/>there has been a dramatic increase in the budget provided for this sector in a host of different areas. 
<br/>Therefore, money  will be provided for self-help  projects,  community access  roads, footpaths and 
<br/>footbridges  for  rural  housing  and  the  upgrade  and  renovation  of  civil  servants’  quarters  in  the 
<br/></span><span>Division, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Let me refer to the allocation on self-help as I have stated, when they 
<br/></span><span>were separate ministries back then, the Multi-Ethnic Affairs had their own allocation for self-help 
<br/>projects.  Perhaps this is something that can be considered and discuss later with the two respective 
<br/>Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note the substantive increase of $4.2 million for the NDMO which is slightly due to the 
<br/>Disaster Risk Programmes sponsored by the New Zealand – Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1065 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(NZMFAT). We will be expecting </span><span>El Nino</span><span> conditions this year and I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we 
<br/>will all be ready. Since the last time we had such conditions was in 2016 when we had </span><span>TC Winston.</span><span>
<br/>The  Government  will  need  to  make  sure  that  the  NDMO  and  its  partner  entities  such  as  the  Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological Office are ready to address the likely challenges that will arise out of </span><span>El Nino</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only issue that perhaps I wanted to raise with the honourable Minister is the allocation 
<br/>on the construction of Evacuation Centres in the four villages that have already been identified.  I 
<br/>hope that will continue in this year’s allocation as provided by the Koreans under the IOM Office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Ministry  for  Local  Government,  FijiFirst  has  invested  immensely  in  Local 
<br/>Government in the development of local markets all around the country including Laqere, Nausori 
<br/>and Rakiraki.  These markets, for the first time included areas where female vendors have sleeping 
<br/>and shower facilities.  In this Budget, funds have been allocated for Savusavu Market, Nakasi Market, 
<br/>Dreketi Market and the completion of the Levuka Market and we applaud Government for that, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, over the past few years, Fiji’s status 
<br/>internationally and regionally has been elevated. We have served as President and Chair of the G77 
<br/>in China, we have hosted COP23 and served as President of the United Nations Conference Assembly 
<br/>and we also hosted the 1st World Ocean Conference with the Pacific Island Nations and our partner 
<br/>countries of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).  We were able to put the oceans issue as a 
<br/>part of the global agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has also played a leading role in trade negotiations globally and regionally and developed 
<br/>Fiji as a hub for the region. During this time, we have been friends for all nations and enemy to none, 
<br/>and  this  has  been  a  major  pillar  of  our  growing  international  stature.    This  is  something  that  the 
<br/>Coalition Government hopefully will continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that Government is looking to reopen our missions in Washington, Malaysia and 
<br/>Papua New Guinea and there has been mention about establishing a new embassy in Israel, but I do 
<br/>not see any allocation on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Of course, it is critical that we have thorough analysis 
<br/>for a potential return of investment is carried out before we undertake this and the question is, is it 
<br/>the right time for us to re-establish these missions?  Perhaps, we could learn from the Israeli and the 
<br/>Singaporean  concepts  where  the  ambassadors  are  based  in-country  and  they  just  travel  to  their 
<br/>respective missions and of course come back into the home country.  These are cost effective options 
<br/>that probably the Government can consider as we are trying to strengthen the relationship between 
<br/></span><span>our bilateral partners.  Of course, we value these relationships, and the honourable Naivalurua will 
<br/></span><span>talk further on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Independent  Bodies,  we  note  the  increase  of  $7.7  million  in  the  budget  of  our  Fiji 
<br/>Parliament.    Of  course,  this  should  assist  Parliament  to  carry  out  its  duties  more  effectively  and 
<br/>enhance engagements.   Same thing with  the Judiciary,  I just wish to  again  emphasise the fact  on 
<br/>maintaining the independence of these so-called Independent Bodies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Republic  of  Fiji  Military  Forces  (RFMF),  thank  you,  honourable  Minister  for  the 
<br/></span><span>increased allocation.  As I have stated, there have been ongoing discussions about the strength of the 
<br/></span><span>RFMF Engineers and I think this allocation is the first step in that direction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I have some serious questions about the RFMF because I noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>that in 2016, and let me read out some of the concerns raised by the honourable Minister back then 
<br/>concerning the RFMF.  I am quoting the honourable Minister, he was asking the government on a 
<br/>few allocations in the budget then, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That  third  feature  is  the  continuing  increased  allocation  to  the  RFMF,  for 
<br/>example, $78 million for peacekeeping.  What are we gaining from this expenditure?  
<br/>Fiji, in our view, is losing out on peacekeeping.  We are not getting value for money.  
<br/>We should review this part of the RFMF expenditure allocation and redirect to some 
<br/>other priority areas.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was something that I wanted to raise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You say one thing and do something else.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Do not speculate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Not speculation, that is what was said.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I have to skip a few, Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, I will just conclude.  
<br/>There are some allocations given in  this Budget  that we  consider as probably  not  of priority and 
<br/>hopefully can be reconsidered for new allocations.  One is on the USP grant, we still maintain in the 
<br/>name of good governance and transparency that proper investigations be done at USP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope as patriotic Fijians, we will support our 
<br/>people  at  the  University.    I  am  talking  about  Professor  Rajeshwar  Chandra  and  Mr.  Winston 
<br/>Thompson.  They went through the same process by the Council, but the same Council did not allow 
<br/>for investigations when issues were raised against the new Vice-Chancellor.  That is the transparency 
<br/>that we demanded.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Absolutely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Secondly, the $4 million allocation, I have stated about the foreign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>missions, they are important for our relations, but is the timing right?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The $5 million allocated to PWD, as I have stated, the RFMF Engineers are ready to take 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over the responsibility, so this $5 million probably can be redeployed elsewhere.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the removal of tax from water bottling companies is another issue as well.  I know, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that in 2010 when the Bainimarama government came in, they were already on a 
<br/>13-year  tax  holiday,  Fiji  Water,  and  they  claimed  that  they  were  operating  at  a  loss.    What  is 
<br/>happening here?  Everything is connected to everything else.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, there is less economics, but more politics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just go back to the honourable Minister.  I acknowledged and listened very carefully 
<br/>to his Budget Address, and he did talk very passionately about everything connected to everything 
<br/>else and professed their humility to listen to others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would challenge the honourable Minister if he had humility, he would not  have told the 
<br/>former Prime Minister, Mr. Mahendra Chaudhary lately to “shut up” and stop talking garbage when 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1067 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the former Prime Minister told him to stop wasting government money on summits to meet his friends 
<br/>and supporters who comprise about 8 percent of the national vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Summits to discuss their policy homework that should have been  
<br/>done while they spent eight years in Opposition.  This is why I raise the issue about them stating that 
<br/>they are only six months in the Government and adopting a grim state of affairs, but they have been 
<br/>government in waiting for eight years.  He used to tell us, everyone has heard that and know it, that 
<br/>you are a government with no plans, you are a government with no vision, you are a government 
<br/>with no money, you are spending money like drunkards in a night club.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, those were 
<br/>all the things that he used to say, but where is it?  They were getting paid as the Opposition by the 
<br/>Fijian taxpayers but doing no policy homework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  No  policy  work  at  all.    That  is  no  work.    Hence,  the  need  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>endless summits after being shocked to find themselves in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to interconnectedness, if the honourable Members opposite had any humility they will 
<br/>understand many of the things and reasons why the FijiFirst government did what it did.  We did not 
<br/>get  to  government  from  a  background  of  political  stability,  like  how  governments  are  staged  in 
<br/>Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific nations around us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our region, no, we go to government on the back of a  </span><span>coup </span><span>and munity culture, and we 
<br/>invested heavily in its correction, and that is how government changed peacefully to the Coalition 
<br/>Government last December.  We know that the honourable Minister does not like to admit that part 
<br/>of the equation because it is a blot on this country’s history.  But again, everything is connected to 
<br/>everything else, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I remind the honourable Minister and his team that this is just the 
<br/>beginning, and this is all very important because the truth will set them free.  The truth will help them 
<br/>understand the FijiFirst investment of billions of dollars in productive capacities to cancel or try to 
<br/>cancel the damage and debts left to this country by the honourable Minister’s side of politics.  The 
<br/></span><span>truth is after the 1987 and the 2000 events, respected economists pulled the bill of bad governance 
<br/></span><span>by the honourable Minister’s side of politics at about $20 billion.  The list includes the NBF collapse, 
<br/>the two devaluations… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Listen, listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- … the massive brain-drain, the massive investor-drain and on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back of that, what is $7 billion in Productive Capacities Return tied around?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I am summarising, I have a few others but in the interest of time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just 
<br/>have to say that when we invested heavily in infrastructure, especially in the rural areas where the 
<br/>disadvantaged live and reside, we were ridiculed and were heavily criticised.  But, Sir, I hope, and I 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>say that again, I hope that they will stop the criticisms and have the humility to connect the dots. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope also that their priorities will not focus on politics but look at the needs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we have.  Take the time to learn from the FijiFirst journey! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Listen to the positives and the negatives, make it much better for 
<br/>Fiji and all Fijians.  Instead of just removing the levy for those who earn $217,000 plus a year, you 
<br/>could have imposed the levy progressively from $100,000 upwards to collect revenue, instead of the 
<br/>15 percent VAT on the poor which will slow down the economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  concluding  on  the  Budget  itself,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  need  to  ask  three  critical 
<br/>questions to the honourable Minister.  Firstly, what will happen now to Head 50?  I say that again, 
<br/>because this is the conspiracy theories that they used to come up with when they were on this side of 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, in his 2020 Budget Address, said that we 
<br/>were a rudderless Government because of the allocation under Head 50 because our Government 
<br/>then does not know the priorities and the Ministries where to spend the allocations that are in Head 
<br/>50.  But look at the Budget book today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Millions of dollars in Head 50.  That is the conspiracy theory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. J. Usamate interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- What did they do, are they rudderless because of that allocation, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Secondly, allocation under “R” (Request to Incur Expenditure), 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, the honourable Minister of Finance is here on record, questioning why there 
<br/>are so many allocations under “R”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And now you are doing exactly the same thing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- In this Budget, more than half of the whole Budget is under “R”, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- What has changed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1069 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There you go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a few minutes, I will read out what the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister stated back then.  This is, again, more politics, less economics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “How can there be an allocation of just under $400 million under Head 50, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir?  The core feature of the recent Budget is that, there is a massive allocation 
<br/>to Head 50.  Head 50 is for so-called Miscellaneous Expenditure.  How can there be an 
<br/>allocation of just $400 million?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is more than 10 percent of the total Budget to Miscellaneous Expenditure, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  This allocation reflects poor planning in allocation and the lack of trust in 
<br/>the other Ministries and Ministers to oversee the execution of the expenditures.  It also 
<br/>allows the politicisation of expenditure by the Government and to add to this amount, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is those that are on requisition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Minister for Economy alone will effectively have a control of about 50  percent 
<br/>of the total expenditure of $3.6 billion in this Budget, amounting to about $1.8 billion.  
<br/>So, half of the allocation is under “R” in Head 50.  This raises several questions, and this 
<br/>is the conspiracy theory.  Is it more likely that this zeal for control will stifle timely and 
<br/>appropriate expenditure by different Ministries?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has $89.9 million in his Ministry.  Under “R”, we have $1.699 billion, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plus In-Kind is about $60 plus million and, of course, the allocation in Head 50.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He’s controlling all of you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  So, is it because of his zeal for control, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   I hope 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the honourable Prime Minister is in control because when he wanted a mini-budget…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my other question on the Budget is on the Overseas Development Assistance 
<br/>(ODA).  Again, we thank our development partners.  When we were in desperate need and, of course, 
<br/>because of the reforms that have taken place as well according to the recommendations of the World 
<br/>Bank, we have improved on our systems and processes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will not go into the detail.  
<br/>I have the report here, but that is when we began to receive more money through our bilateral partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  honourable  Minister  who  was  in  the  Opposition  back  then,  in  a  </span><span>Fiji  Times</span><span>
<br/></span><span>article,  and  I  do  not  have  the  date,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  said  and  I  quote,  “The  Begging-Bowl 
<br/>Government…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because you had nothing left. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- What is the difference today, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Words do haunt 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us, Sir… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Your words haunt you, my friend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- …because as I used to say in this Parliament, while they were here, 
<br/>they were speaking irresponsibly. They do not realise that one day, they will go to the other side of 
<br/>the floor, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is what is happening today.  That is why in this contribution this 
<br/>morning, I have never talked about freebies, I never talked about hoodwinking, I never talked about 
<br/>electioneering, but those are the very words that always come out from them Mr. Speaker, Sir. But

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now, things have changed.  This is the article - the Begging-Bowl Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he was quick to receive money from the Australians very early this year.  
<br/>The same thing with the honourable Prime Minister, he received money as well.  And then there was 
<br/>a second cycle and he received money from the New Zealand High Commissioner very lately, Sir.  
<br/>Is he the begging Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I started with our expectations and the expectations are; Firstly, let us, again, 
<br/>steer  the  economy  to  recovery.    Of  course,  I  have  heard  from  some  economists,  Sir,  that  in  Fiji, 
<br/>revenue is not  an issue.  We can raise the revenues that we want to raise, but our challenge, that 
<br/>included as well, is expenditure.  How we utilise the revenue that we generated, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, as I have stated, the goose that we need to look after is the tourism sector, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  and  with  that  is  Fiji  Airways.    We  did  not  chew  the  planes,  but  we  supported  Fiji 
<br/>Airways, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I saw that the honourable Prime Minister was in Nadi to congratulate the 
<br/>Fiji Airways staff for their achievement and much of this, Sir, is to the young dedicated staff who 
<br/>joined Fiji Airways recently, so we need to acknowledge them.  Secondly, we need to be reasonable 
<br/>in our revenue generation target, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That can be painful, but we need to be fair. We 
<br/>need to be considerate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, some that are supposed to give us more in this Budget are not giving us what 
<br/>they can afford to give us, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Is this because of everything is connected to everything 
<br/>else? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has tightly controlled our expenditure and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we need to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was looking forward because I have been following the recommendations of the National 
<br/>Economic  Summit,  I  followed  the  statements  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  Review  Committee,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister did speak a day before the announcement of the Budget 
<br/></span><span>and he talked about the magic bullet. We need to share the pain together but, unfortunately, with all 
<br/></span><span>those expectations, I do not see that coming in this Budget. Unfortunately, we have decided to please 
<br/>some and, of course, at the expense of others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  said  that  we  have  to  allow  room  for  flexibility,  given  the  external  factors.  We  are  not 
<br/>isolating ourselves, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  When we talk about geopolitics, when we talk about the war, 
<br/>when we talk about climate change issues, when we talk about disasters, the Opposition back then 
<br/>did not listen to us.  But, of course, this is why we need to always prepare for the worst case scenario.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have stated that this year, we are beginning the </span><span>El Nino</span><span> cycle, and I hope that we will be 
<br/></span><span>prepared to absorb this external source, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of our source markets, particularly 
<br/>our tourists.  Although inflation in under control for now but who knows what will happen in the 
<br/>future because these are the very people that we rely on to give us the much-needed foreign currency 
<br/>so that our economy can continue to grow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to identify and exploit our new opportunities - to broaden and  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1071 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>diversify our economic base. I have given my support to the initiatives that are there, but I can still 
<br/>say that it is not enough. Of course, we need to address cross-cutting issues such as drugs, climate 
<br/>change, women empowerment, youth issues, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  climate  change,  we  have  the  Climate  Change  Act  2021.    There  are  opportunities  in 
<br/>climate-related investments, Mr. Speaker, Sir - our energy bill and our transportation bill.  This is a 
<br/>good opportunity for us when we talk about the magic bullet because the initial cost will be high, but 
<br/>the benefit will come later because of our fossil fuel bill which is about 4 percent of GDP alone.  It 
<br/>will be a big  saving  for  Fiji  in  the  future, so let  us  start  now with  investment in  energy  and fuel 
<br/>because transportation and energy, particularly the energy sector, are too big issues under the Paris 
<br/>Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitment, we need to be seen to 
<br/>be  committed  to  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  had  told  the  media  few  weeks  back  when  they  were 
<br/>interviewing me about climate change, “Go and take a picture of the honourable Prime Minister’s 
<br/>residence.” It is not a good example because we want to grow trees, but then they started cutting trees 
<br/>again. That is the investment that we need - we need to keep our forests, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  said  all  those,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  support  the  Budget,  but  I  wish  the 
<br/>Government well, particularly with their revenue projections based on what is happening here, Sir, 
<br/>because we are part of what you inherited, so you have to look after us as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I wish the honourable Minister all the very best  in  the  achievement  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation of this Budget, but we will continue to monitor Government very closely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition for that rebuttal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea. When we resume after the 
<br/>bell  has  been  sounded,  I  will  be  offering  the  floor  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his 
<br/>contribution as well.  The House is adjourned. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 12.04 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the 2023-2024 
<br/>Budget, delivered by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics, on Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  welcome  our  citizens  who  are  following  these  proceedings  via  television,  radio  or  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>livestream. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to pay tribute to the late Taufa Vakatale, who was the Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  during  the  SVT/GVP  Government,  and  also  the  late  Ratu  Talemo  Ratakele,  the 
<br/>former late Senator and also late member of the Great Council of Chiefs during their lifetime.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the people of Taveuni for receiving the Squad - our Fiji Rugby World Cup Squad, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was training in Welagi Village last week, and it was great to have been able to visit them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also would like to commend the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and his Team for quickly 
<br/>putting together this Budget that we are debating in this august Parliament, aimed at stabilising the 
<br/>situation that we inherited, and moving Fiji forward.  We all understand that it is the will and the 
<br/>wish of everyone elected to this august Parliament.  I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it will be the 
<br/>foundation for the consolidation of Government finances to support the socio-economic development 
<br/>and restructuring in the short and the medium term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proposed  Budget  has  received  quite  broad  support  and  acceptance,  gauging  from  the 
<br/>views expressed to the team that had gone around the country in consultation before and after the 
<br/>presentation  on  the  Budget.    The  encouraging  thing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  they  have  been 
<br/>forthright, and they have freely expressed themselves and their views on the Budget that is before us.  
<br/>Non-Government, professional institutions and the private sector on the whole have commended the 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank those who have endorsed the Budget in the media and in discussions that we have had 
<br/>around the country.  There will be criticisms and political rhetoric, but it is the duty of the honourable 
<br/>Members of the Opposition to try and not criticise but see how best we can better the presentation by 
<br/>Government and allocations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will continue to encourage constructive criticisms that is genuine, in the hope that we can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all work together for the benefit of our people and the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will be discussing with my colleagues the best way of introducing an organised feedback 
<br/>system that gives the public an avenue for letting us know directly what they think about our services 
<br/>and our policies.  When I say ‘our’, it means the Government services and politicians. Questions such 
<br/>as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How efficient are our departments?  How can they improve? 
<br/>How much of a difference did the new bridge which was recently opened in their area make 
<br/></span><span>to the livelihood and the lives of the people in the area? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>What do they think of the local medical services? 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How well do the Water Authority of Fiji and Energy Fiji Limited communicate over water 
<br/>and power cuts? Are their announcements realistic and the duration of the cuts accurate?  
<br/>They can come back on that network and tell the Government about those. 
<br/>Do the Government agencies do a good job of answering the questions from the consumers? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1073 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I also issue a cautionary note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Budget, which is the product of 
<br/>consultations and dialogue among different stakeholders right around the country.  No Government 
<br/>anywhere is capable of preparing a budget that gives their people everything that they want, because 
<br/>our resources are scarce and limited, and Government has to prioritise based on the current needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is meant to help us out of the crises we knew we would have 
<br/>to contend with when we came into the Elections and eventually got the parliamentary votes to be 
<br/>Government.  It is caused by unsustainable debt levels, some of which we could not avoid, and the 
<br/>shocking deterioration of much of our infrastructure, in particular, our health facilities.  These are 
<br/>some of the grim realities that the Budget is designed to deal with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget has been designed to immediately help as many of the poor and needy as possible 
<br/>and give relief to students burdened with Tertiary Education Loans Scheme (TELS) debt.  It is also 
<br/>intended to improve education and boost investor confidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my “State of the Nation” address on the eve of the Budget announcement 
<br/>on Wednesday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023, I reiterated that it is critical that we must all come together to address 
<br/>the common challenges in rebuilding our nation.  There is no doubt that we have to make some hard 
<br/>decisions that will not be pleasant, nor easy, for some of our own people.  These decisions are deemed 
<br/>necessary for the common good of our citizens and to take our country forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I made it very clear that we are operating in an uncertain and unpredictable 
<br/>global  environment.    Therefore,  there  is  a  need,  and  it  is  very  important  that  we  have  to  make 
<br/>necessary changes to protect our nation from the uncertainty that we face today and possible future 
<br/>shocks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Structural adjustment policies to improve efficiency, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and productivity are 
<br/>necessary in order for us to be relevant, adaptable and to be competitive in the global environment 
<br/>we  are  in.    Therefore,  despite  the  increase  in  expenditure,  the  Budget  is  intended  to  consolidate 
<br/>Government finances in the medium term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  deficit  has  been  brought  down  to  4.8  percent,  compared  to  7.4  percent  in  2022-2023 
<br/>financial year.  Despite the reduction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the deficit compared to the last three years, 
<br/>more work is necessary to further reduce our deficit to a desirable level of, at least, or to be below 4 
<br/>percent of our GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Budget  includes  measures  to  address  the  high  debt  level,  minimise 
<br/></span><span>wastage, direct resources to priority areas and sectors of Government and allow our people access to 
<br/>basic services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our current debt portfolio, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is around $10 billion.  This means that with our 
<br/>current commitment, we have to pay over $1 billion to service our debt annually.  That comprises 
<br/>$536 million in interest alone, and $516 million in principle, to be repaid annually. This simply means 
<br/>that we do not have the fiscal space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no room or very limited capacity for Government 
<br/></span><span>to expedite and implement capital projects that are critical for investment to generate employment 
<br/>opportunities to our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  revenue  measures,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  made  some  hard  decisions  to  have  a  balance 
<br/>Budget.  In addition to the 21 zero-rated VAT on basic food items, prescription medicine is now also 
<br/>exempted.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The VAT rate of 15 percent will apply to all other goods and services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While PAYE has been adjusted downwards, import duty on raw materials has been increased 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by 3 percent.  The corporate tax rate has increased from 20 percent to 25 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A few other important item duties have been increased by 5 percent.  Duty concessions on 
<br/>fuel for tourism and shipping have been removed.  Other duty and tax concessions have also been 
<br/>adjusted to improve revenue collection. The Government is also implementing measures to improve 
<br/>tax administration and minimise tax evasion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These revenue policy reforms are guided by the principles of fairness, simplicity and revenue 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>adequacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are committed to transparency and genuine consultation with businesses 
<br/>and taxpayers.  Therefore, we will continue to engage with investors and businesses to build their 
<br/>confidence through consistency of our policies and continuous engagement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the target sectors, the 2023-2024 Budget is more balanced and restrained, 
<br/>while it continues to deliver core Government services.  We steadfast in our commitment to health, 
<br/>education, infrastructure, public security, skills development, poverty alleviation and welfare.  Funds 
<br/>have been allocated to improve our basic infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will continue to engage with our multilateral and bilateral development partners to secure 
<br/>funding in the improvement of basic infrastructure, including health and education facilities, roads, 
<br/>jetties and water supply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A number of projects will be funded by our multilateral development partners, viz-a-viz the 
<br/>ADB  and  the  World  Bank  through  concessional  loans  in  the  vicinity  of  US$150  million.    Most 
<br/>importantly,  these  projects  will  create  employment  opportunities  and  create  more  investment 
<br/>opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Health  allocation  has  been  increased  to  improve  our 
<br/>healthcare  services  and  facilities.    The  Ministry  has  been  allocated  $453.8  million,  which  is  an 
<br/>increase of $69 million to cater for the efficient operation or our healthcare facilities.  The increase 
<br/>will also cater for salary increment for our health personnel and urgent recruitment of nurses and 
<br/>medical assistants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the education sector has been given the highest allocation of $845 million.  
<br/>This is historically the highest allocation ever.  The allocation includes grants, salaries and capital 
<br/>expenditure.  We will provide better salaries and working conditions for our teachers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with our commitment, the Government has written off the TELS 
<br/>debt of approximately of $650 million owed by 53,725 students.  Students and their families will not 
<br/>have to repay that debt.  Instead, students who have benefited from that will have to serve a bond by 
<br/>working in Fiji for a certain number of years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have retained social protection allowances for poor households.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocation has been increased by $11.5 million from the current financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Across  the  board,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  social  protection  allocation  has  been  increased  to 
<br/>support those living below the poverty line, and that includes people with disabilities, pensioners, 
<br/>women and children.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1075 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I now  turn to  the Ministries under my  portfolio,  and one of them is  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Civil  Service.    Within  the  Civil  Service,  there  will  be  more  human  resource  and 
<br/>institutional  capacity  building  to  improve  service  delivery  to  ordinary  people  and  for  the  civil 
<br/>servants to give them a clear career path.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Civil Service is our biggest employer, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with a workforce of over 35,000, 
<br/>spread across 31 Ministries, 50 Departments and agencies at 300 locations throughout the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Service, it is no longer business as usual.  Like other parts of national life, the Service 
<br/>too must go through a transition.  Our aim is for the entire organisation to become world class.  If 
<br/>that sounds ambitious, it is meant to be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  being  allocated  $50.6  million,  compared  to  $2.4  million  in  the  previous 
<br/>Budget.    The  consolidation  and  transfer  of  functions  previously  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy to truly reflect the streamlining of the core functions of the Public Service has led to the 
<br/>substantial  increase.    This  includes  the  transfer  of  responsibility  for  Office  Accommodation  and 
<br/>Housing Unit of $47.9 million.  The intention is that new standards of excellence will be achieved in 
<br/>service delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocation has also increased from $29.4 million to $37.9 
<br/>million,  an  increase  of  28.9  percent.    The  increase  is  to  support  the  opening  of  our  Missions  in 
<br/>Washington DC, Port Moresby, Kuala Lumpur, the establishment of new Embassy in Israel and the 
<br/>refurbishment of our overseas Missions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Prime Minister’s Office’s Small Grant Scheme, to honour the former Prime Minister’s 
<br/>commitments to rural communities, the Small Grant Scheme allocation has also been increased by 
<br/>$1 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Aftercare Fund, this Budget provides our ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen a sum of 
<br/>$14.9 million in the Aftercare Fund, an increase of $2.49 million from $12.4 million before.  That 
<br/>increase is due to the increase in beneficiaries, as well as increase in the medical and administration 
<br/>costs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise the commitment and sacrifices of our disciplined service men 
<br/>and women.  We salute and render our respect to those who have served our country and with honour 
<br/>and grace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Department of Public Enterprises, to further improve the performance of our public 
<br/>enterprise entities, $8 million has been allocated in the proposed budget, which is an increase of $1.8 
<br/>million  from  the  previous  year’s  allocation.    Our  public  enterprises  should  be  making  significant 
<br/>contributions to the economy.  There is a long way to go before they can match the output and results 
<br/>and return on investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Department of Information and National Archives, the dissemination of accurate and 
<br/>timely information is critical to the Coalition Government, to ensure that the people of this country 
<br/></span><span>are well informed on matters of national interest, Government services and initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department has been allocated $3.2 million.  Although this is a reduction by $800,000, 
<br/>it does not mean that the Department will not be able to carry out its core functions.  Basically, the 
<br/>reduction is due to the removal of the allocation for Qorvis, which was employed by the previous 
<br/>Government and now have been terminated.

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Department  of  Environment,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  their  total  budgetary  allocation  is 
<br/>$7.263 million for the fiscal year 2023-2024, an increase from $3.4 million in the previous year.  This 
<br/>budget  provides  for  the  Government’s  commitment  to  safeguarding  our  natural  environment  and 
<br/>ensuring  ecosystem  integrity  through  an  integrated  expedient  approach,  ensuring  an  equilibrium 
<br/>between sustainable development and economic prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Climate Change Division, the increasing severity and frequency of natural disasters is 
<br/>disproportionately  impacting  Small  Island  Developing  States.    The  Climate  Change  Division  has 
<br/>been allocated a total  of $2.56 million  in  the financial year,  an increase  of $1.4 million  from  the 
<br/>previous year’s allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, $6.5 million is being provided by development partners, viz-a-viz, the European 
<br/>Union  contributing  $5  million  for  the  implementation  of  the  Climate  Change  Act  2021,  and  an 
<br/>additional  $1  million  from  the  Australian  Government  to  support  climate  finance  project 
<br/>implementation.    I  would  like  to  assure  the  nation  that  the  implementation  of  the  Budget  will  be 
<br/>closely monitored.  The Government will consider the possibility of having a mini budget after six 
<br/>months, to ensure better realignment and in preparation for the change in the financial year to the 
<br/>normal calendar year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  must  continue  to  be  mindful  of  the  challenges  associated  with  the 
<br/>geopolitical  environment,  risks  associated  with  climate  change,  and  other  headwinds.    We  must 
<br/>always  be  conservative  in  our  approach  and  put  into  place  necessary  measures  and  implement 
<br/>appropriate adaptation and mitigation actions to ensure our resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  have  said  earlier  in  my  State  of  the  Nation  Address,  the  Coalition  Government  is 
<br/>committed to a united, progressive and prosperous nation.  I am confident that after next few days of 
<br/>intense debate and discussions, this august Parliament will finally endorse this Budget for the good 
<br/>of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May God bless us all and may God bless Fiji, and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- A very good afternoon to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  May I also 
<br/>take this time to extend greetings to the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Members of Cabinet, 
<br/>my fellow Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament  and  members  of  the  public  in  the  gallery  today  and  everyone  tuning  into  today's 
<br/>proceedings; </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is, indeed, an honor to be on my feet this afternoon and to offer some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>insights on the Budget as Assistant Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to first thank our honourable Prime Minister for his steady 
<br/>and calm leadership where he has very ably led us over the last few months and has, at every step of 
<br/>the way, kept the people at heart.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance for 
<br/></span><span>providing the people of Fiji with an exceptional Budget - tough but balanced, given the dire economic 
<br/></span><span>landscape that our Coalition Government has walked into.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, for his leadership as we both took on our roles to lead the 
<br/>newly established Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.  And most of all, I would like to thank 
<br/>our people of Fiji, for their continued confidence, patience and prayers.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget has gone down very well for the people of Fiji.  Over the past 
<br/>few days, I have received phone calls from my relatives in Ra, expressing their satisfaction of the 
<br/>National Budget delivered on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023, saying and I quote, “</span><span>Lovara, keimami marau a nia 
<br/>dina na kaicimu na i ‘uva‘uva vou ni lavo ni Ma‘ani‘u</span><span>”. [We, your relatives, are really happy about 
<br/>the Government’s new Budget]  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the old “order”, tourism was always lauded as a critical economic 
<br/>priority because of the returns through tourism receipts to Fiji. Yet, the government arm of Tourism 
<br/>was squashed together with certain economic services pillars of Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, and especially under this “New Budget for a New Fiji” lies the core of our Coalition 
<br/>Government's unified purpose, that despite any odds, we will rebuild Fiji together with our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Coalition  Government  will  reconstruct  from  the  ashes,  the  aging  and  broken 
<br/>infrastructure for water, health, roads and electricity that had failed the nation over the past 15 years 
<br/>because  of  the  "fake  facts"  that  were  dramatically  lectured  about  in  this  same  parliamentary 
<br/>Chambers previously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Coalition  Government  is  now  like  a  father  of  a  rebellious  and 
<br/>disobedient child, having to deal with massive bills after his child's spree of wild parties resulted in 
<br/>unpaid tabs, and damages to property, vehicles and people.  That is the parallel of the unfortunate 
<br/>situation we are now in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it further pains me to know the shocking spike to our national debt situation, 
<br/>that we also carry on our shoulders. As a mother, I cannot in good conscience agree that this </span><span>dinau</span><span>
<br/>(debt) burden should be passed down to our children or to our generations to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- You will have your chance, honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why this Budget will be supported and passed because we want to 
<br/>carry the obligation to clear the path for a fighting chance at a brighter future for our children and 
<br/>their children now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Quite apart from our debt servicing where almost a billion dollars of taxes is to pay for the 
<br/></span><span>interest  and  principal  repayments,  there  are  other  debts  and  unfulfilled  promises  that  we  have  to 
<br/></span><span>honor, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I refer in this instance to the $45 million for the film tax rebate that we now 
<br/>have to treat as expenditure. The Coalition Government and the taxpayers are honoring that debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I refer to the $53.3 million </span><span>dinau</span><span> (debt) to the University of the South Pacific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(USP). The Coalition Government and the taxpayers are honouring that debt as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also refer to shameful saga around the Lautoka Swimming Pool and 
<br/>Govind Park in Ba, where construction had colossal project overruns.  My colleague, the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Housing and Local Government has the unfortunate job of cleaning this up. But it is the 
<br/></span><span>Coalition Government and the taxpayers who will honour those projects to completion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  finally  refer  to  the  assault  on  our  pension  funds  where  the  Fiji 
<br/>National Provident Fund contributions were unilaterally reduced from 18 percent to 10 percent. It 
<br/>now falls on our Coalition Government and the taxpayers to rectify that, with the restoration to the 
<br/>18 percent contribution, coming online at the beginning of next year.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it really challenged me to realise that as our honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>shared,  one  dollar  out  every  four  dollars  in  this  Budget  is  instantly  diverted  towards  servicing 
<br/>Government debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  laid  out  those  real  scenarios  out  because  all  the  "wild  party"  expenses  of  the  parallel 
<br/>illustration  mentioned  prior  about  a  father  cleaning  and  paying  up  after  the  unhinged  acts  of  his 
<br/>rebellious child, means the same scenario for us as a Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  means  that  we  have  to  make  drastic  adjustments  to  squeeze  our 
<br/>expansionary  plans  for  the  Ministry  of  Tourism.    Like  that  father  cleaning  up  after  his  child,  he 
<br/>probably had to skip meals and adjust other due bill payments, in order to bail his child out. That is 
<br/>the similar situation that we are presently in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  understand  that  the  economy  is  projected  to  return  to  pre-pandemic 
<br/>levels this year, in large part due to the resilience and rebound of the tourism industry.  However, we 
<br/>are also very cautious about the headwinds ahead, and the slow but steady steps we need to tread, in 
<br/>the coming years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a number of initiatives that have been welcomed by the tourism industry, including 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the simplified dual-VAT rate system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, although departure tax is set to increase, the transparent announcement and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>phased approach to the increases, has made a difference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  tourism  stakeholders  tell  us  that  what  they  appreciated  the  most  was  the  consultative 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approach taken by the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After all, it is very apparent to most in this country that even though it will be hard, we all 
<br/>have to take a hit in order to start restoring and recalibrating Government revenue that was badly 
<br/>manipulated by wrong policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker in  our Coalition Budget,  the Ministry of Tourism and Civil  Aviation is  being 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocated a total budget of $52.3 million, comprising of: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$37 million to Tourism Fiji; 
<br/>$5 million to Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji;  
<br/>$1.9 million to Domestic Air Subsidy; and  
<br/>$5 million to Vanua Levu Tourism Development Project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are fully appreciative, Mr. Speaker, that tourism is what has aided our recovery. While 
<br/>the Coalition Government is making efforts to diversify the economy as we should, we will still take 
<br/>care of tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the $30 million allocated for tourism marketing, the Ministry fully intends to continue 
<br/>to  maintain brand presence in  our traditional markets,  while pursuing emerging markets, who we 
<br/></span><span>project to bring in greater yields.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within this budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be hosting and encouraging major events that 
<br/>amplify the Fiji brand in the global market. In November this year, Fiji will proudly host the first 
<br/>Spartan event to solidify our capability to host a very different tourist audience.  Spartan in Paradise 
<br/></span><span>introduces an Australian obstacle course to a new setting – Fiji.  The obstacle course will be held at 
<br/></span><span>the Aviva Racecourse in Sabeto, Nadi, from 9</span><span>th</span><span> November to 12</span><span>th</span><span> November of this year.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1079 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, equally important is the Ministry’s oversight role of the Civil Aviation Authority 
<br/>of Fiji (CAAF) in travel and tourism, and the overall safety of Fiji’s flying public within our sovereign 
<br/>airspace.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The CAAF is not always at the forefront, but our people out there are our unsung heroes as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they audit, regulate and monitor our airspace in compliance with international regulations 24/7. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  were  quite  pleased,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  last  month  the  International  Civil  Aviation 
<br/>Organization (ICAO) completed its Universal Security Audit Programme for Fiji and gave us a clean 
<br/>record of significant security concerns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, no significant safety concerns were identified in our safety 
<br/>audit. This is a major boost to Fiji’s aviation ranking, which will, undoubtedly, add to our credibility 
<br/>as a safe tourist destination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these achievements signify that while Fiji may be small, we can stand shoulder 
<br/>to  shoulder  with  global  leaders  on  aviation  safety.  This  is  a  testament  to  the  high  calibre  of 
<br/>professional and passionate people at CAAF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  like  most  other  industries  grappling  with  skills  shortages,  highly  specialised 
<br/>sectors  like  aviation  are  no  exception.  Therefore,  CAAF  will  recruit  and  fill  critical  technical 
<br/>positions that are absolutely vital to maintaining our aviation safety standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In keeping with the changing landscape, Mr. Speaker, CAAF also intends to digitise processes 
<br/>and functions that allow for efficiency and accuracy of operations, so that we are on par with the rest 
<br/>of the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are also very honoured to announce that the ICAO Liaison Office for the 
<br/>Pacific  Small  Islands  Developing  States  was  earlier  endorsed  by  Cabinet  and  $500,000  has  been 
<br/>allocated towards it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ICAO Office will help raise aviation safety standards in the Pacific considerably, and 
<br/>when  we  host  this  Office,  it  will  provide  the  platform  for  easier  access  to  ICAO’s  expertise  and 
<br/>assistance, which is also the conduit for Civil Aviation Authorities with our Pacific neighbours.  This 
<br/>ICAO Office will become operational very shortly at the CAAF Compound in Nadi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is only an upfront and honest Coalition Government like ours that will start 
<br/></span><span>its terms by laying their cards on the table, like we have with this Budget.  Where other countries 
<br/>have to manage strong public outrage for increased taxes and austerity measures, our people of Fiji 
<br/>are in stark contrast – calm and fully aware of why this Budget is this way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our people understand because they remember our Members of Parliament who 
<br/>used to endure ridicule and scorn when they sat on the other side, pleading for cautious spending and 
<br/>wiser decision-making.  The people remembered all that.  In fact, many expected a much tougher 
<br/>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The beauty of this Coalition Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is its simplicity and its attempt to share 
<br/>the burden and spread the cushioning effects among the majority of our most vulnerable.  Even we, 
<br/>the Members of Parliament, have had to take cuts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, Mr. Speaker, takes us back to the fundamentals. High roller investors are not 
<br/>going to bother investing here, if they cannot be guaranteed that their taps will have water, or that

<div><span>their lights will stay on 24/7, or if the state of our roads means they will require new car parts every 
<br/>month.  This Budget is realistic and is made for Fiji - not Singapore, Australia or any other developed 
<br/>country that we had all been promised that we would take after. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  can  almost  guarantee  one  allocation  in  the  Budget  that  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>colleagues across the aisle will not complain about and, that is, the Parliamentary allocations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  with  my  fullest  concurrence,  I  wholeheartedly  support  the  2023-2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What happened to Grace Road?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Do not open your mouth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You started off with a running commentary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise to speak on the 2023-2024 National Budget 
<br/>presented by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, 
<br/>National  Development  and  Statistics,  and  I  wish  to  commend  him  and  his  team  for  this  Budget.  
<br/>Likewise, I would like to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his most constructive 
<br/>and a good critique of the Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that one has to do one’s job as best as one can, and we think there 
<br/>are certain areas of Government activities which are going to be subject to some criticism which we 
<br/>feel is valid and ought to be made and ought to be answered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  has become  the  tradition  in  this  Parliament  that this  is  an  occasion  to 
<br/>debate far and wide which is a good thing because this one opportunity, we have to speak out on 
<br/>issues which, perhaps, during the year, we will not be able to have this opportunity again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  outset,  we  would  like  to  record  our  disappointment  with  this 
<br/></span><span>Government by not allowing the Opposition to fully participate in the debate and to vote.  It looks 
<br/>like they have the fear of defeat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Budget  is  expected  to  provide  the  key  economic  input  by  the 
<br/>Government to run the nation and provide Fijians with the financial basis for a secure and prosperous 
<br/>life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  past  six  months  of  the  Coalition  Government,  we  have  seen  no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leadership, no vision and definitely, no way forward for Fiji and its people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During this time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister said, “We will have a mini 
<br/>budget”. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance said, “No, I will manage 
<br/>with the FijiFirst budget so no mini budget”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  next  round,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  said,  “I  am  not  aware  of  the  Cabinet 
<br/>approval for the </span><span>kalavata</span><span> budget for the National Economic Summit”. The honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister and Minister of Finance said, “Do not worry, I will come back from India and sort it out”. 
<br/>The Office of the Prime Minister said, “Reduce the grant for the Pacific Polytech from $2.6 million”. 
<br/>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance said, “No, I will still give them $2.6 
<br/>million”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Just listen!  I am going to reveal everything today, just wait.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By the way, I will talk about your involvement with Grace Road later on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of this Parliament, this amount was given before the Budget, 
<br/>so no mention of that in this Parliament before us.  In this Budget, the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>gives another $1 million, bringing the total to $2.26 million for Pacific Polytech.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>will speak more on that later on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prime  Minister  asked  the  Girmit  Expenditure  Audit  and  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance said, “It is alright, no need to provide”.  The honourable Prime Minister, in one 
<br/>of the functions, said, “15 percent VAT is too much”.  Right or wrong, honourable Prime Minister?  
<br/>You said that.  The honourable Minister of Finance said, “No, it is alright.  I will listen to Mr. Naidu, 
<br/>the Chairman of the Fiscal Review Committee and the World Bank”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  theme  for  this  Budget  is,  “Rebuilding  our  Future  Together”.    One 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wonders, what is being rebuilt? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Stop modelling in the USA! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When one set of Coalition Ministers say something, the others state the opposite.  The theme 
<br/>should have been, Mr. Speaker, Sir, “I say, you say no Budget”.  And what can they build, let alone 
<br/>rebuild, when all the Coalition Government is doing is fulfilling one of the other of their partners’ 
<br/></span><span>election promises, no matter what the cost will be to the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As this Budget makes clear, it will be the poor, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the working class who 
<br/>will bear the bulk of suffering under its increased cost of living with no vision to take the pressure 
<br/>off these poor people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  proudly  announced  the  municipal 
<br/>elections.    Even  in  the  recent  consultation,  he  talked  about  conducting  municipal  elections.    The

<br/>implemented or done, what do you call those type of people?

<br/>the  evidence  of  where,  when  and  which  day  and  time  did  I  promise  the  $110  because  that  is  a

<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- This is the problem with this man.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government, the media and the Sugar Industry Unions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are silent on the suffering of the poor cane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame, shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Cane  access  roads  have  not  been  maintained  as  there  is  little,  or  no

<div><span>The Ba Sugar Mill has continuous breakdowns, but the honourable Minister for Sugar says, 
<br/>“All is well”.  Well, all is not well for the poor cane truck drivers, who sleep in their trucks, hoping 
<br/>to deliver their loads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very convinced that this industry will collapse under this honourable 
<br/>Minister.  I have been going through the Budget book, trying to find out where the allocation for 
<br/>Penang Mill is.  There is nothing mentioned there, not at all.  So, who is telling lies now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Government Member interjects)

<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Wait for his speech!

<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I hope he is not drunk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2023-2024 Budget is not a Budget about the people, but it is a Budget 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about keeping badly thought-out election promises that come at a huge cost to the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no hesitation in raising my opposition 
<br/>to a Budget that does not deliver to the ordinary Fijians.  As a policy document, it is a ‘cut and paste’ 
<br/>effort that only addresses the fiscal issues as seen by the Coalition Government.  As independent 
<br/>reviewers, like the ANZ Bank, have pointed out, this is a Budget directed by election promises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said in my introduction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget aims to fulfill badly thought-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out promises that serve only political ends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- This is a bad Budget that all Fijians will regret when their pockets are hit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the coming increases in everyday cost of living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget does not keep track of the concerns and issues that people have 
<br/>on the ground, and it does not take into account the huge economic blows that Fiji has taken through 
<br/>national disasters and the pandemic in the past few years.  It is a Budget that will badly impact the 
<br/>working poor and those who are socially disadvantaged, including those in rural and maritime areas, 
<br/>as well as our older citizens.  The Budget fails to deliver in key areas through a lack of innovative 
<br/></span><span>policies, backed by key budgetary allocations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this includes employment generation, skills training, investor friendly fiscal 
<br/>inputs,  and  the  list  goes  on.    The  Budget  has  the  same  old  approach  based  on  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government’s design to rubbish and remove all things put by the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is not a forward looking and innovative approach, as it means that the Budget, like the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1085 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coalition  Government,  is  reactionary  and  politically  motivated,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  rather  than 
<br/>following  sound  fiscal  policies  based  on  forward  planning  to  meet  current  and  projected  needs.  
<br/>Instead, Sir, the Budget is a backward-looking Budget rather than a forward-looking Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister of Finance has admitted, this is a Budget based on 90 percent 
<br/>diagnosis of previous conditions, leaving only 10 percent for the future consideration.  A nation’s 
<br/>economic health is not the same as diagnosing measures for the economic health of an individual.  
<br/>Any first-year economic student will tell you that.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget, as it stands, shows the lack of finance and fiscal policy expertise 
<br/>in  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  Coalition  Government  leadership,  led  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  The 2023-2024 Budget does not carry any initiatives of policy direction 
<br/>that provides balance to recover and grow Fiji for all Fijians.  This is a Budget, Sir, that is not only 
<br/>backward-looking, but  is back-tracking and does  not  provide the platform for  Fiji  to  enter  a new 
<br/>phase  of  economic  recovery  from  the  fiscal  hits  that  we  had  undertaken  and  at  the  time  when 
<br/>recession threatens nations globally from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no policy statement in the Budget on the global context within which 
<br/>we must frame our national budget.  This is a serious lack of consideration by the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance and, again, shows inexperience and underlies his first budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that this Budget is seen and heard for what it is, that it does 
<br/>not provide for the people of Fiji in a sustainable and equitable manner.  This is evident in the massive 
<br/>rise in cost of living, as the wide range of goods and services that will go up, apart from the 22 zero-
<br/>rated items.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The massive return of $446 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will not come from the air, but from 
<br/>the pockets of ordinary Fijians, whose lives cannot be satisfied by the limited zero-rated items.  Each 
<br/>government  is  mandated  to  provide  for  and  deliver  to  the  people  of  Fiji,  but  this  Coalition 
<br/>Government is showing that it does not listen to the people.  Sir, I wonder what or who was being 
<br/>listened to during the public consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Definitely, not the poor people of Fiji, not the poor rural villages and not the poor sugarcane 
<br/>farmers.  Their voices and views are definitely not represented in this Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The 
<br/>keeping of promises through this Budget is a selective one, it does not aim to bring all the people and 
<br/>the nation together in driving forward the economy.  As the poor sugarcane farmers will find out with 
<br/></span><span>the leaving out of guaranteed minimum tonnage price, as well as the total lack of other incentives 
<br/></span><span>and allocations for the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are no policy initiatives on employment generation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that are new or 
<br/>directed at  specific targets  or situations.  The business  initiatives are going  backwards with  more 
<br/>restrictions and more red tape on the way for investors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if one were to measure Government intentions through this Budget, then it 
<br/>is evident that the Government is not quite as serious about promoting investment and development 
<br/></span><span>as it makes out.  There is little of substance when it comes to civil service reforms, upskilling, key 
<br/></span><span>alignment, nor their budgetary allocation to ensure that ordinary Fijians get the best return from the 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The employment and training initiatives to counter the movement of Fijians, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, into sustainable employment pathways to Australia and New Zealand is not properly structured, 
<br/>nor is  it accountable.  There are no committed pathways to  retraining or upskilling to  meet  these

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>demand areas.  There are no plans for site-based or locality focus training to meet local needs and 
<br/>demands.  The training needs or the maritime areas are specific to the area, as are that of the other 
<br/>rural  and  remote  areas.    Instead,  we  have  the  same  old  centralised  and  institute-based  classroom 
<br/>model training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to say a few words on Tertiary Education and Loans Scheme 
<br/>(TELS).  This brings me to the issue of continuation of training programmes that was made available 
<br/>free-of-charge under the FijiFirst Government, apart from increased places  for TVET Programme 
<br/>under TELS.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  scholarship  system  that  replaced  TELS,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  selling-out  of  the 
<br/>principle for equal access to high education, just to keep a badly thought-out election promise.  The 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance is simply keeping his job by keeping these promises.  In fact, he 
<br/>knows very well that the scheme such TELS, as they may be, is the only way to have a system that 
<br/>provides the most accessible means to higher education and for all the people of Fiji.  Its replacement 
<br/>is  a  system  that  many  suffered  under,  and  he  would  know  of  the  discrimination  faced  on  racial 
<br/>grounds, as he was a student from the 1980s and 1990s.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I think the honourable 
<br/>Member is fanning racial hatred by lying because this is what they did before the Election.  They said 
<br/>there will be a race-based scholarship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 62, this man who had lied before, is now using Parliament 
<br/>to incite racial hatred.  That is what he has done, because nowhere in the Budget, nor in this fiscal 
<br/>supplement, that says that the scholarship for any of those programmes will be based on race.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What is your Point of Order?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Under Standing Order 62(4), it has to be dealt with.  So, he 
<br/>has done it twice - first, he lied, he misled Parliament and now, he is inciting racial hatred by referring 
<br/>to the scholarship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Offensive! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Offensive!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we will take note of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, I have not finished, honourable Member.  I am still referring to the 
<br/>Point of Order that was raised by him.  So I am asking the Secretary-General to take note of that, 
<br/>because that is the second time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You may continue, honourable Bala. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance will have his time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to respond, so do not waste Parliament’s time.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1087 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we meet in this august Parliament, this past week, the US Supreme Court 
<br/>threw out a Presidential bid by Joe Biden for a student loan forgiveness  programme.  The bid by 
<br/>President Biden was also to keep an election promise.  The US Supreme Court ruling challenged 
<br/>both,  the  legality  of  such  a  programme,  as  well  as  its  implications  for  past  and  future  loans  and 
<br/>scholarship programmes, as well as the fiscal position of tertiary institutions who were the biggest 
<br/>beneficiaries  of TELS, as well as the students  who receive equal  and unlimited access  to  tertiary 
<br/>education, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             The  ruling  in  the  US  showed  that  the  political  party  concentration  under  the  guise  of  a 
<br/>government policy cannot and should not be allowed to transform and replace the whole policies that 
<br/>are of benefit for the largest number of people.  No racial things here!  Just to keep election promises, 
<br/>why should Fiji be any different, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know he has wasted my good time and tried to…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said in my opening remarks that I note with great concern the allocation 
<br/>of $1 million to Pacific Polytech with a justification that it will help solve some of these training 
<br/>issues.  Sir, one must ask, what is this Institute and what is its credibility?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my investigation shows that it is currently operating from less than adequate 
<br/>premises  and  facilities.   These  allocations  is  almost  the  same  in  total  of  $2.26  million,  as  I  had 
<br/>mentioned earlier on, when compared to the allocation to University of Fiji, an established institution 
<br/>with professional staff.  Pacific Polytech is run from hired space with no record of enrolment, courses 
<br/>being run and graduates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            (Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            HON. P.K. BALA.- You keep quiet, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Higher Education Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            HON. P.K. BALA.- Currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of its landlords - Shree Sanatan Dharam 
<br/>Prathinidhi Sabha, is engaged in a legal case against Pacific Polytech.  Honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>Sir, I ask you to have a thorough investigation in this scam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- For what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            HON. P.K. BALA.- This is not less than a scam, it is a scam because no one knows about this 
<br/>institution, no one knows it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance has some serious questions to answer 
<br/>on both allocations made to Pacific Polytech.  It is an issue that should also concern his Coalition 
<br/>partners and, in particular, the honourable Prime Minister and the other two Deputy Prime Ministers, 
<br/></span><span>that  it  undermines  the  reputation  of  their  Government  and  in  all  honesty  most  of  all,  that  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Minister of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my concluding remarks on this is rather unsupporting, a note of gender bias 
<br/>and unequal allocation and lack of policy vision for our youth and sports, which I will give a written 
<br/>speech during my gatherings just after this Parliament session because of time constraint, and this 
<br/>lack of inclusivity and sound fiscal vision in this Budget applies to all Fijians, Sir.

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can only hope that the people of Fiji are keeping a close watch on the lack 
<br/>of leadership evident in this backward-looking Budget and this is a Budget that will only cause more 
<br/>pain for all Fijians in their day-to-day lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say, thank you and I would also like to thank Parliament for your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>patience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the 2023-2024 Budget debate 
<br/>which was delivered by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics on 30</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023. This is the Budget for the New 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me begin by saying that the most valuable lesson that the FijiFirst government has given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is how not to run government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out of everything that they claim to have left us behind as our inheritance, this is the most valuable, 
<br/>“How not to run a democratic government”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance 
<br/>for delivering what I termed as a “Transparent and Inclusive Budget”, with  well thought-out budget 
<br/>policies  to  grow  the  economy,  assisting  the  vulnerable,  improving  livelihoods,  improving  basic 
<br/>infrastructure and maintaining Government assets that had been forgotten or ignored in the last 16 
<br/>years, as the previous Government was just trudging along since 2006 in survival fire-fighting mode 
<br/>rather than taking care of the very people who voted them into power.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst government was either unwilling or unable to do anything other than move from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crisis to crisis because they refused to consult those who might have been able to help them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the lessons of leadership that I learnt as a young Subaltern is that a good leader should 
<br/>be able to discern good advice from the bad, and once the said advice is received, a leader needs to 
<br/>act swiftly because the lives of people under his or her leadership depends on it. That lesson, Sir, is 
<br/>applicable in all facets of life, including the sacred duty of leading our people towards a prosperous 
<br/>future, whether it be at village or local community level, or at the national level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  thought  it  pertinent  to  observe  that  just  by  delivering  the  Budget 
<br/></span><span>Address on time speaks volumes of the Peoples Coalition Government’s commitment to correct the 
<br/>many mistakes that had become the norm of the previous Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliamentarians having to wait for more than one hour in the night for the former Minister 
<br/>for Economy in this Chamber to deliver his Budget Address was a complete abuse of the process.  
<br/>This side of Parliament commits itself never to follow that road of tyranny and bullying. On this side 
<br/>of the Parliament, we will commit to take note of the concerns of all members of our great nation, 
<br/>and that, Sir, includes honorable Members on the opposite side of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  start,  the  Peoples  Coalition  aims  to  attain  improvements  in 
<br/>accountability  and  government  performance  by  combining  transparency  with  an  invitation  for 
<br/>nationwide  participation,  so  that  stakeholders  can  contribute  ideas  and  information  to  the  public 
<br/>sector. Transparency is a means to strengthening governance.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1089 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Committee, and pre and post Budget consultations were just part and parcel of the People’s 
<br/>Coalition Government’s commitment to uphold a transparent process where everyone is involved. 
<br/>‘Fiscal transparency’ were the operational words.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unlike the previous administration, for the past 16 years, only the “Two” would control the 
<br/>entire process, and everyone sitting across them would have to wait patiently to receive what was 
<br/>offered  by  them  -  a  totally  undemocratic  process  that  they  tried  to  sugarcoat  with  handouts  and 
<br/>giveaways, treating the people of Fiji like little children, as they smashed through the norms of good 
<br/>parliamentary procedure to achieve what they wanted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Coalition Government, there was no secrecy in the entire process. 
<br/>The honourable Minister of Finance was openly discussing the needs to increase VAT to supplement 
<br/>our below-par revenue performance. This was backed by the Fiscal Review Committee after carefully 
<br/>assessing the available data, both from Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) and Fiji Bureau 
<br/>of Statistics (FBOS) and the input gathered from the various public consultations across Fiji. Nothing 
<br/>was hidden from the taxpayers of this country. We preached it, and we are living by it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the official poverty rate is 24.1 percent equating to 208,000 people who live 
<br/>below the poverty line.  As confirmed by the latest release from FBOS, 75 percent of those who live 
<br/>below the poverty line are </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, which is approximately 156,000 people, and the other 25 percent 
<br/>which is approximately 52,000 people belongs to other races.  In other words, 18 percent of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>are poor and other races constitute the remaining 6.1 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What do these statistics mean?  The previous Government had failed to empower every Fiji 
<br/>citizen to improve their livelihood but instead, provided handouts which temporarily addressed the 
<br/>symptoms  of poverty and left  the  roots of it very much intact.   That  is  why the poverty rate had 
<br/>increased. The Peoples Coalition will work towards reducing the poverty rate through sustainable 
<br/>policies and resilient infrastructures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 
<br/>has been allocated $29.1 million in the new financial year, which is an increase of $14.1 million from 
<br/>this financial year’s Budget. Major expenditures include the re-establishment of the Rural Housing 
<br/>Programme,  which  is  budgeted  at  $3.2  million,  and  the  Rural  and  Outer  Island  Development 
<br/>Programme at a tune of $2.6 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New housing schemes will be rolled out to our rural dwellers who meet the criteria set out by 
<br/></span><span>the Ministry.  On the other hand, the Ministry will work with other stakeholders to construct related 
<br/></span><span>infrastructures in the rural space, to improve livelihoods, facilitate trade, improve transportation and 
<br/>expand agricultural commodities which will all be funded under the Rural and Outer Island Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Surprisingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the decision by the previous Government to transfer the Rural 
<br/>Housing Programme under the Ministry of Housing and Community Development was a complete and 
<br/>utter  failure.  The  low  utilisation  under  this  Programme  speaks  volume  of  failed  policy  and  lack  of 
<br/>consultation with relevant stakeholders. Our rural dwellers were the ones that were adversely affected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ongoing  assistance  through  Self  Help  Projects  budgeted  at  $1  million  will 
<br/></span><span>continue, together with the Seafaring Entrepreneur Assistance Subsidy of $0.5 million, which has been 
<br/>transferred  from  the  Ministry  for  Finance  to  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and 
<br/>Disaster Management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Subsidy Programme, Government will assist applicants who have sufficient deposits for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>boats or boats with outboard engines.  We will review the criteria and address the gaps identified after

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the rollout of this Programme in the last two financial years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of rural roads improvements, Government has allocated $18.3 million for rural roads 
<br/>under the Fiji Roads Authority Budget. In addition, the ongoing Community Access Roads, Footpaths 
<br/>and Footbridges (CARFF) allocation under my Ministry is budgeted at $2 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  a  comment  on  the  former  Government’s  misguided  notion  of  employing  the  RFMF 
<br/>Engineers in road construction as conveyed to us this morning by the honourable Leader of Opposition, 
<br/>I call it misguided because the core role of the RFMF Engineers is to support the operations of the RFMF 
<br/>as a whole.  The major civil engineering works for national development is best left to the necessary arm 
<br/>of Government or the private sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture has also been allocated another $2 million for farm access roads and, 
<br/>unfortunately, the request has been sitting with Ministry of Agriculture for the last five years.  Again, the 
<br/>previous Government appeared not to prioritise the needs of our rural farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  the  Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  has  been  allocated  another  $2 
<br/>million for Cane Access Roads. This Government is committed to improving livelihoods for our rural 
<br/>dwellers.  We have set our sights on it, and we will do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and  Transport  was 
<br/>provided an additional $5 million for the re-establishment of the Public Works Department. This is done 
<br/>for three reasons: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To fast-track the maintenance of rural roads as and when required, given the high cost of 
<br/>contractors assigned to undertake rural roads improvement; 
<br/>the new set up will drive down the exorbitant cost charged by private contractors; and 
<br/>to build capacity in the Ministry, hence development in the rural space is not affected where 
<br/>the need to develop rural roads arises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On improving water infrastructure in the rural areas, the Ministry will continue with Rural High 
<br/>Risk Water Sanitation Project and Emergency Water Supplies with a budget of $1.1 million.  On the other 
<br/>hand, the Water Authority of Fiji has been allocated $8 million for the Rural Water Supply Scheme, rural 
<br/>water carting and rainwater harvesting system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources has been allocated $3.5 million for development 
<br/></span><span>of groundwater resources, including reticulation to our rural populace.  Another $0.5 million is allocated 
<br/></span><span>under Head 50 to improve sanitation for villages and settlements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has allocated $1.4 million to support the harvest of pine woodlots 
<br/>in Lakeba and Muani in Kadavu accordingly. This is budgeted under the Ministry of Forestry which will 
<br/>assist  the  two  schemes  in  selling  pine  logs  to  a  reputable  company  in  Viti  Levu.    It  is  all  about 
<br/>empowerment.  We want our resource owners to grow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is also committed to improving service delivery to our people. The 
<br/></span><span>Ministry has been provided with additional funding for our manpower needs which will strengthen our 
<br/></span><span>services to our rural dwellers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the increased allowance to the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span>, </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> and </span><span>Liuliu ni Yavusa</span><span>
<br/>in the new financial year, the Advisory Councillors will also be getting an additional $27.50 per month 
<br/>and Council Chairmans will receive an additional $13 per month.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1091 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those under the Social Pension Schemes between the age of 65 years to 69 years, aftercare 
<br/>recipients and other pensioners will receive a 15 percent increase in allowances and those receiving Social 
<br/>Pension Schemes from the age of 70 years and above will receive an additional 25 percent in the new 
<br/>budget. No one is left behind, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the maintenance of rural offices and quarters was not given a priority by the 
<br/>previous Government.  What we inherited from the FijiFirst government were buildings that were falling 
<br/>apart.  Roofs  were  leaking  and  floors  in  dismal  condition.  Some  buildings  were  beyond  repair.  The 
<br/>Ministry has been allocated $1 million for the renovation of quarters in the rural areas.  Civil Servants 
<br/>occupying these quarters are delighted to hear this commitment from the Peoples Coalition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health and Medical Services has been allocated $2 million for the upgrade of 
<br/>Subdivisional Hospitals, Health Centres and Nursing Stations, with another $1 million allocated under 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture for the maintenance of rural offices and quarters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support rural trade, the Agricultural Marketing Authority has been provided 
<br/>with $5 million in the new financial year.  Part of this funding is for the procurement of agricultural 
<br/>produce from the rural and maritime community where exporters cannot reach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji Crop  and  Livestock Council  has been supported with $0.7 million to establish more 
<br/>commodity associations in the rural space and partner with the Ministry of Agriculture to train our farmers 
<br/>on best agricultural practices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Co-operative  Dairy  Company  Limited  will  receive  $5  million  to  support  our  dairy 
<br/>farmers in the procurement of new breed from overseas, milk subsidy, improvement in  pastures  and 
<br/>training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the disaster management space, the New Zealand Government will provide $3.2 million as 
<br/>cash grant in the 2023-2024 Budget, with the overall goal of reducing vulnerability to natural disasters 
<br/>and enhance Government’s ability to conduct core disaster risk reduction and disaster risk management 
<br/>functions.  The Ministry is also being allocated with an additional $0.2 million as Disaster Risk Reduction 
<br/>Support, which will allow the Ministry to mobilise resources as and when required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  highlighted  earlier,  the  Peoples  Coalition  is  committed  to  improving 
<br/>livelihoods of our rural people and at the same time, build and improve resilient infrastructure in our rural 
<br/>space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just before  I  take my  seat,  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  would like to propose that the future  of  Fiji’s 
<br/>prosperity lies in the rural area and the commitment of this Government in developing it is indicated by 
<br/>the allocation made to it in the 2023-2024 Budget, which assures us that the economic future of the nation 
<br/>and all its people look increasingly steadier and brighter. This is the Budget for the new Fiji, and we are 
<br/>rebuilding our future together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the 2023-2024 Budget and fully support its implementation.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament, please, allow me to make my contribution, as well as share my ideas and thoughts on the 
<br/>National Budget presented to Parliament and to the nation by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on that note, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for delivering the first 
<br/>ever Budget of the Coalition Government.  Also, this is all new to me as it is also an honour for me, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, to deliver my first Budget response in this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it took me eight times to listen to the Budget Address and try and put things into 
<br/>perspective as to how this Budget will have an impact on the lives of ordinary Fijians and to the thousands 
<br/>of Fijians at the bottom of our economic ladder. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Fijians living in villages, maritime islands, rural communities and informal settlements, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, all they wanted to know is whether they will spend more or fork out more money to cater for 
<br/>their daily expenses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know very well, Mr. Speaker, after listening to the National Budget Address, the answer to 
<br/>that is, yes, they will have to pay more. And to thousands of Fijians who might be watching today’s 
<br/>Parliament  session  -  to  any  fisherman,  construction  worker,  housekeeper,  labourer,  garment  industry 
<br/>worker and to all Fijians who are at the grassroot level of our economy, you have to find a way to meet 
<br/>the 15 percent VAT living standard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  put  it  in  the  most  simplest  way  possible  for  all  Fijians,  the  Biman’s 
<br/>Budget does not care whether you put food on the table or not, in one way or the other, the reality is, 
<br/>it is like telling the people of Fiji whether you like it or not, live with it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Who is going to pay the debt? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my view, the increase in VAT to 15 percent is a stab in 
<br/>the back of the supporters of the Coalition Government and to the thousands that voted for them.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  what  I  do  not  understand.    The  very  people  that  voted  for  you  to  be  in 
<br/>Government, the very vote that gives you power, the very vote that gives you the privilege to prepare 
<br/>this Budget and in return a slap of 15 percent VAT right on their faces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this really rebuilding Fiji together or is it a way where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Prof. Prasad is telling PAP and SODELPA Members, “let us drown Fiji together.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Isa lei. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for PAP and SODELPA Members on the other side, is the 
<br/>VAT increase to 15 percent what you campaigned for?  Were your voters made aware that when you 
<br/>come into power the honourable Minister of Finance will burden them with a hefty increase?  No 
<br/>ordinary citizen of this country will ever make a submission to Government to increase VAT.  So the 
<br/>question I ask the honourable Minister of Finance… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Easy way out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- …was this a submission from just are few business people?  To honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prof. Prasad and to all Ministers and Assistant Ministers, I want to remind you that we are here for 
<br/>the people and because of the people, we are here.  That is why in whatever we do, we need to help 
<br/>them,  assist  and  develop  them  and  not  create  more  financial  burden  that  will  demoralise  them 
<br/>financially and economically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1093 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do understand the great need for Government to collect 
<br/>more revenue but allow me to ask the honourable Minister of Finance as an economist, is there no 
<br/>other option to generate more revenue rather than making the people suffer?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Easy way out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to challenge all Government Members on the other 
<br/>side of Parliament, how is it possible that you will just sit there and watch ordinary Fijians suffer in 
<br/>the  hands  of  the    Biman  Budget  and  give  freeway  to  some  multi-million  dollar  water  bottling 
<br/>company by not paying tax for seven years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Now,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please  allow  me  to  bring  your  attention  to  the 
<br/>allocation  and  initiatives  announced  for  the  new  and  most  productive  Ministry  ever  since  the 
<br/>Coalition Government came into power and that is the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a proud Fiji Melanesian descendant, may I remind honourable Charan Jeath Singh, the 
<br/>honourable Sakiusa Tubuna is looking at me, honourable Viliame Gavoka and the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister of the promises made to the various ethnic groups, especially to the more than 40 Melanesian 
<br/>communities around Fiji that a scholarship will be introduced to cater for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget Address has created more confusion amongst various ethnic groups because you 
<br/>are  the  very  ones  who  initiated  the  idea  of  ethnic  based  scholarships  when  they  were  accessing 
<br/>scholarships  introduced  by  the  previous  government  that  does  not  discriminate  them  by  race, 
<br/>ethnicity or gender. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It was a loan, not a scholarship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- After all the lies during the election campaign, you decided, “okay, we will 
<br/>put TELS and Toppers in the microwave, reheat it, try to make it brand new and a new name but  
<br/>little did they know, it is the same one as the last one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a while ago, the honourable Minister of Finance demanded to the honourable Bala about 
<br/></span><span>evidence of the promises made that the ethnic based scholarships will be revealed.  I am happy to 
<br/></span><span>reveal the evidence in my speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs earlier this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year, on 7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 stated on FBC News, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Ministry will provide scholarships, cultural activities and provide funds for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strategic engagement and partnership.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> earlier this year, again, you stated, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There is a great need for a budget for Multi-Ethnic Affairs scholarship.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is that the evidence you were looking for, honourable Minister of Finance?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is different, that is for sugar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the evidence of blatantly lying to the public because 
<br/>none of this was announced in the Budget.  Honourable Minister for Sugar, do not worry, we know 
<br/>it is not your fault, maybe the honourable Minister of Finance saw that you will be a big threat to his 
<br/>voter base, that is why he did not  approve that scholarship.  However, I would like to advise the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  and  the  likes  of  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  in  the  Prime 
<br/>Minister’s Office, if you know that you will not deliver multi-ethnic scholarships, please have the 
<br/>courtesy to inform the various ethnic groups beforehand and not create confusion and dissatisfaction 
<br/>amongst them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Honourable Tabuya, you look at your People’s Alliance promises before you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come into Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Address, I was waiting for the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>to  give  details  to  the  allocation  of  the  Public  Service  Broadcast  Fee  or  PSB  Fee  because  I  was 
<br/>somehow surprised the same amount of funds provided in the previous Budget.  This does not make 
<br/>any sense.  At the start of this year, there were wide speculations and media reports that there will be 
<br/>an investigation into the spending of the PSB Fee by FBC.  Where has that investigation gone, or 
<br/>have they swept it under the carpet because the former CEO of FBC provided all the relevant facts 
<br/>and  figures  to  the  new  Chairman  and  the  Board  which  they  totally  ignored  and  instead  opted  to 
<br/>misinform the media about the operations of FBC? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no indication nor clarification that the fund will go 
<br/>directly to FBC or whether some other media organisation will share the PSB grant or fee.  If this is 
<br/>the case, then I am worried about FBC and the detrimental impact it will have on the company and 
<br/>its workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the change in the Board and leadership of FBC, there have been a huge 
<br/></span><span>turnover of staff because some have opted to resign rather than being included in a toxic working 
<br/>environment.  In what company will you have the chairman of the Board using the boardroom nearly 
<br/>every week as  his  office?  According to  those staff who have resigned  (nearly 20 of them), their 
<br/>families are made to suffer because the new FBC leadership have stopped their overtime pay and no 
<br/>longer paid for working during the weekends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J. USAMATE.- That is your legacy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  why  we  need  clarification  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance because FBC in terms of justification, they have every right to the full PSB fee 
<br/>because of the nature of their work.  Sir, FBC is the only media company that provides both television 
<br/>and radio stations and most of all, they are the only one that provide AM service to the rural and 
<br/>maritime islands.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A. BIA.- May I ask the honourable Minister of Finance, please give clarification of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this PSB grant or fee or whether other media companies will be given the allocation as well?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I turn our attention to the allocation for </span><span>Walesi.</span><span>  I am again surprised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to see that they have allocated funds for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We have reduced it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- You still allocated funds for them. The Government has continuously called 
<br/>for an inquiry into </span><span>Walesi</span><span>.  After gathering so much information from conspiracy theories on social 
<br/>media, however, now we are still waiting for that investigation and concrete evidence to prove their 
<br/>case.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is coming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Copy and paste.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a must we heavily invest in </span><span>Walesi</span><span> because the people 
<br/>of Fiji have benefited greatly from this initiative.  For the first time ever, many Fijians living in the 
<br/>maritime islands and rural communities are now able to watch and cheer their Fijian rugby players 
<br/>representing their country.  We have seen numerous videos on social media about people watching 
<br/>rugby games through </span><span>Walesi </span><span>app from their farms and wherever they are in Fiji.   That is </span><span>Walesi</span><span>, and 
<br/>the people of Fiji are not sure whether all these conspiracy theories will bring an end to </span><span>Walesi</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I conclude with the honourable Minister of Finance, eight times after 
<br/>listening to his Address, I am bored of the fact that you continuously dwell in the works of the past 
<br/>government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- </span><span>Isa</span><span>, missing us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Honourable  Prasad,  you  have  already  spent  more  than  six  months  in 
<br/>Government, the people of Fiji do not want to hear you bragging about the past, they want to hear 
<br/></span><span>your ideas and policies for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- There are no new ideas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- May I conclude with a quote and also an advice to all of us as Members of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament in this Parliament: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There is no point looking back when you are doing something great.  The only 
<br/>time you need to look back is how your progress is going on.  Other than that, do not 
<br/></span><span>look back, just stay in the moment and seize this moment.  Staying in this moment and 
<br/></span><span>looking forward can only make you reach the following levels.  When you get stuck in 
<br/>the past, it will become a burden.  Carrying extra weight in your head is always not a 
<br/>good  idea  when  you  have  the  vision  to  do  something.    So  let  go  of  everything  that 
<br/>weighs.  The past has no power, and the future is before you to make the most of it. Stay 
<br/>in this moment and do not look back.”

<div><span>In  acknowledgment,  I  would  like  to  start  by  first  acknowledging  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/>honorable Prime Minister.  We have had a Coalition Government for some time, so to have a strong 
<br/>and experienced leader has been instrumental in achieving all that we have, including the 2023-2024 
<br/>National Budget that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I would also like to commend the honourable Minister of Finance, 
<br/>my fellow Deputy Prime Minister, the Permanent Secretary and Team at the Ministry for Finance.  I 
<br/>thank them not only for delivering an exceptional Budget, but for doing it consultatively and on time.  
<br/>At this juncture, I can see the strategy of the other side and that is to hit and attack the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance but the last time I checked, he is made of steel and all that will be futile.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Since when? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Personally for me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I salute the political will with 
<br/>the  Coalition  Government  to  write-off  TELS  and  bring  relief  to  some  53,700  youths  or  53,700 
<br/>families.  We do not care and not worried on the makeup of this 53,000 whether they are Indo-Fijians 
<br/>or </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> or Others.  It is for all the young men and women of this nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.-  Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Providing scholarships to the extent that we have in this Budget is 
<br/>unprecedented in the history of this country.  Sir, $148 million is being allocated for scholarships.  
<br/>You will know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that from that side of Parliament I spoke about this, campaigned 
<br/>for this, write-off TELS, provide free tertiary and this Coalition Government is almost equal to free 
<br/>tertiary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This side of Parliament at that time, Mr. Speaker, used to ask, where are you going to get the 
<br/>money from?  We can do it.  So, let the whole country know that the Coalition Government has the 
<br/>political will to lift the burden from the men and women of this country and also provide almost 
<br/>unlimited scholarships going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Only time will tell.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It will, say thank you for now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the backdrop of the Budget was not easy for many 
<br/>reasons  and  it  is  important  we  acknowledge  them.    Of  course,  there  is  the  obvious  managing 
<br/>expectations, but we made a collective commitment for change for the sake of our people and we 
<br/>will see to it that we deliver. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the pandemic is over, its socio-economic impacts remain. This was

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  gravity  of  it.    We  are  still  challenged  by  the  repercussions  of  growing  geo-political  conflict, 
<br/>increasing cost of living, commodity prices and a fragile supply chain.  On the domestic front, there 
<br/>was  of  course  poor  financial  management  by  the  previous  administration.    So  much  so  that  this 
<br/>Government, its citizens and the generation to come is inheriting an unsustainable debt.  The irony 
<br/>here is that, for the last decade and a half, the other side of Parliament at almost every sitting claimed 
<br/>they were inheriting a failed public system.  But in those years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would think 
<br/>they made an effort to move this nation forward.  They did not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Instead, we have a public debt of close to $10 billion, almost the size of the economy and 
<br/>about a quarter of this Budget.  A burden that this Government is now inheriting.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>ultimately, our job as Government is to provide.  To provide essentials services to villages who are 
<br/>yet to receive steady water and electricity, upgrade our deplorable medical facilities, allow quality 
<br/>education, create jobs and provide our most vulnerable with better social protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, we need to spur economic activity by easing the regulatory environment to 
<br/>encourage investments, look at new areas of growth such as the ICT sector, and investing in tourism 
<br/>marketing  to  remain  competitive.    That  essentially,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  means  striking  a  balance 
<br/>between supporting the socio-economic wellbeing of our people with the pressure of cost of living 
<br/>and investing in decent jobs and economic security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the economic state, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Minister of Finance had shared, 
<br/>we are looking at an 8 percent economic growth.  There used to be this boast from the other side of 
<br/>economic growth that was highly inflated, in actual fact, there was only 3 percent but today we are 
<br/>learning that it will be hovering around 8 percent this year under the Coalition Government fueled 
<br/>by the strong recovery of the tourism sector … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Then Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- … and the positive flow on impacts to other sectors of the economy.  
<br/>This essentially means we are returning to pre-pandemic levels.  This is great news, but our socio-
<br/>economic objectives are much greater than returning to what once was.  There is no doubt that we 
<br/>will have as many visitors to our shores as we did in 2019, if not more., but that is not a measure of 
<br/>success.    The Budget focuses on “Rebuilding our Future Together.”  It is, in all its essence, the 
<br/>foundation  of  this  Budget  and  those  to  come.    It  considers  macroeconomic  stability,  financial 
<br/>sustainability and accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my maiden speech, I said that we, as the People’s Coalition Government, 
<br/></span><span>made a commitment to rid this nation of false promises that our people have been beholden to for far 
<br/>too long.  We made a commitment not just to hear but to listen and act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will no longer pass overnight legislations that take away the rights of the indigenous in 
<br/>the name of investments. We will no longer rob our people of freedom of expression in the name of 
<br/>media  safety.  We  will  no  longer  deny  Fijians  the  right  to  be  represented  and  heard.    This  is 
<br/>democracy.  So, as you have heard in Parliament and seen, we delivered on what we owed our people 
<br/>immediately such as reinstating jobs, convening stronger more meaningful dialogue and moving past 
<br/></span><span>grudges that cost us our education and our friendship with the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, I hear about Polytech.  Polytech is very simple, Sir.  It replaces the technical colleges 
<br/>that was a failure by the previous Administration. That is it, to replace something that was a disaster.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1099 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- On the tourism sector, Mr. Speaker, globally, international arrivals 
<br/>are estimated to have reached 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2023 with over 
<br/>230 million tourists having travelled more  than double the same period of 2022.  For Fiji this year, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, we have had five consecutive months of year-on-year growth compared to 2019.  That 
<br/>means from January to May, we got more visitors than we did in the same months pre-COVID. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sectoral performances, although varied, reflect the recovery in the domestic economy, but 
<br/>where we are today is a direct result of tourism. The perception remains clear. The tourism industry 
<br/>is what will take us through the next few years.  When tourists come and spend money, that not only 
<br/>feeds into the hotels bottom line or to governments tax revenue, it goes into the pockets of the taxi 
<br/>driver who picked them from the airport, from the farmer who sold 20 kilogrammes of tomatoes to a 
<br/>restaurant who then invests in their children’s education.  It is not a standalone sector, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>it is central.  It supports agriculture, fisheries, construction, manufacturing, creative arts, et cetera.  
<br/>We need to view tourism as an engine that can support other socio-economic sectors with a focus on 
<br/>opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Assistant Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation shared what businesses 
<br/>and the private sector need more than anything for business continuity is consistency and confidence.  
<br/>In terms of the Ministry’s allocation in the 2023-2024 National Budget, the Ministry for Tourism and 
<br/>Civil Aviation is allocated a total Budget of $52.3 million.  The big-ticket items include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism Fiji Marketing ($30 million) and Operations ($7 million); 
<br/>Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji ($5 million); 
<br/>Domestic Air Subsidy ($1.9 million); and 
<br/>Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme ($5 million). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tourism sector is a sector that has over the years contributed to 40 percent 
<br/>of our national GDP, creating more jobs directly and indirectly that any other sector.  So, to support 
<br/>a  sector  as  crucial  to  the  Fijian  economy  as  tourism  requires  greater  Government  support.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  by  establishing  a  dedicated  Ministry,  we  are  giving  the  industry  the  support  and 
<br/>recognition they deserve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I joined six months ago, Mr. Speaker, we had a combined staff complement of about 
<br/>10.  Despite this limitation, we have managed to deliver key programmes.  These two Departments 
<br/>(Tourism and Civil Aviation) were previously under already huge portfolios where they were almost 
<br/>invisible.  In this Budget we will fix that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism, Mr. Speaker, was under the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport.  
<br/>It was merely a department among 10 others.  The industry that is contributing 40 percent to GDP 
<br/>was  hidden  away  amongst  10  other  departments  in  a  Ministry.    The  Coalition  Government  gave 
<br/>recognition  to  tourism  and  set  up  the  Ministry  for  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  on  its  own.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, with this increased budget and we will ensure to do more and deliver better services to 
<br/>our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  community  focus,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  is  allocated  $105,000  for  beefing  up  its 
<br/></span><span>engagement with the industry and with communities ($100,000 for tourism consultation and $5,000 
<br/></span><span>for tourism awareness).  In the new financial year, the Ministry will work closer with the communities 
<br/>who have shown willingness and ability to be a part of the tourism industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  starts,  we  have  re-instated  the  position  of  Roko  Tui  Saravanua  who  has  already  been 
<br/></span><span>instrumental in creating better understanding and support systems with </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities.  We 
<br/></span><span>will work with development partners to look more seriously at how we can connect farmers to hotels.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will work with villages who have natural assets like waterfalls, farms, culture and traditions so 
<br/>that we are not only disperse the benefits of tourism but diversify our tourism products offering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Vanua  Levu,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  years  we  spoke  about  diversifying  and  spreading  the 
<br/>tourism dollar but in the past decade we have made no real measurable progress.  Tourism is still 
<br/>concentrated from the Coral Coast to Nadi, in the outer islands and in Suva.  Mr. Speaker, another 
<br/>undertaking  of  the  Ministry  in  the  new  financial  year  is  the  implementation  of  the  Tourism 
<br/>Development  in  Vanua  Levu  Programme.  This  was  recently  approved  by  the  World  Bank  of  the 
<br/>Executive Directors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Programme is valued at US$200 million spread over 10 years, essentially looking at the 
<br/>sustainable economic growth of the Vanua Levu economy, as well as Taveuni, through destination 
<br/>development,  investments  in  resilient  infrastructure  and  essential  services  and  improved  tourism 
<br/>enabling  environment  and  growing  institutional  capacity.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  within  the  next  few 
<br/>months, we will begin the first phase on implementation that will run from one year to six years at a 
<br/>value of US$61.5 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this phase, we will implement critical projects to improve access and climate resilience of 
<br/>essential services such as drainage, sewage and transport infrastructure.  This includes the Labasa 
<br/>and Savusavu domestic airports as well as an upgrade to the 95-kilometre road connecting the two 
<br/>towns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Tourism Fiji, a key role of the Ministry is to promote Fiji as a tourism destination.  In the 
<br/>2023-2024 financial year, Tourism Fiji, our marketing arm is allocated an increase marketing budget 
<br/>of $30 million from $22 million.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, restoring Tourism Fiji’s budget is not with the 
<br/>intention  to  return  to  how  things  were  three  years  ago.    It  takes  into  account  much  stronger 
<br/>competition  now  especially  with  Asian  markets  that  are  cheaper  such  as  Thailand,  Malaysia, 
<br/>Philippines and the Pacific now fully open.  In the last financial year, the marketing budget was $22 
<br/>million which is when Tourism Fiji began its marketing activities more heavily.  At this time, not all 
<br/>markets were open such as Japan and China.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tourism Fiji will focus marketing activities across our 
<br/>key markets - Australia, New Zealand, North America, Europe, United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, 
<br/>India, Singapore, Japan and the Pacific.  In line with Fiji Airways’ connectivity plans, we will also 
<br/>create brand presence in the new markets such as Korea and Canada.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways 
<br/>has already restored all our direct routes to its 22 destinations with plans to explore more routes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  point,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  Fiji  Airways  who  created  history  by  being 
<br/>recognised as the Skytrax Best Airline in Australia and the Pacific.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this financial 
<br/>year,  Tourism  Fiji  in  partnership  with  Fiji  Airways  launched  the  “Fiji  where  happiness  comes 
<br/>naturally” campaign.  In the new financial year, the campaign will be more heavily promoted to bring 
<br/>out our brand values. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, new strategic initiatives will be delivered by Tourism Fiji such as Loloma Hour 
<br/>– a project to talk about cultural and environmental respect when visitors come to Fiji and capitalising 
<br/></span><span>on  transit  visitor.    It  is  expected  that  this  will  result  in  around  2,000  to  5,000  visitors  per  month 
<br/></span><span>staying over for three nights and spending in the local economy.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these marketing 
<br/>efforts will be supported by an operational budget of $7 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  an  allocation  of  $5  million  to  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Fiji,  we  will 
<br/>continue our Domestic Air Services Subsidy with a budget of $1.9 million in the new Budget.  In the 
<br/>previous Administration, Civil Aviation came under the Solicitor-General.  It was hidden away

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1101 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>somewhere.  This very key part of the tourism equation was hidden away under Solicitor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Cost cutting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- They had no idea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- And the Board did not even function.  It has all been restored with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the proper resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Air Services Subsidy, this is to ensure that uneconomical air routes of Lakeba, Cicia, 
<br/>Moala, Vanuabalavu, Koro, Gau, Kadavu and Rotuma and possibly new routes such as Ono-i-Lau 
<br/>are catered for and connected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are on the right track here. We know this because as the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance shared, this Budget was not prepared within the walls of the top floor of Suvavou 
<br/>House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Level nine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It was shaped on the most urgent needs of our people, from cost of 
<br/>living to access to better infrastructure and services.  It  was shaped on the expert opinions of the 
<br/>private sector and independent committees such as the Fiscal Review Committee.  More importantly, 
<br/>it was shaped not only to keep our Government Ministers and people happy for the new financial 
<br/>year alone, but to build a strong foundation for the years to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  point,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  re-establishments  of  the  Cabinet  Sub-
<br/>Committee  on  the  Budget,  led  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  my  fellow  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers where we collectively contribute to the finalisation of the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the 2023-2024 National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver by response to the motion that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is before Parliament and that is the Appropriation Bill that includes the 2023-2024 National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the outset, Sir, there has been plenty names that this Budget has been labelled.  The 
<br/></span><span>Labour Party Leader calls this Budget a “flat budget”.  The honourable Leader of the Opposition this 
<br/>morning  called  it  a  “microwave  budget”,  but  again  there  is  nothing  new.    The  Budget  that  was 
<br/>delivered by honourable Minister of Finance, given that he had been our Opposition spokesman for 
<br/>Finance in 2014 to 2015.  After a while in 2016, we had to remove him because he was not doing a 
<br/>good job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We brought in honourable Aseri Radrodro during our time in SODELPA to deliver the key 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Nice try. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- It is a deceptive Budget by a very confused Government.    The 
<br/>platform that the honourable Minister of Finance should have started with was to start with a Mini-
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>1102 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget, that should have laid the platform for his National Budget, but he had opted to re-deploy 
<br/>funds  from  here  and  there  and  that  took  away  necessary  services  for  other  key  areas  such  as 
<br/>agriculture, health that this particular Budget is trying to resolve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, again the message in this particular Budget is very simple.  The Budget is trying to 
<br/>increase revenue and at the same time it will increase the deficit but no infrastructure.  Sir, 72 percent 
<br/>of the Budget is on operating expenditure and only 28 percent is on capital expenditure.  That is the 
<br/>reality of this particular Budget and how it looks like.  The people will suffer more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given it is a large spending Budget and the biggest budget deficit outside the pandemic (as I 
<br/>have said), FijiFirst never took our debt to more than $10 billion even during the pandemic.  This 
<br/>Budget will set a new record in Fiji’s overall debt that will come to $10.5 billion in 2024.  Who else 
<br/>has done that?  It will be your record honourable Minister of Finance and people will need to know 
<br/>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  came  out  from  the  Ministry  for  Finance  Quarter  Report  (January  to  April)  that  the 
<br/>Government  had  accessed  round  about  $223.2  million  in  borrowings;  that  was  by  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government.  They are borrowing at a much faster rate, 12.4 percent increase, more faster than the 
<br/>same period last year.  If that is allowed to go on, I do not know how high we will go in terms of our 
<br/>debt.  This debt theory put by the Government during its campaign is to try to scare people that the 
<br/>debt is really high, but if you put debt into perspective, most of our domestic debts are just with FNPF 
<br/>and other local debts that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  helps  investments  through  FNPF  where  the  Government  loans  from  FNPF  and  when  it 
<br/>repays, it benefits those employees who have funds at FNPF.  It strengthens our economy because 
<br/>the money circulates locally. If you look at the Budget that we have here, we have a deficit of $636 
<br/>million.  I asked the honourable Minister of Finance where will we get the deficit from?  We will 
<br/>loan again from FNPF, the very same institution that you used to say that the FijiFirst government 
<br/>was killing.  The deficit of this Budget will be funded again from a local institution through the local 
<br/>debts that are there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, again, the honourable Minister of Finance is very fond of trying to compare the economic 
<br/>status during COVID-19 with the rate of debt per GDP that is 88.8 percent, but pre-COVID it was 
<br/>48.8 percent ratio and that is where FijiFirst had been taking our economy to, to a booming stage.  
<br/>The revenue that the FijiFirst government had earned at that time pre-COVID was $2.8 billion.  Even 
<br/>last year, FRCS was able to collect $1.8 billion in revenue and now you have a very ambitious budget 
<br/></span><span>in trying to put out that FRCS will try to collect $3.7 billion.  I think they will not even reach their 
<br/></span><span>target  and  at  the  same  time,  the  deficit  will  be  there,  you  will  loan  more  and  there  will  be  no 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we were looking into, what people were expecting where more investment will be there 
<br/>in the private sector.  In terms of construction of roads, there is no capital expenditure here to say 
<br/>that there will be construction of roads or housing that will create employment and also gain more 
<br/>income so that they can spend through their consumption that will help in the economic spin.  That 
<br/>is not the environment that is provided to by this particular Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, we also see that there is more duplication and wastage in this Budget.  On 
<br/>one hand, you have PWD, on the other hand you still have FRA.  I do not know what PWD will do, 
<br/>probably soon it will turn into (not only Public Works Department), but it will also be doing some 
<br/>Private Works Department too.  These are some of the things that we really need to focus on and put 
<br/>money into areas that will really assist our people.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1103 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other deception that is in this Budget is the idea that if you increase or give rise in VAT, 
<br/>it will automatically generate more revenue.  It will depend on the environment, Sir, and also the 
<br/>consumer behaviour on how they spend.  Most of the listed items in the zero VAT items was initiated 
<br/>by FijiFirst and only one addition, that was, prescribed medicine but prescribed medicine was already 
<br/>free through the Free Medicine Scheme by the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people are limited with choices, given they would like to buy items that are outside of 
<br/>the zero-rated list that they would like to enjoy, but the rich people will be able to afford the taxes 
<br/>that will be coming through VAT of 12 percent.  Also, it will be unfair for the poor people that the 
<br/>rich people too will also benefit from the list on the zero-rated items.  These are the few things that 
<br/>are there about this particular Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What about Grace Road?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The other thing that we really need to look at is the argument put 
<br/>forward by the honourable Prof. Prasad that Government is paying off debt.  I think that is always 
<br/>refinanced  and  never  at  any  time  that  FijiFirst  has  not  serviced  our  debt.    During  their  time  of 
<br/>government, it has serviced their debt and never at any time that FijiFirst has defaulted in making 
<br/>debt repayments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the things that the people of Fiji need to hear because these are some of 
<br/>the lies that are spread, that puts that scary picture that FijiFirst has really taken this country down 
<br/>the path that they are trying to project.  What we wanted to see was the change of economic direction 
<br/>on moving more investments into private sector and also in strengthening the various sectors that are 
<br/>related.  We hear that the honourable Minister of Tourism is trying to boast about tourists.  I want to 
<br/>take him back to the last few years when we were talking about the Fiji Airways guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yeah! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- When we were at this side of Parliament, the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Tourism did not support that guarantee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- If it was not for the FijiFirst government .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Look at him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- If it was them ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- … all our aeroplanes would have been sold or eaten. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- All eaten! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- But we are thankful for the decisive leadership of the former Prime 
<br/>Minister and the former Minister for Economy that enabled to keep and secure our airline industry 
<br/>because those who were relying on it, not only those who work  in the tourism industry, but if you 
<br/>look down at the hotels, they got filled up and landowners will benefit through land rentals.  These 
<br/>are some of the things that the leadership at that time, when they were in the Opposition they could 
<br/>not see, but they are trying to boast about that when they are now in Government.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The honourable Minister of Tourism in his speech said that they 
<br/>are expecting 8 percent economic growth to GDP, but let me take him back to the Supplement.  The 
<br/>Supplement says on Page 4, paragraph 1.3 (listen properly honourable Gavoka) and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Following the strong recovery last year, the domestic economy is poised to grow 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>further by 8 percent this year.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Recovery last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That is due to the strong economic recovery path that was laid 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down by the FijFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That is not because of the last six months, it is because of the  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic recovery policies that were laid down by FijiFirst post-pandemic that had led to this figure 
<br/>that will come up.  Again, I reiterate the words of the honourable Leader of the Opposition that we 
<br/>have inherited a better Fiji than the other government in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- We have given you a developed Fiji, we have given you a Fiji that 
<br/>has recovered from a pandemic. I do not know whether this particular Government will be able to 
<br/>manage our economy during a pandemic or no? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- I do not know whether this particular Government will be able to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>manage our economy if they are hit by a Category 5 tropical cyclone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- They do not have any plan and this is a problem.  The only plan 
<br/></span><span>that they had in their first Budget when everyone was expecting more growth to our economy, they 
<br/>put the burden on our people, the poor to be more poorer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- You do not have new ideas on how to generate revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- No ideas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- How to grow the economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Clear the VAT.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1105 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Just increase the VAT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management in his 
<br/>speech  today  was  talking  about  that  most  of  our  indigenous  people  (</span><span>iTaukei),  </span><span>70  percent  are  in 
<br/>poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes, that is correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Copy and paste. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Because of you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D BULITAVU.- It is inconsistent and contradicting to  with what the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister had said that the measurement of poverty in our rural areas is quite different because 
<br/>people might not be earning income but they are able to put food on the table because they have their 
<br/>subsistence economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- They do farming, they do fishing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- These are some comments by the honourable Minister. It is not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the reality of what is faced on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The other thing, Sir, that I would like to look at too, the increase 
<br/>in VAT also threatens our foreign currency debt management. As inflation, it puts pressure on the 
<br/>Fijian  dollar,  it  could  be  leading  to  devaluation  and  other  increases  in  nominal  value  of  debt 
<br/>obligation. These are some of the things that the honourable Minister did not look into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things about foreign debt is that it should balance out with the foreign currencies 
<br/></span><span>that are coming.  We had policies during the FijiFirst government through the Duavata Initiative with 
<br/></span><span>the Australian Government through PALM where people go overseas and through the remittance, 
<br/>send money back. But now the policy has changed where they are taking their family too. We should 
<br/>be seeing that in the future, there will be less remittance that will be collected by Fiji because people 
<br/>are moving out.  We cannot see anything in this particular Budget that will create employment and 
<br/>force people to stay.   There are no incentives to the private sector to create employment, so we do 
<br/>not lose our people - brain drain and our skills drained overseas.  These are some of the things that 
<br/>should have been in this Budget so that we can ensure that our economy is stronger and also more 
<br/>money circulating through our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me go into the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I see that the Budget has 
<br/>increased from 14.3 percent in 2022-2023 to 38.6 percent in the 2023-2024 Budget, 95 percent of the 
<br/>activities in that particular Head in SEGs 7 and 9 are under Requisition (R).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who controls that? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  The  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  upon  the  request  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, what I was looking at is, more innovation in terms of the policies that should have 
<br/>come in, that should have moved our </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>institution to a more fully autonomous, self-funded and 
<br/>self-governed.  These are some of the things that we should have seen incoming rather than putting 
<br/>more money into areas that were not properly researched.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  can  get  more  models  from  the  Papua  New  Guinea  Mineral  Resources  Development 
<br/>Company  Limited  (MRDC)  where  landowners  are  partnering  with  government  in  terms  of  their 
<br/>resources.    These  are  some  of  the  economic  models  that  we  have.  Nothing  in  this  Budget  will 
<br/>empower landowners in terms of climate change or moving into carbon trading. The model that is 
<br/>currently used by the Maori Land Commission in terms of buying credits with landowners in Fiji, I 
<br/>think we have not taken advantage of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  thing  that  we  see  in  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affair’s  budget  is  the  economic 
<br/>development per province. I would like to suggest that we look into a more better model that not only 
<br/>centres wealth through the province but trickles down to the </span><span>tikina, yavusa, mataqali</span><span> and right into 
<br/>the  </span><span>tokatoka</span><span>  where  most  of  them  are  registered  landowners.    The  model  that  was  started  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister back then through the Commercial Loan Scheme, I think it only centres 
<br/>around the provincial council.  Most of the provincial council companies now are still holding onto 
<br/>assets and the business that should have benefited those </span><span>Vola ni Kawa Bula</span><span> (VKB) members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  see  the  allocation  of  a  Village  Improvement  Scheme  and  we  look  forward  to  that 
<br/>implementation  in  various  villages  and  also  buildings  and  structures  to  be  constructed  that  are 
<br/>Category 5 or cyclone resistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We see the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Land Development Grant that is with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, it 
<br/>used to be with the Ministry of Economy before.  We would like to ensure that the Minister looks 
<br/>into other specialties like surveyors, those that will do the scheme plan plus other things that will 
<br/>help the applicants.  Most of the applicants fail to meet the requirements because they do not have 
<br/>the funding to engage surveyors, et cetera, if the requirements can be lowered a little bit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that we see, there is a new allowance for the </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span>. The biggest 
<br/>question by some of the landowners in Vanua Levu, why did you not include the </span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali</span><span>
<br/>and </span><span>Turaga ni Tokatoka</span><span>?  Because most of the </span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali </span><span>or the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> have more land 
<br/></span><span>mass than the </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span>. Why are you only focusing on the  </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span>, when the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> obligations they do funeral and other </span><span>lotu</span><span> obligations at </span><span>mataqali</span><span> level and </span><span>tokatoka</span><span> level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that people are asking honourable Minister of Finance, if the Great Council 
<br/>of Chiefs had approved $200 for that allowance, why did you reduce it to $100?  This is the common 
<br/>question coming from the ordinary Fijians, the natives.  You have to tell them why you reduced it, 
<br/>because if the GCC had approved $200, why did you have to reduce it to $100. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Sir, the honourable Attorney-General and the Great Council of Chiefs.  The 
<br/></span><span>big blunder that he did when he had not introduced, given the GCC was abolished, and he should 
<br/></span><span>have introduced a Bill in Parliament in order for the GCC to be the authority to sit. I think this is a 
<br/>big  blunder  and  I  urge  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  due  to  the  few  legal  blunders  that  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General has done so far that has really threatened his leadership in terms of his 
<br/>decision and given that this legal advice has come from him, to change the Attorney-General.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  call  on  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  to  do  a  quick  reshuffle,  the  honourable  Filimone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vosarogo could be a better Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Or the honourable Lynda Tabuya is a better Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  This  is  the  Budget  that  is  being  put  forward  by  this  particular 
<br/>Government, again it is a painful Budget by a very confused Government. I do not know whether 
<br/>they will be able to collect the revenue that they have projected to collect.  They have increased debt 
<br/>and people will suffer more in this country because of the policies that this particular Government 
<br/>has put forward through this Budget.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not support the Budget, again because 
<br/>it is anti-people and anti-poor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow honourable Members.  I rise in support 
<br/>of the 2023-2024 National Budget which is termed, “The Budget for a New Fiji -Rebuilding our Fiji 
<br/>Together” and I take this opportunity to commend the honourable Minister of Finance for a well-
<br/>crafted, inclusive, balanced and responsible Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VANAWALU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition 
<br/>mentioned that the Budget is a “big spending” one but he did not mention that it is big on revenue as 
<br/>well.  If he looked carefully at both the revenue and expenditure, they were increased because of the 
<br/>need based on prioritized expectations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- While you only copy and paste? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- It is not politics, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Most or all the ministries, independent bodies and commissions 
<br/>have an increase in this Budget.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to state here that it is not a boom 
<br/>budget or a fluffy budget that they normally expect to be presented as happened in the past years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- By increasing VAT. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E. IMMANUEL.-  This Budget directs adequate resources with a clear game plan to 
<br/>fix our infrastructure, address our water problems, improve health facilities and lift public service 
<br/>delivery.  At the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget ensures that our vulnerable, including those

<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- By increasing VAT? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y.  IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I have spent  most of my  life working  in  the 
<br/>private sector and worked on corporate budgets and this was my first experience of working with the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance and a team of dedicated and qualified professionals at the Ministry 
<br/>for Finance to put together this National Budget.  I must thank the Permanent Secretary for Finance, 
<br/>CEO of FRCS and the entire team at the Ministry for their selfless service to the nation and for their 
<br/>collaborative  and  valuable  professional  support  towards  the  first  Budget  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  last  few  days,  we  have  received  overwhelming  support  for  the 
<br/>Budget  from  every  sector  of  society  and  economy.    Our  people  are  happy  for  being  genuinely 
<br/>involved in the Budget process and having their say in its formulation and for being actively informed 
<br/>in a transparent manner in the build up to the Budget presentation and deliberations.  Our civil society 
<br/>groups  have  welcomed  the  freedom  to  diagnose  the  Budget,  ask  questions,  demand  clarity,  and 
<br/>openly criticize any aspect of the Budget without fear.  This did not happen in the last how many 
<br/>budgets that we had.  Our media has been able to report freely, keep the public informed … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- … and the Government in check.  All this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has 
<br/>built  a  lot  of  trust  between  the  Government  and  our  people  and  is  inspiring  confidence  in  the 
<br/>economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our businesses have welcomed the Budget and the government’s commitment to improve the 
<br/>ease of doing business, simplify the overall tax regime and create a conducive and stable environment 
<br/>for business activity and investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our tertiary students and their families have welcomed the Budget for the relief that they have 
<br/>gained  from  the  thousands  of  dollars  relieved  off  their  shoulders.    Our  social  welfare  recipients, 
<br/>pensioners and ex-servicemen are happy with the increase in their allowances.   Our development 
<br/>partners have quietly applauded the Budget for being responsible and inclusive and in fact we were 
<br/>told that many in the Opposition are also happy, although they might criticise the Budget publicly.  
<br/>The honourable Leader of the Opposition’s reply seems to have been the same tired old rhetoric that 
<br/></span><span>the country has been hearing for many years and that led to the mess that you have had to deal with 
<br/></span><span>for 16 years.  In fact, there was very little in his response which makes economic sense to make an 
<br/>alternative Budget, again no Alternative Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nation has suffered a lot over the years and the Coalition Government 
<br/>has inherited a lot of challenges to deal with.  We inherited a large debt of close to $10 billion. I was 
<br/>surprised that the former </span><span>de facto</span><span> Leader of the Opposition cunningly engineered himself out of the 
<br/>Parliament, as he knew he had to answer for his ill-conceived and disastrous economic policies that 
<br/>led to this mess.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his own words, “the fact of the matter is” he will go down in 
<br/></span><span>Fiji’s history as the leader that took Fiji to the brink of economic disaster.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank God, we have had a change of government and a Prime Minister and a Minister of 
<br/>Finance who knows what they are talking about.   Our health facilities have deteriorated from the 
<br/>years of the lack of attention and under investments.  Our people have been struggling with daily

<div><span>water cuts.  Our roads, especially in rural areas have been left unattended and there have been no real 
<br/>focus on overall rural and maritime development.  These, they did not mention in their speeches.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sets the foundation. Again, I wish to repeat the foundation to 
<br/>deal with these chronic challenges.  We are confident that by working together with our people, we 
<br/>will eventually  bring back prosperity and development.  We will build a future that  is  secure  for 
<br/>everyone and make sure that our future generation do not inherit this mess.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our economy is rebounding quickly. People are optimistic and there is a renewed sense of 
<br/>hope. Our state coffers are being stabilised, revenue levels are picking up, wastage have been put 
<br/>under  control  and  we  have  redirected  taxpayer  funds  to  more  productive  purposes.    We  are 
<br/>strengthening mechanisms for proper scrutiny of projects before any funding is allocated to them.  
<br/>We are strengthening, monitoring and evaluation to ensure that we get value for money, and we are 
<br/>tightening processes to eliminate pilferage and cronyism which used to be a practice in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Office  of  the  Auditor-General,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  Chairman  of  the  Public  Accounts 
<br/>Committee, I am pleased that we are strengthening the Office of the Auditor-General. The Cabinet 
<br/>had  earlier  endorsed  the  review  of  the  Audit  Act  1969  which  will  strengthen  the  Legislative 
<br/>Framework and give the Office of the Auditor-General more independence towards external scrutiny 
<br/>of  how  public  funds  have  been  used.  We  will  ensure  that  the  Act  is  aligned  to  international  best 
<br/>practices, and we will do all this in a proper consultative manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  also  making  sure  that  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  is  well 
<br/>resourced and the budget allocation for the office has been increased to $7 million, an increase of 
<br/>$1.2 million. This increase will ensure that we are able to get in the right people with appropriate 
<br/>skills  and  with  proper  resources  to  keep  the  Government  in  check  with  proper  accountability  of 
<br/>taxpayer funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  clear  the  backlog  of  audits  that  have  been  dragging  for  some  time  under  the  previous 
<br/>government,  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  has  been  allocated  a  specific  budget  of  around 
<br/>$722,000 to fast track these pending audits through the engagement of external auditing firms.  A 
<br/>further $552,000 is allocated to clear the audit backlog for provincial councils and mataqali trusts.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will work together with the Office of the Auditor-General to make sure that 
<br/>moving forward audit reports are up to date and presented in a timely manner for Parliament scrutiny. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry for Finance is also undergoing several reforms to strengthen 
<br/></span><span>our Public Financial Management System, tighten compliance and promote good governance.  We 
<br/></span><span>are reviewing the legislative guidelines including the financial instructions, procurement regulations, 
<br/>finance  manuals  and  other  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  taxpayers’  resources  are  used 
<br/>efficiently and effectively.  The Ministry has adopted a new Public Sector Investment Programme 
<br/>(PSIP) guidelines which will assist with proper due diligence and cost benefit analysis in the appraisal 
<br/>and selection of public sector projects that was missing in past years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All capital projects will now go through these stringent processes which will ensure that we 
<br/>do not fund regrettable projects that do not give us the right return and value for money.  Through 
<br/></span><span>this process monitoring and evaluation will also be tightened with timely tracking of projects to make 
<br/></span><span>sure that we deliver projects on time and at the right cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The newly established Strategic Planning Office with a budgetary allocation of $3.4 million 
<br/>will beef up project coordination and delivery and support the overall development of a pipeline of 
<br/>bankable projects for future funding. The office will also start work on a new National Development 
<br/>Plan from next year.  The Planning Office, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will also ensure that we monitor the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation of the expenditure laid out in the Budget. There is so much to do, Mr. Speaker, that 
<br/>ministries will have to be in their feet to ensure that we are able to address so many challenges in 
<br/>every sector of our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also in the process of upgrading the Finance Management 
<br/>Information  and  Payroll  System  to  modernise  Government’s  accounting  system  and  replace  the 
<br/>almost two-decade old FMIS that has served its purpose now.  This transition will enhance efficiency 
<br/>with  availability  of  real  time  financial  data,  improve  responsiveness  in  budget  execution  and 
<br/>monitoring,  introduce  better  accounting  controls  and  mitigate  any  risks  from  cyber  security 
<br/>challenges. A funding of $14 million is allocated in this Budget and we would like to thank the Asian 
<br/>Development Bank for the technical support provided towards this transition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  for  Finance  is  also  in  the  process  of  automating  its  budget 
<br/>system with an allocation of $2 million.  This will be integrated with the new FMIS and make national 
<br/>budgeting more efficient and easier compared to the current manual system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Gender-Responsive Planning and Budgeting (GRPB) efforts have been a 
<br/>key feature of recent budgets. Building on this progress, 18 Government Ministries had implemented 
<br/>gender budgeting in this Budget.  These Ministries submitted their budgets that were better targeted 
<br/>at these beneficiaries ensuring a fairer and inclusive budget that takes into consideration the need to 
<br/>empower our women and ensure that public services are delivered equitably.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is exciting to note that the Ministry for Finance also has a Gender Equality 
<br/>Social Inclusion (GESI) Policy in place to facilitate the process to gender mainstreaming and gender 
<br/>responsive  planning  and  budgeting.  In  its  key  role  as  guardian  of  Government’s  finances,  the 
<br/>Ministry for Finance plays an instrumental part in ensuring that gender mainstreaming is reflected in 
<br/>all aspects of the budget cycle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also strengthening the Statistics Office and review is underway for 
<br/>the Statistics Act which will give more independence to the Fiji Bureau of Statistics. The Bureau is 
<br/>provided  in  increased  funding  of  $7.6  million  in  this  Budget,  an  increase  of  $3.2  million.    This 
<br/>increased funding will cater for the Employment and Unemployment Survey which will provide up 
<br/>to-date data on our labour force and employment conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  FRCS,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FRCS  is  an  important  arm  of  Government  and  supports  the 
<br/>delivery  of  Government  services  by  ensuring  that  taxes  are  collected  in  a  timely  and  transparent 
<br/></span><span>manner.  To equip FRCS with the right resources, an increased funding of $45 million is provided in 
<br/></span><span>this Budget.  This will support FRCS in implementing its newly unveiled Strategic Plan which is 
<br/>focused on FRCS becoming a customer centric organisation, an employer of choice and to support 
<br/>the overall transformation of FRCS including digitisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On TELS write-off, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was part of the working group that was set up to guide 
<br/>the write off the TELS debt and I am pleased that 53,750 students and their families are now relieved 
<br/>off  their  debt  and  is  replaced  with  a  fairer  and  less  burdensome  bonding  arrangement.    The 
<br/>forgiveness of $650 million of TELS debt reiterates the commitment of the Coalition Government’s 
<br/></span><span>promise to our students, who are the future of our country.  This ensures that their future is secured 
<br/></span><span>without the burden of debt and loan repayment as they start earning.  Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, all our students will have the opportunity to get a scholarship which they do not have to repay.  
<br/>This is the biggest relief that has been provided to thousands of our students and families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>Development and Empowerment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2023–2024 Budget also 
<br/>provides a range of measures to strengthen our </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>institutions and bring about improvements in

<br/></span><span>culture, customs, traditions and language.  Again, I thank God for the change in government, as had

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  In  the  2023–2024  Budget,  the  Coalition  Government  has 
<br/>recognised  some  of  these  needs    and  has  provided  its  support  to  the  14  provincial  councils  to 
<br/>effectively  address  the issues faced by our  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>communities.   For the 14 provincial councils, 
<br/>Government  will  now  cater  for  the  cost  of  operations  for  each  Council  which  used  to  be  funded 
<br/>through the </span><span>soli ni yasana. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to this, Government has increased the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>monthly allowance from 
<br/>$100 to $150 to support village leadership and ensure good governance and well-being in </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>village communities at a total cost of $2.1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the </span><span>Mata ni Tikina </span><span>quarterly allowance has also been increased by $150 per 
<br/>quarter for 262 </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span>.  The </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> is responsible for communicating and assisting 
<br/>the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>with the implementation of new government policies and strategies and address 
<br/>issues faced by each </span><span>tikina </span><span>to the </span><span>bose vanua </span><span>for the formulation of an efficient and effective dispute 
<br/>resolution mechanism in the village council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  has  also  recognised  the  importance  in  the  decision-making  role  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Turaga  ni  Yavusa  </span><span>and  therefore  have  provided  a  monthly  allowance  of  $100  for  648  </span><span>Turaga  ni 
<br/>Yavusa </span><span>under the Vanua Leadership Allowance allocation with a budget of $777,000.  That is just a 
<br/>start, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This will assist the leaders of the </span><span>vanua </span><span>in effective and efficient contribution 
<br/>to the </span><span>vanua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the 2023–2024 Budget, the Ministry for </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>Affairs has been 
<br/>allocated $2 million for Village Development Programme which aims to provide assistance for the 
<br/>physical  beautification  and  general  improvement  of  living  standards  in  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>villages  and 
<br/>settlements, including a further $4 million for </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land development.  All these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>will strengthen </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>development and empowerment and will support the overall development of 
<br/>our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Budget before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  Assistant  Ministers  and  fellow  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament.  I rise to speak on the 2023–2024 National Budget presented by the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance.  I wish to thank him and his staff for this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will begin my reply to the 2023–2024 Budget Address by offering my deepest condolences 
<br/>to the family of the 21 year old woman, who was the victim of the ferris wheel incident on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June.  
<br/>My  thoughts  and  prayers  are  with  the  families  of  the  two  who  are  still  in  hospital.    Someone’s 
<br/></span><span>negligence has caused the life of the young woman and lifelong injuries to the two young surviving 
<br/></span><span>women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to extend my sympathy to those teachers who are being 
<br/>witch-hunted  and  accused  by  the  Coalition  Government  of  being  FijiFirst  supporters  in  what  is 
<br/>quickly turning our beloved Fiji into a third world dictatorship where anyone who does not support 
<br/>their political views gets victimised.

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition for his words of wisdom which I fully support and wholeheartedly endorse the sentiments 
<br/>offered to promote economic growth and manage the affairs of the State prudently.  I also endorse 
<br/>the name given to this Budget by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and that is “microwave 
<br/>budget”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  a loyal member of the Opposition and representative of my people, I 
<br/>intend to highlight some issues related to the policy measures announced through this Parliament on 
<br/>30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023.  The primary objective of Government Budget should focus on boosting GDP growth 
<br/>by promoting balanced economic development and improving people’s standard of living.  That is 
<br/>done  by  considering  the  general  public  welfare.    However,  it  is  very  surprising  that  there  are  no 
<br/>innovative measures by the Coalition Government to grow the economy and address poverty in the 
<br/>2023–2024 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget is mainly based on the recommendations of the Fiscal Review 
<br/>Committee’s Report.  One of the recommendations of the Fiscal Review Committee that has been 
<br/>adopted is a VAT hike which will have a great impact on Fijian livelihood.  This directly affects the 
<br/>bread and butter issues of the Fijians and the Government has given no regards to the cost of living 
<br/>they were harping about in the election promises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  increase  in  the  rate  of  VAT  from  9  percent  to  15  percent  will  see 
<br/>consumer demand soften with the rise in cost of living.  The substantial increase in VAT will impact 
<br/>the cost of living and would mean that all Fijians will have to dig deeper into their pockets to make 
<br/>ends meet.  Many will just be left with the desire to buy but lack the ability to do so.  Fijians will 
<br/>suffer in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  boasted  in  this  
<br/>Parliament on 25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 that budget speech can be finished in an hour.  Did he finish his Budget 
<br/>Address in an hour?  No, he did not.  He took almost two hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Talk is cheap.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- It is easier said than done.  The honourable Minister of Finance could 
<br/></span><span>have  finished  his  Budget  Address  in  an  hour  if  he  had  spent  less  time  making  unjustified  and 
<br/>unsubstantiated remarks against FijiFirst and the former Prime Minister and Attorney-General and 
<br/>Minister for Economy.  Do not preach what is impractical, cheap line politics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister of Finance confirmed in his Budget Address that more than 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>90,000 people on social welfare will benefit from the allowances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- They are being removed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  I  am  sure  the  figure  provided  by  honourable  Prof.  Prasad  is  correct 
<br/>because earlier this year, honourable Sashi Kiran made a threatening statement by saying that many 
<br/>of the 96,000 plus welfare recipients should not be receiving assistance from the State.  It is almost 
<br/>seven months now since she made the comment.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  do  not  understand  on  what  basis  she  made  that  comment.    Does  she  have  statistics?  
<br/>Premature and baseless statements cause unnecessary panic and anxiety among people.  Comments 
<br/>should be backed by facts and figures and not on assumptions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, another promise not kept is that of doubling the welfare 
<br/>payment rates.  The biased increase from  $100 per month to  $115 and $125 per month for those 
<br/>between 65 to 69 years old and over 70 years old respectively is not only inadequate, bearing in mind 
<br/>the increase in VAT, corporate tax and high cost of living but it is also discriminatory. Why is there 
<br/>a  disparity?  What  is  the  rationale  behind  the  difference  in  increase?  Is  it  because  there  are  more 
<br/>people between 65 to 69 years old compared to over 70 years old?  The 2013 Fijian Constitution 
<br/>prohibits discrimination by age, yet, the Coalition Government has decided to do exactly the opposite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, National Federation Party promised to the people of this nation that in first 
<br/>100 days the salaries of Government Ministers would be slashed by one-third.  There was no mention 
<br/>of salary deduction in the honourable Minister’s Budget Address. He only spoke on the reduction of 
<br/>Government Minister’s allowances; promise not delivered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Another lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was expecting an increase in the allocation of food 
<br/>vouchers for rural pregnant mothers. The reason, the cost of living will go up with the hike in VAT 
<br/>and to cater for that, an increase in the allocation is necessary. The Coalition Government could have 
<br/>gone a step further and catered for pregnant mothers in urban areas with low income.  The Coalition 
<br/>Government  should  come  up  with  some  new  initiatives  rather  than  riding  on  the  initiative  of  the 
<br/>FijiFirst. This is an indication that the Coalition Government lacks in critical thinking, creativity and 
<br/>originality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The Coalition Government is doing copy and paste…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Copy and paste. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- ... and is just rewording the successful policies designed and successfully 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented by FijFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I have gone through the Budget  books and there is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothing on the restoration of the Executive Teacher positions in primary schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Shame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The former General Secretary of Fiji Teachers Union and the current 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations  in  one  of  his  press 
<br/>statements on 27th June, 2018 said that FTU wants full restoration of Executive Teacher positions in 
<br/>Fiji.  There was no mention of Executive Teacher restoration in the honourable Minister’s Budget 
<br/>Address.  Will the Executive Teacher positions be restored in 2024 which the honourable Agni Deo 
<br/>Singh was harping on when he was the General Secretary of Fiji Teachers Union.

<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Only talk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now turn my attention to one of the most pressing 
<br/>matters  that  affect  the  future  of  this  country.    This  relates  to  the  scholarship  and  TELS  debt 
<br/>forgiveness announced by the honourable Minister of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- </span><span>Bhatao.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the policies as announced by the honourable Minister 
<br/>of    Finance  in  the  Budget  have  let  the  Fijians  more  confused  than  ever  before.  What  happens  to 
<br/>students who have already paid their debt?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- You people lied to the students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Will they be refunded?  If not, where is the fairness? Those who were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honest, upfront with their payments and paid off, they get no benefit from this new policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, why did the Government not announce a reimbursement scheme for those 
<br/>who have already paid? Where is fairness and equity that the Coalition Government is harping about?  
<br/>By forgiving TELS debt, the Government is essentially wiping out potential revenue of over $650 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Imagine the positive impact this revenue could have had on addressing 
<br/>critical issues such as formalising informal settlements, building markets for vendors and improving 
<br/>essential services like health, roads, electricity, internet services and water supply. It also means that 
<br/>there is no sustainability in this scheme. We know that honourable Prof. Prasad does not understand 
<br/>sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the agreement signed between the parties to form the Government had TELS 
<br/></span><span>as non-negotiable condition by SODELPA.  No matter how hard TSLS and Coalition Government 
<br/>are  trying  to  convince  the  taxpayers,  the  facts  remains  that  this  policy  is  to  keep  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government and its Ministers in power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- This is a huge trade-off, of the Government at the cost of taxpayers, our 
<br/>future  generation  and  our  economy,  a  situation  where  the  political  survival  of  the  Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government has been put before the country’s best interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- No political will.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  The  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  opted  for  a  political  decision  to 
<br/>ensure the marriage of convenience between the NFP-PAP  pre-election coalition and SODELPA is 
<br/>given more oxygen to survive.

<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has also failed to recognise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and appreciate the fact that TELS was a revolving fund scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is a loan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Rushing into announcing a policy to meet SODELPA’s demand for debt 
<br/>forgiveness,  the  Coalition  Government  has  failed  to  understand  simple  logic  and  sound  financial 
<br/>model.  A student enrolled for a three-year programme in 2014 would start repaying after 2017. A 
<br/>MBBS student enrolled in 2014 will start repaying after 2020. So, it is unfair and childish for the 
<br/>honourable Minister to say that the scheme recoveries were poor.  Also, the loan repayments holidays 
<br/>announced by the FijiFirst government during the COVID-19 hardship period should not have been 
<br/>included in assessing the returns.  This actually has been his problem and level of deceit. He wants 
<br/>to compare a pandemic term with a non-pandemic period.

<br/></span><span>to forgive TELS debt without considering its long-term financial implication raises serious concerns 
<br/>about responsible leadership and fiscal prudence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Poor leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  also  like  to  raise  an  issue  concerning  a 
<br/>reduction  in  duty  on  lamb  products  from  5  percent  to  zero  percent.  The  way  this  message  was 
<br/>presented in Parliament led to Fijians on the 1st Reading of the Budget believe that they will pay less 
<br/></span><span>for lamb chops now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in announcing a 5 percent reduction in duty on lamb chops, the honourable 
<br/>Minister intentionally and clearly failed to explain the impact on prices due to his hidden agenda in 
<br/>his other policy announcement such as increase in VAT and corporate tax rate.  This shows that the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>combined impact on the prices of lamb chops due to the policy changes will definitely increase the 
<br/>price of lamb chops.  Any unfavourable movement in the exchange rate and freight cost will further 
<br/>increase the domestic price of lamb chops.  Fijians will not get fooled easily, Fijians are smarter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to raise a serious concern about the decision by the Coalition 
<br/>Government  to  include  Pacific Polytech as  an eligible institution  for the  new scholarship  scheme 
<br/>with an allocation of $1 million to this newly established institution.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone 
<br/>knows who is behind this institution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Taxpayers money, not your money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The allocation of funds to the Girmit Day Celebrations to Global Girmit 
<br/>Institute and then allocation of $1 million to Pacific Polytech cannot be mere coincidence.  It is a 
<br/>clearly calculated and smart move.  A search at the Companies Office shows that Pacific Polytech is 
<br/>registered as a private company under the name of Pacific Polytech Limited.  My question is, who 
<br/>are the stakeholders?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the decision by the Coalition Government to rush into allocating $1 million 
<br/>to this newly established limited liability company which is, of course, a privately owned institution 
<br/>whereas so far, the Government has been assisting non-private entities, education institutes such as 
<br/>Montfort  Boys  Town,  Corpus  Christi  and  Fulton  College,  why  is  the  Government  providing  $1 
<br/>million to a private company with no experience in this field?  Has the Government policy changed 
<br/>to accommodate a private company?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if this Budget passes on this floor, we are condemning ordinary Fijians to 
<br/>suffering which will last for decades.  The Budget is biased against low and middle income families 
<br/>and fails to provide them with adequate protection from the looming inflation crisis.   This Budget 
<br/>will ensure that thousands are trapped in a cycle of poverty. This Budget has shown Fijians that the 
<br/>Government does not care for the people but instead, have contempt for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not support this hopeless and heartless Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And I urge all those who are sensible on the other side not to support this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  </span><span>Na  Turaga  Bale  na  Tui  Cakau</span><span>;  the 
<br/></span><span>People’s  Prime  Minister;  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition;  my  fellow  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers - the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation and the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics;  honourable  Ministers  and 
<br/>Assistant  Ministers  of  the  realm;  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  colleagues,  ladies  and 
<br/>gentlemen; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and good afternoon to everyone who may be listening to this broadcast or 
<br/>streaming in live today.  It is with honour, Sir, that I rise today to deliver my statement in support of 
<br/>the 2023-2024 National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank my fellow Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic 
<br/></span><span>Planning, National Development and Statistics, for an excellent,  well-crafted and people-centered 
<br/>Budget.  I commend his Team as well for their hard work and recognise the outgoing CEO of FRCS, 
<br/>Mr. Mark Dixon, for his contributions as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, the Budget announcement was delivered on time.  The honourable  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leader of the Opposition asked for humility.  If that is not indication of humility to the people of Fiji, 
<br/>I do not know what is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was delivered in simple language so that the whole country could understand, and it was 
<br/>well received by the majority of the people of Fiji.  It was done in a consultative, open, compassionate 
<br/>and transparent manner, Mr. Speaker, Sir, without any hidden agendas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to talk briefly about the People’s Coalition’s legacy in less than a 
<br/>year of being in office, and this is something that the honourable Members on the other side do not 
<br/>understand.  They have 16 years of history and we have only been here for seven months, so I urge 
<br/>them to wait.  Good things are coming.  It is about promises made, Sir, and promises delivered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We promised true democracy, Sir, removal of the Media  Industry Development  Authority 
<br/>(MIDA) and facilitating free speech, removal of Bill No. 17 or Act No. 22, return of the Great Council 
<br/>of Chiefs (GCC), removal of excessive Ministerial allowances that enraged the other side… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- …introduced public holidays, like Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna and 
<br/>the Girmitiya Day which will form the basis for true reconciliation in the new Fiji, removal of TELS, 
<br/>repayments to USP, no more </span><span>soli ni yasana</span><span>, and the increase of social welfare payments to the people 
<br/>of Fiji, contrary to the suggestion during the campaign that we were going to reduce social welfare 
<br/>payments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can go on with the full list of promises and embellish a little bit on what 
<br/>we delivered in such a short span of time.  We, on this side of Parliament, are not boastful in our 
<br/>makeup.  All we know is that we are here to serve the people of Fiji and we are just getting warmed 
<br/>up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Let me talk about the mess and maybe, this will make them 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on why we had to deliver a very high Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  Mr.  Richard  Naidu  and  Ms.  Lisa  Apted,  who  were  the  Chairperson  and  Deputy 
<br/>Chairperson of the Fiscal Review Committee delivered their findings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it confirmed 
<br/>our deepest fears.  This country was in a mess.  The mess was a result poor leadership, which resulted 
<br/>in – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>high unsustainable debt levels; 
<br/>improper spending; 
<br/>shambolic  and  pathetic  state  of  our  health  facilities,  school  facilities,  government 
<br/>quarters and government assets; 
<br/>poor management of infrastructure, such as water and roads; and  
<br/>a famous swimming pool which has still not seen the light of the day after so much 
<br/></span><span>wastage of taxpayers’ money.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps,  honourable Bala may be able to  elucidate us on that That  begs the question, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, how on earth did we get to this place?    And this is a learning for all of us in this august 
<br/>Chamber, especially the aspiring young leaders of tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you armchair yourself into positions of leadership without one relevant experience or 
<br/>training, in this case, I am chairing through a </span><span>coup</span><span>, think that you know more than anyone else and 
<br/>refuse to listen, you are setting yourself up for catastrophic failure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this mess falls at the feet of the former Prime Minister, Voreqe 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bainimarama, and the former Attorney-General.  Where are they, Sir? Where are they? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Areh,</span><span> they are not here. Ah, you know!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- They ran away… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… and refused to account themselves to the people of Fiji in this august Chamber.  I leave it to the 
<br/>people of Fiji to judge them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me cover some facts about the mess, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I have five examples.  The first is 
<br/>Film Tax Rebate.  When foreign companies come to Fiji, they are entitled to rebates. So, a portion 
<br/>of the money they spend in our country is refunded to them.  This happens around the world, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, but for some reason, the rebate levels in Fiji were excessive.  Even film companies were 
<br/>telling the Government that it was too generous.  As a result, the FijiFirst government has handed us 
<br/>an outstanding bill of $178 million owing to these companies.  So, for the next four years to five 
<br/>years, we will be paying $40 million a year to make good on this colossal muck-up.  Be assured, Sir, 
<br/>we will honor this debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The wors fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the payouts were never recorded in the budget of the 
<br/>country. I will say that again, Sir, the payouts from the rebates were never ever recorded in the budget 
<br/>in the country. So, one can argue that the former Minister for Economy was misleading Parliament 
<br/>on  this  matter.    I  will  be  lodging  a  complaint  to  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  for  an 
<br/>investigation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second is that the  </span><span>Walesi</span><span> investigation is ongoing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but again, it is  a 
<br/></span><span>mess.  We have asked for some additional resources to complete the investigation and be assured, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, we will leave no stone unturned.  If we account for this year’s budgetary allocation of $8 million, 
<br/>we would have spent $136 million on </span><span>Walesi</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, how does one government and Cabinet first allow money to be spent without 
<br/>any feasibility study done?  The honourable Assistant Minister of Finance talked about feasibility 
<br/>studies and business cases and worst still, the true cost of </span><span>Walesi</span><span> was never ever fully disclosed in 
<br/>this Parliament, and that is a shame. What a mess, Mr. Speaker, Sir! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third is the USP dues.  Much has been said about the refusal by the former Attorney-
<br/></span><span>General to pay the dues of USP.  The quality of education for our children, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was 
<br/>highjacked by one individual and honourable Members on the other side were scared to tell him – 
<br/>the height of arrogance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we owed $80 million, before the Coalition took over, and this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has now been repaid.  Sir, $20 million is being provided in the current Budget. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1119 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth is FRA amounts unpaid.  The FijiFirst government fully spent the FRA budget 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>within six months before we took over.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- So! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mismanagement, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, there is $40 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>set aside in this Budget to pay for liabilities that they incurred.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, the fifth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is the crime of the century, is the backdating of 
<br/>Capital  Gains  Tax  to  benefit  or  exempt  certain  individuals.    Totally  unacceptable,  Sir!    I  was 
<br/>particularly vocal about this in the campaign. The amount of revenue lost was $70 million, according 
<br/>to the honourable Minister of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on these five examples alone… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What about Grace Road? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  …the  FijiFirst  government  has  handed  a  gaping  hole  of 
<br/>$506 million to the people of Fiji and the Peoples Coalition Government, more than half a billion 
<br/>dollars. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Half a billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  No  wonder,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  had  to  increase  taxes 
<br/>because of this hole, and they are wondering why we are increasing taxes. It was done because of the 
<br/>mismanagement of the FijiFirst government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rest assured, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I guarantee you that this half a billion will grow and by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the time we reach the end of the year, there will be a bigger number to report in this Chamber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is like we are beginning a 100-metre race, at least, 50 metres behind the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>starting line. That is the impact of what they have done to this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do not be despaired, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not despair.  The good news is, that there is a 
<br/>new leadership in Fiji which believes that if we work together as one people under God - the people 
<br/>of Fiji can overcome our current challenges.  Therefore, the 2023-2024 National Budget is the first 
<br/></span><span>step in building the new Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are under no illusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the road ahead will be hard, but together as 
<br/>one people, we can build the new Fiji.  Allow me to talk about the economic setting, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.     I am very optimistic about the current trajectory of the Fijian economy.  It is projected to grow 
<br/>at 8 percent this year, 3.8 percent in 2024 and 3 percent in 2025.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  economic  indicators  are  in  the  right  direction,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  Liquidity  is  strong, 
<br/>lending rates remain at historic lows and the private sector has been showing continuous growth in 
<br/></span><span>terms of credit and optimism is up.  For sure, Sir, there are headwinds building globally but as we 
<br/></span><span>know, best opportunities arise from challenges and adversity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are wondering about where the economic growth 
<br/>will come from. The investment pipeline - foreign and domestic, in Fiji right now is $4.25 billion, 
<br/>and  growing.    This  represents  179  active  projects  in  Fiji  from  the  private  sector  alone,  and  this

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>includes major public sector investments that are being planned in Fiji.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are 
<br/>positioned for some very good times in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  touch  on  our  Ministry  allocation  and  priorities,  Mr.  Speaker  and  perhaps, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answer some of the questions around how we are going to grow the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and 
<br/>Communications was actually identified as a new portfolio in the 2023-2024 Budget.  The Ministry 
<br/>is very thankful with its total allocation of $116.5 million, which consists of: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$98.9 million in operating expenditure; 
<br/>$6.3 million in capital expenditure; and 
<br/>$11.3 in VAT. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the core allocations, Mr. Speaker, Sir are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>8)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$45 million for the outstanding rebates and new rebates. Just imagine, if that $40 million 
<br/>could be used for something else in Fiji. Perhaps, we are now paying for other people’s 
<br/>stupidity. 
<br/>$9 million on the ease of doing business. 
<br/>$8 million for Walesi and I think I had addressed the honourable Bia here, the problem is 
<br/>not Walesi but the problem is how they set up Walesi, without understanding how we are 
<br/>going to recover the money once we spent the money on Walesi. They have no idea, so that 
<br/>is the job of this investigation - to find out how we can sustainably keep Walesi, or if we 
<br/>have to exit, to exit sustainably. That is the key.  
<br/> $4.4 million for Trade Commissions in Australia, New Zealand, North America and China. 
<br/>$2.8 million for Investment Fiji. 
<br/>$2.6 million in grants for SMEs and Co-operatives.  I will come back to that figure, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, but it is an increase of about 80 percent (I think). 
<br/>$2.5 million to support the ICT/BPO sector; 
<br/>$1.4  million  to  purchase  weights  for  one  of  our  Departments  –  National  Trade 
<br/>Measurement and Standards. 
<br/>$800,000 for Film Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>10)</span><span> </span><span>$500,000 for Business Assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the important things to note, and I think you will hear it from all the Ministers, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is that when we entered our Ministries, they were severely under-resourced. So, part of 
<br/>this Budget is to actually address the under-resourcing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These allocations from our Ministry underpin five priority areas in the Ministry that we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>going to focus on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span> </span><span>Genuine economic diversity; 
<br/>2)</span><span> </span><span>Driving Fiji as a regional hub; 
<br/>3)</span><span> </span><span>Driving a fully digital economy; 
<br/></span><span>4)</span><span> </span><span>Connecting the unconnected; and 
<br/></span><span>5)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving regulatory and governance frameworks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow me to elaborate very briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will be collaborating with all Government Ministries and agencies - Investment 
<br/></span><span>Fiji, our Trade Commissioners, High Commissioners, Bilateral and Multilateral partners, the private

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector and NGOs, which was a bad word on the other side of the House, to continue to expand and 
<br/>diversify the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is an intense focus on renewable energy, green and blue solutions such as recycling, 
<br/>commercial agriculture and aquaculture with strategic and foreign local partners, manufacturing in 
<br/>renewable  spaces  and  niche  products,  the  fast-growing  BPO  sector,  education  and  ICT/Data 
<br/>Warehousing opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  talked  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tourism and what growth is happening there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the film industry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they almost destroyed the film industry because of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this rebate issue. We, on this side of Parliament, will not allow that to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  MSME  sector,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  put  it  under  diversification  because  it  is  a  very 
<br/>important part of what we are wanting to do. It is a major job creator and is about 19 percent of GDP.  
<br/>It has significant potential.  With the current funding, we will assist MSMEs to link up to formal 
<br/>markets, start up, or scale up their businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to acknowledge Rise Beyond the Reef with Mr. Semi Lotawa, who just recently 
<br/>through our assistance, has got on this product on Amazon, which means that our ladies will now be 
<br/>able to actually market their goods internationally.  What an exciting development - diversification 
<br/>in practical terms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assisting  farmers  under  the  Smallholder  Farming  Models,  we  plan  to  do  this  and  there  is 
<br/>already examples in Fiji on how it is done.  British American Tobacco (BAT), Goodman Fielder and 
<br/>Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) are good examples of using Smallholder Models. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  step  further,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  would  like  to  incorporate  co-operatives  into  these 
<br/>models, such as they do in Fonterra in the Dairy Industry in New Zealand and the Espree Model for 
<br/>Kiwi Fruit in New Zealand as well.  So, watch this space, it is happening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Targetting assistance to tourism projects is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I would like 
<br/>to acknowledge Mr. Josefa Bau from the Takalana Beach Resort in Nataleira for dolphin watching.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With these allocations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are developing a ecosystem to support MSMEs 
<br/></span><span>and co-operatives by collaborating with the private sector and the banks, such as the Fiji Development 
<br/></span><span>Bank (FDB), Bank of South Pacific (BSP) and the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we look at the support to MSMEs across the Ministries, the MSME 
<br/>funding envelope is about $30 million, excluding the private sector.  Our plan is to launch, at least, 
<br/>one new industry in our country every year, and reboot existing export opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New  emerging  industries,  such  as  medicinal  cannabis,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  look  promising.  
<br/>Nutraceuticals  such  as  kava  tablets  and  juices,  cosmetics,  the  cocoa  industry,  ginger,  turmeric, 
<br/></span><span>mahogany and noni commonly known as </span><span>kura</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>are industries that will be of focus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade is the lifeblood of our economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We will focus on traditional, bilateral 
<br/>and  multilateral  trade  opportunities  that  make  sense  to  Fiji.    As  part  of  this  commitment,  we  are 
<br/>prioritising  the  conclusion  of  negotiations  on  the  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework  (IPEF)  for 
<br/>Prosperity.    This  agreement  represents  immense  opportunities  for  our  region  to  expand  our  trade 
<br/>horizons beyond our immediate region.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course. there is import replacement.  I am in  discussion with some manufacturers, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  and  we  will,  hopefully,  be  making  some  announcements  soon  on  genuine  import 
<br/>substitution in Fiji.  We will continue to support their efforts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Driving Fiji as a regional hub, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We will continue to drive Fiji as a regional 
<br/>hub.  Discussions about a second submarine cable into Fiji is progressing positively, the expanding 
<br/>reach of our national carrier (Fiji Airways), and the strategic position of our ports of entries in Suva 
<br/>and Lautoka makes Fiji well positioned. But most importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s intent is that 
<br/>all countries in our region benefit because of this regional hub agenda.  We all rise together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  driving  a  fully  digital  economy,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  endeavour  to  unlock  our 
<br/>potential in terms of digitalisation, and we will launch a National Digital Strategy soon.  The second 
<br/>cable, Sir, if it happens, is a game changer for our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  collaborating  also  with  our  Telco  operators  on  a  plan  to  implement  a  5G 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>network in Fiji.  It will require some policy and regulatory adjustments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Progress towards making businesses and processes more efficient under the “Business Fiji 
<br/>Now Initiative” or Ease of Doing Business is underway and ultimately in the first phase, we plan to 
<br/>automate 16 processes across 25 agencies in about 18 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  thing  that  we  are  looking  at,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  digitalisation  of  our  trade.  
<br/>Working with United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World 
<br/>Trade  Organization  (WTO),  we  will  endeavour  to  establish  a  National  Single  Window  which,  if 
<br/>happens, becomes a one stop shop and will simplify and streamline trade procedures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On connecting the unconnected, Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly, we plan to actually connect 
<br/>the  remaining  5  percent  over  the  next  24  to  48  months  using  the  Universal  Service  Trust  Fund, 
<br/>working  in  close  collaboration  with  our  partners.    We  have  also  launched  an  initiative  called  the 
<br/>Smart Islands Initiative with the United Nations, and we are focusing on Rotuma.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  improving  regulatory  and  governance  framework,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are 
<br/>undertaking  some  legislation  reviews  -  the  Real  Estate  Agents  Act  2006,  National  and  Trade 
<br/>Measurement Act 1989, Trade Standards and Quality Control Act 1992, a possible MSME Bill to 
<br/>support MSMEs, and a review of the Co-Operative Act 1996. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cybersecurity  is  also  a  major  priority  in  our  Ministry  and  this  framework  is  being 
<br/></span><span>strengthened by the introduction of the National Crisis Emergency Response Team (CERT) to deal 
<br/>with emerging threats.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking at Data Protection Laws and this will be important as 
<br/>we try and continue to push for the BPO industry and also protect the flow of transborder personal 
<br/>data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may recall that in my Maiden Speech, I invited all of us 
<br/></span><span>to  seek  the  wisdom  of King  Solomon,  and  what  I  am  about  to  say  comes  from  that  well  pool  of 
<br/></span><span>goodwill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last  few weeks,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen the release of a  50 page dossier of 
<br/>garbage, attempting to destabilise our beloved country, which was saddening.  What saddened me 
<br/>more was the silence and lack of condemnation on the other side of Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this type of thinking has no place in the new Fiji, and I condemn whoever 
<br/>wrote that nonsense in no uncertain terms.  I hope Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the law catches up with him 
<br/>or her.  I hope my colleagues on this side of Parliament will do the same and condemn this document 
<br/>publicly and on record. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent suspension of the FijiFirst Party revealed all the flaws 
<br/>in  our  electoral  system  created,  obviously,  by  the  former  Attorney-General  for  self-preservation.  
<br/>Even the honourable Leader of the Opposition in the Business Committee which I attended on behalf 
<br/>of the honourable Prime Minister, admitted that the laws did not make sense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, you are telling lies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I repeat the challenge I issued in the 
<br/>spirit of goodwill to the Business Committee in this august Chamber - let us work together to change 
<br/>all the unjust laws set up in the last 16 years and let us, once and for all, set Fiji on a new path for the 
<br/>new Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the 2023-2024 National Budget, and look forward 
<br/>to working with all honourable Members in this august Parliament and the people of Fiji, as we take 
<br/>the first step in building the new Fiji.  May God bless Fiji, may God bless us all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament for afternoon tea.  When we resume, I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>call upon the honourable Sanjay Kirpal to make his contribution.  The Parliament is adjourned. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 5.02 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  start,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications on the 
<br/>investigation  into  breaking  the  law,  is  there  also  supposed  to  be  an  investigation  if  you  trash  the 
<br/>Constitution? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are you asking me or ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Honourable Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, honourable Kirpal... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I am not a lawyer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- ... you should be directing your question to the Chair rather than straight 
<br/>across to the honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and 
<br/>Communications.  You have been in Parliament for quite some time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; greetings and a very good afternoon to you all 
<br/>who are present here today, at home, and those listening to other mediums.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 at 10.00 a.m., the honourable Minister of Finance spoke for about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two hours about our country’s future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Less than two hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Fijians listened attentively in the hope that the promised cost of living 
<br/>relief would be delivered, but it was not and thousands of Fijians have every right to be disappointed 
<br/>with this Government.  Sometimes, the most important thing about a Budget speech is not what the 
<br/>Minister of Finance says, but it is what he does not say and tries to keep hidden in the Budget papers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  few  things  that  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  failed  to 
<br/>mention  which  are  not  only  important  to  all  Fijians  but  are  very  essential  and  that  is  education 
<br/>assistance - the removal of Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TELS) being replaced with the 
<br/></span><span>Fijian Scholarship.  You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out, the TELS loan has not 
<br/></span><span>been forgiven but the students have to serve the bond to get themselves free. In this bond system until 
<br/>a student is free from this completely, he or she cannot progress further in his or her studies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, where is your 
<br/>free tertiary education promise which you were singing before the Elections?  There is no write-off 
<br/>in the student loans since they are all under bond. This is a great deceit for the students in Fiji.  Where 
<br/>is your SODELPA Party’s promise?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the sugarcane price, when in Opposition, the honourable Minister of Finance had boasted 
<br/></span><span>that when his Party will be in Government, they will give farmers $100 per tonne guaranteed price.  
<br/>So, I am asking now, where is your promise? Nothing was mentioned about this price of sugarcane 
<br/>in the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very sad that poor farmers fell for that and eventually voted you in Parliament.  Each and 
<br/>every time, poor farmers are being used as political football for political games and that is your old 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1125 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trick.  I was taught this long time ago and I quote: “ If farmers are rich, so is the nation.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was simply under FijiFirst government that farmers were given bulk of incentives.  What 
<br/>has happened now? Farmers have no faith in this three-legged stool Government who has failed to 
<br/>give our beloved farmers further incentives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 15 percent VAT, this will have a huge impact on 
<br/>poor and low income earners as they cannot survive on only 22 zero-rated VAT items.  The rich will 
<br/>get richer and the poor will get poorer.  It is sad to see that their situation will not improve further as 
<br/>they might have anticipated from this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on corporate tax, this has been increased to 25 percent on all levels. This 
<br/>will have a huge impact on small and medium enterprise businesses, as some businesses may close 
<br/>down and I am being told that some are already in the process of closing down.  When increasing the 
<br/>corporate tax, there should have been some brackets so that smaller businesses could have survived 
<br/>and thrive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  this  2023-2024  Budget,  the  Coalition  Government  has  decreased  the 
<br/>capital  expenditure  and  increased  the  operating  expenditure,  which  simply  means  that  the 
<br/>Government  wants  its  Ministers to  have luxurious  term  in  office rather than cutting  on operating 
<br/>expenditure, to have more funds on capital expenditure where our Fijian people can benefit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the FijiFirst’s term, if you look at the percentage ratio, capital expense has been more 
<br/>than 30 percent, while this three-legged stool Government has decreased the capital expenditure and 
<br/>allowed the operational expenditure to increase.  The reason may be simple - more overseas trips to 
<br/>the Ministers, Assistant Ministers and their staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Housing is allocated with $25.7 million, compared to the 
<br/>2022-2023 Budget where it was $30.3 million.  In 2018, the NFP promised that they will invest $200 
<br/>million a year or $800 million for four years in housing, so what happened now?  According to the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance, I quote from what he said: “The Government has completely failed 
<br/>on housing.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even if it was $100 million, people could have had some relief of what he said but it was a 
<br/></span><span>blatant lie to our people to no avail. Saying something for a personal gain or taking advantage of the 
<br/></span><span>poor is not a good quality of a leader when actually what they do in reality is totally the opposite of 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government have always said all along that they will improve the health 
<br/>sector and solve all health-related issues but yet, they are full of fake promises and lies.  For example, 
<br/>it will not take much time to figure out that they have reallocated the FijiFirst budgetary allocation 
<br/>of  $1.8  million  to  the  Savusavu  Hospital  for  maintenance  and  refurbishment  at  the  cost  of  only 
<br/>$250,000.  It seems that this Government is full of false promises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been observed that the service at the Titles Office is very inconvenient 
<br/>to the general public, as well as to the daily user companies.  Previously, within a day, they used to 
<br/>get title copy searches done but now it takes two to three days.  I ask, where is service efficiency, 
<br/>honourable Minister for Justice?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The delay really affects the running of the company which deals with Title searches for  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>valuation, transfers, caveats, and the list goes on. Mainly, replacing people will not do any good but 
<br/>it will make things from bad to worse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Ministry of Lands, it is very difficult to get the sales data, even though 
<br/>Valuers  and  other  financial  institutions  pay  for  the  service.  It  is  almost  seven  months  now  that 
<br/>companies  are  facing  problems  to  get  the  real  market  value  of  properties  around  Fiji.    Service 
<br/>inefficiency will have a huge impact to Government and financial institutions in generating revenue 
<br/>and lending loans respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  important  matter  is  the  processing  time  for  transfer  of  concern 
<br/>which takes longer than the normal time, hence the buyers get frustrated, and the deal gets cancelled, 
<br/>or at times, the concerned time expires and re-application has to be made with additional fees and 
<br/>charges  and  the  same  applies  to  the  mortgage  concerned.      With  this  increase  in  the  budget,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister should  take some proactive  measures to  ease the problem in  the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands, which the poor lessees go through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the arrears of rents are in millions of dollars and the Government loses out a lot 
<br/>in revenue, hence some measures should be in place to get the arrears paid.  However, I am thankful 
<br/>to  the honourable Minister of  Finance for the increase in  the Ministry of  Lands’ budget  and also 
<br/>keeping the Land Bank which was initiated by the Bainimarama-led Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I was in West last week, it was an eyesore to see the roads in pathetic 
<br/>condition.  There is no proper maintenance of roads but only small patch-up by this Government.   I 
<br/>met some rural residents, and they told me that they are neglected by this Government, as before they 
<br/>use their vehicles for transporting goods and traveling, but now with this Government they are going 
<br/>back to the 17</span><span>th</span><span> century and they may be using horses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Giving a huge budget to the Fiji Roads Authority does not make sense 
<br/>if you cannot fix the roads, instead, use that money.  If the Government complaint waiting for this 
<br/>budget, then where is your mini budget, honourable Minister of Finance?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The poor road condition is one of the major contributing factors of road accidents and higher 
<br/>death numbers compared to previous years.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, so far, the current Government has 
<br/>just enjoyed opening the roads and bridges which were the Bainimarama-led Government initiatives, 
<br/></span><span>and this was also mentioned by the honourable Leader of the Opposition this morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is in power for almost seven months, but nothing fruitful 
<br/>for the ordinary Fijians have materialised.  The only thing that the Government does is to disregard 
<br/>the Constitution, the supreme law of the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Look in the mirror.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- One of the failures to comply with the Constitution is that two Members 
<br/></span><span>of  Parliament  who  are  representatives  of  the  FijiFirst  Party  are  not  sworn  in  just  because  they 
<br/></span><span>deliberately delayed the Constitutional Officers Commission meeting.  The reason is best known to 
<br/>the Coalition partners.  Our honourable Leader of the Opposition has given a hint this morning on 
<br/>the reasons why this has not been done.  It simply deprives the people’s voice in Parliament and is a 
<br/>direct insult to our Constitution.  Instead of owning up to the mistakes, the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>blamed the honourable Leader of the Opposition, which is very unfair and uncalled for.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1127 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, instead of outlining their agenda and plans to address the development needs 
<br/>of this country and governing within the framework of the Constitution, they are trying to amend the 
<br/>Constitution and give executive powers to the Great Council of Chiefs which is unconstitutional.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Republic of Fiji Military Forces is there to safeguard and protect the 
<br/>Constitution and the well-being of every Fijian in this land.  I am proud that the establishment is 
<br/>leading best to our expectation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the crime rate has  increased significantly.  It  is  an everyday news that some 
<br/>crime is committed somewhere.  Government should be more concerned about this rather than trying 
<br/>to amend the Constitution.  Why is the honourable Minister for Home Affairs quiet now?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No one is changing the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Investor confident is zero since the day the Coalition Government came 
<br/>into power.  First, they tried to investigate the Grace Road but slowly, it faded.  It was just to get the 
<br/>public attention.  What is happening now?  Nothing is coming.  It was just to discredit the previous 
<br/>Government and humiliate Grace Road, or someone is scratching someone’s back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good to see that the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/>is praising Fiji Airways, as previously, he used to criticise our airline and was praising Qantas.  At 
<br/>least,  but  not  leased.  Now, the honourable Minister has realised how important  it is  to  keep our 
<br/>national carrier… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Well, you were always criticising when we bought two …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- … which is the critical link for our tourism industry.  It is not only 
<br/>generating  revenue  directly,  but  also  indirectly  through  visitor  spending.    He  should  thank  the 
<br/>FijiFirst government for protecting the Airline during the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the overall Budget, it is just a copy and paste Budget from the 
<br/>2022-2023  FijiFirst  Budget.    However,  in  this  Budget  there  is  nothing  for  the  poor  and  no  new 
<br/>incentives for the under privileged. Absolutely nothing new for farmers and it will make life difficult 
<br/>for the poor due to various VAT components.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity, and I do not support this Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Members  and 
<br/>honourable Members of  Parliament; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka saka,</span><span> </span><span>aur</span><span> </span><span>sab ko mera pranam</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I speak today in support of, and also in appreciation of, the Coalition Government’s Budget 
<br/></span><span>for  the  financial  year  2023-2024.    I  believe  it  is  a  Budget  that  indicates  that  the  Government  is 
<br/></span><span>listening to the needs of the people and trying to meet them, despite the mounting debt burden that 
<br/>Government faces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  Government  for  recognising  the  need  for  an  increase  in  social  protection 
<br/>allowances for the most vulnerable, with an allocation of $200.2 million overall.   This is by far the 
<br/>biggest ever allocation for the Ministry, especially for the Social Pension Scheme.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  has  allocated  an  estimated  amount  of  $169.8  million,  84  percent  of  the 
<br/>Ministry’s total budget, for the new financial year towards social protection programmes to try to 
<br/>ensure that more than 97,000 beneficiaries on our various support schemes have an increase in their 
<br/>allowances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may repeat that in Hindi, </span><span>humari sarkar ne is </span><span>budget</span><span> mein </span><span>social welfare 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allowance</span><span> mein vridhi lai hai.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection will 
<br/>discuss in depth the overall impact of the new budget and the Ministry’s plan for the new financial 
<br/>year.  But I want to focus on a few things in the Department of Social Welfare where we are making 
<br/>changes, and that may answer honourable Bala’s question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a new budgetary allocation for poverty graduation.  This is because we recognise 
<br/>two particular weaknesses in our current systems.   The first weakness is that we do not have active 
<br/>plans to move our current beneficiaries out of poverty.  The second weakness is, we do not have the 
<br/>means  to  identify  when  many  of  our  beneficiaries  have  ceased  to  need  our  help,  often  through  a 
<br/>change in family or other circumstances.  At that point, we should be in a position to reduce assistance 
<br/>to them or re-direct our limited resources to helping others in need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to remember that the Department does not currently support everyone in need.  
<br/>We have many applications for assistance which are still unmet due to lack of funds.  So, we must 
<br/>be able to use our money as wisely as possible, and I will come back to that in a moment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the need for us to help our people move off schemes, 
<br/>such as the Family Assistance Scheme, to improved incomes through economic empowerment, skills 
<br/>development and pathways for employment.  These are matters I am passionate about.  Sometimes, 
<br/>it is just a matter of making the right connections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  our  small  success  stories  is  being  able  to  connect  a  major  hotel  group  to  a  non-
<br/>government organisation with many unemployed women on its records.  At a time when the hotel 
<br/>industry is desperate to replace staff because of losses overseas, we were able to help with recruitment 
<br/>of hundreds of trainees into this hotel group’s training programme, simply using smarter and more 
<br/>relevant connections.  There are situations where single mums are willing to go and work and all they 
<br/>need is childcare support, for example, so it is just about thinking.  Think about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many job vacancies are advertised in newspapers, but the poor and the unemployed are not 
<br/></span><span>reading newspapers, whether in print or online.  Their time and limited money is directed to more 
<br/>urgent  things.    But  there  are  NGOs  who  can  help  bring  them  together  with  potential  employers, 
<br/>because they read the newspapers and they know where to find the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to find ways to make better connections, including with NGOs, who are often better 
<br/>connected  to  the  poor  than  some  of  us  in  Government.    This  is  a  matter  I  know  from  personal 
<br/>experience, and this is why building relationships with NGO partners remains a critical need across 
<br/>all sectors of Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government recognises the importance of the Civil Society Sector, and I am thankful for 
<br/>the allocation of grants to organisations that works towards our deliverables. In this Budget, $200,000 
<br/>is a new allocation to community-based organisations that encourage women’s social and economic 
<br/>empowerment programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have seen first-hand during the global COVID pandemic when the past Government was

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1129 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out of its depth in dealing with the crisis and took its time to plan assistance, it was the community-
<br/>based organisations that mobilized basic needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, sometimes Government systems are inflexible and bureaucratic, and lack the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>human element. Let me talk about another bureaucratic failure which we have addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, girls from Fiji’s 11 Orphanages had to leave when they turned 18 years old.  This 
<br/>was a rule which applied, regardless of their personal circumstances, abilities or specific needs. There 
<br/>was a reason these girls were in Orphanages, Mr. Speaker, they had no family support. Their legal 
<br/>status may have changed when they turned 18, but they were not better able to fend for themselves 
<br/>on their 18</span><span>th</span><span> birthday than they were the day before.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year, we have retained all those coming of age under State Care and are enrolling them 
<br/>in skills programmes with economic pathways. This is preparing them to enter either the job market 
<br/>or to use their skills to become entrepreneurs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a challenge for us. Each one of these young women is a human being, like all of us, 
<br/>with different hopes, ambitions, strengths and weaknesses.  They do not necessarily respond in the 
<br/>same way to a training programme, but it is an improvement on the gap that we had before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is an example of where, as a Ministry, we need to be less rule-bound and 
<br/>more focussed on the people we serve.  It only takes a little bit of thinking and recognition that people 
<br/>are not numbers. We can do better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Social Welfare Department is committed to delivering an integrated social 
<br/>protection system with improved targeting, effectiveness, coverage and impact on poverty reduction. 
<br/>We  cannot  do  this  without  good  information.  At  the  moment,  our  information  on  our  welfare 
<br/>recipients is poor, spread over multiple databases, which we cannot integrate and analyse.  So, we 
<br/>are unable to understand how and where we can be more effective.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are working with the Australian Government assistance to change this. We have a total 
<br/>of $3 million in budgetary allocation to completely overhaul our management information system, 
<br/>so that we can become more effective in targeting those who need help, but also identifying those in 
<br/>our system who can now be phased out of help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in March this year, when I tried to talk publicly about these challenges, I was 
<br/></span><span>attacked by a senior politician, who accused me of trying to undermine the rights of the poor people. 
<br/></span><span>And  now  that  the  Ministry’s  budget  has  been  substantially  increased,  the  same  politician  is  now 
<br/>saying that welfare payments are handouts and erode the dignity of those receiving it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I accept that in the Government, we must be open to criticism of our mistakes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and scrutiny of what we do.  But those who criticise us must do more than just talk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are trying to be more open and transparent about how we work and the challenges we 
<br/>face.  Welfare recipients are not  a political plaything, Mr. Speaker.  People who want to criticise 
<br/></span><span>should take the time to find out the problems and offer solutions, and I will certainly talk to anyone 
<br/></span><span>with a genuine interest in helping us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir,</span><span> </span><span>our Ministry will also continue to work with development partners on new 
<br/>initiatives and programmes in strengthening the social protection sector.  Some of these will include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An adaptive social protection strategy to better respond to recovery from disasters and

<div><span>in mitigating the impacts of climate change. 
<br/>Pilot  parametric  insurance  with  selected  social  assistance  beneficiaries  as  a  way  to 
<br/>provide faster and more flexible funds to those affected by disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir,</span><span> </span><span>I had earlier told this Parliament that the State Homes, the places where we 
<br/>accommodate  our  young  people  and  our  elderly,  are  in  poor  condition  because  of  insufficient 
<br/>budgetary allocations for maintenance. Pearly Gates Home in Suva has been allocated $100,000 for 
<br/>maintenance, infrastructure, as well as administration cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has also been allocated more than $700,000 towards the refurbishment of the 
<br/>former  Ba  Mission  Hospital  complex.  The  intent  is  to  transfer  the  operations  of  the  Golden  Age 
<br/>Home in Lautoka, to allow the scoping works for the upgrade of the Golden Age Home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this property has been neglected for years and is now under attack from termites. 
<br/>The safety of the residents is compromised, and we have run out of options. We have to do the best 
<br/>we can, and that is why I am grateful that we have a specific allocation of $250,000 for these scoping 
<br/>works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, having worked with rural communities for the past 25 years, I have seen how 
<br/>committed  and  crucial  our  community  leaders  are  for  outreach  programmes,  disaster  relief  and 
<br/>ensuring that voices of our communities are heard in decision-making, and I applaud the increase in 
<br/>the allowances of </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span>, Advisory Councillors, </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> and </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span>, to 
<br/>enable them to function better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  cannot  help  but  appreciate  the  allocation  for  our  rural  roads  in  the  Ministry  of  Health. 
<br/>Visiting  rural  communities,  we  are  constantly  bombarded  with  narratives  for  the  urgent  need  for 
<br/>improvement in rural infrastructure, and our health services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  pandemic  while  in  the  civil  society  sector,  I  was  directly  involved  in  making 
<br/>medication and equipment available to help the Ministry of Health cope with the crisis. With this 
<br/>budget, I for one am glad that the Ministry of Health will be better equipped to serve those in need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,</span><span> </span><span>I  want  to  touch  briefly  on  the  plight  of  the  people  suffering  from  the 
<br/>devastating effects of Asian Subterranean termite infestation.  This is another issue that for years, the 
<br/>previous Government simply ignored.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many  people,  particularly  in  the  West  have  seen  their  homes  destroyed  by  termites.    No 
<br/>politician  from  the  previous  Government  took  the  time  to  even  visit  them  or  hear  them  out.  The 
<br/>problem was left to the Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF) to manage within its existing budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier this year, together with the Assistant Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, we met 
<br/>with stakeholders in Lautoka which still remains the hotspot.  None of the affected homeowners was 
<br/>aware of any remediation plan from BAF or any other government body. The City Council has no 
<br/>solution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Termites  have  severely  affected  businesses,  homes,  the  tourism  industry  and  Government 
<br/></span><span>infrastructure. We have discovered that there has been no effort to coordinate or collate data from 
<br/>business, tourism, municipalities or rural housing to indicate the extent of the problem and economic 
<br/>cost of termite infestation that has been fast spreading to other parts of the Western, as well as now 
<br/>the Northern Division. We have had a few meetings with various stakeholders and have developed a 
<br/>taskforce to look into this mammoth problem.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People have been crying out to be heard for the past 10 years on this but for the first time, the 
<br/>Coalition Government has taken the time to listen and there is an allocation of $3 million to begin a 
<br/>support programme to those affected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may repeat that in Hindi, Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span> dus saal se humari jan samudaye termites ke 
<br/>vishe me awaaz utha rahi hai par pahli baar Coalition sarkaar ne unki sunwayee ki hai aur sahyog 
<br/>ke liye $3 million ka allocation kya hai. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to finish my contribution on a subject that is important and very dear to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my heart and, that is, the subject of national unity and reconciliation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The subject of our debate this week is, of course, the Budget. I agree with the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance when he reminded us that in economics, “everything is connected to everything 
<br/>else”.  So, it is in nation-building. We cannot have a strong nation without a strong economy and 
<br/>sound economic policy, but we also need resources and support for the most fundamental things that 
<br/>are important to all of us - care of our people, peace, a sense of belonging, a sense of one Fiji.  These 
<br/>things  strengthen  us  and  build  confidence.  A  confident  forward-looking  country  will  become 
<br/>economically stronger and with that, we hope better able to care for those who are left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for 16 years, we had a Government that believed that some kind of national 
<br/>unity could be created by treating us as though we were all the same, denying our ethnic and cultural 
<br/>identities, treating our differences as sources of weakness, not strength.  We were not even allowed 
<br/>to  know  our  own  nation’s  ethnic  composition,  despite  the  urgent  need  for  such  information  in 
<br/>policymaking for health, education and so many other things. These actions did not bring us together. 
<br/>They tore us apart. They fed mistrust, division and suspicion among our different communities and 
<br/>now, we have urgent work to do to fix it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in our first six months in Government, we have made a start. We commemorated 
<br/>Girmit Day and Ratu Sukuna Day with national holidays and consequential events.  The return of the 
<br/>Great Council of Chiefs is a recognition of the rights of our indigenous people, even as that important 
<br/>body itself goes through a process of self-review.  The Terms of Reference of that review recognises 
<br/>the Council of Chief’s responsibilities towards other communities in Fiji.  These things may all seem 
<br/>merely symbolic, but they are consequential, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We witnessed the Methodist Church Leader reconciliation ceremony in which all Churches 
<br/>and faith groups participated; a commitment was made that we will celebrate all of us in our full 
<br/></span><span>diversity as we build our new nation. These are signs of greater things ahead - a new Fiji, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, a Fiji where every citizen has a role to play in nation building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  attended  the  recent  ‘Fiji  Times  at  150’  book  launch.  This  book  reminds  us  of  the 
<br/>contributions of all communities – the Europeans, the early Chinese settlers from the sandalwood 
<br/>trade who found home in island villages, the Melanesian community who were brought before my 
<br/>ancestors as part of the slave trade have contributed to our nation, just as have Kioans, Rabi Islanders 
<br/>and Rotumans and everyone who calls Fiji their home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Much of our history is not taught, often each of our people feel isolated and alone in their 
<br/></span><span>suffering.  And when history is told, it is done in isolation, of one people at a time.  But where is the 
<br/>history of how we all developed together?  How is it that we are not learning about it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our President, His Excellency, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, has given us a clear direction to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>include Fiji’s collective history in our education system.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to national unity and nation building, there is still much to 
<br/>do, and I believe our Government has begun well.  This Budget has something for all our people, 
<br/>each one of us in our diversity to help us progress as a people, as communities and as one nation.  I 
<br/>would  like  to  thank  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics, for crafting this amazing Budget that is people-centered, and I 
<br/>fully support and commend the Budget for the Financial Year 2023-2024 for a new Fiji.   </span><span>Vinaka 
<br/>vakalevu</span><span> and God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  economic  growth  hinges  on  political 
<br/>stability and respect for the rule of law.  It hinges on the confidence of the people that live in our 
<br/>country and how they perceive their political and social activities that is happening around them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The political and social ground must be stabilized to create confidence in people who own or 
<br/>run  businesses  that  are  established  or  companies  looking  around  to  establish  a  base  for  their 
<br/>businesses.  This  will not  only  give security but  allow business  to  grow  and give returns to  their 
<br/>owners and shareholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  the confidence to  establish and operate in  Fiji  whether it is  a small, medium  or large 
<br/>business which will provide snowball effect of creating employment within but also provide grounds 
<br/>to other supporting industries and businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Minister of Finance stated in his speech, and I quote from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Page 1014 of the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> on Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Everyone expects me today to talk about economics.  Let me remind everyone of 
<br/>the  old  maxim,  well  understood  by  good  scientists,  good  environmentalists,  and  good 
<br/>economists that everything is connected to everything else.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can advise the learned Professor and honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>that the conditions we are experiencing is not conducive to stable and good economic growth.  He 
<br/>can lecture us on the good economic plans that he has mastered over the years, but he needs to ask 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues, including the Assistant Ministers, to work 
<br/>towards providing a conducive ground to nurture confidence at all levels of our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government must be seen to establish the independence of the three separate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>arms of governing and keep them separated at arm’s length. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Look in the mirror. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- What we have witnessed in the last six months is not right 
<br/>and will haunt Fiji in the future.  I will not go into the detail but it is a phenomenon that is well known 
<br/>in Fiji and neighbouring countries, and I am sure that my colleagues will cover this in detail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not profess to be an expert on finance, economy or budget, like the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance.  As a layman, all I can see is we are heading downhill on a slippery 
<br/></span><span>slope  and  unless  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  Coalition  Government  carries  drastic 
<br/></span><span>corrective actions, Fijians will face the consequences of a financial doom in the medium to long term.  
<br/>Unintended consequences will kick in as we move forward under these uncertain circumstances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget estimate is $4.3 billion, but Budget is heading to a big spending and big deficit.  
<br/>Borrowing will be around $1.28 billion, operation estimated at 75 percent, capital at only 25 percent.  
<br/>This rate of spending needs to be monitored as it could run out of control very fast.  We have gone

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1133 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>busted on the $10 million debt and I estimate the debt will be in the vicinity of $11 billion in the very 
<br/>near future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rise of VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent will create a rise in the cost of living and food.  
<br/>Transport cost will also soon rise, and everything will be less affordable to our people.  The economy 
<br/>will slow down, as we are already at a high inflammatory environment.  New prices are emerging 
<br/>and slow growth will take revenue out of Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The timing of this Budget is not right.  This is a big spending Budget and with a huge deficit 
<br/>of $639 million, VAT increases will slow the economy down.  Debt and deficit will go higher if 
<br/>Government does not control spending. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are the main features of the Budget?  A well-known fact, $3.7 billion revenue, estimated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenditure of $4.3 billion and estimated deficit of $639 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  arouse  the  interest  of  listeners,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance 
<br/>planned the Budget layout and calculated that the best way to defend is to attack.  Unfortunately, the 
<br/>honourable Minister decided to attack the FijiFirst Government’s performance, and this was covered 
<br/>in the first 25 pages of his 91 page speech, basically continuing his election campaign gimmicks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- $500 million debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  The  ‘Biman  Budget’  launched  its  delivery  to  appease 
<br/>everyone. At the end, it disappointed all, except him and his cronies, who supposedly were given the 
<br/>task to soften the impact of tax increases.  What a fuss!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget is inflated by putting out the requisition in every Budget Estimate.  I wish to draw 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your attention to line nine and ten in every Head of the Ministries’ budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are the facts of Fiji’s economy?  Fiji’s economy is basically tourism based.  We need 
<br/>to continue to support tourism but look for other growth areas.  We need to diversify; we need to 
<br/>look at resource-based economic development.  We need to support manufacturing and construction. 
<br/>We need to encourage Business Process Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reviewed the resource-based Ministries to see funding that will innovate them and encourage 
<br/>growth.    Unfortunately,  the  Budget  does  not  reflect  any  new  projects  to  improve  activities  in 
<br/></span><span>agriculture, fisheries and forestry, including lands and mineral resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-  I will ask for your opinion, honourable Kamikamica, if I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>need to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the general outlook, the Budget is pro-rich and attacks the poor and the marginalised.  It 
<br/>will make the low and medium bracket income earners struggle and provides little or no way out.  It 
<br/></span><span>does not innovate to provide incentives for investment and provide new work for unemployed people, 
<br/></span><span>graduating out of university and other training institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With increase retirement age to 60 years, it will create less employment opportunities to our 
<br/>younger population, as people over 50 years will benefit from obtaining their FNPF savings while 
<br/>they turn 55, but they will still hold on to their jobs until 60 years. There is no current contract term 
<br/>of employment, they just turn up daily and get paid.  It has nothing for our young people to look of

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to in terms of prospects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increase in VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent will affect low and medium income earners 
<br/>more than rich people in our society.  Zero-rated VAT which will assist the rich people too is equally 
<br/>for  low  and  middle  wage  earners,  who  will  suffer  more  due  to  increase  in  the  15  percent  VAT 
<br/>increase.  No investment in the infrastructure will lead to less work available in the companies that 
<br/>employ people in the construction industry and other supporting companies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by exploring and explaining my interpretation of the 2023-
<br/>2024  Budget.    To  get  a  better  understanding  of  this,  we  need  to  examine  the  last  years  of  what 
<br/>transpired in the last two terms of Parliament prior to the formation of the Coalition Government. 
<br/>This Budget, in its entirety, is all about honourable Professor Prasad, his thoughts and attitude for the 
<br/>last eight years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  introduction  of  the  Budget  and  the  excuses  reflect  the  culmination  of  attitude  and 
<br/>arrogance  that  he  had  displayed  in  this  Parliament  over  the  last  two  terms.    I  understand  the 
<br/>difficulties that he is facing, trying to balance a Budget to satisfy the three Parties in the Coalition 
<br/>Government. I also know that he must satisfy all the General Election promises made by the three 
<br/>Parties over six months ago, and also the promise made by the Coalition Government to deliver in 
<br/>its first 100 days which is impossible but promised anyway. This is the level of blaming and trying 
<br/>to  camouflage  this  Budget  to  hoodwink  the  people  of  Fiji,  especially  the  poor  and  marginalised 
<br/>people of this country.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister of Finance, the great Abraham Lincoln said, I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your lies and concoction will haunt you in the next few months and certainly before the next Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will destroy this country and will weaken the medium class 
<br/>spending power and further improvise the low-income earners and the poor people of our beloved 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in reviewing the Budget Estimates, it is evident that the main aim of this 
<br/>Budget  is  to  increase  revenue  and  increasing  revenue  will  increase  VAT  and  increase  taxes.  
<br/></span><span>Ultimately, this is the worst action to take now, especially when the world over is trying to grapple 
<br/></span><span>with economic distress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has already made its mind that it will need more money to 
<br/>satisfy all its promises.  The honourable Prime Minister then gave the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>a guideline to collect and cover the expected inflated Budget.  This has forced the increase in VAT 
<br/>to 15 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  items  in  zero-VAT  list  have  not  changed  from  what  was  brought  up  by  the  FijiFirst 
<br/></span><span>Government, but with a single exception of adding prescribed medication, which is already part of 
<br/></span><span>the Free Medicine Scheme. This is just the continuation or the initiative of the  FijiFirst government 
<br/>to assist Fijians financially.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  Budget  announcement,  I  was  thinking  that  maybe  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance  was  presenting  the  Budget  on  behalf  of  the  previous  FijiFirst  government  with  all  its 
<br/>initiatives incorporated, as most of the initiatives were brought in by FijiFirst government to cater

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1135 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the needs of all Fijians.  It seems that the honourable Minister has taken a likening of the Budget 
<br/>policies of the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to protect the tourism industry, as it is the mainstay of the economy 
<br/>and a major income earner for Fiji.  What the Government has done in this Budget will basically kill 
<br/>tourism,  divert  tourists  to  other  destinations  around  the  Pacific  and  Asia  by  increasing  VAT, 
<br/>increasing in the Airport Tax from $100 to $125 and $140 from January 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism has undergone a boom period after the Airport Tax was reduced from $200 to $100 
<br/>by the FijiFirst government to attract tourists to Fiji.  Over-dependence on tourism is not good but 
<br/>we need to assist this sector as it provides the major fuel for the economic engine of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  examine  four  the  resource-based  Ministries  -  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forestry  and  the  Mineral  Resources  Department,  to  see  if 
<br/>allocation  had  reflected  the  importance  of  developing  these  important  sectors.    While  there  are 
<br/>increases in the resource-based sectors, the funding in Ministries as highlighted above is not directed 
<br/>to areas that will matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Ministry of Agriculture, an increase is noted on all major budgeted items, but are all 
<br/>under requisition.  Forestry should have shown funds that will be deployed to improve the mahogany 
<br/>sector and thus, lead to the development of commercial entities, similar to the Pacific Green Coconut 
<br/>Furniture Company. The  Ministry of Fisheries should be allocated more funds for the start-up of 
<br/>aquaculture farm for brackishwater, caged farming of fish in our coastal areas, to cushion the effect 
<br/>of climate change and overfishing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Budget of 2023-2024 is geared towards the rich people of Fiji.  
<br/>It has completely ignored the middle and low income earners, and our marginalised.  The rich will 
<br/>get richer and the poor will get poorer.  It has ignored the young people of this country, who are 
<br/>looking around for work opportunities to start a business and earn a decent, respectable and affordable 
<br/>living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  increase  in  VAT  will  have  a  huge  ripple  effect  on  the  economy  of  Fiji.    The  cost  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investing in Fiji will be too expensive and investors will look elsewhere to invest and get returns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have alluded to the tourism industry. Tourists will look elsewhere to spend 
<br/>their holidays and harden dollars. The increase in VAT will subsequently make holiday in Fiji very 
<br/></span><span>expensive, as hotels, cruise and tour operators, including suppliers and contractors will have to pass 
<br/></span><span>this cost to tourists as consumers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Airline tickets to Fiji will become expensive as the Airport Tax will now be included in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cost of buying their ticket.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investors and hotels and operators will not build extra rooms required for tourists as material 
<br/>for construction will become too expensive.  There will be massive unemployment as construction 
<br/>will stop and infrastructure development grinds to a halt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Fijians will need to go overseas to look for better opportunities.  Only the poor and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>downtrodden will be left in Fiji, as they do not have any other choice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  summary  and  to  conclude,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  big  spending  budget  with  total 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenditure expected to rise above 25.2 percent, at an all-time high of $4.3 billion by 2023-2024.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  increase  in  VAT  in  an  already  high  inflammatory  environment  could  see  consumer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>demands take revenue away from the Government and push that to higher level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, inevitable inflation is to be expected after 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, when the new tax rate will 
<br/>put pressure on Government revenue, pushing a high level of debt.  On the other hand, VAT increase 
<br/>will burden the construction and manufacturing sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increased VAT, FNPF and duty on raw materials will push costs outwards and this will 
<br/>be passed down to consumers, who are the people of Fiji.  Duty on raw materials does not raise a lot 
<br/>of  revenue  but  will  push  costs  in  the  industry  who  are  the  big  employers,  including  the  tourism, 
<br/>manufacturing and construction industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not support the Budget as it penalises the poor, while giving tax breaks for multinational 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>corporations.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable fellow Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; I rise to affirm the Ministry of Health and Medical Services’ 
<br/>full support for the 2023-2024 Budget that was presented on Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  commend  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  and  his  staff,  who  had  worked 
<br/>tirelessly to deliver a visionary Budget that sets the platform for a smart and resilient recovery.  This 
<br/>Budget is, indeed, a people’s Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming out of the woes of one in a hundred-year global pandemic, the people want better 
<br/>social services to help them overcome their daily struggles, and this Budget has answered the call.  
<br/>The Coalition Government, as promised, has prioritised the health of the people of Fiji by allocating 
<br/>$453.6 million for the next financial year, compared to $395.1 million in the current financial period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health and Medical Services is, indeed, grateful to Government for the $58.5 
<br/>million budget increase, as we have many strategies to implement in the next 12 months to improve 
<br/>the provision of quality healthcare services around Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the 2023-2024 Budget, the Ministry aims to achieve outcomes across 
<br/>key  health  system  components  that  will  support  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  health  service 
<br/>delivery,  including  the  upgrading  and  improvement  of  healthcare  facilities  and  health  services 
<br/></span><span>support systems; strengthening the management of our human resources for health; taking innovative 
<br/></span><span>approaches, including private sector engagement to mitigate the impact of staff exodus; refocusing 
<br/>on public health and primary healthcare to build a more resilient health system; tackling the ever-
<br/>increasing  burden  of  Non-Communicable  Diseases  in  the  country;  and  instilling  the  culture  of 
<br/>wellness that empowers our communities to live a healthy and productive life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the point of capital projects, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation of $39.6 million for capital 
<br/>projects under the Ministry will facilitate the planned health infrastructure improvements.  Out of 
<br/>these, the Ministry has allocated $1.8 million for the upgrade and maintenance of urban hospitals and 
<br/></span><span>institutional quarters, and this will address the much needed work in the painting and repairing of the 
<br/></span><span>CWM Maternity Unit exterior, construction of the walkway that connects the East and West Wing 
<br/>of the CWM Hospital, incinerator infrastructure, rehabilitation works for CWM Hospital, road works 
<br/>for  the  Labasa  Hospital  Road  and    undertaking  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  for 
<br/>Labasa Hospital refurbishment worksite.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has also allocated $2 million for the upgrade and maintenance of Subdivisional 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hospitals,  Health  Centres,  Nursing  Stations  and  these  will  be  directed  towards  the  planned 
<br/>renovations  at  Valelevu  Health  Centre,  Makoi  Health  Centre,  Lami  Health  Centre,  Wainibokasi 
<br/>Subdivisional Hospital and Korovou Subdivisional Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  further  $6.75  million  has  been  allocated  in  the  Budget  towards  the  refurbishment  of 
<br/>Savusavu Hospital, the upgrade of Labasa Hospital interior and the construction works for the new 
<br/>National Rehabilitation Centre at the Tamavua Twomey Hospital.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, other important construction preparatory works that include the construction 
<br/>of Qamea Health Centre, construction of doctors and nurses’ quarters and refurbishment of nursing 
<br/>stations at Nagado in Ba; Tokaimalo in Ra; Nacula and Yaqeta in Yasawa; Kubulau in Bua; Tuvu, 
<br/>Naqalimare and Raiwaqa in the Nadroga/ Navosa Subdivision, has been allocated $1.6 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  well-maintained  clinics and dwellings  are essential  for maintaining the health and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>morale of our healthcare workers, as they provide health services to our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the point of minor works, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation of $3 million for minor works 
<br/>which is a significant increase from $1 million allocated in the current financial year, is welcomed 
<br/>and it is very important in ensuring that the Ministry can continue to maintain and repair its hospitals 
<br/>and institutions in a timely manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  regard  and  preparation  for  the  new  financial  year,  the  Ministry  has  taken  plans  to 
<br/>establish its minor work plans to be able to segregate this allocation further to all the core centres for 
<br/>ease of implementation  and monitoring of activities.  The Ministry is  also taking steps to engage 
<br/>suitably qualified technical staff to assist in implementing the much-needed works towards changing 
<br/>the outlook for the more and wanted healthcare infrastructure under the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On accessing medicine and medical products, Mr. Speaker, Sir, equitable and uninterrupted 
<br/>access  to  essential  medicine  is  an  important  component  of  our  focus  on  strengthening  primary 
<br/>healthcare in Fiji.  As we have stated before, we firmly believe that the primary healthcare approach 
<br/>provides the best platform and conduit for the Fiji health services efforts towards achieving universal 
<br/>health  coverage  for  our  population.    These  mammoth  tasks  rest  with  the  Fiji  Pharmaceutical  and 
<br/>Biomedical Services  (FPBS), who are responsible for procuring  essential medicine, consumables, 
<br/>medical supplies, medical appliances, biomedical equipment, x-ray materials, laboratory reagents, 
<br/>infection prevention and control supplies and staff clothing for the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FPBS has invested with strategic partnership support on an online stock 
<br/></span><span>and  inventory  management  tool  called  m-supply,  which  is  geared  towards  improving  our  stock 
<br/>management system.  The m-supply system provides for the ordering, procurement and inventory 
<br/>management of pharmaceutical and medical supplies held at the FPBS and all participating health 
<br/>facilities.  As of today, 45 percent of our targeted healthcare facilities, departments and service areas 
<br/>have been connected and are now utilising m-supply system when managing their clinical stock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This means that 94 health facilities out of 236 target sites now use either a template or PC to 
<br/>place their orders and monitor their inventory.  These facilities and sites include dental departments, 
<br/></span><span>radiology  departments,  laboratory  departments,  operating  theatres  at  the  CWM  Hospital,  Labasa 
<br/></span><span>Hospital, Subdivisional Hospitals in Nadi, Sigatoka and Nabouwalu in Bua and the rural healthcare 
<br/>facilities  in  Cicia  and  Lakeba  in  the  Lau  Group,  Kioa,  Saqani,  Lekutu,  Kubulau  and  Qamea  in 
<br/>Northern Division and Bouma in Taveuni.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is grateful that the Government has, in the next financial year, increased the

<br/>Dental equipment from $389,200 to $1.21 million; and 
<br/>Allocation  to  purchase  biomedical  equipment  for  our  hospitals  has  been  significantly 
<br/>increased  from  $3  million  to  $12.3  million,  which  will  allow  the  Ministry  to  replace 
<br/>obsolete  and  non-functioning  biomedical  equipment  and  establish  functional  service 
<br/>contract agreements that will ensure the longevity of major biomedical equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The budgetary allocation under FPBS will ensure that we will accomplish the full roll-out of 
<br/>the  m-supply  within  the  next  financial  year  so  that  we  can  achieve  our  targets  of  reducing  and 
<br/>eliminating stockout of essential medicine and supplies of our health facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another major focus of the Ministry is on tackling the disease burden of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>NCD and endemic communicable diseases in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the world come to terms with the new normal way of living and working with the COVID-
<br/>19 virus, the Ministry is focussed on strengthening the primary healthcare, particularly in the area of 
<br/>preventative healthcare.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increase in excise tax of alcohol and tobacco by 5 percent and the increase in excise for 
<br/>carbonated and sugar sweetened drinks for 40 cents per litre is much welcomed and it indicates the 
<br/>Government’s intent to tackle the current NCD crisis in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NCD remains the number one cause of sickness and premature mortality in 
<br/>our population and addressing the risk factors for our population is a necessary step towards halting 
<br/>this silent epidemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The allocation for NCDs in the Ministry’s Budget has also been increased substantially to 
<br/>$350,000  from  $150,000  allocated  in  this  financial  year  for  the  implementation  of  crucial  NCD 
<br/>Programmes. This increase is important, to ensure that we are able to implement our action plans for 
<br/>NCDs, as well as engage effectively with our health partners who are supporting us in this battle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 pandemic has taught the world the dangers of neglecting the 
<br/>threat of communicable diseases, whether endemic or novel to a country, public health programmes 
<br/>actions and initiatives should be constantly assessed, strengthened and enhanced to ensure that we 
<br/></span><span>are  able  to  effectively  prepare  for,  recognise,  diagnose,  manage  and  protect  our  people  when 
<br/></span><span>communicable disease outbreaks are on the horizon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In recognition of this critical role in Fiji’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the Health 
<br/>Protection Division of the Ministry has been designated as a new cost centre under the Ministry in 
<br/>the  new  financial  year.  This  is  an  important  and  essential  step  towards  strengthening  and  further 
<br/>enhancing our capabilities to conduct effectively disease surveillance programme for Fiji through an 
<br/>enhanced  diagnostic  capacity  at  the  Tamavua  Hospital  and  Namaka  in  Nadi  through  effective, 
<br/>collaborative border health surveillance services provided at our international ports and facilitated by 
<br/>the Border Health Protection Unit in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Health  Protection  Division  is  responsible  for  prevention  and  protection  against  acute 
<br/>threats to public health, including from communicable diseases, environmental hazards and health 
<br/>emergencies. The Division worked closely with the Medical Divisions in programme implementation 
<br/></span><span>and  consists  of  the  Environmental  Health  Unit,  the  Fiji  Centre  for  Disease  Control  (FCDC)  and 
<br/></span><span>Health Emergencies and Climate Change.

<div><span>In this Budget, the Health Protection Unit which is the Ministry’s newest cost centre has been 
<br/>allocated $2.8 million and this will enable greater flexibility, oversight and planning of programmes 
<br/>and operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Programme  Budget  for  Health  Protection  increased  from  $815,000  to  $1.29  million, 
<br/>which is a different of $480,000. This included increases in allocation for leptospirosis and dengue 
<br/>control, tobacco control enforcement and water sanitation and hygiene promotion, as well as the new 
<br/>allocation for outreach. This increase in the restoration of health protection allocations to levels that 
<br/>will better enable outreach and field activities for the prevention, preparedness and response to public 
<br/>health events of concern.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programmatically. the focus will be on the following areas:

<div><span>Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Dengue Fever Prevention and Control:   The allocation will allow 
<br/>for the increase in outreach activities on Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in schools, 
<br/>healthcare facilities in communities with the support of our heath partners, it also supports 
<br/>WASH Cluster preparedness and interventions. 
<br/>Training  for  Division  Outbreak  Response  Teams  and  Community  Awareness  in 
<br/>Preparation for the start of the rainy season.

<div><span>Sir, on food safety, the allocation will support the Food Safety Awareness and Training, given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the Ministry is a competent authority for food safety and food export market certification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Tobacco control, the allocation will support the review of relevant legislation related to 
<br/>health  protection  and  public  health,  strengthening  of  tobacco  control  enforcement  activities, 
<br/>including the promotion of tobacco free setting initiatives; and enhancing quarantine and the port 
<br/>health facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during and after COVID-19, we seem to have shifted our focus away from 
<br/>this deadly disease - HIV.  However, it is alarming that Fiji has increased its estimated HIV infection 
<br/>by 129 percent over the last decade, and according to the UNAIDS Global Report, we are now one 
<br/></span><span>of the top five countries out of a pool of 38 countries with an alarming rise in infection rates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the UNAIDS Report, Fiji is rated second in the Asia/Pacific Region, with the 
<br/>fastest growing HIV infection, and recording 46 HIV-related deaths last year which is also the highest 
<br/>in the region and for Fiji.  In 2022, Fiji recorded 245 HIV cases, compared to 151 cases in 2021, 
<br/>which is almost an increase of 100 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is alarming to note that 14 of these cases are children or under the tender 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>age of four years old.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will not rest on its laurels in the fight against HIV, and we are grateful that the 
<br/>HIV/AIDS Prevention Programme has been allocated to $200,000 in the 2023-2024 Budget, which 
<br/>is an increase of $110,000, approximately 122 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Universal  Health  Coverage,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  proposed  National  Budget  has  also 
<br/>indicated Government’s commitment towards achieving universal health coverage for the people of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji and leaving no one behind. For the first time ever, Government has allocated to each cost centre 
<br/>in the Ministry an allocation of $50,000 to $200,000 respectively to undertake outreach services into 
<br/>their respective communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Budget has allocated a resounding $655,000, compared to $493,500 in this current 
<br/>financial year. This is an increase of $161,500, or 33 percent.  This will allow our clinical and public 
<br/>health teams and specialist doctors and nurses to go out into our remote and hard-to-reach villages 
<br/>and communities to provide primary and secondary healthcare services to our people, who may not 
<br/>have the means to access healthcare for their health conditions in a timely manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government has also recognised the role of Health Partner Organisations in the delivery of 
<br/>health services in Fiji and has allocated $900,000 for NGOs who support the priorities of the Ministry 
<br/>by providing essential health services to the vulnerable population in our communities.

<br/>Prema Specialist Children Hospital  for children born with  congenital  heart  conditions  and the St. 
<br/>John Ambulance for the timely ambulance services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, community health workers or </span><span>nasi-ni-koro</span><span> as we know, the Ministry has 
<br/>been allocated $3 million for community health workers or </span><span>nasi-ni-koro</span><span>. They are the hands, eyes, 
<br/>ears and feet of the Ministry in the communities and play an important role in ensuring that our health 
<br/>programmes are supporting and meeting the health needs of Fijians in their homes and communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trained through our public health system, community health workers assist members of their 
<br/>respective communities on community health priorities such as maintaining good child health, safe 
<br/>motherhood and promote wellness while working closely with their zone nurses for our home based 
<br/>care and domiciliary care programmes.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, community health workers 
<br/>were effectively involved in checking, assessing and reporting on individuals or on home isolation 
<br/>in the communities.  There are a total of 1,582 community healthcare workers in the country - 411 
<br/>healthcare workers in the West, 438 in the North, 455 in the Central and 278 in the Eastern Division.  
<br/>The allocation will assist the Ministry in meeting the payment of their monthly allowance of $200. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, on the more important point of nursing workforce.  The Government has heard the plight 
<br/>of our nurses in this Budget and responded to the exodus of this valuable health workforce from the 
<br/>Ministry.  A sum of $5.08 million has been allocated for the movement of about 1,600 nurses to their 
<br/>correct salary band relative to the years of their work experience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The upward movement of Intern Nurses’ salary to Band F is allocated $1.15 million which 
<br/>will  benefit  330  new  nursing  graduates.    At  least  98  registered  nurses  will  benefit  from  the 
<br/>$399,246.82  allocated  for  consolidated  allowance  while  the  $4.83  million  allocated  as  retention 
<br/>allowance will benefit the current 2,447 nursing workforce under the Ministry.  These incentives for 
<br/>the nursing workforce will go a long way in addressing the unprecedented attrition of nurses that is 
<br/>threatening the integrity of our health systems and will greatly assist in stabilising and planning the 
<br/>delivery of health services in the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has again shown commendable leadership in this Budget and 
<br/></span><span>that while the Ministers and Assistant Ministers has taken reduction in salaries and privileges, the 
<br/>current salaries of healthcare workforce and indeed all civil servants in Fiji has been protected and 
<br/>maintained in the midst of economic challenges we are facing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this way, the hard work and dedication of more than 7,500 staff of the Ministry of Health 
<br/>and Medical Services have been acknowledged and rewarded and this is indeed commendable.  In

<div><span>1141 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>addition, the provision of overtime will assist in carrying out essential tasks that cannot be completed 
<br/>within the normal working hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also aware that like all agencies of Government, it has a role 
<br/>in economic recovery for the nation.  In this regard, the Ministry has put into action strategies that 
<br/>include the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the recruitment of more staff in the Food Unit and Tobacco Unit that will ensure timely 
<br/>issuance of licenses that facilitate the work of industries that deal with these products; and 
<br/>the digitalisation of application process to minimise the laborious processes associated with 
<br/>application and reduce turnaround time for response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I would like to respond to the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition’s remarks on the funds from the Ministry being utilised in the Ministry of Education’s 
<br/>$200 “Back to School” initiative.  The Ministry re-deployed $10.4 million back to the Ministry for  
<br/>Finance in the latter half of this last Budget year.  In essence, the deployment of funds were from 
<br/>allocations  that  we  knew  would  not  be  spent  within  the  allocated  financial  year  because  of  the 
<br/>following reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  the  latter  half  of  the  last  financial  year,  the  scoping  of  a  number  of  capital  projects 
<br/>including Savusavu Hospital Refurbishment Project had not yet been completed.  We knew by the 
<br/>time that scoping would be completed, we would have to rely on the budget that is currently under 
<br/>debate and discussions today to fund the refurbishment.  This was because of a highly centralised 
<br/>tender process which in the previous government was all done in the Construction Implementation 
<br/>Unit. To compensate this inherited shortcoming, we embarked on a strong community engagement 
<br/>programme which was already born fruit as we see in the Savusavu Hospital and many of the small 
<br/>healthcare facilities around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, moving forward I have initiated control the centralised process to ensure the 
<br/>more completion of tender processes so that we can facilitate more timely capital expenditure.  So, 
<br/>in  summary,  the  redeployment  was  a  logical  response  where  unavoidable  expenditure  difficulties 
<br/>within  the  Ministry  of  Health  from  factors  we  inherited  and  urgent  needs  within  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education was mitigated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition further adds that they have done 
<br/>so much in regards to infrastructure in the Ministry of Health and Medical Services.  He stated that 
<br/></span><span>whilst the previous government built Nakasi Health Centre, Valelevu Health Centre, Navosa Hospital 
<br/></span><span>in  Keiyasi,  Rotuma,  renovation  at  CWM  Hospital,  et  cetera,  congratulations  for  your  efforts  but 
<br/>today, there is no connection of sewerage to the main line at Nakasi Health Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Navosa Hospital in Keiyasi had officially opened its doors with borrowed items from 
<br/>various  hospitals  and  health  centres,  thus  affecting  the  provision  of  quality  healthcare  in  these 
<br/>facilities.  Rotuma Hospital cost the Ministry approximately $8 million to build, the groundbreaking 
<br/>ceremony was held in 2014, yet nine years down the line it is yet to be completed and this time we 
<br/>will do it right when the time is ready for opening.  Sir, the state of nation’s infrastructure mid-year 
<br/></span><span>to  February  revealed  the  appalling  state  of  our  100-year  old  Colonial  War  Memorial  Hospital 
<br/></span><span>(CWMH).  The picture is worth a thousand words.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  concluding, the Ministry has taken steps to  ensure that the budgetary 
<br/>allocations will be utilised as intended by the Government.  The Ministry is thankful that it will be 
<br/></span><span>able  to  recruit  essential  corporate  support  services  staff  such  as  clerical  officers,  labourers,  boat 
<br/></span><span>captains, handymen, boiler men and store officers amongst others and these support staff are critical

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the efficient implementation of the new Budget towards the delivery of quality healthcare services

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proposed National Budget allocation for the financial year of 2023–2024 is one that will 
<br/>ensure  Fijians are  able to build back better and  stronger and this is  pivotal  in  building  a resilient 
<br/>healthcare system economy and society.  In affirming my full support for this Budget, I urge Fijians 
<br/>to continue to support Government’s visionary plans that are aimed at achieving our full economic 
<br/>and social recovery in laying the platform for a secure healthier future for our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, distinguished Members 
<br/>of this Parliament, fellow citizens, I actually rise today as a representative of the Opposition and most 
<br/>importantly as a Fijian compelled by the responsibility entrusted upon us by the people of Fiji and 
<br/>especially those who voted for FijiFirst into Parliament as the single largest political party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were elected to ensure that our citizens’ voices are 
<br/>heard, their rights are respected and their aspirations addressed.  It is with this duty in mind that I 
<br/>stand here to give my remarks on the 2023- 2024 National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us begin by acknowledging the sentiments that were expressed in the  Budget Address. 
<br/>The people of Fiji actually desire accountability, respect and the well-being of our nation. We, the 
<br/>Opposition, share these aspirations and acknowledge the importance of leadership that respects the 
<br/>contributions of those who came before and recognizes the essential role of every citizen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, stability, security and equality – that is meant to be the covenant that every 
<br/>single person who takes on the mantle of leading our country actually upholds.  As we delve deeper 
<br/>into the discussion on Fiji's National Budget, it is imperative to emphasize that these three crucial 
<br/>pillars  that  underpin  economic  prosperity  are  stability,  security  and  equality. Without  these 
<br/>fundamental elements, any economic plan is destined to fail, leaving our nation in a perpetual state 
<br/>of turmoil and inequality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  former  Prime  Minister,  Voreqe  Bainimarama  and  the  FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>government brought about changes that actually upheld these critical values.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Solicitor-General sacking, what is that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Good governance, Mr. Speake, Sir,  is a new concept for the other side 
<br/>of Parliament then, so allow me to explain how these values underpin the very fabric of our society 
<br/>and economic prosperity.  Stability  plays a pivotal  role in  fostering an environment  conducive to 
<br/>economic growth. Investors, Mr. Speaker, Sir, both local and foreign, seek actual stability to make 
<br/>long-term commitments and contribute to the development of our economy. Repeated attacks on our 
<br/>Constitution, independent institutions and those who play a critical role in nation-building actually 
<br/>erode the very foundations of stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Let me repeat, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the reckless decisions that we have seen 
<br/>so far, and those embedded in this particular Budget erode the stability that we desperately need. 
<br/>Case in point or look at the numbers the people that are actually migrating and leaving for greener 
<br/>pastures.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  uncertainty  in  fiscal  policies  only  serve  to  deter 
<br/>potential investors.  It will only leave us trapped in a cycle of stagnation. So, while it lasts, they can 
<br/>ride on the good works that we did. For example, they have boasted about 7 percent interest paid out 
<br/>by FNPF, that same FNPF that they criticised and said was not making prudent investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  this  is  the  same  FNPF  that  has  paid  out  $2.06  billion  in  interest  payments  to 
<br/>members over the past six years. And while we were battling COVID-19 and assisting our airlines 
<br/>and keeping our country afloat, we had an honourable Member that side who was actually eating 
<br/>planes on social media, calling on the government to abandon Fiji Airways. I have a great comment 
<br/>in store right at the end which will actually tell you the exact makeup of the other side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our own honourable Prime Minister at the moment praised Fiji Airways and 
<br/>said that the recent achievement by the airline makes it evident that the great airline powers of the 
<br/>world  recognise  and  know  the  service  of  Fiji  Airways  staff.  You’re  welcome,  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister. Fiji Airways is another FijiFirst success. It is not a laughing matter, honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance.  Please give credit where credit is due.  I know you got a love affair with Aiyaz Sayed-
<br/>Khaiyum but just stop it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not me, it is you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, remember also  that part of the airline was  actually  purchased by 
<br/>FNPF at the height of COVID. So, all our Fiji citizens have part of that particular airline. We all 
<br/>know that security is a vital component also in a thriving economy. Our citizens need to feel safe and 
<br/>protected in their daily lives.  At the moment, they do not, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Economic growth cannot 
<br/>be achieved if people are plagued by fear …   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Where is your facts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- … and insecurity. We still have pressing issues for crime, corruption and  
<br/>ethno-national discrimination that continues to haunt our society, now even more so, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir. To truly pave the way for economic prosperity, we must absolutely prioritise the well-being and 
<br/></span><span>security of our people by upholding constitutional values. Unfortunately, Fiji now knows the track 
<br/>record of the other side of Parliament where our Constitution is concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, equality is the cornerstone of any economic plan and indeed for any nation. 
<br/>A thriving economy cannot be built on a foundation of disparity and of injustice. We must strive for 
<br/>a society where every citizen, regardless of who they are or their circumstances has equal access to 
<br/>opportunities and resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, falls short, way short in addressing the glaring wealth gaps 
<br/></span><span>and systematic inequalities that persist in our nation. You have actually killed the  middle-income 
<br/>society with this Budget, a society that was created by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have no idea what you are talking about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- He knows everything, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he does not like it when he hears

<div><span>the truth. Very soon he will turn around and talk to them about it because that is the way he does it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- All of them, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without this commitment for equality and we are actually risk perpetuating social divisions 
<br/>and hindering the overall progress of Fiji and it is going to be a sad day indeed, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>This Government came into power on the back of some shady offerings and deals to coerce Coalition 
<br/>partnerships and to fund these promises and do good on deals that were made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget, touted as a milestone has actually elicited 
<br/>a  sense  of  disdain  and  disappointment  amongst  those  who  understand  the  ramifications  of  poor 
<br/>economic management and I will get to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us begin by examining the numbers. The Government proudly declares a massive increase 
<br/>in spending, a staggering $4.3 billion, which is purportedly the largest in Fiji's history. But at what 
<br/>cost? A record revenue of $3.7 billion supported by an unjustifiable hike in VAT and corporate tax 
<br/>rates is nothing more than a smokescreen to disguise the truth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A net deficit of $639 million, the largest outside of pandemic years, and a ballooning debt 
<br/>from $9.9 billion to $10.5 billion.  Let me just qualify something, they are going to say, “ it is just 
<br/>large debt”, they keep forgetting about COVID-19.  We had to take on debt … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- … to look after our people, remember that, for which they are grateful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment the honourable Minister of Finance who does not possess ability to actually 
<br/>manage the economy, Sir, is just beyond me.  It is indeed a "big" Budget, as the Government proudly 
<br/>proclaims, with expenses soaring to new heights. However, let us not be blinded by this particular 
<br/>veil of deception and I will tell you the kind of veil of deception, “oh, let us reduce the per diem that 
<br/>goes out to every Minister.”  But guess what?  We are going to travel more.  Instead of the 10 they 
<br/>will do the 20 which works out to the same thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Who is going to do the work?  Despite the promised revenue increase, 
<br/>Fiji is still headed towards a $639 million deficit. The VAT hike is actually an ill-conceived strategy, 
<br/>we were all looking forward to his earlier predictions. We will bring down VAT – ha ha guess what?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Someone lied, this ill-conceived strategy threatens, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to exacerbate this deficit 
<br/>and catapult our nation into even deeper debt. It is not just us speaking, go speak to those outside this 
<br/></span><span>Parliament.  The dreams of a balanced budget remain nothing more than a distant mirage. This Budget 
<br/></span><span>offers little relief to those that are suffering, in fact the rich will get richer, I said it before, and the 
<br/>poor shall fund their glossy promises and fancy lifestyles. Let me expound, a seven-year tax holiday 
<br/>being  given  to  a  multi-billionaire  company  while  everyday  Jone  and  Premila  are  going  to  pay  6 
<br/>percent more every time they buy anything.    
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- So officially the new sponsors of the Emmy’s  and the red carpets and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the award ceremonies are Jone and Premila.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Wrong, totally wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Absolutely right!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Read your notes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The defender of the water companies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reduce income tax by 5 percent to individuals earning more than $270,000, so the rich can 
<br/>spend  more  on  fancy  restaurants  while  Jone  and  Premila  think  twice  about  buying  food  for  their 
<br/>families.  They promised change to make lives better but, what did they do?  Increased VAT and 
<br/>reduced income tax by 5 percent to those individuals earning $270,000.  Does that not seem like you 
<br/>are protecting the poor?  You are protecting the rich.  What did they do?  They said equal distribution 
<br/>of land lease money was not the right way.  Does that seem like you are protecting the everyday 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span>?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I hope those minutes get added on.  The reality of the matter is VAT is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>going up so that Ministers can sit in business class and take their selfies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And so that they can enjoy endless trips overseas to do what they want.  Unfortunately, the 
<br/>reality we face today is far from what was promised.  I do not begrudge them being in Government, 
<br/>fine, no problem.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance spoke about the desire for 
<br/>change and the need for a government that works towards the betterment of its citizens.  However, 
<br/>the actions and policies outlined in this Budget do not align with those particular noble aspirations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Instead,  they  perpetuate  a  narrative  of  continued  mismanagement, 
<br/></span><span>neglect  and  disregard  for  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  our  people.    They  applaud  themselves  to 
<br/></span><span>delivering  the  budget  on  time  but  let  us  not  forget  the  timely  delivery  is  just  merely  a  basic 
<br/>expectation.  The real issue lies in the content and the effectiveness of the Budget, and this has far-
<br/>reaching effects for thousands of families in Fiji.  This Budget fails to address those challenges that 
<br/>are being faced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, speaking of fundamentals, and I hope the honourable Prof. Prasad is actually 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>listening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  He is not listening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Your review process.  You do not instil confidence when you have your 
<br/>lawyer-cum  speech writer, become the Chairman of the Fiscal  Review  Committee whilst  his  still 
<br/>convicted, putting together a report without any declarations of numerous conflicts.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I did not say failed.

<div><span>many others.

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It hurts you, does it not?  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were not even made aware of these conflicts.  No wonder certain companies are actually 
<br/>getting tax free status.  You do not instil confidence when you mess up the review process and its 
<br/>order.  Everyone knows you first get a small group to review something in detail and then you present 
<br/>the findings to a wider group for their comments, but you decided to do the summit first and then do 
<br/>the fiscal review.  It does not make sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Would  it  not  have  made  sense  to  bring  better  policies  if  the  Fiscal  Review  Report  was 
<br/>published and discussed in the Economic Summit?  There were about 500 top minds from around 
<br/>Fiji  that  you  had  invited  to  the  Summit  with  a  taxpayer  funded  </span><span>kalavata;</span><span>  analyse  the 
<br/>recommendations  that  your  party  associates  put  in  the  Fiscal  Review  Report.    You  do  not  instil 
<br/>confidence when a family member of yours, taxpayer dollars are given to an institution that your 
<br/>family member is in.  And then also, to a single education provider like Polytech and that person 
<br/>within that Polytech happens to be a compatriot.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This sort of collusive approach is not only morally bankrupt but bordering on illegal.  You do 
<br/>not instil confidence when police brutality is committed in broad daylight in the middle of the city, 
<br/>yet your budget has not even touched on the allocations to eradicate human right abuses.  You do not 
<br/>instil confidence when you remove subsidies, we had provided to give relief to thousands of Fijian 
<br/>families.  You do not instil confidence when you do not keep your word.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The change you promised pre-election was VAT reduction, you have been told that today, 
<br/>and I saw the expression on your face when the honourable Leader of the Opposition brought it up.  
<br/>Not a good expression, honourable Minister of Finance.  We actually have you on video saying that 
<br/>in your Manifesto saying that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Don’t play it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We know you are not going to  reduce the debt, in fact, you are taking 
<br/>on more debt and silently.  Tell the people!  The gross borrowing requirement is of $1.2 billion and 
<br/>tell the people that it is higher because maturing debt is refinanced, it is not paid.  All governments 
<br/>around the world, when it comes to mature time to actually pay, they do not pay it off, they refinance 
<br/>it.  It is the simple philosophy that maybe everyone should know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we were in government, we borrowed at near zero at very low interest rates and we 
<br/></span><span>actually  managed  it  well,  contrary  to  what  may  they  believe,  but  do  not  ask  us,  go  and  ask  our 
<br/>development partners and everyone else around town, the international institutions that said that to 
<br/>us - we were one of the best managed economies during COVID-19.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You may laugh, you may laugh, but guess what?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  must  call  this  budget  out  for  what  it  is.  It  is 
<br/>unimaginative budget, it is not creative, it is the biggest spending budget, the largest in Fiji’s history 
<br/>post COVID, $4.3 billion, an increase of 37.8 percent, so much for fiscal consolidation and reducing 
<br/>expenditure.  The consequences for Fiji and the future of Fiji are actually dying.  We must correct 
<br/>the course of this particular economic policies and we will be shipwrecked otherwise.   There are 
<br/>some things that I need to address before I run out of time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is actually going to kill the middle-income society, it has no 
<br/>creativity and no innovation.   The engine for growth for any economy has been stalled, which is the 
<br/>middle-income society.  As a matter of fact, there is a massive disconnect between all the honourable 
<br/>Ministers, especially the major ones, one says something, the other one says something else, they just 
<br/>do not connect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even the honourable Prime Minister has not connected to the honourable Minister of Finance.  
<br/>He says something, this person says something else.  You know, honourable Kamikamica, Sir, he 
<br/>waxes lyrical about innovation, creativity; fantastic speeches.  Guess what?  They have done nothing 
<br/>for all of that.  The honourable Minister of Finance has not given one incentive to him, he has not 
<br/>given him one initiative, nothing to actually create more employment, nothing to keep our Fijians 
<br/>here.  Absolutely nothing!  All they are relying on is FijiFirst policies that we had put in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Microwave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hot air, that is all they are about.  Honourable Gavoka sat there and also 
<br/>waxed lyrical.  Guess what, honourable Gavoka, (who he is not here), be careful of the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance because he the other day in the newspaper said, he is the right man for the job.  
<br/>But guess what?  He qualified his statement by saying, at the moment.   Be very wise about what is 
<br/>sitting around you, honourable Gavoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is very poor financial management when it comes to all of these.   We 
<br/>have got the largest deficit since 1992.  The net deficit budget sits outside pandemic years, and all 
<br/>these hysteria that they have created about debt, now the Government is on a spend-a-thon.  What 
<br/>matters is, actually the size of the debt does not matter, it is if you are a growing economy then you 
<br/></span><span>can actually repay that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have always been in that particular state.  Debt as a proportion of GDP is actually coming 
<br/>down and we all know that, but the answer to all of these is growing the economy.  What has the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance given us in this Budget that is actually going to grow the economy? 
<br/>Absolutely nothing, zero, nada, </span><span>kuch nahi</span><span>.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, no innovation,  no incentives, no creativity and guess  what, poor old  Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister, honourable Kamikamica is now going to fall flat on his face with respect to all that 
<br/></span><span>waxing lyrical that his done about growing the economy, ...   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  …  bringing  in  more  investments.  No  encouragement  to  the  middle-
<br/>income society. The middle-income society is the one that actually spends. They are the ones that are

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aspirational, Mr. Speaker. Right now, we are heading into unsustainable debt levels. That is what, 
<br/>honourable Gavoka said. I guess that is completely wrong. He needs to put things in perspective.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A couple of things that I just quickly need to address, honourable Kamikamica actually spoke 
<br/>about film tax rebate.  Honourable Kamikamica, I think you need to tell the whole story. As a matter 
<br/>of fact, </span><span>Survivor</span><span> is still here.   All of those movies that were filmed here, they spent hundreds of 
<br/>millions of dollars. The training that was given to our people was huge.  Guess what? The marketing 
<br/>dollars that we obtained out of these movies is actually huge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  By  the  way  if  you  are  talking  about  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  too,  we  welcome  the 
<br/>investigation. You know as far as USP is concerned, honourable Minister all they had to do was do 
<br/>the investigation, they would have got their money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This Government has never been scared of one person. As far as the FRA 
<br/>is concerned, go take a great look around you.  We made sure we supported FRA to put the necessary 
<br/>infrastructure in so that our trade could work, people could move, goods could move in a better road 
<br/>that has ever been, Mr. Speaker. You just have to take it on and continue with it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the consequences for Fiji are too dire to actually imagine if we do not correct 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our course and our economic policies. We will be shipwrecked.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want to leave, Mr. Speaker, with one last comment and this is really good. According 
<br/>to them there is economic woes. According to honourable Tabuya absolute economic most. She has 
<br/>been harping on whole day, </span><span>dinau</span><span> and debt. On 1</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2021, honourable Tabuya says, “print 
<br/>more money.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She has suggested that Government should print more money to solve economic woes. Print 
<br/>more money but  she does not  understand that will  not  work, Mr. Speaker. What  happened to  the 
<br/>waxing lyrical here about printing more money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Out of date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- She said the idea is bold and controversial but unprecedented times call 
<br/>for such measures. Well according to your book, you are in unprecedented times.  There are economic 
<br/>woes.  What you doing - print more money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I think my time is up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I thank you for the extended time, Mr. Speaker. I do not support this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget and I thank all the speakers previous to me and thank you for listening.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 7.47 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, the general public who are here in the gallery and also 
<br/>those watching on television and via livestream.  </span><span>Nu bula nakwa </span><span>and good evening to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is with great privilege and deep appreciation that I address this august 
<br/>Parliament to express my explicit support for the National Budget delivered on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023.  I 
<br/>commend the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance along with his dedicated 
<br/>team for their unwavering commitment and tireless efforts in formulating a budget.  It is a Budget 
<br/>that not only insists hopes but also paves the way for a prosperous future for our beloved nation of 
<br/>Fiji.  This Budget embodies a spirit of unity and collaboration igniting a renewed sense of purpose 
<br/>amongst our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is steadfast in its mission to construct a new Fiji, 
<br/>one  that  prioritises  solidarity  and  trust,  pleases  the  people  at  the  heart  of  its  endeavours  and 
<br/>demonstrates prudence in its fiscal framework to maintain a sustainable national debt to GDP ratio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the other side of Parliament that this is not a copy and paste 
<br/>Budget, a Budget that is warmed in a microwave. This is a smart and a well-crafted Budget.  We will 
<br/>continue to be innovative, inclusive and stronger together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, rising debt to GDP ratio in Fiji has become a grave concern for our nation’s 
<br/>future.  It is alarming to witness the ratio spike from 48.8 percent from 2018 to 2019 to a staggering 
<br/>88.8 percent by the end of 2021–2022 financial year.  While the impact of the pandemic cannot be 
<br/>ignored, it is crucial to acknowledge that there was an underlying issue preceding it.  The current 
<br/>state of affairs demands immediate attention and action and the Coalition Government is committed 
<br/>to rectifying this situation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget reverses 16 years of misrule and false promises, 16 years of poor, unstable and 
<br/>bad governance and 16 years of lost hope.  This Budget goes beyond addressing immediate needs, it 
<br/>lays  the  groundwork  for  instilling  hope  in  future  generations.    Through  collaborative  efforts  and 
<br/>cautious steps, we have embarked on a journey of recovery, taking decisive measures to overcome 
<br/>the crisis faced by various sectors in Fiji.  While we have made significant progress, it is vital to 
<br/></span><span>acknowledge that our work has just begun.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Notable aspect of this Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the increased allocation of key sectors such 
<br/>as health, education, infrastructure and agriculture.  This  exemplifies the Coalition Government’s 
<br/>commitment  in  enhancing  essential  services  that  directly  impact  the  lives  of  ordinary  Fijians  by 
<br/>fostering  a  healthy,  well-educated  population  and  improving  access  to  better  roads,  water  and 
<br/>coordinated agriculture programmes.  We will invigorate a more vibrant and prosperous new Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>Affairs which has been neglected for 
<br/></span><span>16 years has received increased funding.  This signifies our commitment to ensure that the </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>Affairs  administration  is  adequately  resourced  to  address  issues  such  as  poverty  and  resource 
<br/>management effectively.  At the heart of Fiji, a reality persistS that cannot be ignored.  It weighs 
<br/>heavily on our collective conscience.  It is harsh truth that 24 percent of our fellow Fijians live in a 
<br/>grim of poverty, among them a staggering 75 percent are </span><span>iTaukei, </span><span>our resource owners who bear the 
<br/>burden of hardship.  This is a reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we cannot turn away from and it is our 
<br/>duty to confront it head on. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1151 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By providing timely support for the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>community, we aim to address the deep-rooted 
<br/>issue of poverty.  We understand that the key lies in empowering those who own the very resources 
<br/>that hold the potential for economic prosperity.  It is imperative that we help them recognise the true 
<br/>value of the resources and guide them towards sustainable avenues of growth and development.  Let 
<br/>us rise together, driven by compassion and a burning desire for a change.  Let us extend a helping 
<br/>hand to those in need, ensuring that the future holds a brighter prospect for every Fijian.  Through 
<br/>unity and sheer determination, we will build a Fiji where poverty becomes a thing of the past and 
<br/>where the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people can reclaim their rightful place of strength and resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today we stand together to prove that our promises are not empty rhetoric 
<br/>but resolute commitments.  The responsibility now lies with the Coalition Government to continue 
<br/>the vital work of ensuring that every Fijian can enjoy the security of a safe and permanent place to 
<br/>call their home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  shortage  of  housing  in  our  country  is  not  solely  the  result  of  one 
<br/>government’s action but rather a consequence of inadequate measures taken over several decades.  
<br/>To address the pressing issue, the Ministry of Housing has been allocated a substantial sum of $25.7 
<br/>million  in  the  2023–2024  National  Budget.    This  allocation  will  enable  the  Ministry  to  fulfill  its 
<br/>mandate of providing accessible, adequate and affordable housing to low and middle income earners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The escalating rate of rural to urban migration compounded by the adverse effects of climate 
<br/>change necessitates urgent action to tackle housing challenges and formulate policies that cater for 
<br/>the rising demand for affordable housing.  Additionally, our focus extends to safeguarding the needs 
<br/>of the vulnerable population within our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  will  continue  to  assist  the  Ministry  in  the 
<br/>development of new housing projects by the Housing Authority and Public Rental Board.  As such 
<br/>more Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiatives will be promoted for efficient delivery of affordable 
<br/>housing  projects.    Funding  for  assisting  in  the  provision  of  affordable  and  decent  housing  will 
<br/>continue as allocated in this Budget.  More consultation will be done with a lot of agencies in the 
<br/>First  Home  Ownership  Scheme  to  ensure  that  all  Fijians  have  access  to  proper  and  affordable 
<br/>housing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In recognising the importance of supporting individuals living with disabilities, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the Budget allocation for assistance in retrofitting their homes has been increased by 50 percent.  
<br/></span><span>The  increase  in  allocation  will  benefit  under  applicants  and  provide  them  with  necessary, 
<br/></span><span>accessibility  modifications.    Furthermore,  families  affected  by  accidental  fires  will  continue  to 
<br/>receive grants of up to $5,000 enabling them to rebuild their homes and lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has acquired 48 informal settlement development leases since 
<br/>2015,  however,  only  three  settlements  are  near  completion  of  the  formalisation  process.    This 
<br/>indicates that the former government did not have the political will to upgrade informal settlements.  
<br/>Had  they  done  so  would  have  contributed  to  the  alleviation  of  the  rising  number  of  informal 
<br/>settlements today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formalisation of informal settlements programme has been allocated a 
<br/>budget of $10 million in the next financial year.  With the primary focus of completing capital works 
<br/>in Sakoca, Tavela in  Nadi, Tore and Field 4 in  Lautoka. These capital  works should provide 378 
<br/>households access to affordable infrastructure at subsidised cost. Furthermore, nine settlements will 
<br/>begin capital works and additionally preparation works for nine more settlements are well underway.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the housing sector, the Coalition Government is serious about upgrading  
<br/>informal settlements in Fiji.  The increased budget allocation is a testament of our commitment to 
<br/>those  living  in  informal  settlements  to  be  provided  with  basic  services  such  as  roads,  water, 
<br/>sanitation, drainage and electricity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the past government did not do much upgrading of informal settlements.  
<br/>They  were  more  concerned  about  acquiring  development  leases  but  lacked  proper  planning  to 
<br/>develop  the  settlements.    Hence,  some  of  these  development  leases  have  expired  without  any 
<br/>development  work  undertaken.  In  this  regard,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government’s 
<br/>comprehensive approach encompasses a work plan designed to formalise the remaining 45 informal 
<br/>settlements  by  considering  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the  residents.    The  holistic  approach  will 
<br/>significantly enhance their livelihoods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry remains committed to refunding deposits paid by individuals 
<br/>to the People’s Community Network (PCN) for housing units at Lagilagi.  Regrettably, these projects 
<br/>remain incomplete despite the previous government’s allocation of over $12 million.  This showed a 
<br/>lack of commitment and vigour by the previous government which is definitely not the case for the 
<br/>Coalition  Government.    To-date,  a  total  of  434  refunds  have  been  made  from  the  initial  336 
<br/>complainants,  amounting  to  $3.5  million.  A  budget  of  $150,000  has  been  allocated  to  refund 
<br/>applicants in the coming financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  actively  working  on  the  review  of  the National  Housing 
<br/>Policy which will provide an updated strategic direction for our stakeholders in the housing sector.  
<br/>This  policy  aims  to  standardise  the  assessment  of  our  housing  needs  with  specific  focus  on 
<br/>affordability. This was supposed to be reviewed in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue its collaboration with housing partners such as Koroipita and the 
<br/>Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environment (RISE) Project with an allocation of $1.7 
<br/>million and $1 million respectively.  These collaborative efforts are designed to benefit vulnerable 
<br/>families by providing cyclone safe homes and improving sanitation and access to safe drinking water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this budgetary support, the Ministry will continue its crucial role in 
<br/>facilitating  the  provision  of  accessible,  adequate  and  affordable  housing  thereby  contributing  to 
<br/>broader socio-economic development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now shift to the priority areas for the Ministry of Local Government.  Our 
<br/></span><span>Coalition Government not only upholds the principle of freedom of expression and freedom for the 
<br/></span><span>Fijian  people  but  also  translates  these  principles  into  action.    Over  the  past  six  months  we  have 
<br/>empowered the people to actively participate in the governance of their country.  We have fostered 
<br/>an  environment  where  people  can  voice  their  concerns  and  demand  accountability  from  their 
<br/>government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most notably, we have  ushered in  a new  era of  democratic participation  by involving  our 
<br/>citizens  in  municipal  elections.    As  the  Minister  responsible  for  Local  Government,  my  primary 
<br/>objective  is  to  mobilise  my  team  towards  conducting  a  successful  municipal  council  elections  as 
<br/></span><span>promised by the Coalition Government.  Our achievements go beyond mere rhetoric surpassing the 
<br/></span><span>previous government’s failed promises since 2014.  </span><span>Sa rui sivia na lasu!  </span><span>In this august Parliament, 
<br/>honourable Bala mentioned in his speech in Parliament that Municipal Elections will be held.  It is 
<br/>now 2023, municipalitiess are still waiting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  conducting  elections  after  nearly  two  decades  is  a  formidable  task. 
<br/>However, the Coalition Government’s unwavering vision and determination has cleared the path to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1153 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this  accomplishment.  We  did  not  yield  to  legislate,  legislative  and  regulatory  challenges  used  as 
<br/>delaying  tactics  by  the  previous  government  instead  we  took  decisive  action.    In  the  spirit  of 
<br/>rebuilding our future together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we actively engaged with residents from all 13 towns 
<br/>and cities, seeking their valuable input on the desired changes in their municipal councils.  Our aim 
<br/>is to ensure that these institutions truly served the people, the people’s involvement in the process is 
<br/>vital for their benefit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past 18 years, we have witnessed a decline in democracy within 
<br/>municipal councils, excessive reliance on Government grants, undue interference, lack of long-term 
<br/>planning  and  vision  had  become  pervasive  issues.    We  are  determined  to  reverse  this  trend  by 
<br/>reducing Council dependence on grants and focusing on strengthening their revenue streams for long-
<br/>term sustainability. We have endorsed an action plan for the elections, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Ministry 
<br/>of Local Government, Office of the Solicitor-General and the Fijian Elections Office are working 
<br/>diligently to ensure a free and fair Municipal Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to enhance the positions and service delivery of the Municipal Councils, the 
<br/>Cabinet  endorsed  the  review  of  the  Special  Administrators  in  January  this  year.  Following  the 
<br/>performance  review,  the  Cabinet  has  approved  the  Expression  of  Interest  for  new  Special 
<br/>Administrators.  These  Special  Administrators  will  be  appointed  to  promote  accountability, 
<br/>transparency and good governance and addressing long standing issues of service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  defined  job  responsibilities  and  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPI)  to 
<br/>improve the quality of services.  As per the Local Government Act 1972, section 9(a) stated, and I 
<br/>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Special Administrators may perform the function of the Council until the Election date 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is determined by the Electoral Commission.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  alluded  to  earlier,  the  newly  appointed  Special  Administrators  will  play  a  pivotal  role  in  the 
<br/>transition to elected councillors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lack of council ownership has resulted in unacceptable delays in crucial 
<br/>capital projects such as the Lautoka City Swimming Pool.  What was meant to benefit the residents 
<br/>of  Lautoka  has  been  turned  into  an  international  level  competition  pool  through  ministerial 
<br/>intervention, leaving it unfinished and disregarding the needs of our own people.  The swimming 
<br/>pool was supposed to be completed in one year and nine months from January 2018, from an initial 
<br/></span><span>cost of $2 million, this has now ballooned to $11.2 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Tell the truth.  You are a Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- We are in July 2023, and the project is nowhere complete.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  The size has gone up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Govind Park started in January 2018 
<br/>for completion by the end of the same year, but the story remains the same.  Another failed promise 
<br/>by the previous government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Never expected things from you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Recognising the urgency to rectify such issues, our Ministry is in 
<br/>damage  control  mode  and  has  taken  decisive  action.    We  are  committed  to  ensuring  the  timely 
<br/>completion  of  the  Lautoka  Swimming  Pool  and  the  Govind  Park  in  Ba,  making  the  necessary 
<br/>modifications and allocating the required services in the new financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the pursuit of accountability and transparency, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been allocated a 
<br/>budgetary support for a dedicated Compliance and Audit Team.  This team will diligently monitor 
<br/>capital  projects,  conduct  thorough  financial  audits  of  municipal  councils  and  enforce  strict 
<br/>compliance with established KPIs and milestones.  Furthermore, this team will be the primary point 
<br/>of contact for all customer service inquiries related to the Department of Local Government, National 
<br/>Fire Authority and the Department of Town and Country Planning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  centralising  these  inquiries,  we  aim  to  streamline  processes,  eliminating  any  trace  of 
<br/>corruption,  favouritism  and  enable  the  Department  of  Town  and  Country  Planning  to  focus 
<br/>exclusively on processing applications.  These measures not only demonstrate our commitment to 
<br/>efficient delivery service, but also underscore our unwavering dedication to fostering a system of 
<br/>governance  that  prioritises  accountability,  transparency  and  timely  completion  of  vital  projects 
<br/>within our local government system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  process  for  doing  business,  particularly  construction  permits  have 
<br/>become burdensome, and hindering progress over the years.  Fiji’s standing in terms of ease of doing 
<br/>this,  it  is  at  a  risk  of  declining  further.    In  line  with  the  Coalition  Government’s  commitment  to 
<br/>streamline  processes  and  improve  ease  of  doing  business,  we  are  actively  digitalising  planning 
<br/>process with the Department of Town and Country Planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Microwave oven. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Our  aim  is  to  eliminate  bureaucratic  barriers  associated  with 
<br/>obtaining  development  permits.    As  part  of  the  larger  Government  doing  this  project,  we  are 
<br/>transitioning from the manual system to digital transformation.  By 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023, we will pilot 
<br/>the standing planning procedures and processes in three councils - Savusavu, Suva and Lautoka. This 
<br/>digital transformation will revolutionise service delivery, reduce application timelines and enhance 
<br/>transparency and promote stakeholder accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the development of new towns is a key focus of our Government’s proactive 
<br/></span><span>approach to urban growth.  We aim to create self-sufficient, resilient and thriving communities while 
<br/>minimising the need to commit to larger centres for services.  In this regard, I am delighted to share 
<br/>that Nabouwalu and Keiyasi have been earmarked as commercial hubs for trade.  However, extensive 
<br/>groundwork is required to provide the necessary infrastructure that supports commercial, industrial 
<br/>activities while considering climate change adaptation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-   Mind blowing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  These  initiatives  will  create  a  solid  foundation  for  economic 
<br/></span><span>growth and provide opportunities for both local and international businesses.  This programme has 
<br/>been allocated $2 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I proudly lend my full support to the 2023-2024 National Budget.  It reflects 
<br/>the  unwavering  commitment  of  the  Coalition  Government  to  address  the  pressing  needs  of  our 
<br/>people.  This Budget paves the way for a future where for every Fijian can have access to affordable

<br/>unwavering determination and unity, embracing innovation and strategic planning.  By working hand 
<br/>in hand, we can create a Fiji where communities thrive, our towns and cities flourish, and our dreams 
<br/>and aspirations become a reality.  I extend my heartfelt gratitude for this opportunity to contribute, 
<br/>and I assure you, that the Coalition Government  remains steadfast in its mission to build a better 
<br/>future for all Fijians.  I fully commend and support this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the Budget Estimate for 2023-2024 
<br/>financial year.  Before that, I would like to join my colleagues to express my dissatisfaction with the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, the Chair of the Constitutional Offices Commission (COC) for denying 
<br/>two members of FijiFirst to be in this Parliament today.  In other words, we missed two people who 
<br/>could have analysed this Budget and given their comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It all boils down to his failure to convene a meeting to appoint the 
<br/>members of the Electoral Commission, which we have heard from our leader.  So why blame the 
<br/>former Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and FijiFirst suspension to cover your deliberate 
<br/>attempt to deny full representation of FijiFirst in Parliament?  You had 49 days from the time the 
<br/>honourable Leader of Opposition was appointed in March to the suspension of FijiFirst in May to 
<br/>convene COC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Even when he did convene the COC last Friday, he did not have a full list of names to appoint 
<br/>the Electoral Commission.  So why blame others?  It seems the honourable Prime Minister cannot 
<br/>trust his Coalition partners, and he is playing safe to get the budget passed without any risk.  This is 
<br/>the level of insecurity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving  on  to  the  National  Budget,  to  say  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance’s  National 
<br/>Budget  is  disappointing  would  be  an  understatement.    This  Budget  is  underwhelming,  unfair, 
<br/>irresponsible, unimaginative, lacks creativity and above all, deceitful.  Instead of instilling hope, this 
<br/>Budget has left us in despair.  Mr. Speaker Sir, the Budget is merely pushing the different priorities 
<br/>of each leg of the uneven stool, rather than taking a collective approach to growing the economy and 
<br/>building confidence.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Budget raises very serious concerns regarding its impact on citizens, businesses, 
<br/></span><span>and the overall economy.  The increase in  VAT, duties and corporate tax will have a detrimental 
<br/>effect on the economy and the livelihood of citizens.  This Budget lacks a comprehensive strategy 
<br/>for lowering the cost of living for ordinary Fijians, or promoting private sector growth, essential for 
<br/>creating jobs and boosting economic productivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  after  so  much  frenzy  that  the  debt  is  high  and  we  need  to  control  the 
<br/>expenditure and start paying the debt, the honourable Minister of Finance did the opposite.  He chose 
<br/>to borrow more to spend more on operations rather than capital works.  He has delivered the largest 
<br/></span><span>deficit outside the pandemic years in the Fijian history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no sign that Fiji is on the path of fiscal repair, absolutely no sign.  We have heard 
<br/>from  honourable  Prof.  Biman  Prasad  that  25  percent  of  the  Government  Budget  will  go  towards 
<br/>servicing debt. To pay debt, one needs a balanced or surplus budget, not a budget deficit. This is what 
<br/>we are seeing.  We all know that this Professor is very good at hoodwinking.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is the same Professor who used the </span><span>Saqamoli</span><span> Budget as he termed it to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>run the government from December 2022 after voting against it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What they called freebies and handouts are now the main feature of 
<br/>the Coalition Government’s Budget.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of living is at an all-time high and it 
<br/>will get much worse if this Budget is passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget is heavily tilted against the poor, working and middle-income families, MSMEs, 
<br/>farmers and tourists. They will feel  the pain  at  the cash  registers  with  the VAT increases from 9 
<br/>percent to 15 percent.  It is obvious, the burden of raising government revenue lies squarely on them.  
<br/>Fijians should brace themselves for an increase in the price of everything by 6 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians who think that a measly increase in pension and other allowances 
<br/>including reduced duty on meat and prawns will improve access to these categories of food are being 
<br/>fooled.  All these items attract 15 percent VAT which will further increase the price by at least 1 
<br/>percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijians should be ready to pay more for over-the-counter medicines such as balm, eye and ear 
<br/>drops, cough mixtures, baby products, painkillers, vitamins, and other supplements.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  generally  when  someone  is  under  the  weather,  they  normally  go  to  the  pharmacy  to  get  this 
<br/>medication over the counter to actually fix themselves before they go to the doctor.  Now, when they 
<br/>go to the pharmacy, they will find that all the over the counter products are 15 percent and that will 
<br/>push the price further.  Do Fijians realise that under this Coalition Government their water, electricity 
<br/>and telecommunication bills will go up?  Is this what they promised to the people that they are going 
<br/>to look after them by increasing all their bills?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- If consumers are thinking that they are not affected by an increase in 
<br/>corporate  tax  then  they  are  naïve.    An  increase  in  corporate  tax  will  be  passed  on  to  consumers 
<br/>through price increases as businesses will always protect their profits.  A meagre increase in pension 
<br/>is still not enough to counter price increases on thousands of products because of VAT increases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of these items are not under price control, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The meagre increase in 
<br/></span><span>social allowance may give the false impression of improved support, but in practice, it will cause 
<br/></span><span>financial strain on pensioners and low-income earners. In fact, they are actually worse off.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am appalled by institutions like the Consumer Council of Fiji, FCOSS and 
<br/>other organisations and individuals for supporting this Budget without really understanding the full 
<br/>repercussion of this Budget on our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- They are getting the money from there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- In all these, I wonder what honourable Tabuya has to say.  She was 
<br/></span><span>opposing  a  12.5  percent  VAT  increase  through  social  media.  If  she  thought  12.5  percent  was 
<br/>inhumane,  I  wonder  what  she  has  to  say  about  15  percent  VAT  increase  which  her  party  is  now 
<br/>pushing for and she is happily supporting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Of course.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1157 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  any  tax  hikes  hurt  consumers  and  businesses  alike,  affecting  their 
<br/>purchasing power and decreasing investments.  Consumers’ disposable income will shrink causing 
<br/>cut  back  on  other  goods  and  services.  Such  behavioral  change  can  affect  businesses,  causing  the 
<br/>economy  to  slow  down  and  impacting  the  revenue  collection  for  the  government.  Tourism  will 
<br/>become more expensive, particularly with an increase in VAT and departure tax but the question is, 
<br/>why are we squeezing the tourism sector and letting the water bottling industry go scot-free? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, prior to the Budget, the honourable Prime Minister made a National Address 
<br/>asking  the  Fijian  people  to  understand  and  accept  the  hard  times,  alluding  to  the  Budget  while 
<br/>shamelessly in the same vein, giving all water bottling companies a 7-year tax holiday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We all wonder, what exactly was discussed between the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister and the billionaire owners of Fiji Water earlier this year for him to make an unjust 
<br/>decision.  One thing is for sure, the honourable Prime Minister has put the interest of Fiji Water first, 
<br/>much ahead of Fiji and the Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, how can this Budget justify the exemption of corporate tax specifically for 
<br/>established water bottling companies, while increasing corporate tax to all other companies and new 
<br/>companies registering on the South Pacific Stock Exchange?  Is this fair to our garment industry, 
<br/>food processing companies, furniture manufacturing companies and other export businesses to pay 
<br/>more in corporate income tax?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is strange, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the honourable Minister of Finance (who is never tired of 
<br/>speaking  about  accountability  and  transparency)  failed  to  mention  tax  exemption  for  all  water 
<br/>bottling companies (whether new or old) in his Address.  This is the level of protection the Rabuka 
<br/>Government is trying to give to rich and influential companies.  Absolutely no transparency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker Sir, it is illogical for honourable Prof. Biman Prasad to defend by saying 
<br/>that  the  increase  in  water  resource  tax  will  give  an  overall  gain  for  Fiji.    How?    Currently,  the 
<br/>companies are paying two taxes; water resource tax for water as raw materials, and corporate tax on 
<br/>the profits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by exempting  corporate tax, the water bottling companies will only  pay 
<br/>water  resource  tax,  and  zero  tax  on  their  profits.  So  how  is  this  a  revenue  gain?  Unless  these 
<br/></span><span>companies are showing losses in their books which is really hard to believe.  No matter what, you 
<br/></span><span>are forgoing revenue and setting a dangerous precedent.  The closer you are to this Government, the 
<br/>more you can get, you can get away with tax exemption. Let the other business suffer, who cares, 
<br/>ultimately let the country suffer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another interesting observation, just for one established international company to claim tax 
<br/>credits  in  USA,  the  Rabuka  Government  decided  to  forgo  corporate  tax  on  all  water  bottling 
<br/>companies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Water has become a gatekeeper, stopping Fijian companies from selling 
<br/></span><span>any products with the name “Fiji” in the USA market. Was this problem solved by the Prime Minister 
<br/>in all fairness to our local companies?  I hope international consumers and NGOs are watching how 
<br/>rich and powerful global brand is influencing politicians for their own gain in a developing country.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-    The  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  also  rewarded  lawyers  and 
<br/>accountants,  and  other  professionals  (some  of  them  are  on  the  Fiscal  Review  Committee)  by 
<br/>endorsing  the  removal  of  the  social  responsibility  tax  and  reducing  personal  tax  by  5  percent, 
<br/>resulting in a revenue loss of $2.2 million, while ignoring the recommendation made by the same 
<br/>Committee to reduce income tax for those earning between $30,000 to $50,000, this was not done.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this income group with no social protection will be badly affected if this Budget is 
<br/>passed.  He also deferred the taxing of dividend income benefitting the rich while taxing the working 
<br/>and middle class families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Do you know what you are talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Oh, yes, I know what I am talking about, thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Budget intends to tax Fijians earning any interest on their savings while 
<br/>exempting tax on the profits earned by companies like Fiji Water. This is not only unethical, this is 
<br/>shameful.  I will give you an example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if a farmer or a market vendor puts $5,000 
<br/>in their bank account and they are earning 2 percent interest rate, at the end  of the year they earn 
<br/>$100 as their interest income, this Government is going to tax that $100.  This is how low they have 
<br/>gone in collecting revenue from all these people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously, under the FijiFirst Government, the resident withholding tax on interest income, 
<br/>less than $1,000 was exempted from taxes.  Which Coalition Government will remove it once this 
<br/>Budget is passed, and I hope that the people of this country are listening. This is the Government that 
<br/>promised that we will look after your interest and this is what they are doing to the people of this 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the honourable Minister of Finance claims the debt situation is so bad, 
<br/>then  a  right-thinking  person  will  ask  -  why  is  the  Government  forgoing  all  these  revenues  from 
<br/>professionals and businesses that have the means to pay?  In fact, every penny should count.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, moving on to TELS.  To say TELS have been forgiven is deceptive. It is not 
<br/>forgiven; it is converted to a bond, with just a name change from Toppers Scholarship to Merit–based 
<br/>scholarship.  You know microwave, re-heating. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker,  Sir, 53,725 students will reap the benefit at the expense 
<br/></span><span>of most Fijians who do not have student debt.  It is unfair and inappropriate to ask the rest of the 
<br/>citizens to pay by dismantling a sustainable financial model of loan scheme just to meet SODELPA’s 
<br/>demand.  This means, every year, (and taxpayers should listen to this very carefully) the Government 
<br/>will  have  to  raise  around  $150  million  or  even  more  through  taxes,  maybe  another  VAT,  maybe 
<br/>another duty increase (I do not know what it would be) or redirect funds away from other services to 
<br/>continue paying for tertiary education.  Is this responsible leadership? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Why not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Is this your money that you can make a decision recklessly, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir?  The policy decision is not sustainable.  Of course, we know that the honourable Minister  of 
<br/>Finance does not care about financial sustainability.  I thought, as an honourable Minister of Finance, 
<br/>he would understand financial sustainability, he would have made the right decision, but he did not 
<br/>do it.  Why did  he not  do it?  Because he cares  only  about  pleasing  the Coalition partners at  the 
<br/>expense of taxpayers.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1159 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, honourable Prasad mentioned that only $5 million TELS debt was collected 
<br/>every year without disclosing the fact that for the last three years, students’ loans were suspended 
<br/>because  of  COVID-19,  and  of  course,  those  unemployed  were  not  expected  to  pay  till  they  find 
<br/>employment.    Forgiving  loans  solely  based  on  low  repayment  rate  lacks  logical  justification. 
<br/>Strengthening loan recovery was a better option, now that the economy is growing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the budget for the education sector has definitely increased but this increase 
<br/>is not really going to the schools or Free Education Grant has increased or bus fare has increased or 
<br/>something else has increased.  No, it has increased because we are paying USP.  In other words, 
<br/>chunk of the money has gone to the tertiary institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Realistically, the actual grants payable to these institutions should be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reviewed based on the guaranteed tuition fees given to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Coalition Government is preaching sacrifice with the increase in taxes and duties, 
<br/>we continue to see Ministers trotting around the globe.  In just 6 months, they have made more than 
<br/>65 overseas trips paid by the taxpayers.  Some have an average of at least one trip a month.  Actually, 
<br/>someone mentioned to me that Nadi Airport has become a revolving door for Ministers and Assistant 
<br/>Ministers.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Is this not  extravagance?  I expected the expenditure to  reduce, but 
<br/>what has happened in a country with less than a million people?  We have 29 Ministers and 3 Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers.  I feel very ashamed if someone asks me, “how big is your Government?”  I say, 
<br/>“29 and all of them are Ministers.”  It has become a laughing matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  lack  of  investor  and  consumer  confidence  is  not  only  demonstrated 
<br/>through this Budget but also through the Coalition Government for not complying with the Rule of 
<br/>Law  and  the  Constitution.    In  fact,  honourable  Manoa  Kamikamica’s  (who  is  not  here)  effort  to 
<br/>encourage  investors  to  invest  in  Fiji  is  ruined  by  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance.    Always 
<br/>negative utterances, inconsistent messaging on the economy; all these creates fear in the market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that every country had to borrow money to deal with prolonged 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19, induced economic and social crises.  We had to  support the economy  when business 
<br/>activities slowed down or started to shut down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tourism sector, our  largest  foreign  exchange earner was near zero. One-third of  Fiji’s 
<br/>workforce was either unemployed or on reduced hours.  During this period, our economy contracted 
<br/>by 17.2 percent and 4.1 percent in 2020 and 2021 respectively. There was a high risk of balance of 
<br/>payment  crisis.      In  spite  of  this,  Fijians  were  supported  by  the  Government  during  quarantine, 
<br/>isolation, hospitalisation, even death with assistance (either cash or kind).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  that,  the  economy  was  managed  well  to  put  Fiji  on  the  path  to 
<br/>recovery. That is why you can openly talk about 8 percent economic growth.  If we had not put our 
<br/>country on the path of recovery, you would not be talking about 8 percent economic growth.  We 
<br/>were the third fastest growing economy in the world.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- In 2022, our economic growth was 18.4 percent which the Opposition 
<br/>refused to believe when the projected figure of 12.4 percent was announced in the last Budget.  This 
<br/>year, the economy is poised to grow by 8 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite calls made by the Opposition, we did not devalue our dollar or print 
<br/>money or return the aircrafts or shut our national airline or cut civil service pay.  Our decision helped 
<br/>in the economic recovery with low inflation, high liquidity, healthy foreign reserves and manageable 
<br/>debt.    I  want  to  repeat  once  again,  manageable  debt  not  unsustainable  debt.    I  have  heard  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  saying  unsustainable,  I  have  heard  honourable  Kamikamica  saying 
<br/>unsustainable.  Please when they appoint a Fiscal Review Committee and when the Report comes 
<br/>out, at least they should have the courtesy of reading that Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  multinational  organisation  and  even  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance’s  own  Fiscal 
<br/>Review Committee Report stated that the debt is significant but manageable. Manageable is the word 
<br/>underlined, go and read that Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, instead of complaining, I urge the honourable Minister of Finance and other 
<br/>Ministers to show initiative to deal with problems as we did during COVID-19 and during several 
<br/>disasters caused by cyclones and floods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, FijiFirst Government’s fiscal policies played an important role in the recovery 
<br/>process.  We kept our taxes low to support private sector investment and to fuel consumer demand.   
<br/>There  is  a  stark  diversion  from  this,  as  we  can  see  the  Coalition  Government  is  relying  on  tax 
<br/>increases to raise Government revenue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget allocation for the Ministry for Housing has been reduced and we 
<br/>have heard from the Minister, but the major concern is the First Home Ownership Grant.  Sadly, this 
<br/>Grant will now be available to fewer families, further reducing economic activities in the construction 
<br/>and financial services.  There is always a very high demand for First Home Grant.  In the first few 
<br/>months of the year, generally this money is all used up.  Given the overall positive impact of this 
<br/>programme  on  the  Fijian  economy,  I  cannot  understand  why  honourable  Prasad  reduced  housing 
<br/>funding and diverted $8.6 million in January when Fijians had been waiting for this assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to end by thanking our leader, Frank Bainimarama, for resisting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the urge to sell or eat our Fiji Airways planes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He did not listen to honourable Gavoka’s many proposals promoting Qantas with no national 
<br/>pride for Fiji Airways.  After Fiji Airways created history by topping the prestigious Skytrax Award, 
<br/>beating Qantas and Air New Zealand, honourable Gavoka and others from the Government side are 
<br/>not  tired  of  praising  our  national  airline  or  ringing  Fiji  Airways  to  ask  for  invitations  for  the 
<br/>celebrations last week. Of course, the accommodation was probably paid by Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate, our economy will suffer if this disastrous Budget is passed in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.</span><span> </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  </span><span>Ni  sa  bula  vinaka,</span><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    The  honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Assistant Ministers and fellow Members of Parliament and also to members of the public who are 
<br/>watching this evening, I extend to you all a very good evening and </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span>.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1161 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I begin by just thanking God Almighty from whom all blessings flow, for sure is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His faithfulness and His enduring mercy.  I rise this evening, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to deliver my response 
<br/>to the 2023-2024 National Budget and provide my total support to it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know, it is not the </span><span>Saqamoli </span><span>Budget that was delivered last year by 
<br/>the former government. It is certainly not the “mother of all budgets” delivered in November 2014 
<br/>for the 2015 Financial Year, which in reality turned out to be anything but. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, allow me to make a few comments in response to a few speeches from the Opposition.  
<br/>On the topic of rising cost of living due to the VAT increase and corporate  taxes and duties, this 
<br/>Budget’s welfare policies are very well targeted to address the VAT effects on the people who need 
<br/>it the most.  Need I remind the other side, that all of us in this country, including those of us here in 
<br/>this Parliament and not just “Jone and Premila”, to quote a Member from the other side, have to pay 
<br/>for the mess left behind by their two legged stool of a government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker the 2023-2024 Budget is a budget that learns from the past, it is rooted in the 
<br/>present  and  has  its  eyes  firmly  on  the  future.  This  is  the  Budget  for  the  New  Fiji.  The  question 
<br/>therefore, is what kind of Fiji are we trying to build; a Fiji where we can accept one another at the 
<br/>table of brotherhood and sisterhood. A Fiji where our children can grow up, safe and sure, confident 
<br/>that  the  law  works  and  that  the  Government  works  for  them.  This  is  a  Budget  that  lays  the  firm 
<br/>foundation of rebuilding our future together.  A Budget that caters for the advancement of everyone, 
<br/>and  has  come  against  a  backdrop  where  more  than  $1  billion  or  25  percent  of  the  money  our 
<br/>Government  spends  is  to  be  applied  to  paying  interest  and  principal  on  our  debts.    A  legacy  left 
<br/>behind by a government that did not know how to manage the economy except to borrow and spend, 
<br/>and now that it is out of government, it turns out,  cannot even balance its own books as a political 
<br/>party and then they got suspended. So please do not lecture the new Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Members  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government for their confidence in my new appointment as Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
<br/>an appointment that I am assuming with humility and commitment. I am fully aware of the great 
<br/>responsibility that is placed on the shoulders of those who are called upon by our nation to represent 
<br/>them into the world. Be assured, Sir, that I will give it my utmost loyalty and service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take this moment to acknowledge the support of the staff of the Ministry of Housing and 
<br/>Local Government where I previously served. They have my appreciation for their dedication, for 
<br/></span><span>being gracious and helpful in their performance of their duties and their help to me in the performance 
<br/></span><span>of mine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our beautiful country is undergoing a positive transformation and a new Fiji is 
<br/>unfolding before our very eyes. A Fiji that has embraced real democracy and good governance. A 
<br/>Fiji that values freedom, inclusiveness, trust and accountability where the people is our focus.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Government’s mandated arm of diplomacy, and the national vanguard 
<br/>reaching out to and managing new fields and relationships, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs took a 
<br/></span><span>giant leap forward when the People’s Coalition Government took up the baton of leadership.  From 
<br/></span><span>being tucked under different portfolios, to the forefront where it rightly belongs for Fiji, the regional 
<br/>hub.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  milestone  was  amplified  at  the  very  first  official  engagement  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister in Kiribati where through time-tested Pacific way, he stopped the Pacific 
<br/>Family from coming apart. Our previous government treated our Pasifika neighbours with disdain, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as people unworthy of its attention as it clamoured for a bigger stage. The ridiculous fight over USP 
<br/>funding was a triumph of personal ego over common sense.  How could we in Fiji speak confidently 
<br/>in the wider world if we did not have the goodwill of our neighbours? Who were we to talk about the 
<br/>global threats to our region when it was our own government that was the greatest threat to regional 
<br/>unity?  But our honourable Prime Minister has moved swiftly to rebuild our bridges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it takes someone who understands and is prepared to take the time to be 
<br/>sensitive to Pasifika, Pasifika identity, Pasifika values and Pasifika sense of affinity to be able to 
<br/>cross the geopolitical, cultural and legalistic lines and offer the hand of hope and trust that can only 
<br/>be  offered  by  those  who  speak  from  the  heart.  The  honourable  Prime  Minister  did  that.    He 
<br/>understands  that  everything  we  do  as  a  region  from  this  point  onward  is  possible  only  upon  that 
<br/>platform of unity and solidarity as a Pasifika family.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as countries begin to adjust to a post-pandemic world and the socio-economic 
<br/>development  challenges  that  come  with  it,  a  worsening  climate  and  biodiversity  crisis,  and  geo-
<br/>political competition, the leveraging of international cooperation and solidarity is even more critical 
<br/>in our diplomacy. The way we frame our issues and interests to shore up support and generate new 
<br/>opportunities is indispensable to building new alliances and agreements. Our efforts are not only to 
<br/>ensure that our interests are protected at the global stage but that desired returns are realised through 
<br/>targeted engagements within our very limited capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will therefore embrace closer working relations with other 
<br/>Ministries and agencies to streamline systems and processes, improve coordination and ease of doing 
<br/>business as we approach our development and security partners. We will be investing in coordinating 
<br/>the levers of Government to ensure that domestic policy and foreign policy are working in tandem at 
<br/>all times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  region,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  increasingly  becoming  more  complex  and  contested.  The 
<br/>diplomatic lens we wear to tease out and articulate our issues, to manage regional dynamics, navigate 
<br/>our way around associated challenges and opportunities is changing. Our focus remains to conjointly 
<br/>safeguard and strengthen our sovereignty, security and prosperity. Our foreign policy is guided by 
<br/>our commitment to multilateralism and regionalism. Our diplomacy will therefore be determined, 
<br/>calculating and persistent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recent official bilateral and multilateral meetings attended by the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>the  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  Government  Ministers  and  Senior  Government  Officials  deepen  our 
<br/></span><span>relations and shore up cooperation. We have been forthright, honest and willing to do our part. These 
<br/></span><span>are building blocks to new frontiers and a re-calibrated diplomatic landscape.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  contested  space  we  find  ourselves,  we  endeavour  to  maintain 
<br/>constructive  relations  with  development  partners  while  upholding  good  practices  within  the 
<br/>international  rules-based  order.  This  approach  gives  us  the  safeguard  for  desired  returns  from 
<br/>bilateral and multilateral engagements.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the $4 million allocated for the re-opening of the three diplomatic Missions 
<br/></span><span>in Port Moresby, Washington and Kuala Lumpur signals the Coalition Government’s commitment 
<br/></span><span>to restoring Fiji’s presence to countries that have been and will continue to be major security and 
<br/>development partners. The focus will be on widening cooperation on a number of complementary 
<br/>fronts. Our selectiveness is key to optimising our opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our physical presence in selected regions and countries is needed at a time 
<br/>when we reach out to our friends for we do not have everything we need to deal with issues that are

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1163 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transnational in nature and require cooperative responses.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the general 
<br/>state of disrepair of some of our Mission properties after years of neglect reflects very poorly on us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have heard so many times since the Budget Address, maintenance seems to have been 
<br/>forgotten by some.  It is something that seems to have been forgotten by the previous Government 
<br/>and something for which we now must find funds to catch up.  The $2.2 million allocated for capital 
<br/>refurbishment work is a start and, therefore, greatly welcomed.   I commend our Mission staff who 
<br/>carry on their work with diligence and loyalty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the $37.9 million allocated, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will raise 
<br/>its  deliverance  capacity  to  be  more  active  and  cohesive.    An  immediate  focus  is  in  enabling  the 
<br/>Ministry to operate smartly with tested internal controls and accountability measures, a focus that the 
<br/>Coalition Government is bringing to all its decisions and actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is an increased expectation on our Missions, Mr. Speaker.  This includes the facilitation 
<br/>of other Ministry engagements abroad which are not yet budgeted for.  The Ministry will coordinate 
<br/>closely with other sectors within and outside Government, to find creative ways of providing needed 
<br/>support with allocated resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  renewed  emphasis  on  serving  our  diaspora  communities,  the  latter 
<br/>having contributed substantially to our economy in recent years.  Our diaspora community is not a 
<br/>side issue.  It is central to our image, voice and our purpose abroad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  diaspora  community  are  initiators,  they  are  suppliers  and  markets,  investors  and 
<br/>facilitators of humanitarian assistance.  They are our people, we will work with them and together, 
<br/>find new strategies to optimising their potential in their new country of residence to help grow our 
<br/>own economy, our skills and our human capacities at home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to reach out to other Ministries 
<br/>in an effort to strengthen coordination of our efforts at the international front.  In these, we are mindful 
<br/>of  the  2030  Agenda,  the  17  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  including  other  umbrella 
<br/>Development Agendas that will continue to underscore the Ministry’s attention.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  negotiations  and  advocacy  on  labour  mobility,  treaties  and  conventions, 
<br/>international  security,  trade, human rights,  Small Island Development  States and social economic 
<br/>agendas  are  priority  areas  in  the  Ministry’s  core  business.    We  will  endeavour  to  provide  timely 
<br/></span><span>support to counterparts in the formulation and coordination of the Government’s positions.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work of the Fiscal Review Committee and the Ministry for Finance must 
<br/>be commended.  They have put forth a budget that is smart and restorative.  It is an example of what 
<br/>can be achieved when we are united, open and consultative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Durable solutions are realised when the very people whose lives are affected are involved in 
<br/>that  search  for  solutions.    This  Budget  is  a  demonstration  of  this  inclusiveness.  It  is  part  of  the 
<br/>Coalition Government’s ongoing work towards re-setting our moral compass in terms of governance, 
<br/></span><span>economic management and real and practical help for our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I,  therefore,  commend  the  great  work  of  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister of Finance and his team, and hereby give my full support to the Budget.  God bless Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, I rise to contribute to the 2023- 2024 Budget Debate.  Before I do, I would 
<br/>like to thank you for allowing me an opportunity to respond to the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also thank the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members on the Government side.  I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition and 
<br/>the  26  Members  of  Parliament  that  make  up  the  Opposition,  although  we  are  being  denied 
<br/>parliamentary representative democracy with our two seats yet to be filled.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to start my response to the 2023-2024 Budget on the Ministry of Civil Service.  
<br/>The  Ministry,  under  Head  17,  is  being  allocated  $50.6  million  in  the  Budget.    In  the  2022-2023 
<br/>Budget, the Ministry was allocated $2.74 million.  In the 2021-2022 Budget, the allocation was $2.4 
<br/>million and in 2020-2021, the Ministry was allocated $3 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the 2023-2024 National Budget, there has been a big increase of 95 percent in the 
<br/>Ministry’s allocation.  Every year, the Ministry ran under one programme.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this 
<br/>reflects the Government’s wasteful spending and yet, the honourable Minister of Finance blames the 
<br/>last Administration for the wasteful spending.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rent of office space amounts to $34 million plus.  The rent of all UN 
<br/>Offices is $3.3 million, and renovation of quarters and public buildings is being allocated $3 million.  
<br/>It accumulates 95 percent of the Ministry’s allocation, which is my point that this big spending could 
<br/>be used on other programmes or development work to help Fijians who are in need or fix road that 
<br/>needs to be looked into.  Can we be enlightened on who are the private stakeholders?  I hope that 
<br/>they are not the supporters of the Coalition Government that are looking to gain from public funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, only  $3 million  for renovation of quarters which house  the Government 
<br/>official is understood, but to requisite $46.6 million to the Ministry of Civil Service is a very familiar 
<br/>sight  for  corruption.    Why  cannot  the  allocation  be  stored  under  the  Ministry  for  Finance  for 
<br/>monitoring and control purpose?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my hope that funding for SGDs, Global Leadership Programme, Kizuna 
<br/>Programme,  Agri-Net  Programme,  DRR  Programme  and  Clean  City  Programme  with  JICA,  for 
<br/>which $972,132 will be put to good use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As stated by the honourable Minister of Finance, I will quote from what he said: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“And let me remind everyone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that COVID-19 pandemic was 
<br/>not the underlying cause of our problems.  COVID-19 certainly made them worse, but 
<br/>this has been a decade of missed opportunities.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  had  nine  consecutive  years  of  economic  growth  from  2010  to  2018.    I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for finally admitting to the fact that he chose to ignore for a very long time, and 
<br/>the above quote is just one of the many.  If you look into the 2018-2019 Budget, the economy was at 
<br/>its peak.  Then COVID-19 struck the world and Fiji was badly hit for two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before coming into power, the honourable Minister criticised FNPF and the 
<br/>Government for using FNPF members’ funds to support their families.  After the 2023-2024 Budget 
<br/>Address, the honourable Minister was on record on “Straight Talk”, thanking FNPF for the support 
<br/>during the two years of COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="123">Page 123</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1165 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1998, the FNPF net  worth was $2.15 billion under the SVT Government.  In 2005, the 
<br/>FNPF net worth was $3.2 billion under the SDL Government.  During COVID-19 year which was 
<br/>2021, the FNPF net worth was $8.2 billion.  This was a great achievement for FNPF during COVID-
<br/>19.  The honourable Minister also criticised Fiji Airways, which is now ranked 14</span><span>th</span><span> in the world and 
<br/>the leading airline company in the region, way above New Zealand and Australia.  This is because 
<br/>of the smart and decisive leadership of FijiFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we would have gone with the suggestion from honourable Tabuya or honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad to sell or eat the planes, we would not have reached the climax that we have achieved today, 
<br/>and I congratulate Fiji Airways for the achievement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister of Finance also claims that we left the great debt of $10 million, but 
<br/>what he fails to tell the public on the separation between domestic debt and foreign debts, the values 
<br/>of debts and the history behind these debts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If only the honourable Minister of Finance can be honest about the simple facts, the people 
<br/>of Fiji can see the reality of the current status of Fiji’s economy and the truth behind these debts, then 
<br/>only the honourable Minister can stop the blame game and work on taking Fiji forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was really surprised with the current Coalition Government’s borrowing 
<br/>which is $223.2 million, according to the RBF Quarterly Reports for the first three months of 2023.  
<br/>Imagine, in three months, the amount of debt this Government has accumulated, only then can you 
<br/>understand where we are heading in years to come.  This clearly shows that the Government can 
<br/>spend so much on themselves, and the people will pay for their bills through increased VAT and 
<br/>TAX.    That  is  why  the  Government  is  manipulating  the  members  of  the  public,  taxpayers  and 
<br/>corporate businesses that we must be  ready for the hard times  ahead, while Fiji  Water gets  a tax 
<br/>exemption for seven years along with all other water bottling companies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Government emptying the pocket of the poor and filling up the pocket 
<br/>of the rich?  Going through the Budget, I thank the FijiFirst for eight years of governance - never 
<br/>once we forgot the people of Fiji.  Even during COVID-19, we did not tell them, “We will face hard 
<br/>times ahead”, but we still found ways to bring Fiji back on the world map.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there was no money in Government as claimed by the honourable Minister of Finance, then 
<br/>how he, in  six  months, has  been able to  table a Budget  with  an estimate of $4.33 billion  and net 
<br/>deficit percentage of GDP 4.8 percent? That clearly shows that FijiFirst left the economy in good 
<br/>state, and the job of the Government that takes over is to stop complaining and move it to the next

<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Fiji was the third country in the world to recover from COVID-19 which 
<br/>speaks  volume  about  FijiFirst  leadership  and  our  leader  then,  Mr.  Voreqe  Bainimarama.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-You have two leaders, so who is the leader?  It is really confusing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the revenue collection for the year ending 2022-2023 
<br/>was $2.2 billion. Our foreign reserve sits comfortably at $3.3 billion.  The Government fails to secure 
<br/>a protection plan for the people and the increasing cost of living to justify why the capital expenditure 
<br/>increased  by  $28  million  and  operational  expenditure  increased  by  $437.6  million,  which  clearly 
<br/>reflects that the Government spending is very high and meeting the needs of the people is very low.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may put this into percentage, the Coalition Government’s capital expense is 39 percent while 
<br/>their operational expenses is 61 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When FijiFirst was in power, its capital expenditure was always more than the operational 
<br/>expenses.  FijiFirst prioritised more on the people and less on the Government operation. The people 
<br/>are tired of hearing the story that always replays when the honourable Minister of Finance speaks 
<br/>titled, “16 years of leadership”.  We would like to hear what is there for people under your leadership.  
<br/>It is time for you to showcase your experience as an experienced Opposition Member for the past 
<br/>eight years and provide better solutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The road condition in the recent six months is at its worst up in the Naitasiri, Navosa and Ra 
<br/>Highlands, as well as in streets in towns and cities.  This is due to funds that got diverted to fulfil 
<br/>promises  such  as  the  Back-to-School  Programme,  GCC,  Girmit  Day,  Ratu  Sukuna  Day,  Fiscal 
<br/>Review, and the consultation list goes on and on.  All we see is </span><span>salusalu</span><span> here, </span><span>salusalu</span><span> there, opening 
<br/>here, commissioning there, and expensive travels of the 29 Members of the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The time for partying is over.  The people are waiting to see what is going to benefit them 
<br/>and yet, the Government puts a burden on people’s shoulders.  This is certainly not a great answer 
<br/>for people of Fiji who voted for change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a few questions I would like to ask the Government of the day.  Where is fairness?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Where is transparency?  Where is equality?  Where is accountability?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As stated as the theme of the 2023-2024 National Budget - Rebuilding our Future Together, 
<br/>that brings me to my final question, where is togetherness in this Budget when only few groups are 
<br/>benefitting and the majority get to pay the bills? The people have got to realise that this Government 
<br/>does not have a vision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this can be seen in people’s movement for the past six months, people prefer 
<br/>migrating  than  to  stay  in  Fiji.    They  are  being  neglected  and  marginalised  by  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government which is a greater threat to braindrain in our beloved Fiji. If the Coalition Government 
<br/>wants to talk about human resource development and fails to see the reality, then it needs to relook 
<br/>at their plan for a better Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Renown  economies  around  the  Pacific  are  keenly  following  Fiji’s  economic  situation  and 
<br/>they have predicted, and I quote, “It is a big Budget.  Expenses up significantly but so too is revenue 
<br/></span><span>prediction.”  Economists are looking at the large deficit of $639 million.  They are forecasting that 
<br/></span><span>the high VAT could end up slowing the GDP and taking revenue away from Government.  Deficit 
<br/>and debt can higher than forecasted, if Government sticks to its expenditure plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  modest  fiscal  tightening  over  forward  estimates,  looking  at  the  large  deficit,  they  are 
<br/>forecasting that balanced Budget is still far away.  With banks recording a large deficit, it is not a 
<br/>good sign for the economy.  People who applied for loans before the change in Government are not 
<br/>accessing the loans due to the uncertainty of the Coalition Government’s financial management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People are either paying their loans or buying policies to safeguard their business and their 
<br/></span><span>families’ future, but not  to take loans.  When will the tyre meet the road, honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance?  Basically, all development works officiated in the past six months and in the months to 
<br/>come is the work of the FijiFirst Budget, of the so-called Administration you always replay in all 
<br/>your speeches. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1167 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Viria Water Project is an example of FijiFirst plan to solve the water problem in Nausori, 
<br/>Suva  to  Lami  corridor,  and  will  be  open  soon.  This  facility  is  the  biggest  in  the  South  Pacific, 
<br/>providing 40 mega litres of treatment plant, benefiting 360,000 Fijians at a cost of $270 million.  Like 
<br/>all others, the Coalition Government will be opening this facility soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would say that the taxation system is at its worst if we pass the 2023-2024 Budget.  It will 
<br/>not solve anything but only bring more problem to the economy and the effects will land heavily on 
<br/>the low to middle income earners of Fiji.  Sir, 15 percent VAT still does not help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  also  quote  honourable  Tabuya’s  </span><span>Tiktok  </span><span>video  and  I  quote,  “Increasing  of  VAT  is 
<br/>inhumane.  Whoever is responsible must stop it.” I will repeat honourable Tabuya’s </span><span>TikTok</span><span> video 
<br/>and I quote; “Increasing of VAT is inhumane.  Whoever is responsible must stop it.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It will only increase poverty in Fiji, departure tax increase reduces Fiji’s popularity as one of 
<br/>the best tourist destinations, not forgetting departmental tax.  The 22 items VAT exempt is not enough 
<br/>to help low-income families because they will worry about other things, for example, ruler, rubber, 
<br/>plates, pots, uniforms, shoes, bags, lunch box, clothing, traveling and shelter.  In fact, 21 items were 
<br/>already zero-rated.  This Government only adds one item.  Could this Government not add 21 more 
<br/>items for the betterment, for the change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  increase  in  cost  of  living  and  justifying  this  to  benefit  our  future,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government is failing to secure the low to middle income families with more children.  Are we going 
<br/>back in time whereby a child who lives with five or more siblings, will have to sacrifice his future to 
<br/>secure his or her siblings?  It is certainly the case, looking at the new TELS Waiver Guideline, and 
<br/>the new policy that comes with it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government believes in human development but minimising the opportunity.  
<br/>The Government fails to capitalise or plan for basic human rights on the Rights to Education for all 
<br/>Fijians  under  Section  31  of  2013  Constitution.    My  advice  to  the  parents,  if  you  are  a  farmer, 
<br/>fisherman or whatever trade you are in, work hard and plan to save.  If you are working and you are 
<br/>enjoying your 7 percent FNPF, increase and enjoy while it lasts because in a few months, you will 
<br/>be funding your child’s education in tertiary schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an ambitious Budget by the ambitious Government.  This Budget 
<br/>will make the rich richer and poor poorer.  This Budget is uninteresting and lacking in many ways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all those said, I do not support the 2023-2024 Budget tabled before 
<br/></span><span>Parliament but wish the Coalition Government a very best on implementing their Budget for the so-
<br/>called benefit of the Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, fellow Fijians and concerned taxpayers; good evening and </span><span>bula vinaka.  </span><span>I stand before 
<br/>you as the final speaker for tonight for this Budget debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  today  we  are  here  to  discuss  the  recently  released  Budget,  a  financial 
<br/></span><span>blueprint that is meant to reflect our collective aspirations, our shared commitment to progress and 
<br/></span><span>in many ways, our covenant with the future of Fiji.  But it  is with deep concern, that I voice my 
<br/>objections to this Budget which falls dramatically short of our taxpayers’ expectations and needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  people  who  are  watching  this  debate  today,  I  want  to  state  with 
<br/>complete conviction that this is the worst self-destructing Budget in the history of Budgets, just like 
<br/>the FBC logo.

<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Very interesting line, honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  this  morning,  our  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition  said  that  the  Government  is  spending  money  like  drunkards  in  the  nightclub.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, instead of keeping metal detectors in front, we should keep breathalysers to check if 
<br/>none of our honourable Members are drunk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must look back into our history books.  From this retrospection, we can 
<br/>clearly see that we have in front of us the largest Budget with the largest deficit in the history of 
<br/>Budgets  of  Fiji  during  the  non-COVID-19  period.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  congratulate  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance.  He has made history for preparing the worst Budget ever.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  do  not  know  what  chopper-nomics  he  used  to  write  this  Budget,  I  guess  that  is  what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happened when you only have theoretical knowledge and no practical experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hold on, I am coming to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  our  previous  Parliament  needed  more  time  to  prepare  his  Budget,  I  want  to  take  a 
<br/>moment to remember the sons of the </span><span>Girmityas</span><span>, who actually fought for our nation.  These are strong 
<br/>leaders, like Jai Ram Reddy, S.M. Koya and A.D. Patel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the citizens and the taxpayers who are watching right now, they want the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contact numbers of all those Ministers sitting on the other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- But that is not available to the citizens,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The previous 
<br/></span><span>FijiFirst Government, each and every Minister gave their number to everyone.  They are scared of 
<br/></span><span>the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have received complaints from students and youth that even the Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister of Finance is not even picking or replying to the calls of young students.  
<br/>Is this why we have elected this Government?  They will know, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prime  Minister  should  learn  from  the  example  set  by  the  former  Prime 
<br/>Minister and the former RFMF Commander, Mr. Voreqe Bainimarama.  The former Prime Minister 
<br/></span><span>had a clear vision for a free Fiji, without discriminating anyone, from equal citizenry to fair taxation 
<br/></span><span>policy for everyone, especially those who extracted and made millions from our natural resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> These Cabinet Ministers have not even read the Constitution.  I am shocked to see that the 
<br/>honourable Minister who is responsible for the security of the nation is quiet.  There is an increase in 
<br/>criminal activity, but he is quiet.  People are suffering, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There are tax cuts for the 
<br/>rich but more burden for the poor.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1169 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  previous  Parliament  session,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance 
<br/>made disparaging comments about being a law student for too long.  As an academic and professor, 
<br/>such a personal attack displays the profound lack of understanding and maturity towards the issues 
<br/>faced by our young population, and that shows the maturity of this Cabinet as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  politicians  like  the  honourable  Member  should  never  hold  positions  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>power in this esteemed Parliament.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us face it.  The truth is, the honourable Prime Minister is afraid of FijiFirst because he, 
<br/>being  the  Chair  of  the  Constitutional  Offices  Commission  (COC),  has  failed  to  appoint  any 
<br/>commissioners to the Electoral Commission to confirm the replacement of our seats.  This raises the 
<br/>question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why is the honourable Prime Minister afraid?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say to the honourable Prime Minister, “</span><span>Kua ni rere, kua ni rere.</span><span>
<br/>This FijiFirst government is your friend as well.  You need to work with us, but why are you not 
<br/>giving us our seats?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  look  at  this  Budget,  we  see  the  biggest  betrayal  by  this 
<br/>Government.  VAT increase - the substantial hike in VAT will cause the cost of essential goods and 
<br/>services to increase.  The impact of this decision will be felt far and wide - from the bustling markets 
<br/>of Suva to the quite fishing villages along the cost of Cakaudrove. The burden of this increase will 
<br/>weigh heavily on the people of Fiji, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not forget the burden that this new VAT hike places on our vibrant 
<br/>community of SMEs, the backbone of our Fijian economy.  These enterprises, already contending 
<br/>with the challenging market conditions, will now face the massive task of managing higher  
<br/>operational costs, while trying to keep their prices competitive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  corporate  tax  has  also  increased  by  5  percent,  together  with  the  VAT 
<br/>increase of 6 percent. This is a total of 11 percent increase.  That means on average, the value of 
<br/>goods and services will increase by a warping $10 for every $100 spent.  Now, the big question here, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the income tax, where do you think the inflation will go?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, it will trickle down to the consumer, that means they will pay even more. This kind of 
<br/></span><span>small-minded vision is what we expect from the Budget.  Some Members have already talked about 
<br/>lamb chops, so let us not talk about lamb chops.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Public Works Department (PWD), some citizens have called PWD or 
<br/>renamed it as Potholes Works Department. They have been given $5 million, to do what? The same 
<br/>job as FRA?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Budget  has  demonstrated  a  complete  disregard  of  the  needs  and 
<br/></span><span>aspirations of our young people. There is a shocking absence of youth policies and initiatives.  The 
<br/></span><span>allocation for the first home buyers’ initiative has been reduced, despite the fact that it has positively 
<br/>impacted the lives of many young individuals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the beginning of their term we can only see these honourable Ministers jetting off to 
<br/>overseas countries, wasting taxpayers’ funds on six months of holiday, while the people of Fiji suffer.  
<br/>What have they come up with?  This 15 percent VAT, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister is already jetting off to some countries, I guess. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  this  Government  has  been  cheating  the  people  of  Fiji  from  the  beginning  and  lying  to  our 
<br/>hardworking youth and taxpayers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they said they are repaying the debt, but that is not true. Again, they have 
<br/>lied to the people of Fiji. This Budget is a refinancing Budget, which means not paying debt.  Another 
<br/>lie, and this is the biggest lie of all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I cannot see honourable Gavoka here because he is the main person who should be listening 
<br/>to  this.    Before  the  Election,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  SODELPA  Members  and  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister also went on </span><span>TikTok</span><span> doing this.  He said that they will remove the TELS debt. They went 
<br/>and begged students for their votes and the students gave them their vote. Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>without consulting the students, the same Government changes their condition from one form of debt 
<br/>to another form of debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  When  they  said  “free  education”,  they  should  have  delivered  on  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>promise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also astonishing to note that the Government did not bother to read the 
<br/>Constitution before bringing a motion to Parliament which had to be corrected by honourable Koya.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is clear that many of these Members of Parliament, particularly the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and Minister for Justice and maybe some other Ministers, like the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Multi-Ethnic Affairs have no understanding of this Constitution. If I ask them, what is Chapter 8 Part 
<br/>A of the Constitution, he will not be able to answer. So, let me answer, Chapter 8 – Accountability; 
<br/>Part A – Code of Conduct.  You should be learning that. This book is not a joke.  Because of this 
<br/>Constitution, all the Ministers, even the honourable Prime Minister who is sitting there, would not 
<br/>be breaching Sections of the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the previous Budget Response in July 2020, the honourable Minister of Finance called on 
<br/>the FijiFirst government to reduce the size of Cabinet size to decrease borrowing.  However, in a 
<br/>glaring display of hypocrisy, honourable Rabuka’s Government now boasts the largest Cabinet in the 
<br/>history of Fiji with 19 Ministers and 10 Assistant Ministers.  Congratulation again, you have made 
<br/></span><span>history.  </span><span>Khali baat iske,</span><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, empty words.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in February, the media reported that the honourable Minister of Finance had 
<br/>discovered instances of wastages and financial negligence within the Government.  Yet, he turns a 
<br/>blind  eye  and  allocates  millions  of  dollars  for  wasteful  events,  even  including  a  questionable 
<br/>allocation of $200,000 to some organisation named Global Girmit Institute - an organisation where 
<br/>the honourable Minister’s wife is a trustee and this is on public record.  Why I am bringing this here 
<br/>is because   that is taxpayers’ money and he should be answerable to the taxpayers. These actions 
<br/>expose the lack of transparency and accountability within this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  it  is  concerning  that  the  same  individual  associated  with  the  Global  Girmit 
<br/>Institute, one of those individuals, is also allegedly heading Pacific Polytech, which is receiving a 
<br/>grant  of  $1  million.  Why  is  this  institution  favoured  over  our  Government-owned  Fiji  National 
<br/>University  (FNU),  or  local  universities,  like  University  of  Fiji.    The  honourable  Minister  and  his 
<br/>Party, Mr. Speaker, Sir, must be investigated for potential conflict of interest.  Something is fishy 
<br/>and the taxpayers deserve to know these answers.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1171 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji are not only on life support but this Government itself is 
<br/>on  life  support,  desperately  trying  to  save  their  failing  marriage.    Their  claim  that  this  Budget 
<br/>addresses the challenges we face are empty and misleading.  I do not know why the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister appointed honourable Professor Prasad as the Minister of Finance, there are other capable 
<br/>Ministers in Cabinet, so he should reshuffle his Cabinet Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  something  has  also  been  brought  to  my  attention  that  Fiji  Water,  that 
<br/>recently  received  a  tax  exemption,  their  lawyers  are  Munro  Leys.    Apparently,  one  of  the  senior 
<br/>lawyers at Munro Leys, Mr. Richard Naidu, is also the Chairman of the Fiscal Review Committee 
<br/>appointed by the honourable Minister of Finance, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  You can connect the dots and it 
<br/>all connects to itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, in the beginning of this year, the honourable Prime Minister visited Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water Head Office in the USA. Why tax the poor and not the rich, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say this, it is not just about numbers, figures or percentage, it is about our people.  It is about 
<br/>the people who have voted you to this Chamber.  It is about the people who have put you here.  It is 
<br/>about the people who gave us the mandate under this Constitution to fulfil their wishes, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the Government to revisit this path and make decisions that truly serve all Fijians. The 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance can cry all about the past.  In fact, he should read the comments on 
<br/>social media - just get on with it and stop wasting time.  I do not think his echo chamber told him all 
<br/>these, it might have hurt his ego, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, have you seen the condition of our roads?  Everywhere, there are potholes. 
<br/>They do not care because they are riding in their black cars and redlights.  They are not driving those 
<br/>vehicles, it is driven by their drivers. They are saving all the potholes, but what about the common 
<br/>Fijians, what about the common people? She is laughing, she does not care about people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What about the people, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have failed to provide effective leadership, prioritise the needs of the youth and address 
<br/></span><span>the concerns of the working class, and display transparency and accountability.  Their false promises 
<br/></span><span>and lies have deeply disappointed the people of Fiji. And I feel sorry for those who have voted for 
<br/>them and who will now suffer, I really do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it is time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we should </span><span>tuba </span><span>this Government.  It is time for change 
<br/>and we need true leaders, like FijiFirst, to step forward and restore faith in the governance of the

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Member, for your lively contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, whilst still on that, I thank you for your participation today, bearing 
<br/>with the long sitting, but at the same time, I just want to simply ask if some level of respect could 
<br/>also be shown here.  We may go out of our way in trying to say what we want to say, but at the same 
<br/>time, we still need to ensure the decorum of Parliament is kept and maintained.

<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister has been labelled. Honourable Members, he has served his 
<br/>time as a Prime Minister, he has done great things, just like the previous Prime Minister.  So, our 
<br/>duty is to ensure that we have that respect all the time.  That is all I want to ask you to observe, come 
<br/>tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will now adjourn Parliament until tomorrow.
