<h3>INTERPRETATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>INTERPRETATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 18/2023) be debated, voted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upon and be passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Before I complete that process, I just want to break the ice here.  This is 
<br/>politics.   Sometimes you need to derail the train of thought a lot by coming up with issues that prompt 
<br/>you to reply and then you forget where you are. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Electoral  (Registration of Voters) Act, 2020 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provides </span><span>inter alia</span><span> for the registration of voters for the General Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We are looking at the Interpretation or Electoral? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>1576 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Sorry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- They are linked.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Interpretation Act of 1967 sets out the principles and rules for the interpretation of written 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>laws and public documents in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I proceed, may I just thank the women who are sitting in the gallery; 
<br/>strong  minded  women  who  fought  for  their  right.  Whilst  they  were  waiting  for  a  decision,  this 
<br/>Government found the courage to change this law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Interpretation (Amendment) Act 2021 otherwise known Act No. 42 of 2021 amended the 
<br/>Act to create a rule to provide where any written law authorises or requires a person to provide his 
<br/>or her name, the person  must provide his  or her name as specified on his  or her birth certificate.  
<br/>Where any written law authorises or requires a person to provide any form of identification of himself 
<br/>or herself, the person must provide such form of identification which accurately reflect his or her 
<br/>name as specified on his or her birth certificate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Act  of  2021  was  seen  to  disadvantage  people  namely  women  who  chose  to  use  their 
<br/>spouse’s surname when providing their name under any written law. For example, a woman using 
<br/>her spouse’s surname on her identity documents such as passport, voters card, driver’s license, FNPF 
<br/>or FRCS joint card, certificate of naturalisation, practicing certificate for lawyers, accountants and 
<br/>doctors.  The rule created by the Interpretation Act of 2021 which was enacted by FijiFirst Party also 
<br/>cost $5 million to the Ministry of Justice in the Births, Deaths and Marriages Office which catered 
<br/>for the free service provided for the application of the name change for birth certificates and death 
<br/>certificates.    As  we  have  said  throughout  this  week,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  could  have  been 
<br/>Government revenue and used efficiently elsewhere such as upgrading of roads and our water system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rule created by the 2021 law was seen to be a voter suppression.  It was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reported by the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> May, 2023 and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Fiji  Women’s  Crisis  Centre  have  evidence  that  women  were  beaten  up 
<br/>because they decided to change their names on their identify documents and let go of their 
<br/>spouse’s surname in order to retain their married name as per Birth Certificate.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is ridiculous for women to take their spouse’s name and inserts them in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their birth certificate which takes away their family’s maiden name.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 seeks to amend the Act to remove 
<br/>the rule which was created by Act 42 of 2021 and allow a person to use his or her spouse’s surname 
<br/>when  providing  their  name  under  any  written  law.  The  Bill  must  be  considered  by  Parliament 
<br/>urgently as amendments by the Interpretation Act 2021 set out the rules that a person must use his or 
<br/>her name as specified on the birth certificate when providing his or her name under any written law. 
<br/></span><span>Given that we are now removing the rule from the Interpretation Act 1967, we have also tabled a Bill 
<br/></span><span>that will amend the Electoral (Registration Voters) Act 2012 to remove the  requirement that a person 
<br/>can only vote with the names specified on his or her birth certificate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again on consultation, it had extensive, it was held at the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister, Ministry of Finance and the Office of the Solicitor-General. The stakeholders that were 
<br/>consulted were:

<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1577 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre (some of the members are sitting in the gallery); 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Women’s Rights Movement; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Council of Churches; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>iTaukei Land Trust Board;

<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  were  also  public  consultations  in  Suva,  Labasa,  Lautoka,  Nadi  and  outer  islands 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including Lomaiviti – Gau, Nairai and Batiki.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament 
<br/>there amending legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister by Notice in the 
<br/>Gazette.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Act to allow a married person to use her spouse’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>surname under any written law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we promised the people of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are going to go away with the wrong 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>law, bad law. Accordingly, I commend this Bill to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor, I would like to inform you, honourable Members 
<br/>that I have list here and there are only two speakers who have been identified – honourable Alitia 
<br/>Bainivalu and on the Opposition will be honourable Usamate.  So we will continue and now I offer 
<br/>the floor to the honourable Usamate to begin the batting and he will be speaking for five minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  on  the 
<br/>Interpretation Bill.  It has been quite amusing sitting here listening to some of the comments, maybe 
<br/>if I have time, I will got back to it.  Let us be clear what was the purpose of this Bill all along. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Let us be clear what the purpose was.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in one of the previous Elections that we had in Fiji, 
<br/>one of our honourable Members of Parliament on this side was one of the people that was at that 
<br/>election. It was held in Silana in Dawasamu. There was a complaint that was registered to one of our 
<br/>MPs and the complaint was this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That  married women were having difficulties opening bank accounts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because the name on their Voter IDs was different from the one on their birth certificate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- How many women? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Because of this, they couldn’t open bank accounts. The problem was 
<br/>people having different names on different identity documents.  So when you have different names 
<br/>on different identity documents, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, it creates problems for those 
<br/>two different sets of documents when they go to places.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It makes it easier for people to misrepresent themselves as someone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>else. I realised that all kinds of difficulties can arise as a result of this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There was also a lady that was in Fiji, her name was Premila Kumar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When she got her passport... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This is a different Premila Kumar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It was issued under her married name which was Premila Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Jone and Premila.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, Jone and Premila, we are both on this side.  Don’t worry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She went  to  the United  States of America, she came back using her married name on the 
<br/>passport, when she had to go back to the United States of America, she had to get vaccinated.  But in 
<br/>Fiji, you will need to use your birth certificate when you are to get vaccination.  The names were 
<br/>different. So, you see this is what happens when you have different sets of identification systems.  
<br/>When you have different sets of identification systems those are problems that arise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While here this morning, I looked at the requirements in Australia for you to get a passport, 
<br/></span><span>it requires you to have your name on your birth certificate. My wife calls herself Cagi Usamate but 
<br/></span><span>her birth certificate’s name is Vakacagicagi Veikaukila (a very Lauan name and a name I am very 
<br/>proud of) but people call her different names, sometimes because you have these two different sets 
<br/>of identity documents it creates problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I understand that a lot of women have had this problem, I heard them 
<br/>complaining to me but at the end of day you have to weigh the balance between the difficulties that 
<br/></span><span>some face and the need to be able to maintain the integrity of your identification systems.  That was 
<br/></span><span>the purpose of this.  You create all these kind of hogwash statements about .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Stop washing the hog.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you are going to change 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this, be prepared for the kind of problems that will follow.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1579 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.  USAMATE.-  You will solve one problem and create other problems.   There  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>always unintended consequences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since my time is coming up, I just wanted to mention are few things. The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Attorney-General likes to say this thing flew in so it is a fly out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Do you know where it flew into?  It flew into Parliament. When you 
<br/>denigrate that, you are denigrating Parliament and the seat of the Speaker of Parliament. When you 
<br/>say fly in, fly out, you are denigrating Parliament.  You are a Member of Parliament, pay your respect 
<br/>to  Parliament,  pay  your  respect  to  the  Leader  of  Parliament,  to  the  Speaker.    Honourable  Pio 
<br/>Tikoduadua said the Australians and New Zealanders are not our </span><span>vuvale</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, I did not say that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, you did.  You did some inference.  You said why are you treating 
<br/>them like this, when you treat everyone else like this.  Do you know that in the Pacific we are all 
<br/>related.  If you say </span><span>dua, rua, tolu, va, lima</span><span>, you go to Tonga, Samoa and everywhere it is almost the 
<br/>same.  At the end of the day, we are all </span><span>vuvale.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing I would like to say, this week we have heard the learned honourable Attorney-
<br/>General liking to quote this verse in the </span><span>Bible</span><span>, Matthew 5:7.  That is a Bible verse you never quote, 
<br/>because every time you quote it, you indict yourself.  When you quoted that verse, I said, “do not use 
<br/>it as a spear, use it as a mirror.”  I do not support this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  before I make my brief contribution, may 
<br/>I  please  highlight  that  this  Bill  and  the  Electoral  (Registration  of  Voters)  Bill  have  undergone 
<br/>extensive public consultation and there is no need for it to be referred to the Standing Committee, as 
<br/>it meets the criteria to be fast tracked through Standing Order 51.  The Standing Committees as it is 
<br/>already have a huge backlog of work of annual reports to review so this process is democratic because 
<br/>the views of the people have already been heard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very good afternoon to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Interpretation Act of 1967 sets out the 
<br/></span><span>principles  and  rules  for  the  interpretation  of  written  laws  and  public  documents  in  Fiji.    The 
<br/></span><span>amendment made in 2021 requires a person to provide his or her name as specified in his or her birth 
<br/>certificate as a form of identification.  This change has disadvantaged a lot of people, especially the 
<br/>women who choose to their use their spouse’s surname, but were required to add a name in their birth 
<br/>certificate in order to be registered using their spouse’s surname.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  women  residing  in  rural  areas  were  most  affected  as  a  result  of  this 
<br/>draconian law.  Those who had registered under their married name in the electoral roll were required 
<br/>to  change  their  names  to  be  consistent  with  their  birth  certificate,  otherwise  they  would  need  to 
<br/></span><span>include their married name in their birth certificate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  why  change  something  that  is  not  broken?    Women  in  rural  areas  and 
<br/>communities have to take time away from their families to travel to town centres if they can afford 
<br/>to have the necessary changes rectified.  Those who were not able to do this because of geographical 
<br/>location, financially deprived and have their little ones to attend to, were unfortunate in the process.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most women lost the right to vote because of this ridiculous process.  I know 
<br/>this because I lost some votes during the general elections from my relatives residing in the interior 
<br/>villages of Ra.  I know now that we are going to amend this Bill, they have assured me that I have 
<br/>their  votes  come  2026  General  Elections.    I  think  this  has  also  contributed  to  the  lower  voter 
<br/>participation rate of 68.3 percent in the 2022 General Elections compared to the 72 percent voter 
<br/>participation rate in the 2018 General Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Tuisawau alluded to earlier this week, this Bill was brought because of the 
<br/>case of Mr. Niko Nawaikula, having a different name on his birth certificate and a different one on 
<br/>his National Register of Voters.  As the former Chief Justice ruled, he was not legally required to 
<br/>provide his name on his birth certificate in order to be registered as a voter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, women residing out of Fiji also have to go through the inconvenience of 
<br/>changing their names on their passports, property titles, driver’s licence et cetera because it became 
<br/>a mandatory requirement.  Again, why change something that is not broken?  What happened to the 
<br/>old convenient and practical ways of having to change names through the use of marriage certificate 
<br/>documents,  where  one  can  proudly  use  their  married  name  on  any  form  of  identification  if  they 
<br/>choose to?  Why does names on forms of identification only have to be reflective of the names on 
<br/>your birth certificate?  I say this because I was one of those who had to make this change to be eligible 
<br/>to vote in the last General Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, I wholeheartedly support the Bill before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the legacy of the FijiFirst Government that over 
<br/>the last 16 years, they made laws based on one or two incidents to solve problems by law, instead of 
<br/>addressing the administrative issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- We all know that the law that we are amending arose from one single 
<br/>incident, because they cannot allow for one moment especially my predecessor for Niko Nawaikula, 
<br/>the champion from Buca to win.  That is the essence!  Nothing more nothing less!  That is the gist.  
<br/>We  are  committed  to  right  the  wrongs.  We  listen  and  consult.    Look  at  the  gallery,  it  is  full  of 
<br/>members of the public.  Why?  Ask yourself, why?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Today  in  my  maiden  speech  I  said  this,  we  are  going  to  bring 
<br/>restoration, we will create freedom and that is exactly what we are doing today.  I stand proud because 
<br/>in  my  trips  overseas,  this  is  what  was  expressed  to  me  by  the  women,  “We  will  not  change  our 
<br/>passports until Mr. AG you change that law.”   For these women, if they comply with all of these, 
<br/>they will be forced to change their identity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ke ra dau vosa na vatu, era vosa e daidai.  Sa rauta mada </span><span>FijiFirst, </span><span>sa rauta</span><span>.  Let us move 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  Let us try and complete this.
