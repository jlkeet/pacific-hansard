<h3>ELECTORAL (REGISTRATION OF VOTERS) (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>ELECTORAL (REGISTRATION OF VOTERS) (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday 
<br/>11th July, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Electoral (Registration of Voters) (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 19/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be debated, voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Electoral  (Registration  of  Voters)  Act  2012 
<br/>provides </span><span>inter alia</span><span> for the registration of voters for General Elections. By way of background, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in 2021 the case of the Supervisor of Elections and Niko Nawaikula, HBM 58/2021, 
<br/>the Court of Disputed Returns held that, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Based on the current law, Niko Nawaikula was not legally required to provide 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his name on his birth certificate to be registered as a voter.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Court also held and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It is the duty of the Supervisor of Elections to implement the law, not to enact it.  
<br/>The law does not require the use of birth certificates name and allow use of names other 
<br/>than the birth certificate names.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The court further held that the Supervisor of Elections’ actions in removing Niko Nawaikula’s 
<br/>name from the register of voters was unlawful and wrongful.  Following the results of the case in 
<br/>September  2021,  the  Parliament  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  enacted  the  Electoral  (Registration  of 
<br/>Voters)_(Amendment) (No. 2) of 2021 to provide amongst other things that a person must use his 
<br/></span><span>birth certificate name for the purpose of voter registration.  That commenced on 6th October, 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Electoral (Registration of Voters) (Amendment) (No. 2) of 2021 provided that a person’s 
<br/>application for registration as a voter must state his or her full name as specified on his or her birth 
<br/>certificate and the application must also be accompanied by the person’s birth certificate.  The Act 
<br/>was seen to disadvantage people especially women who chose to use their spouse’s surname when 
<br/>registering to be a voter.  In a nutshell, the Act of 2021 takes away the right of women to choose or 
<br/>infringe on their freedom of choice which name they wish to register for the purpose of voting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  women  changed  their  birth  certificates  to  reflect  their  spouse’s 
<br/></span><span>surname  on  the  birth  certificate  in  order  for  their  identity  documents  to  remain  valid.    This  is 
<br/>unacceptable. A person had to change their name which was given at birth in order to continue using 
<br/>the spouse’s name on identity documents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Names have meanings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is an identity that is given to a person at birth.  The 
<br/>name change policy discriminated women and violated the women’s constitutional right to vote. This  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>1582 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Registration of Voters)(Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>came as an obstacle to the people especially married women as they were required to amend their 
<br/>birth certificate name to their married name for voting and identification purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the name change policy was also seen as an insult to the names given at 
<br/>birth and defeated the whole point and purpose of having a birth certificate. The purpose of a birth 
<br/>certificate is that the certificate contains details pertaining to person’s birth.  You are not born with 
<br/>your husband’s name, FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is why we have a marriage certificate by virtue of which a married woman can use her 
<br/>spouse’s  surname  when  registering  to  be  a  voter.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2021  laws  breached  the 
<br/>Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)  and human 
<br/>rights instruments norms.  Fiji is a party to the Convention on all the Elimination of all Forms of 
<br/>Discrimination against Women which was ratified in 1995.  This means that the Fiji Government 
<br/>recognises  that  women  have  been  historically  and  systematically  disadvantaged  in  all  spheres 
<br/>compared to men including legal rights and political life.  It imposes obligations on State to take 
<br/>measures to eradicate that historical inequality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2021 law breaches the right to privacy for married women by mandating them to choose 
<br/>one name and go through the burdensome administrative and costly process to record their choice of 
<br/>name.  The State has the duty to promote women’s participation in elections and enjoying of rights, 
<br/>however, Act 40 of 2021 does the opposite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, therefore the Electoral (Registration of Voters) (Amendment) Bill 2023 or 
<br/>this  Bill  seeks  to  amend  the  Act  to  remove  the  amendment  made  to  Section  4  of  the  Electoral 
<br/>(Registration of Voters) 2012 by Act 40 of 2021 to allow a person to use their spouse’s surname 
<br/>when registering to be a voter.  A person who wants to use his or spouse’s surname when registering 
<br/>as a voter would need to provide his or her marriage certificate as part of his or her application for 
<br/>registration as a voter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill must be considered urgently to address the concerns raised by women who want their 
<br/>birth certificates to be changed to reflect their maiden names as they had previously changed their 
<br/>birth certificates to reflect their spouse’s surname for election purposes only.  The longer we delay 
<br/>the Bill, the longer individuals are being denied their right to vote as women who wish to vote under 
<br/>the married and other official documents such as passport, driving license, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Justice  will  be  making  an  announcement  in  the 
<br/></span><span>coming days which will provide guidelines to cater for these people who are affected by the name 
<br/></span><span>change policy and amend their birth certificate.  Consultations were held with the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister, the Ministry of Finance and the Office of the Solicitor-General.  Consultations were also 
<br/>held  with  the  same  stakeholders  as  far  as  the  amendment  of  the  Interpretation  Act.    Public 
<br/>consultation were also extensively carried out.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, during consultations, the Office of 
<br/>the Attorney-General received a lot of submissions from people who strongly opposed the 2021 laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament, 
<br/>the amending legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister by notice in the 
<br/></span><span>gazette.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends Section 4(2) of the Act to allow a person to use their spouse’s 
<br/>surname  when  registering  to  be  a  voter.    The  application  for  registration  as  a  voter  must  be 
<br/>accompanied by a marriage certificate and other particulars as may be approved and published by 
<br/>the Supervisor of Elections.  Accordingly, I commend this Bill to Parliament.

<div><span>Electoral (Registration of Voters)(Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1583 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  for  this  particular  Bill,  I  have  received  the  list 
<br/>showing the speakers that have identified themselves and confirmed by the two honourable Whips. 
<br/>For  the  Government  speakers,  it  will  be  Honourable  Prime  Minister  followed  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Women and then for the Opposition it will be honourable Bulitavu and each will speak 
<br/>for five minutes. As such I am now offering the floor to honourable Bulitavu to lead the batting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this side of the House, this particular 
<br/>amendment  on  the  Electoral  law  is  a  consequence  of  the  Interpretation  Act  so  we  do  not  have 
<br/>anything on that given that it will be amended anyway as a consequence of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- So just support it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  The  only  thing  is,  I  urge  the  honourable  Attorney-General  as  
<br/>Minister responsible for Elections is the guideline by the Supervisor of Elections that will be issued 
<br/>by  the  Fijian  Elections  Office  that  should  somehow  prevent  those  cases  where  people  can  be 
<br/>registered twice as a vote. Those are things that probably will come in the guideline that we look 
<br/>forward that we should not have those cases where people are registered wise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that the  various identities that people can use to  register  as  a voter, those 
<br/>official documents can be used to register as a voter.  We also urge people whether it is in this case 
<br/>or another case, our job as legislature is to drive voter registration so people can come to vote where 
<br/>we have  a credible elections and urging more people to vote and that is voter turnout and whatever 
<br/>the issues that come in that will affect many people who are confused about what we are talking 
<br/>about here is just to urge many of our people to register as voters so that they can cast the valid vote. 
<br/>Those are our take from this side of the House.  As I have said earlier, it is just a consequence from 
<br/>the previous Bill that was passed, that is, the Interpretation Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.-  I thank the honourable  and learned Attorney-General  for bringing 
<br/>this Bill forward.  Mr Speaker, Sir, in response to what our supporters had asked us to do when we 
<br/>came to the House. I am sure the honourable Bulitavu would agree because a few years ago while 
<br/>we were having our internal struggles within SODELPA, his middle name came up under a lot of 
<br/>scrutiny and I am sure he would not want to have his middle name used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  my  great  grandfather  was  one  of  the  first  Christians  in  our  tribe.  He  was  baptised  or 
<br/>christened on 25</span><span>th</span><span> November, 1860.  His tribal name was Vakadranu. He was given a Christian name, 
<br/>Aisea,  they all had to take on Christian names. When their son was born, he was given another name 
<br/></span><span>to reflect on the exploits of one in the line who had participated in the </span><span>i valu mai Kaba</span><span>.  So, he was 
<br/></span><span>called  Rabuka  and  that  name  was  given  to  my  grandfather.    So,  as  the  honourable  and  learned 
<br/>Attorney-General had alluded to, our names mean something.  Sometimes we live to the character of 
<br/>the name and sometime we have the opportunity to change. This Bill is a very useful one and I am 
<br/>glad the honourable and the loyal Opposition is not really going to oppose this because it shows that 
<br/>we are moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When my grandfather died in November of 1921, a youngest son was born in February the 
<br/>following year but he took on the name of his late father or my grandfather and the Rabuka name had 
<br/></span><span>by the time been used as our surname according to English</span><span> </span><span>laws.  I am proud to be using that name. 
<br/></span><span>I know that there are Vakadranu’s all over Fiji. I know honourable Naivalurua has a close relatives 
<br/>also named Vakadranu and in other tribes the name Vakadranu was used to signify a kill in the  first 
<br/>battle. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill and commend it, not only to the House but to the 
<br/>people of Fiji.

<div><span>Electoral (Registration of Voters)(Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, we have heard from the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>the reason behind bringing this law and it was a law that disrespected the decision of a High Court 
<br/>and affected Mr. Niko Nawaikula to the point where he was out of Parliament for some time. But, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, I want to speak with another angle about this law and what it was designed for. I do not 
<br/>think  the  Members  on  the  other  side  quite  realise  this  but  this  is  the  shrewdness  of  the  former 
<br/>lawmaker and I will tell you why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This law, Mr. Speaker, was designed to disenfranchise women voters and I will tell the reason 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>why and the statistics will not lie and I will outline that for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT  MEMBER.- Tell them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  So,  why  would  he  bring  this  law,  Mr.  Speaker?  What  was  the 
<br/>purpose? Quite apart from honourable Niko Nawaikula’s case, let me shed some light on the statistics 
<br/>of our elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2018 there were a total of 637,500 registered voters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 49.6 percent were 
<br/>women, 50.4 percent were men but the actual voter turnout by gender, the total number of females 
<br/>223,439 and total number of males 220,016. So, more women voted than men by a total of 3,423 
<br/>votes. What was the effect of that? Does everyone remember the numbers difference  between the 
<br/>FijiFirst votes and the rest of the parties in 2018? Anyone remember that? Sir, 147 votes between 
<br/>FijiFirst and all the other parties that did not vote for FijiFirst; only 147 votes. The overall result of 
<br/>those elections, FijiFirst lost six seats to the Opposition at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, from these statistics we can already deduce that more women voted in 2018 and 
<br/>more seats were lost from FijiFirst. Therefore, is it quite possible that more women voted for the 
<br/>Opposition  and  the  mere  difference  that  reflected  was  only  147.  So,  what  does  that  previous 
<br/>lawmaker do? Quite apart from disrespecting the decision of the Court, he sees another opportunity. 
<br/>He writes a law to require all married women, and these were hundreds of thousand married women, 
<br/>registered at that time who were  carrying their married name to have to choose either or, their married 
<br/>name or their maiden name as we have heard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Bulitavu mentions about  fraud, yes, it is always a concern. I remembered 
<br/>when we were debating that year in 2021 and we were asking why is this law and how is it justified. 
<br/>I  remember  that  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  went  in  the  media  and  said,  “because  fraud  is 
<br/>committed”.  We asked how many people committed fraud in the previous elections to justify this 
<br/></span><span>law. Sir, 76 versus the 100,000 married women who would be affected by this.  Were they thinking 
<br/></span><span>about that?  Did they consult to find this out?  No.  , they were so hell-bent on disrespecting a Court 
<br/>decision and of course this was also an opportunity to disenfranchise the married women.  So this 
<br/>law to require that all those who use the name other than what is on their birth certificate was designed 
<br/>to falls close to  a 100,000 of those women to choose between their names.  I mean what kind of 
<br/>arrogance, what kind of stupidity, what kind of disrespect does a person have?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this blue book that they flaunt all the time, they flaunt this, the Constitution 
<br/>you got to respect it. This is the same one they flaunt, Section 26(3)(a), you do not discriminate based 
<br/></span><span>on gender or marital status; read it again Members.  Given that in 2018 the difference between men 
<br/></span><span>and women voters was a whopping 3,000 plus votes and the difference between FijiFirst and the 
<br/>Opposition  parties was only  147 votes. They know they were on a trajectory to  lose. The former 
<br/>lawmaker knew that they were on a trajectory to lose, so this would be a way to cull or discourage 
<br/>women voters. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1585 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, guess what!  Despite them trying to do that, they are still sitting on 
<br/>that side.  What does that say? They lost the elections.  I have requested the voter list analysis for this 
<br/>past Elections 2022 and the Fijian Elections Office are working on it and the results will be out by 
<br/>the end of this month.  But I can bet every dollar, it would reveal as to how the women voted, that 
<br/>they do not even realise this, that their own women voters voted against them.  That is why they lost 
<br/>because it was already a trajectory based on 2018, they lost.  You know what, thank goodness that 
<br/>lawmaker is gone.  Just like honourable Lal’s word that he used </span><span>tuba, </span><span>that lawmaker is gone </span><span>tuba.  
<br/></span><span>This law has to go </span><span>tuba.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I just read two of the comments from women.  
<br/>“You are killing it today </span><span>turaga </span><span>AG. </span><span>Vakadua - </span><span>thank you.”  What about this one, “Parliament is 
<br/>cracking today, Opposition is cracking today.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Opposition  for  supporting  the  change  in  this  law,  give  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>freedom to the women, they readily deserve it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I am a bit emotional today because of the experience 
<br/>we went through.  Here, some of us, like you honourable Members want to serve, yet some suffer 
<br/>under the consequences of different interpretations and different applications of rules of law that they 
<br/>brought in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The mention of honourable Nawaikula really affects me and I must apologise.  I have another 
<br/>few colleagues who are still going through this process.  Some of them are sitting in the gallery, but 
<br/>again, we just have to take on the challenge and offer the challenge as well.  I thank you for listening 
<br/>and sitting during the debate that has been going on.  I just want to share this view of mine for it 
<br/>really badly affects me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[A Bill  for an Act  to amend the Electoral  (Registration of Voters) Act  2012 (Bill  No. 19/ 
<br/>2023) moved under Standing Order 51 passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic 
<br/>of Fiji. (Act No. …..2023)]  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I hope you will bear with us just for a few more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>minutes to ensure that we fully cover what we have in the Order for today’s sitting.
