<div><span>Honourable Virendra Lal subscribed to the Administration of Oath/Affirmation of Allegiance  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and took his seat in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Congratulations, honourable Member.  Welcome once more to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I wish you well in this term of Parliament as well, honourable Sachida Nand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I will now invite the honourable Sachida Nand to deliver his Maiden 
<br/>Speech and I remind honourable Members about the established protocols for maiden speeches and 
<br/>to show courtesy this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maiden Speech – Hon. Sachida Nand 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and the people of Fiji.  A very good morning to you 
<br/>all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I would like to thank the almighty Perumal</span><span> </span><span>for giving me a second opportunity to be 
<br/>part of this team. May His divine grace and blessings be on the proceedings on this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, I would like to thank my family for their continued support in my endeavours, my 
<br/>wife Sunita who is sitting in the gallery, son – Anirudh and daughter – Shaista have been my three 
<br/>main pillars on which my professional, personal and political aspirations have been based upon.  They 
<br/>have always actively supported me and continue to support me through my ups and downs.  I am 
<br/></span><span>very grateful for their support because without them, I would not have been where I am today.  Thank 
<br/></span><span>you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, I would like to sincerely acknowledge and appreciate the support of my friends, well-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wishers and my voters.  They continue to believe in me, and their support never dwindled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all those who supported and voted for FijiFirst.  There 
<br/>were some who got swayed by the $5 per hour minimum wage and $100 per tonne of cane.  They 
<br/>are now realising that it was nothing but hot air.  My sympathy to them, but do not worry, your time 
<br/></span><span>will come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  congratulate  my  two  friends,  honourable  Rayalu  and  honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau, on their ministerial appointments.  These two are the glimmer of hope I see on the other 
<br/>side.  I would also like to thank the Electoral Commission for their nomination and accepting their 
<br/>nomination.  I think he was sworn in as a Member of Parliament.

<div><span>Administration of Oath-Affirmation of Allegiance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1535 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is an honour and a privilege to be given an opportunity to be in Parliament again.  This will 
<br/>no doubt, give me an opportunity to serve the public at large and in particular, those who voted for 
<br/>me  and  FijiFirst  being  the  largest  single  party  in  this  Parliament.    I  am  a  person  who  had  spent 
<br/>considerable time with the people, be it in the agriculture sector or in small and medium enterprises 
<br/>through my association with the other business as I am a businessman myself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said before, Fiji traditionally has been eased and will continue to 
<br/>depend on agriculture as a source of livelihood.  Whilst due credit is given to all other sectors, the 
<br/>agriculture sector is what keeps us especially the rural community ticking.  The agriculture sector 
<br/>plays an important  role in developing and supporting the economy.   The  countries  which are not 
<br/>industrial  countries  have  a  major  focus  on  the  agriculture  sector,  Fiji  is  no  exception.  Increased 
<br/>productivity and output in the agriculture sector will contribute significantly to the overall economy 
<br/>and prosperity of the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the Coalition Government’s allocation in the agriculture sector looks 
<br/>very nice from the outside, delivering what has been promised is another matter.  It is nothing new 
<br/>for someone on the other side to make huge promises and fall short of delivery.  Benjamin Franklin 
<br/>famously said, and I quote “Promises may get the friends, but non-performance will turn them into 
<br/>enemies.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must  congratulate the  Coalition Government  for making our ordinary  citizen’s life more 
<br/>miserable by increasing VAT to 15 percent.  For members of the Coalition Government, all of whom 
<br/>are either Ministers or Assistant Ministers, 15 percent VAT may not matter, but it does to the ordinary 
<br/>citizens.  A person who is on a minimum wage earns around $160 to $180 per week.  For him, a 6 
<br/>percent increase in VAT does matter and believe me, a lot of people fall into this category. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the art of deflection works sometimes or in some cases most of the time, 
<br/>but will not work every time.  It has become a habit of some honourable Members on the other side 
<br/>to keep deflecting issues raised with the previous government.  Yes, you knew the debt was there.  
<br/>There was nothing hidden from you.  You knew running the country was a mammoth task, yet you 
<br/>chose to do it, then stop complaining and get the work done.  Every time someone raises an issue, do 
<br/>not jump up and down and blame the previous government, it has been over six months now, stop 
<br/>whinging,  get  on with  the work.   I know you have bitten more than what  you  can chew, but  try, 
<br/>maybe you will get the work done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people do not have money to spend, people are struggling.  Racial attacks 
<br/></span><span>are increasing  and the social media is  uncontrollable.  Just recently, the Acting Commissioner of 
<br/></span><span>Police stated that the crime rate in the country has decreased.  Really?  Then why are we having so 
<br/>many grab and  runs, places are being  broken into, Eden Restaurant  was  recently  robbed,  and the 
<br/>protectors of law are being investigated for attempting to rape one of their own.  To add salt, the 
<br/>American Embassy has issued a security alert that states and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Several assaults and robberies have occurred in the bar and nightclub district of 
<br/>downtown Suva.  Violent robberies and assault, reports of sexual assault against female 
<br/>tourists have increased.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  is  this?    Is  this  Government  not  capable  of  creating  a  protective 
<br/>environment for its citizens?  The laxity of this Government and lack of competency of some office 
<br/>holders will slide the country backwards and this will not only affect the safety and security of the 
<br/>citizens, but  also  drastically affect  the tourism industry.   I am  sure the  honourable Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Tourism will agree with me.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President in his Address during the Opening of Parliament stated, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1536 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There  must  be  a  clear  focus  on  the  rule  of  law  and  the  democratic  processes,  including 
<br/>transparency, accountability, respect for human rights and freedom and listening to the views 
<br/>of people through genuine consultations.  The views of all members of the community must 
<br/>be  heard  and  I  urge  the  People’s  Coalition  Government  to  ensure  all  initiatives  and  draft 
<br/>legislations  must  undergo  thorough  consultation  process  for  better  outcomes  to  ensure 
<br/>inclusiveness and foster greater ownership.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  this  happening?    Have  all  the  appointments  made  under  this  current 
<br/>Government gone through a transparent and democratic process?  Have all the Bills passed in this 
<br/>august Parliament gone through what His Excellency had recommended? I do not think so. He also 
<br/>stated and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Government  must  ensure  that  the  draft  laws  are  deliberated  in  consultation  with  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders particularly through the Standing Committee process.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir is this happening?  Are we heeding to what he has said or have we totally 
<br/>disregarded the advice of His Excellency the President?  If the Government is not willing to adhere 
<br/>to the advice of His Excellency the President, then will the ordinary citizens matter to them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my first communique from the Electoral Commission was received on 15th 
<br/>March, 2023 and my invitation to join this august Parliament came now. It took the Commission 
<br/>almost  four  months.    Not  only  have  I  missed  the  Parliament  sittings  but  have  been  deprived  the 
<br/>opportunity to voice the concerns from my voters who voted for me.  The reason for not appointing 
<br/>the members of the Electoral Commission which in turn delayed my appointment as a Member of 
<br/>Parliament is very obvious and well known to the honourable Prime Minister and I leave it at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  time  the  Coalition  Government  needs  to  work  with  the  biggest  political  party  in 
<br/>Parliament  in  order  to  put  our  people  of  Fiji  first.    Remember,  no  government  is  permanent, 
<br/>governments do change, new ones come in, so be careful of how one behaves with the Opposition.  
<br/>Tables will change and you may sit in our seats.  Let us have constructive discussions.  Let us not 
<br/>argue for the sake of arguing.  Let us not set up cheap political point scoring.  Let us put our people 
<br/>first, let us put Fiji first and our country will prosper.  Is that not what we all want? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I look forward to work in harmony with all present in this august Parliament for the people 
<br/></span><span>of our nation and to contribute meaningfully for the betterment of our nation.  God bless Fiji and 
<br/>thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation)
