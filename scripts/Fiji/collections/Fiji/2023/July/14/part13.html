<div><span>1539 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed with the motion.  I wish to remind 
<br/>the august Parliament that pursuant to the resolution of Parliament, this motion to debate all the 12 
<br/>Consequential Bills will be limited to one hour only and this will be facilitated accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Bills together and as is convention, the Consequential Bills seek to amend relevant laws to address 
<br/>budgetary  policy  changes.    Just  before  I  go  into  the  Bills,  for  the  information  of  Parliament, 
<br/>consultations  on  the  Consequential  Bills  as  usual  were  held  with  the  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs 
<br/>Service,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources,  Ministry  of  Education,

<div><span>The first Bill, Tax Administration (Budget Amendment) Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to

<br/>tribunal for a review of an objection where attempts to resolve the matter through alternative dispute 
<br/>resolution Mr. Speaker, Sir, have been unsuccessful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill amends Section 31 of the Act to provide clarity on the grounds that allow

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deemed to have come into force on 1st July, 2023 as is the Convention and Sections 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8

<div><span>Clause  3  of  the  Bill  amends  Section  8  of  the  Act  by  deleting  the  refences  to  Social

<br/>budget response the rational for changing the structure of the Social Responsibility Tax or removing 
<br/>the reference to Social Responsibility Tax. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends Section 10 of the Act to remove the computation of Non-resident

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  6  of  the  Bill  amends  sub-clause  8  of  the  Act  by  removing  reference  to  Social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Responsibility Tax from the definition of Fiji Income Tax. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 7 of the Bill amends Section 67 of the Act by removing capital gain made by resident 
<br/>of Fiji or Fiji citizen on the disposable of shares being shares that were held by that person before 1st 
<br/>May, 2011 as an exempt capital gain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  7  of  the  Bill  also  expands  the  scope  of  ownership  of  first  residential  property  the 
<br/>disposal of which would be exempt from capital  gains.  Clause 7 of the Bill further amends, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, Section 67 of the Act by including a provision for de facto spouses as defined in the 
<br/>Family Law Act of 2003.  Additionally, clause 7 of the Bill deletes amendment made in 2021 through 
<br/>the Income Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 which exempted those liable to pay Capital Gains 
<br/>Tax on the disposal of shares held before 1</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2011 and I explained that earlier.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Value Added Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, clause 1 of the Bill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provides for the short title.  The 1</span><span>st</span><span> August is when the legislation will come into force.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023-2024 Budget Consequential Bills 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1541 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends Section 14 of the Act by removing the VAT rate of 9 percent and 
<br/>substituting the new VAT rate of 15 percent which is to be levied, collected and paid in accordance 
<br/>with the Act for Goods Imported to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>activity. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>imposition of VAT at a rate of 15 percent on prescribed services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier, we had three rates of VAT; zero, 9 and  15.    This 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Act removes the 9 and brings only two; 0 and 15.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  5  of  the  Bill  amends  Schedule  2  to  the  Act  to  provide  prescription  medicine  and 
<br/>prescription drugs as a zero-rated supply.  Apart from the 21 items that were already zero rated, we 
<br/>have added prescribed medicine and prescribed drugs, so 22 items are now zero rated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  6  of  the  Bill  amends  the  Act  by  deleting  Schedule  2(a)  to  the  Act  which  listed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prescribed services for which VAT at a rate of 15 percent was charged.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Customs (Budget Amendment) Bill, again the legislation will come into force on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends Section 2 of the Act by inserting new definitions of alternative 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends Section 6 of the Act to include post offices where customs officers 
<br/>are to be accommodated for the purpose of administering and enforcing customs laws.  There are 
<br/>some very difficult problems identified in terms of how customs officers could do the job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  4  of  the  Bill  amends  the  Act  by  inserting  a  new  Section  (11b)  to  provide  for  the 
<br/>requirement of cargo reporters to produce the advanced cargo information on cargoes prior to the 
<br/>ship or aircraft arriving in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 5 of the Bill amends Section 52(2) of the Act to provide for the warehousing period 
<br/></span><span>for items such as machinery and mechanical appliances and motor vehicle for only one year and no 
<br/>further extension allowed while other goods are warehoused for one year with further extension of 
<br/>six months. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>payment of import Value Added Tax for gold card taxpayers.

<br/></span><span>the purposes of administering any custom law collect, accounts, documents, records of information 
<br/></span><span>stored in electronic data.

<br/>and orders in addition to Departure Prohibition Orders for a person who owes duty or outstanding 
<br/>fines and penalties under customs laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>1542 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023-2024 Budget Consequential Bills 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 9 of the Bill amends Section 159 of the Act by deleting provisions where the Minister 
<br/>may drag goods seized and liable to be forfeited under the provisions of the Act or be sold or reserved 
<br/>for the civil service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 10 of the Bill amends Section 73(b) of the Act in relation to appeals where a person 
<br/>dissatisfied with an objection, decision or upon successful resolution under Section 173(c) of the Act, 
<br/>in relation to rectification of mistakes made within 20 working days, service a notice to the Court of 
<br/>Review or to a Court of Competent Jurisdiction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 11 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting a new Section 173 (c) of the Act to provide 
<br/>for the rectification of mistakes where it is apparent from the record that the mistake does not involve 
<br/>a  dispute,  the  Comptroller  may  for  the  purpose  of  rectifying  the  mistake,  amend  the  mistake 
<br/>accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting a new part, 22(b) in relation to alternative 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dispute resolution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting new sections, 180(a) and 180(b) to provide 
<br/>the  Court  of  Review  may  remit  decisions  to  the  Comptroller  for  reconsideration  and  provide  for 
<br/>general provisions in relation to objections and appeals in applications for review by the Court of 
<br/>Review or appeal to the High Court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is intended to simplify the administration of tax and ensure proper 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compliance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Customs Tariff (Budget Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 8 of 2023), again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, clause 
<br/>1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  It will come into force on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 
<br/>2023 except for clause 6 which comes into force on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023 and clauses 2(c),  (d) and (e) 
<br/>and 5 which will come into force on 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  2  of  the  Bill  amends  Part  1  of  Schedule  2  to  the  Act  to  provide  for  the  following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>changes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>i)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ii)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiscal duty on food items such as beef products, lamb, sheep, prawns, ducks, corned meat, 
<br/>lamb, sheep, corned beef, canned Mackerel, canned tomatoes and chicken portions; 
<br/>Increasing import excise duty on alcohol and tobacco, increasing port excise duty on new

<br/></span><span>and setting a new tariff item for snacks and non-alcoholic wine and deleting tariff items 
<br/>in relation to electronic cars and inserting new tariff item to rectify anomalies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the Act by deleting concession quotes for 
<br/>concessions which will no longer be provided.  I have explained some of those concessions in my 
<br/>Budget Address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 4 of the Bill amends Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Act to increase the fiscal duty on items 
<br/></span><span>under  Concession  Codes  231,  231(a),  231(b),  235,  235(a),  236,  236(a)  and  236(b)  and  to  delete

<br/>on unhealthy snacks and drinks such as sweet biscuits, juice, ice creams, snacks obtained by roasting, 
<br/>frying and baking or swelling and sugar confectionaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023-2024 Budget Consequential Bills 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1543 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 6 of the Bill amends the Act by increasing the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 9 percent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 15 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again comes into force on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 
<br/>2020 except for clauses 3 and 4(c) for the amending legislation which will come into force on 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>January, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends Section 41 of the Act to provide that a proper officer under the 
<br/>Act may require information including electronic data to excisable goods or materials while accessing 
<br/>an excise factory on an excise warehouse.  Again clause 2 of the Bill also amends Section 41 of the 
<br/>Act to insert a new subsection to provide that electronic data required by the proper officer will be 
<br/>dealt with in accordance with Section 111(a) of the Customs Act 1986.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends Schedule 1 to the Act to insert new items in the list of goods 
<br/>which will be subject to excise duty.  These new items are sweet biscuits, waffles, wafers, ice cream 
<br/>and other edible ice frozen confectionary, snack food and sugar confectioneries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  4  of  the Bill  amends  Schedule  2  to  the  Act  to  indicate  that in  addition  to  the  Gay 
<br/>Lussac Hydrometer an approved apparatus may also be an authorised instrument for the measurement 
<br/>of alcohol.  Clause 4 of the Bill also amends Schedule 2 to the Act to reflect the increase in the rate 
<br/>of  excise  duty  on  alcohol,  tobacco,  sugar,  sweetened  beverages,  sweet  biscuits,  juice,  ice  cream, 
<br/>snacks obtained by roasting, frying, baking or swelling and sugar confectionaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Airport Departure Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill, again, we are changing the departure tax.  
<br/>The amending legislation will come into force on 1st August, 2023 where the departure tax will go 
<br/>from $100 to $125 and then $140 from 1st January, 2024.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed rates are 
<br/>still less than the departure tax rates in 2012 and 2014 which were $150 and $200 respectively.  What 
<br/>we  have  done  is,  we  have  consulted  with  the  tourism  industry,  we  are  staging  it  first,  it  is  a  $25 
<br/>increase and we are giving another six months before we take it to $140. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water Resource Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a lot of debate and comments.  I have 
<br/>clearly laid this down in my response, but the amendment is in connection with the proposed income 
<br/>tax  Water  Structured  Industry  Incentive  Regulation  2023.    The  Bill  will  come  into  force  on  1st 
<br/>August, 2023.  Essentially Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Act by limiting its application to persons 
<br/>or businesses that are engaged in water extraction and bottling business as defined in Clause 2 of the 
<br/>Bill.  Taxpayers that are not engaged in a water extraction and bottling business shall not be subject 
<br/></span><span>to the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill clarifies that the Water Resource Tax applies to all water extracted by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taxpayers engaged in water extraction and bottling business regardless of its use. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (Budget Amendment) Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Bill will come into force on a date that will be appointed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting 26(a) which empowers or allows the service 
<br/></span><span>to  establish  a  panel  of  valuers  of  other  panels  to  allow  the  service  to  administer  its  functions  as 
<br/></span><span>provided for under Section 22 of the Act.  It also amends Section 27 of the Act, sub-section (3) to 
<br/>remove the requirement to appoint an Acting CEO as the CEO is temporarily out of the country.  Just 
<br/>a simple administrative change, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is in light 
<br/>of the volume of movement of Fijian labourers to work in Australia and New Zealand under Labour 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>1544 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023-2024 Budget Consequential Bills 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mobility Schemes in recent years and the opportunity of Fijian labourers workers to have access to 
<br/>the Fiji National Provident Fund would benefit these people.  Essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill 
<br/>provides  legal  basis  for  the  FNPF  to  expand  its  membership  by  setting  up  a  fund  overseas.    So 
<br/>amendments to clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill gives effect into that and this will allow FNPF to 
<br/>provide those services to those workers who are in Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second last Bill is on the Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Service (Budget Amendment) 
<br/>Bill.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had very good discussions on this Bill and basically the Bill amends 
<br/>the Act by inserting a new section 16(b) to provide for the cancellation of loan repayment under loan 
<br/>agreement for a student or a former student who was under a loan scheme prior to 1st August, 2023.  
<br/>All loan agreements as we have said will be converted to bond agreements with Board conditions 
<br/>determined by the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service. The cancellation of loan repayment under loan 
<br/>agreements, however, will not apply to a student or a former student who was under a loan scheme 
<br/>prior to 1st August, 2023 while working in the private sector.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is to effect 
<br/>that amendment and the policy that has been announced by the Government and the budget for it 
<br/>approved already. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Final one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Land Sales (Amendment) Act.  Again, in 2014, the Act 
<br/>was amended to specify limitations on the sale, transfer or lease of State land or freehold land to non-
<br/>resident  for  residential  purposes  within  town  or  city  boundaries.    While  the  amendment  did  not 
<br/>prohibit the sale, the transfer or lease  leads to a non-resident beyond the boundary of any town or 
<br/>city declared or extended under the Local Government Act 1972. This was only on the condition that 
<br/>the non-resident commences construction of a new residential dwelling within 24 months of the date 
<br/>of the sale and transfer of the lease.  We have had discussions with the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources.  We found that this was a very problematic law in terms of the time.  So, what the Bill 
<br/>does, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to amend to extend that 24-month period to five years.  That is a reasonable 
<br/>time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for any investor leasing State land or buying freehold land and trying to invest.  
<br/>So that amendment is effect that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you and I will be happy to respond after the debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I open the floor to debate on the motion.  I 
<br/>just  wish  to  remind  us  that  it  is  only  one  hour  on  both  sides  to  make  your  contribution  on  these 
<br/>Consequential Bills.  For the information of Parliament, I have two honourable Members from the 
<br/>Government  who  are  going  to  be  speaking  and  that  is  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister 
<br/>Kamikamica and the second one is honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka.  For the Opposition, 
<br/></span><span>the  list  that  has  been  submitted  are  honourable  Koya,  honourable  Usamate,  honourable  Premila 
<br/></span><span>Kumar, honourable Kirpal and honourable Sharma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will try and see how best we can cut the coat according to the cloth available. I will try and 
<br/>give five minutes each and if the list has still got balance of speakers and the time has run out, I will 
<br/>therefore stop the continuation of participating in the debate because the last 20 minutes will again 
<br/>be given to the honourable Minister for his Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and I offer the floor first to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>members on the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on Bill No. 11 of 2023.  Water bottling 
<br/>companies  are  actually  getting  away  in  two  ways.    Removal  of  Corporate  Tax,  none  of  these 
<br/>companies will pay 25 percent Corporate Tax, absolutely nothing on their profits that they will be 
<br/>earning and an increase in threshold of water extraction from 3.5 million litres per month to 10 million 
<br/>litres per month.  What will change with the passing of this Bill?  One, companies extracting up to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023-2024 Budget Consequential Bills 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1545 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.5 million litres per month that paid one cent per litre will pay nothing, zero absolutely.  Bigger 
<br/>companies like Fiji Water, owned by billionaires who paid 18 cents per litre for water extracted over 
<br/>3.5 million litres, now will pay 19.5 cents per litre if they extract more than 10 million litres per 
<br/>month.  So further revenue loss because of the threshold change.  Also, they will not pay 25 percent 
<br/>Corporate Tax.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, how is this a revenue gain for Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, in his justification recently through his press statement, I must 
<br/>say, the arguments presented by the honourable Prime Minister was not sound and not valid.  He did 
<br/>speak about  new companies coming in  and how they will benefit, but  the question is  established 
<br/>companies who have already enjoyed all these concessions and then it will end up in revenue loss.  
<br/>While we hear, e, revenue is so important for this country.  Let consumers pay 15 percent, let MSME 
<br/>pay 25 percent Corporate Tax, but let bigger companies, like Fiji Water, get away.  How is this fair?  
<br/>Above  all,  the  most  disappointing  component  was  that  unfortunately  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance did not see fit to include Fiji Water as part of his speech.  I do not support this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will speak primarily on the Water Resource Tax 
<br/>(Budget Amendment) Bill 2023.  It makes good sound by it to talk about tax holiday and name a 
<br/>conglomerate like Fiji Water,  but the reality is that, the country is earning more income out of this, 
<br/>and it is 20 percent more than what we are currently collecting.  I would just ask the other side not to 
<br/>engage in cheap politics, it makes good sound by it, holidays and conglomerates and big names like 
<br/>that.  It does not give confidence to our potential investors when we attract them in this manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Water is our very own and we need to protect it.   It gives Fiji a profile in the world that 
<br/>we need to protect, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I was in Doha in Qatar where Fiji Water is a premium water, 
<br/>and they were saying, “You know this American water called Fiji Water?”  That is what the world is 
<br/>saying today.  It is our very own and we need to protect it.  I just wish to reassure my colleague from 
<br/>Ra, who spoke very passionately about Ra, I can just say to him in the Nadroga dialect, “you ain’t 
<br/>seen nothing yet.”    We are engaging with Fiji  Water in  a manner that has not been there in the 
<br/>previous administration.  We know what they plan for Fiji and my colleague will be sharing that with 
<br/>us over the next couple of weeks or months, but we are engaging with them in a big way, and we will 
<br/>see a lot more from this conglomerate in what they will do for the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the other side, you have portrayed Fiji in a very negative vein over the 
<br/>last  couple of days.    It  is  like you are living  in  another planet.   Just few days  ago, in  Australia, 
<br/>Expedia which is one of the biggest consolidators of travel in the world has rated that Fiji has become 
<br/>the place where people want to go; only two days ago.  If Expedia says this, Mr. Speaker, that we are 
<br/></span><span>number one in terms of destination for people, it must be saying something about the change that has 
<br/></span><span>happened in Fiji over the last couple of months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- As we speak, you cannot find a room anywhere in Fiji, you cannot 
<br/>get a seat on the airlines coming to Fiji and the way they are talking is opposite to what is the reality 
<br/>on  the  ground.    As  we  say,  the  proof  is  in  the  pudding  and  people  like  this  country  and  what  is 
<br/>happening in this country.  I would just ask our guys in there, just cool down and support our investors 
<br/></span><span>as this side is doing in a big way.  For example, when we came into power, when we came into the  
<br/></span><span>administration, there was this hangar in Nadi, that was built in Nadi,  and somewhere along the line 
<br/>someone put a stop work to it, someone from FijiFirst.  We asked, what was the stop work?  No one 
<br/>could give an answer.  They had spent $9 million.  We said, “go for it, open it.”  That is the attitude 
<br/>today from the Coalition.  Look after investors.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would urge us all to support this 
<br/>Water Tax, it means a lot more for Fiji than what the other side is trying to portray.

<div><span>2023-2024 Budget Consequential Bills 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, never heard such a huge brunch of dribble before.  
<br/>Under Income Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill, Bill No. 6 of 2023, Social Responsibility Tax to be 
<br/>reduced.  The tax paid by the highest people who pay tax in this country will be reduced and by the 
<br/>same token under VAT, there will be an increase in VAT by 6 percent, people on the other side said 
<br/>that people who earn the lowest income, do not pay or buy much of the stuff that is outside of the 
<br/>ambit of the zero VAT.  That is absolute hogwash!  People also want to go to McDonald’s, they want 
<br/>to go to the movies and they want to do all of these things.  So they are reducing the income tax for 
<br/>the highest paid people in the country and increasing the cost of goods.  That is pro-rich and anti-
<br/>poor.  That is the hallmark of this particular Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is one thing that I do agree with, I do agree with some of the things that we are saying 
<br/>in some of these legislations, Bill No. 4 on Tax Administration and also for the Customs Act bringing 
<br/>in alternative dispute resolution.  I think this is great move.  This is something that we have been 
<br/>talking about a long time.  We practiced it in the Ministry of Employment over many years in the 
<br/>settlement of industrial  disputes. It reduces the amount of time, it reduces the cost and takes a bit of 
<br/>money away from lawyers, but I think it is very advantageous to us also.  I am also glad to see that 
<br/>FNPF is being brought in for our people who are working offshore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things  that I am  bit worried about  is about  the Land Sales Act,  where you are 
<br/>increasing the number of years, yet you give people to build a house from two years to five years.  
<br/>One of the problems that we have in this country now is the speculation on land.  Land prices are 
<br/>going up because a lot of people are speculating.  They buy land, they do not build anything and then 
<br/>after a few years they sell.  So, obviously, if you are going to open this up from two years to five 
<br/>years, you increase the possibility of speculation.  So, I think that is an area that I have a lot of concern 
<br/>for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now  going  back  to  Bill  No.  11  of  2023  which  is  on  Water  Resource  Tax  (Budget 
<br/>Amendment)  Bill  2023.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  few  years  ago,  the  Water  Resource  Tax  came  into 
<br/>account I think around 2008.  It was instituted as a result of what happened in 2009. Water was being 
<br/>extracted not much money was coming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I am not mistaken, I may stand to be corrected, it was at around 1.1 cents for any amount 
<br/>of water extracted up to 4.9 million litres and then from the 5 million litres to 9.9 million litres, it 
<br/>went up to 22 cents.  Above that it was 33 cents and then it reduced to 1 cent Water Resource Tax 
<br/>for every litre above 9.9 million and above 10 million litres it came up to 18 cents.  Then it changed 
<br/>again so that up to 10 million litres it was 1 cent and then from 10 million litres up, it moved up to 
<br/></span><span>18 cents but that included every litre from 0 to 10 million litres.  This new one is going to say, “once 
<br/></span><span>you reach 10 million litres then you start paying that extra tax, all the water above the 10 million 
<br/>threshold.”  The current one, no! All from zero up to 10, so we are losing income in that space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, there is no income tax being paid for this particular sector.  That means the 
<br/>water resource tax and the income tax is being lost.  I have talked at length in my addresses this week 
<br/>about our struggling entities in this country.  Medium-sized enterprises that will be hit by the VAT 
<br/>increases, the increases in company tax and the increase in duty they will be hit by all of these of 
<br/>things.  Some of these companies are almost about to die and if you add on this extra cost …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is not a laughing matter, Assistant Minister of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian citizens are employed in this companies.  It is no laughing matter, we have to look after 
<br/>our medium and small micro enterprises. We must help them grow, if we are going give tax break to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1547 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>large,  multi-national  companies  that  earn  millions  of  dollars,  what  are  we  doing  about  the  small 
<br/>companies,  the  ones  that  we  want  to  grow  that  are  going  to  be  the  real  engine  of  growth  in  this 
<br/>country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to grow the micro to become small, the medium to become large.  We need to be 
<br/>able to create an environment where they can grow and flourish.  This Budget is talking about giving 
<br/>advantages to those who are already well-off and not helping our struggling small, micro, medium 
<br/>enterprises that are employing people where you will find a lot of innovation that will drive us and 
<br/>will drive your trade agenda forward Deputy Prime Minister. Those are the ones that you have to 
<br/>work on, in helping and for you too, honourable Attorney-General to make sure that you can flourish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Allow me to setup Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise 
<br/>to support the accompanying Bills to the Budget Bill and just before I do that, just allow me in a 
<br/>couple of seconds reflect on what happened yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Yesterday was a historic 
<br/>day for Fiji and Fiji saw the New Fiji yesterday - 29 Members on this side of Parliament voted for a 
<br/>New Fiji.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, I thought I just share that. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>being a collegian, honourable Tikoduadua is such a gentleman and he said something to me yesterday 
<br/>that I thought I just share.  He said, “You know the Opposition kept us honest all the way.  They 
<br/>stayed with us right till the end asking and questioning.” I thought I would just thank the Opposition 
<br/>for their contributions as well yesterday.  They have had 16 years of experience, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>and  I  am  sure  in  over  the  next  few  years,  we  certainly  will  be  able  to  benefit  as  well  from  their 
<br/>experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I will be doing in this Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can, I will correct us in Parliament 
<br/>so that we do not misinform the people of Fiji. The travel advisory was not issued by the US Embassy, 
<br/>it was issued by AIG which is an insurance company.  This was only issued for Suva and so I urge 
<br/>this Parliament, please let us not be inflammatory if we can because the people of Fiji are watching, 
<br/>the world is watching us.  All of us want our economy to grow, we want stability in our country and 
<br/>so we must inform the world correctly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just a few contributions to make, if I can on the supplementary Bills.  
<br/>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Airport Departure Tax, there were some suggestions that it would 
<br/></span><span>actually slow down tourism.  It is a stepped arrangement and again we consulted widely with the 
<br/></span><span>tourism industry as the honourable Gavoka will know and it is widely accepted because we have 
<br/>consulted widely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the FNPF Act, Sir, this is not a small point and I would like the people of Fiji to understand 
<br/>this. This is a first step in developing a strategy for our diaspora.  They are sending a billion dollars 
<br/>into this country and we have an unique opportunity to capture that money, not as consumption but 
<br/>turn it to investments and grow this country. So, the setting up of the Fund in Australia or around the 
<br/>world  will  be  a  great  opportunity  for  this  country  and  I  congratulate  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/></span><span>Finance and also FNPF for their decision to start setting up offshore. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of TELS, there is not much else to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The children of Fiji will 
<br/>benefit from this wise decision.  A lot of us on this side of Parliament, we actually benefitted from 
<br/>the same methodology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We went offshore or stayed in Fiji, did our studies, came 
<br/>back and we are here, we are still here.  What is happening to our children at the moment is that they 
<br/>running offshore so they are saying that they are running away.  No, they are running away because 
<br/>of their decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  This  is  also  the  problem  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  I  went 
<br/>during the campaign, I went to Australia and I met with about five of the groupings in various parts 
<br/>of New South Wales and what they said was, “we have never got a visa from the government, ever; 
<br/>never ever.”   I was the first politician to actually go and visit.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to sort 
<br/>of just mention that and please know that the children of Fiji will benefit from that decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Land Sales Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir,…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Sachida.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Member is misleading Parliament.  The travel alert is 
<br/>by US Embassy, Suva and it is there on their website.  You are deliberately misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please quote the Standing Order that you are rising 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Standing  Order  74,  the  honourable  Member  is  deliberately  misleading 
<br/>Parliament.  The alert is from the US Embassy in Suva, it is on their website.    He is deliberately 
<br/>trying to mislead Parliament.  It is on their website. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of yesterday when we saw the travel 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>advisory it was coming from AIG which is an insurance company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Can I continue, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on the Land Sales Tax, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just a few things to note.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- This amendment, Sir, has a wider reaching ramification, I 
<br/>take  the  point  from  honourable  Usamate  about  potential  increase  in  real  estate,  but  this  decision 
<br/>actually, Mr. Speaker, Sir, killed the real estate market for retirees offshore who  wanted to come to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>

<div><span>2023-2024 Budget Consequential Bills 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1549 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji; it destroyed it.  So, this piece of legislation amendment will actually grow the economy, we will 
<br/>have retirees coming to Fiji who genuinely want to settle in Fiji, they will time to actually build in 
<br/>Fiji, two years was not enough. This is a practical way of growing the economy.  I hope the Members 
<br/>on the other side keep it in mind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Water Resource Tax.   I just like to share some very basic 
<br/>arithmetic so that you understand.  Firstly, there is no impact on the coffers of Fiji - zero.  Basically 
<br/>what is happening is, through a restructure of the Water  Resource Tax, the increase in the Water 
<br/>Resource Tax from 18 cents to 19.5 cents per litre actually means that it covers whatever tax liabilities 
<br/>we have ever paid.  It applies to all companies across Fiji so it applies to not only Fiji Water, it applies 
<br/>to Aqua Pacific or VaiWai, the suppliers, a company in Nadi, Frezco Beverages; it applies to all of 
<br/>them.  So, stop saying that it is only Fiji Water. One of the companies is owned by Fijian Holdings 
<br/>and FNPF, so it is benefitting the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Please, please let us be accurate in what we say.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing that I would like to say is, one of the things that the previous 
<br/>government did not do well is pay respect to big investors.  Fiji Water was wanting to invest more in 
<br/>this country and for some reason, they ignored them.  Like honourable Gavoka said, just watch this 
<br/>space Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you treat your big private sector with respect, you will get benefits 
<br/>across the board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The whole of the private sector is very thankful that this side 
<br/>of Parliament has delivered a Budget that is good for Fiji and good for the economy. So with those 
<br/>few words Sir, thank you for this time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, time has caught up with us and I now have to invite 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  to  make  his  Right  of  Reply.    Sorry  about  that,  honourable 
<br/>Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to pick on after explaining so well, after 
<br/>putting out the actual figures, after explaining the rationale behind  the Water Resource Tax, I am 
<br/></span><span>really  disappointed  that  the  Opposition  still thinks  that  there  is  some  kind  of  conspiracy  or  some 
<br/></span><span>sinister motive and some outside of Parliament started by saying, “just because the Prime Minister 
<br/>met the owners, there is something going on.”  I want to repeat what I said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Cheap shot.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The submissions made to the Ministry of Finance were from 
<br/>the water bottling industry as a whole.  Their figures are all wrong, honourable Kumar was saying 
<br/>that extraction for the top tier was increased from 3.5 million litres to 10 million litres. It was always 
<br/></span><span>10 million litres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I explained to them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is absolutely no revenue loss for Government 
<br/>in what we have done.  In fact, what we have done is going to get us more revenue.  As I said by 
<br/>2024 – 2025 from $80 million that we collect now, we could be up to $100 million and the Corporate 
<br/>Tax that we are getting now is just about $5 million and we are increasing the Water Resource Tax 
<br/>from 18 percent to 19.5 percent.  We are actually going to increase the revenue that the Government

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have not taken it away.  The honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition  did  not  get  it.    I  said  the  total  Corporate  Tax  that  we  collect  from  the  water  bottling 
<br/>industry is only $5 million.  The Water Resource Tax is what gets the revenue and we are increasing 
<br/>Water Resource Tax from 18 percent to 19.5 percent.  I do not know what they want.  In the last two 
<br/>days… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …Mr. Speaker, Sir, they were moving motions on the other 
<br/>side.  First  in the debate, they came out  and complained, they said,  “this is  a very high spending 
<br/>Budget,  you are not cutting expenditure.”  Then in the last two days, they were all moving motions 
<br/>to increase the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-.  When  I  added  that,  it  comes  to  more  than  $150  million 
<br/>increase that they wanted in the last two days.  If we had taken that or if we  listened to them, our 
<br/>expenditure will increase from $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. That is the voodoo economics that they 
<br/>practised over the last so many years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I was hoping, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they would break away 
<br/>from that Stockholm syndrome and as a new Opposition party with a new honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition (my friend and his a very good man) that they would all change.  They would start looking 
<br/>at something different and break away from the past, but they do not seem to.  I think honourable 
<br/>Kamikamica said that they have 16 years of experience, some of them have eight years of experience 
<br/></span><span>in  government,  but  I  think  they  will  need  some  time  to  fit  in  the  experience  of  being  a  good 
<br/></span><span>Opposition.  So, we will give them the time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the Social Responsibility 
<br/>Tax, they are saying that we reduce the tax from the rich.  That was a bad policy brought by the 
<br/>previous government to target certain groups and what happened?  First when they brought it, people 
<br/>who  were  slightly  below  $270,000  and  someone  who  was  earning  $280,000,  the  Social 
<br/>Responsibility Tax for the person who was earning $280,000 would take away more in tax than the 
<br/>person who was earning $60,000.  So, the net effect of that was, that if you were earning $280,000 
<br/></span><span>and if you were earning about $220,000, the person with $280,000 will at the end of the day get less 
<br/></span><span>take home pay than the person who was earning $220,000 or $230,000.  That is how stupid the policy 
<br/>was. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  What happened when people complained? When people 
<br/>complained, they changed it to marginal income instead of the total income.  So what happened was, 
<br/>some of those people who realised that they were paying more Social Responsibility Tax changed

<div><span>tax.  They formed companies, they got dividends paid. So they were avoiding, in fact, we lost tax as 
<br/>a result of that.  So what we have done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to  correct that and now it is a more 
<br/>progressive tax system that we have created and  it is fair and is simple.  It is not complicated for tax 
<br/>administration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Usamate  is  good  in  statistics  I  know  because  he  used  to  sit  in  my  class  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statistics…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You were in my tutorial class.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order, Standing Order 74, he is telling lies, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was never his student. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I was never your student, you never taught me anything.  He has to 
<br/>withdraw that statement because he has lied to you, Sir, he has lied to Parliament, he has lied to the 
<br/>people of Fiji.  I was never your student.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He used to be in my tutorial class, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A tutorial class? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I cannot understand the difference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me come back to the point, Mr. Speaker.  Honourable Usamate understands what SRT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was doing and we have corrected that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, is on the Land Sales Act.  Again that law 
<br/>was kind of brought because some people went and complained about foreign investors buying land 
<br/>and they brough this legislation to say, “you have to buy a freehold land in Savusavu and you have 
<br/>to build in two years.”  A lot of investors were scared away by that.  It was very stringent and given 
<br/></span><span>the ease of getting everything completed, two years was not enough and so what we have done is a 
<br/></span><span>very practical thing; increase the time.  We have given them five years, they still have to invest and 
<br/>it is a reasonable proposition, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in conclusion, what I want to say is that, as I said earlier, this is a budget that we passed 
<br/>yesterday, it was a well thought out budget, it addresses a number of fundamental problems in the 
<br/>economy and it has provided so much certainty confidence to our investors. I think there is a sense 
<br/>of exuberant, there is a sense of confidence, there is a sense of freedom, not only amongst the people 
<br/>but amongst the investors and we have been told every day from institutions, from the surveys we do 
<br/></span><span>and meetings we have that we are poised for a very strong not only economic growth but also a path 
<br/></span><span>line of investment that will be good for this country. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I hope honourable 
<br/>Members will support the Consequential Bills and I thank them for their contributions and the debate 
<br/>over the last three days.
