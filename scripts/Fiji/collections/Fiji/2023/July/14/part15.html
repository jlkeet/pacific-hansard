<h3>IMMIGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>IMMIGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday 
<br/>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  Immigration  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  17/2023)  be  debated,  voted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Immigration 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 17/2023), which was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, 11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 
<br/>2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill seeks to amend the Immigration Act 2003 to allow persons who are not citizens but 
<br/>whose name is registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula</span><span> </span><span>(VKB) to be permitted to enter, to reside and 
<br/>work in Fiji without having to obtain a permit or visa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  VKB  which  is  a  register  of  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  determines  membership  into  a 
<br/>y</span><span>avusa </span><span>or m</span><span>ataqali</span><span>.  It verifies an access to </span><span>mataqali</span><span> owner land and is also an avenue that justifies 
<br/>title holders within </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by virtue of the registration in the VKB, an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> person is considered a 
<br/>member of a landowning unit in Fiji.  Therefore, it defeats the purpose of being registered in the 
<br/>VKB when the process of return is bureaucratic and non-convenient.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been advised by the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs that the 
<br/></span><span>total number of </span><span>yavusa</span><span> in Fiji is 1,390, total number of </span><span>mataqali</span><span> in Fiji is 5,280, total number of the 
<br/></span><span>i tokatoka </span><span>is 9,979.  The total live members of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> registered in the VKB as todate is 541,540. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had mentioned on Tuesday, when the Act was first passed by Parliament in 2003, there 
<br/>was a provision that allowed for a non-Fiji citizen who is registered in the VKB to enter and reside 
<br/>or work in Fiji without having to apply for a permit.  However, in 2007, this provision was repealed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>1566 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the Immigration (Amendment Promulgation) 2007 and in doing so, was removed at a time when 
<br/>Parliament was not convened with no Opposition to question such removal. Now, given the manner 
<br/>in which the provision was removed, it is only right that this be corrected, and also democratically as 
<br/>we are doing now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people have intimate, social, cultural, spiritual and economic ties 
<br/>with Fiji and these has shaped their identity, even when they are not living in Fiji.  By allowing them 
<br/>to return without having to obtain permits or visas, by extension, we are also allowing them to fulfill 
<br/>their traditional obligations to their </span><span>vanua</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do acknowledge your traditional role as the </span><span>Turaga na Tui Cakau</span><span>, one of 
<br/>the paramount chiefs of Fiji.  I am sure the honourable Members of the Opposition will acknowledge 
<br/>your traditional role and the role to the people under the </span><span>Tui Cakau</span><span> wherever they may be in – in 
<br/>Beirut, Norway, USA, China or India, they have that special relationship when they arrive in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard that Fiji is and has been suffering from the issue of braindrain 
<br/>with many of our skilled workers having to leave our shores to find better employment opportunities 
<br/>overseas.  This  week,  we  have  heard  the  Opposition  saying  that  because  we  have  changed  the 
<br/>Government, people are leaving. That is far from the truth.  By allowing non-Fiji citizens who are 
<br/>registered in the VKB to go and work in Fiji without obtaining a permit, it is hoped that this will be 
<br/>one of the measures by which we are able to address the issue of braindrain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  I  may  just  share  this  to  the  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  on  my  recent  trip  to 
<br/>Washington D.C. I had an audience with the members of Fiji diaspora. I met this young lady, who is 
<br/>probably  23 years old,  comes from  a single parent  and went  on a scholarship after  Form 7 at  St. 
<br/>Joseph Secondary School. She graduated with a Bachelor and a Masters and enrolled with the US 
<br/>Army.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She shared with me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and said that she deals with millions in terms of the 
<br/>purchase of military equipment. She shares the vision, along with the other members of the Fijian 
<br/>diaspora there, that they want to come back and work in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also providing a schedule to allow for non-Fijians 
<br/>who are registered in the VKB to use those skills, experience and network that they have learned in 
<br/>the big world so that that can be used right here in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  highlight  a  very  important  point.    The 
<br/></span><span>exemption from having to apply for a permit will also be provided to the descendants of Fiji citizens 
<br/>of all other ethnic groups in Fiji.  Let me repeat that, the exemption from having to apply for a permit 
<br/>will also be provided to the descendants of Fiji citizens of all other ethnic groups in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just look back at the celebration of the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> that this Government hosted. A spirit of 
<br/>reconciliation is moving in Fiji.  Being a responsible Government, we have taken a step, a step that 
<br/>the 16 years of the FijiFirst Government never looked at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  the  extensive  public  consultations  conducted  and  based  on  the  submissions 
<br/></span><span>received  verbal and written, Cabinet also endorsed that the Minister responsible for Immigration by 
<br/>way of order in the gazette…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A Point of Order.  It would seem, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  is  talking  about  something  that  is  not  in  this Bill.  He  is  saying  this  is  going  to 
<br/>happen. We are here to debate this particular Bill. If you make that change, then you bring it to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1567 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. We are here to talk about something. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Usamate, you rose on a Point of Order and you began your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response by saying ‘it seems’. You are not sure of what you are about to say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have always informed Parliament that when you rise on a Point of Order, state the Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that you are rising so we can also look and participate in the Point of Order that you have raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Attorney-General, you may continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Apologise for honourable Usamate jumping the gun there. What he 
<br/>does  not  realise  is  that  the  policy  belongs  to  this  Government,  not  them.  I  am  in  the  process  of 
<br/>explaining the policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. J. Usamate interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Alright, listen, listen!  I am going to say it again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Listen, you may learn something!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, that is my role to say.  Just continue where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you left off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cabinet also endorsed the Minister responsible for Immigration by way of order in the gazette,  
<br/>will exempt descendants of Fiji citizens of all other ethnic groups from the requirement to obtain 
<br/>permit under section 8(3) of the Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exemptions  will  be  provided  to  recognise  the  historical  linkages  to  Fiji  and  to  show  this 
<br/>Government’s commitment to ensure that no matter which part of the world you may be in, as long 
<br/>as you have a link to Fiji, you will always find home here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is currently working with Kioa and 
<br/>Banaban people to undertake the process of citizenship by naturalisation to regularise their status as 
<br/>Fiji citizens. Following this, descendants of Kioa and Banaban people, along with other ethnic groups 
<br/>in Fiji who are non-Fiji citizens, will also be illegible to enter Fiji without a permit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, that the Bill, in no way, intends to discriminate against 
<br/></span><span>other ethnic groups  in  Fiji. As a sign  of good-faith to  all our people, the amending legislation, if 
<br/></span><span>passed by Parliament, will commence on the same date as the Order so that whether you are non-Fiji 
<br/>citizen registered in the VKB or are descendants or Fiji citizens, the exemption to enter Fiji without 
<br/>a permit will be applicable on the same date.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, necessarily, this means that whether you are not Fiji citizen, descendants of 
<br/>Indo-Fijian, Rotuman, Rabi, Kioa or any other ethnic group in Fiji, you too will be allowed to enter 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>1568 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji without a permit. The only qualifying element is that, those non-Fijians are descendants of Fiji 
<br/>citizens and those are administrative issues.   These are yet to be operationalised by the Department 
<br/>between  the  Solicitor-General’s  Office  and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  before  it  comes  and  it  will 
<br/>commence on the date the Act also commences.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand that question will also be raised as to why the exemption to 
<br/>VKB  registered  person  is  provided  for  in  the  Bill,  while  the  exemption  of  other  ethnic  groups  is 
<br/>catered for by way of an Order from the Minister.  The answer to this is very simple because the only 
<br/>qualifying factor for non-Fiji citizens of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> descent is their registration in the VKB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is easier to determine the categories of people who would be exempted from applying for 
<br/>a permit or visa when entering Fiji.  For other ethnic groups such as those that belong to the indo-
<br/>Fijian, Kioa, Banaban groups, et cetera, active and committed efforts are being undertaken to define 
<br/>the specific categories within these ethnic groups that would qualify for an exemption.  However, I 
<br/>will emphasise this again, the same exemptions given to non-Fijian citizens in registered in the VKB 
<br/>will also be given to descendants of Fiji citizens of all other ethnic groups in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 14</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023, His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, informed the 
<br/>111</span><span>th</span><span>  Session  of  the  International  Labour  Conference  in  Geneva  of  Cabinet’s  decision  for  Fiji  to 
<br/>adopt an official position support of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Indigenous 
<br/>Peoples (UNDRIP).  In recent times, the UNDRIP has been considered as the most comprehensive 
<br/>international instrument on the rights of indigenous people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  providing  proposed  exemptions  to  non-Fiji  citizens  registered  in  the  VKB,  we  are  also 
<br/>upholding the principles contained in the UNDRIP and, therefore, comply with international norms 
<br/>towards the protection of the rights and interests of indigenous people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  note  that  under  Section  5(4)  of  our  Constitution  says,  and  I  quote: 
<br/>“Citizens of Fiji may hold multiple citizenship”, however, this is subject to the laws of the foreign 
<br/>country. For instance, if a Fiji citizen would like to obtain citizenship in China, because of China’s 
<br/>legal requirements, they would have to revoke their Fiji citizenship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the proposed exemption is not a pathway to Fijian citizenship, it is hoped that it will 
<br/>provide for an easier entrance process into Fiji to those whom the proposed exemption is to apply to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  as  with  most,  if  not,  all  Bills  that  are  brought  before  this  Parliament,  we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anticipate a healthy debate and contributions from Opposition on the merits of the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before this, I would like to pose the following for deliberation by the honourable Members 
<br/>of the Opposition.  In disagreeing with the Bill, what are your motivations for doing so?  Let me say 
<br/>it, again, what is your motivation of disagreeing with this Bill, honourable Usamate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- If they are based on a well-balanced and well thought out constructive 
<br/></span><span>criticisms, we welcome that.  As a matter of fact, it would be disservice to the principle of democracy 
<br/></span><span>and the people of Fiji if we did not consider the Opposition’s contributions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  if  the  motivations  for  debate  are  based  on  petty  dislike  for  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government which they said last week and the like, is this the reason enough to deprive our people 
<br/>who are living overseas?  The opportunity to return to Fiji without having to be subject to the process 
<br/>of applying for permits and visa.  How wonderful it is! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1569 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Bill seeks to recognise the connection our Fijian diaspora 
<br/>have with us, regardless of their current place of residence and status of citizenship.  Accordingly, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  offering  the  floor  to  the  list  of  speakers  submitted  to  me  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Whips,  perhaps  I  should  read  them  out.    Two  speakers  have  been  identified  by  the 
<br/>Opposition - honourable Naupoto and after that, it will be honourable Bulitavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the Government’s side, the speakers are honourable Kiran, honourable Vakalalabure 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and then rounded off by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Each speaker will speak for five minutes as agreed, and the floor is now open for debate on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me put things into context, and I hope that those 
<br/>who are registered in the VKB will be listening.  What we are asking in this Bill is to allow the VKB 
<br/>as a requirement for immigration, that is the bottom line.  We are asking that the VKB be brought in 
<br/>as a requirement for immigration, like you do with the birth certificate for a passport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us allow the VKB as a requirement for immigration for someone who is not a Fiji citizen 
<br/>to come in, enter and reside in Fiji without a visa and a permit and work, which is what someone 
<br/>does when you have a blue passport. Now, please listen, what is the VKB?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The VKB is the most sacred document for the </span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>  Not anyone can access it completely, 
<br/>I can only see what has to do with my family.  If you are not registered in the VKB, you cannot go 
<br/>and see, and the aim of the VKB if you look at the history, is to connect the person who is registered 
<br/>in there to the ownership of the land.  That is the reason for VKB, not for immigration purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was watching one of the presentations by the iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Affairs in </span><span>iTaukei, </span><span>and it says, </span><span>E dua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ga na i naki ni Vola ni Kawa Bula, sa i koya me semati koya ka volai kina ki na qele e taukena. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, what you are trying to do is to use that very restricted document that I can only see what 
<br/>belongs  to  me  and  open  it  up  where  anyone  can  access.    Once  you  enter  it  into  the  immigration 
<br/>system, someone even a non-VKB guy is going to punch into the system and see, “Oh, this person is 
<br/>in the VKB or not”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have just opened up what was a very restricted system.  Please, listen because I will tell 
<br/></span><span>you.    I  know  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  is  listening  because  I  will  tell  you  every  system.  
<br/>Immigration decisions are life changing decisions and I will tell you that every system that produces 
<br/>a requirement for you to use for immigration is corrupt.  I will tell you a story. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Someone  came  to  the  Immigration  with  a  birth  certificate  so  that  is  Births,  Deaths  and 
<br/>Marriage (BDM) because it is a requirement to get a Fiji citizenship.  That birth certificate was not 
<br/>even fake.  It was the birth certificate of someone who still does not have a passport and the age 
<br/>group was only one year difference, the month - September was the same and the date was different. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That person took that birth certificate and had a driving licence done at LTA.  Also, we have 
<br/>seen the joint cards being used - fake.  So, every system that produces requirements for immigration 
<br/>is open to corruption and what you are doing is now opening this very sacred system or document 
<br/>that belongs to the indigenous people that links them to their land ownership, to corruption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>1570 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, there is a simple way to do this and I will tell you.  If you are a man, the requirement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to be a Fiji citizen, amend it. Under registration, there are three categories: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span> </span><span>If you are former Fiji citizen, you can apply to be a Fiji citizen. 
<br/>2)</span><span> </span><span>If you are a child of a Fiji citizen, either parent is a Fiji citizen, you can.  Now, if you amend 
<br/>that for it to say, “ a person whose either parent is or was a Fiji citizen”, then you cover 
<br/>everyone.  You are leaving the VKB aside, but now you cover everyone.  You cover the 
<br/>person, who is registered in the VKB and who is now maybe a citizen of another country or 
<br/>the child of someone who is registered in the VKB of a different citizenship and you are 
<br/>covered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3)</span><span> </span><span>But, please, do not pull in this very sacred and allow it to be opened, do not!  Because you 
<br/>can do it in other ways.  I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, I know this because I was the one and I 
<br/>thought I did a favour by removing it and keeping it safe .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I was the Director of Immigration and I did it because when I went 
<br/>there I saw that every system that had to produce requirements for immigration were very open to 
<br/>corruption.  I mentioned that story and that person who got a Fijian Passport was trying to set up a 
<br/>jewellery business in Levuka.  This person came from another country and he went through all those 
<br/>systems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All I am saying is that, there are other ways.  This is not anti-</span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, it was really done to 
<br/>protect that system and keep it apart.  Do not allow it to be corrupted because someone is going to sit 
<br/>at Immigration and punch it in and say, “Alright, just to check this person whether you are in or not.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have sounded the alarm here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have just reconvened the Great Council 
<br/>of Chiefs (GCC) and now you are bringing that VKB and open it up?   Do not give that risk for 
<br/>someone to corrupt it, because you can do it in other ways!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of this august Parliament; what a beautiful 
<br/>day it is!  A day when my heart explodes with emotions that all those who have been born in Fiji and 
<br/>their descendants no matter where they live, are welcomed to their home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- I wish to take this time to humbly express my gratitude to the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister for leading this nation with the vision, for recognising that for people who came to 
<br/>Fiji during indenture period or as free migrants for them and their descendants, this is the only home 
<br/>they know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For descendants of Melanesians, Kioans, and Rabi Islanders, stories that have nurtured their 
<br/>upbringing are rooted in Fiji and they feel rooted in Fiji.  A general perception is that we operate in 
<br/>silos, have stereotypes, and each ethnic group may have their own narrative of suffering of their own 
<br/></span><span>people.  But all the influences of people around us and this nation becomes core of who we really 
<br/></span><span>are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reality is that in their past century and a half, we have worked together, lived together, 
<br/>celebrated together and cried together, whether we see tragedy, a natural disaster or a win in Rio or 
<br/>when Drua plays, we all come together.  The entire diaspora laughs with us in our celebrations and 
<br/>cries with us in our tragedies, and this was well reflected in the remittances during the pandemic and

<div><span>1571 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>after.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My grandfather came during the indenture system.  My elders are in their 90s and 80s, and I 
<br/>have been very blessed that their stories of how our people were adopted in this land has kept me 
<br/>grounded in Fiji, in my own history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The values they have imparted have made me who I am.  I can see these values passed down 
<br/>by cousins to their children and grandchildren living abroad.  Actually, what I see with some of my 
<br/>nieces and nephews around the globe, they hold our culture even dearer as their parents have tried to 
<br/>hold on to Fiji in their hearts in the way they live, the way they cook, the way they relate to each 
<br/>other.  </span><span>Lovo, yaqona</span><span>, mats, </span><span>masi</span><span>, are part of the way our people live abroad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was told my cousin that there are 140 </span><span>Ramayan Mandalis</span><span> run by our diaspora in Sacramento 
<br/>alone.  This is the case wherever people have settled.  Our people remained different from others of 
<br/>Indian origin because of the influence by the people of the land and its experiences we have all grown 
<br/>with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I grew up in the West and deeply connected to the chiefs of Ba.  When we presented our 
<br/></span><span>veisa</span><span> to the chiefs of Ba in 2017 at Ba Provincial Council event, the chiefs presented their </span><span>kamunaga 
<br/></span><span>or </span><span>tabua</span><span> for their love and protection of our people.  We have had the acceptance in the  </span><span>vanua</span><span> of 
<br/>Rewa by the </span><span>Gone Marama Bale na Roko Tui Dreketi</span><span> and the chiefs of Rewa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I met others like me, Mr. Speaker, who feel they belong to the </span><span>vanua</span><span> after we were given the 
<br/></span><span>i  cavuti  </span><span>by  the  </span><span>Turaga  Na  Tui  Noco</span><span>,  the late  Ratu  Isoa  Damudamu  who  has  given  us  a sense  of 
<br/>belonging to the </span><span>veiwekani </span><span>or relationships in this </span><span>vanua.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been guided by my elders and have been very blessed to have the guidance of elders 
<br/>of other communities I have grown with, Mr. Speaker, including our chiefs, who continuously have 
<br/>helped me shape my journey.  This is how it has been for people of all origins in Fiji.  Our people 
<br/>who have lived here and have left have deep-rooted connections to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, through this Bill, the Coalition Government recognises all our people.  If those who 
<br/>have left or their descendants wish to come back home, come and live here in the West.  They can 
<br/>by showing proof that their ancestors were born here, even if it is just one of their ancestors come 
<br/>back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People of all ethnicities, people of Chinese origin, Kioans, Rabi Islanders and Melanesians 
<br/></span><span>born in Fiji, you and your descendants are welcome to Fiji.  This is the </span><span>loloma</span><span> being sent to all of 
<br/>you by the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I would like to caution those intending to come as well.  While everyone is very 
<br/>welcome, it is important that we protect our nation from crime, drugs and other unwanted elements 
<br/>that  could  add  to  our  social  challenges.    I  know  there  will  be  requirements  for  things  like  police 
<br/>clearance for those wanting to leave or invest in Fiji,  and I call upon on our diaspora to, please, help 
<br/>us keep Fiji clean and use this opportunity responsibly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am grateful for this Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that recognises all descendants of ethnic groups 
<br/>from Fiji, a great step towards not only reconciliation, but recognising all of our people.  Welcome 
<br/>home to all who have been from Fiji - their children, their grandchildren who can take a precedence 
<br/>- buy land, start  up a business or just a holiday like a Fiji  citizen.  With  that I  applaud and fully 
<br/>support the Bill.

<div><span> Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution to the Bill that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before Parliament, Bill No. 17 of 2023, to amend the Immigration Act 2003.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me start by saying that if I were the Attorney-General, I would withdraw 
<br/>this Bill because it is not completely drafted. The way he presented it today, the background of the 
<br/>Bill or the Clauses that this particular Bill needs to amend, only talks about the additional list that 
<br/>will (g) to section 8.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill talks about the powers of the Permanent Secretary of Immigration to grant a permit.  
<br/>What is not in the list are those VKB members who reside overseas, not Fiji citizens, for them to be 
<br/>allowed to enter and reside and work in Fiji and they should not be given a visa and a permit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only amendment that comes in for them or VKB registered members to be added into the 
<br/>list that are already there in section 8.  There are only two sections in section 8 of the Immigration 
<br/>Act, section 8 (1) and section 8 (2) talks about the powers of the Permanent Secretary in reviewing 
<br/>the permit and I think that is also subject to section 3 of the Immigration Act - the discretionary power 
<br/>of the Permanent Secretary that is delegated by the line Minister to the Permanent Secretary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of his speech, the honourable Attorney-General talked about the descendants of 
<br/>the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>, plus the descendants of Banabans and also other </span><span>Vasu</span><span> ni Melanesia and also </span><span>Vasu</span><span> ni 
<br/>Tonga, who are here and will also be part of this,  but there is no mention of that in this particular 
<br/>Bill, honourable Kiran. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney-General should withdraw the Bill, take it back and try to tidy it up 
<br/>by adding, at least, another list there that should guarantee or also take care of the other communities 
<br/>that should also be part of this particular Bill or this broad acceptance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What a fuss, very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- It is half-cooked, half-done, and I urge the honourable Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General to withdraw it, take it back and do a good drafting on how this particular legislation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What the honourable Attorney-General will do is this, you will pass this, then you will come 
<br/>back to the Parliament to amend this and to try and insert another subsection 3 to include that.  If this 
<br/>Bill was given to the Committee, it would have gone around with this background to try and tell 
<br/>people what this Bill is about, it will be without the provisions that honourable Kiran is talking about.  
<br/></span><span>That is one of my concerns that could help improve in drafting the Bill, so honourable Attorney-
<br/></span><span>General, in future, once you pass the Bill to the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second part of my contribution is what the honourable Naupoto has talked about and I 
<br/>think  we  have  been  talking  about  not  only  the  usage  of  VKB  as  a  requirement.    I  urge  that  the 
<br/>requirement too that will be used for the descendants of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> should also be used for us the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and our VKB should not be used as a requirement because our digitized records will be put 
<br/>online. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have grave concerns, Sir.  When we were first Members of Parliament in 2014, leading 
<br/></span><span>before that 2018, concerns was when our VKB was first digitized because our records going online 
<br/></span><span>by a company in India as you know and also some records were subject to error too and there are still 
<br/>some error in some of the entries that are there with iTLTB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of the VKB members who want to go and open their accounts, still do not have the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>correct name because of the incorrect entry that was done by those who digitized this.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1573 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are few of our concerns that I urge Government to look into very seriously.  If another 
<br/>requirement can be used, the requirement of VKB should not be used, another requirement similar to 
<br/>the other communities and also proper drafting can be done so that the things that the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General has said in his speech is properly reflected in the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  just  to  add  to  the  remarks  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  when  moving  this  amendment  of  this  Bill.    In  terms  of  the 
<br/>responsibility that Cabinet has now entrusted upon my Office to ensure the element of equality in 
<br/>terms of how we value all of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want to assure this Parliament and also all of our people that we, as Fijians, recognise 
<br/>and we value those that have come before us and have left their mark for the development of our 
<br/>great nation and many of their descendants are abroad but because by virtue of their citizenship, they 
<br/>would have to go through these additional steps to be able to get a work permit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we have started with iTaukei as what this Bill is proposing.  Obviously, in the past, the 
<br/>last Government had approved the dual citizenship, so that makes it easier for anyone to bypass this 
<br/>process through the same way, but this makes it even easier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not so much about the permit issue, it is about recognition of dedication of how this nation 
<br/>of ours recognises the investment, the effort.  People who lived here, built this country, have gone 
<br/>and their descendants can also enjoy these benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The process have to be worked out, so at the end of the day, the Minister has the powers under 
<br/>the Act, honourable Bulitavu, to institute and make these changes according to law.  But I would just 
<br/>like  to  address  some  concerns  initially  raised  by  the  honourable  Naupoto  and  my  good  friend, 
<br/>honourable Bulitavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The records of the VKB is not going to be opened.  Those processes as you have informed 
<br/>Parliament on, honourable Naupoto, in terms of protecting it - the VKB from the birth certificate or 
<br/>immigration at that time, follows a similar process.  So, it is already being used as a pre-condition 
<br/>for </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>to go to the VKB, get the record of their VKB listing and take it as a requirement to buy 
<br/>shares at the Fijian Holdings.  It is not open to anyone else.  It will be along the same lines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So if someone can prove that they have descendants from my tribe which there are many, 
<br/>they  do  not  necessarily  look  dark  like  me  anymore,  so  they  have  to  come  with  their  parents  or 
<br/></span><span>whoever and prove that I am a descendant of the great, great, great records is in the book, take that 
<br/></span><span>slip, use the law and apply for this permit as someone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, prior citizenship can be easily traced because we have records. So, I just wanted 
<br/>to assure you that VKB records are secret, as you have said, and we intend to make it secret.  But we 
<br/>would like to use it also (those records) for the benefit of our descendants of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> who now live 
<br/>abroad.  So, like I said, the current law does not allow anyone to go and dig up the books, that is up 
<br/>to the people who can go, they have the right to do it and check it and come out with green slips.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, that is, essentially, what I would like just to assure that by doing this, as the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Attorney-General and honourable Kiran had alluded, is we value our people.  We value our citizens, 
<br/>we value our </span><span>Fijianas</span><span>.  I was just writing a comment in my book because in some of the partnerships 
<br/>we do, we call them our </span><span>vuvale</span><span>, </span><span>na lewe ni noda vuvale</span><span>, those who are not from here but we treat 
<br/>them as our </span><span>vuvale</span><span> and we deal with them on a Government basis. These are truly our relatives and 
<br/>our people who came from here, parents lived here, had gone away, so we want to give them this

<div><span> Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>benefit and this privilege.  Of course, it benefits them and it will benefit Fiji and our people going 
<br/>forward.  I endorse the amendment, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will refer to two issues, The first is honourable 
<br/>Naupoto.  Sir, honourable Naupoto and the Immigration have forgotten that it was an act that came 
<br/>into force in 2003.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You may have recalled Sir, when you were member of SDL, I was the Legal Officer working 
<br/>for  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration.  I  was  once  involved  in  presenting  this  in  the 
<br/>Senate after I was endorsed by Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Senate at that time, they were members of the Great Council of Chiefs.  It was approved.  
<br/>It is in 2007 when they removed this specific issue so the issue of VKB access is basically a non-
<br/>issue.  What we have done now, we are reverting to the </span><span>status quo</span><span>.  They took it out, they are putting 
<br/>it back, so that is a non-issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second issue I would like to resort to, honourable Bulitavu, it is very fundamental. The 
<br/>specifications are covered in the regulation not covered in the Act. The authority to permit someone 
<br/>is  under  the  Permanent  Secretary  and  the  Director,  not  the  Minister  because  you  appeal  to  the 
<br/>Minister. That is why it is not covered here.  Rest assured.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I assure the Members of the Opposition that the interest of other ethnic groups will be 
<br/>catered  for  once  the  matter  goes  to  Cabinet,  then  the  Minister  will  sign  an  order  and  they  will 
<br/>commence on the same day as the Act is enacted. Like every other Acts that have been passed by 
<br/>Parliament, some have not commenced for the simple reason because the regulation has not been 
<br/>drafted.  There are two different issues  - Act and Regulations.  That is the simple explanation.  I 
<br/>support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Votes cast: 
<br/>Ayes 
<br/>Nays 
<br/>Not voted  -  5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>-  28 
<br/>-  21 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[A Bill for Act to amend the Immigration Act 2003 (Bill No. 17/2023) moved under Standing 
<br/>Order 51 passed and enacted by Parliament of the Republic of Fiji (Act No. …. 2023)]. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Point of Order Nos. 61 and 74. I would like to bring to the attention 
<br/>of this august Parliament that there is a case before the courts. You might be aware that there were 
<br/>seven  women  who  filed  a  Constitutional  redress  against  the  Electoral  (Registration  of  Voters) 
<br/></span><span>(Amendment) Act and Interpretation (Amendment) Act which we are actually going to be debating 
<br/></span><span>today.  One of them was the former General-Secretary of National Federation Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this case has been represented by Jon Apted in court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1575 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- If we continue with this debate, we will be directly interfering with 
<br/>a court case which is still pending before the Courts. We would like to have a ruling from you, after 
<br/>that, we can decide to either take part or not in this particular debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Whip.  Honourable Members, I think we have gone 
<br/>through this in a similar case as well when we were addressing Bill No. 17.  I will ask the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General to give his reply to the concern that you have raised, honourable Whip. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes, it was raised as an objection, Bill No. 17 then became an Act 
<br/>No.  22  of  2021.    I,  again,  for  the  information  of  the  Members  of  the  Opposition,  look  at  you 
<br/>Constitution, Chapter 3, Part A on the Legislative Authority states and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“46(1)   The authority and power to make laws for the state is vested in Parliament consisting 
<br/>of  the  members  of  Parliament  and  the  President,  and  is  exercise  through  the 
<br/>enactment of Bills passed by Parliament and assented to by the President; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)   No person or body other than Parliament has authority to make any law in Fiji, except 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under authority conferred by this Constitution or by a written law.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 47(1) of the Constitution also states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any  member  of  Parliament  may  introduce  a  Bill  in  Parliament,  but  only  the  Minister 
<br/>responsible for finance, or another Minister authorised by Cabinet, may introduce a Money 
<br/>Bill, as it described in subsection (4).”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In essence, it basically says that this is the reason why we are here in Parliament, we introduce 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that was the intention of the Constitution, it would have stated here that it cannot introduce 
<br/>a Bill if there is a matter pending in Court. What has happened is this – this is the law that you made, 
<br/>the challenge is here and we are waiting for a decision. We are repealing the Act.  So, this is still a 
<br/>live issue before Courts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  I am sorry for the distraction. 
<br/></span></div>
