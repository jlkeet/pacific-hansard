<div><span>ELECTORAL (REGISTRATION OF VOTERS)(AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Electoral  (Registration  of  Voters)(Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  19/2023),  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>considered by Parliament without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament;  
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committees of Parliament;  
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, but 
<br/>then ample be given to debate the Bill after the vote on the 2023-2024 Appropriation 
<br/>Bill 2023 and Consequential Bills with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, essentially,  this Bill and the Electoral Bill are linked 
<br/></span><span>and, of course, the case of Niko Nawaikula is well known to us. This is to change what was provided 
<br/></span><span>for in the Registration of Voters (Amendment Bill) 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, these changes were made after the Supervisor of Elections lost his case.  There 
<br/>were wider consultations, just like other related Bills, with Government agencies and, of course, key 
<br/>stakeholders were heard.

<div><span>Electoral (Registration of Voters) (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  must  be  considered  urgently  to  address  the  concerns  raised  by 
<br/>women who want their birth certificates to be changed to reflect their maiden names, as they had 
<br/>previously  changed  their  birth  certificates  to  reflect  their  spouse’s  surname  for  election  purposes 
<br/>only. The longer we delay the Bill, the longer individuals are being denied their rights to vote, as 
<br/>some women wish to vote under their married name and other official documents such as passports, 
<br/>driving licence, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Now, the floor is open for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- I rise to give my contribution on the Bill. That is why I have said 
<br/>in during the debate on the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill 2023 for us to wait for that Election 
<br/>Report because this has come after that Bill and now the honourable Attorney-General is moving this 
<br/>Registration of Voters (Amendment Bill) 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were part of the Committee then that just reviewed those three Electoral Laws that were 
<br/>used  in  the  2022  Elections.    This  was  one  of  the  amendments  that  was  proposed  by  the  former 
<br/>Supervisor of Elections (SOE) and his Team then.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the current Acting SOE, Ms. Ana Mataiciwa, wants to bring up those amendments, then 
<br/>they should come through the right procedure, that is,  for her to first table the 2022 Election Report 
<br/>and  from those findings and from the Multi Observer Group findings, if there are things that need to 
<br/>be improved for the 2026 Election, the honourable Attorney-General, closer to Election time, can 
<br/>move those amendments that would facilitate the Election in 2026.  Those amendments also do come 
<br/>with the request for a budget to hold that Election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the right time, this is too early. This is just trying to play some 
<br/>emotions with some voters and trying to politicise things, so Standing Order 51 should not be used. 
<br/>We are talking about the Budget this week.  Honourable Attorney-General, the only Bills that are 
<br/>entertained  this  week  are  those  Consequential  Bills  that  affect  the  Appropriation  Bill.    This  Bill 
<br/>should  go  through  the  normal  procedure  under  the  Standing  Orders  and,  please,  do  respect  the 
<br/>Standing Orders and Parliament.  The procedures are laid out in there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not support the use of Standing Order 51 as we should respect the Standing Committee 
<br/>that should do the necessary consultations on this electoral law - they move around the country and 
<br/>conduct consultations as part of their role as parliamentary committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is  just talking  about  executive consultation.    Executive  consultation  is  totally different 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from a legislative consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Sometimes when you do a legislative consultation, when we ask 
<br/>the Solicitor-General and the drafters when they come down to the Standing Committees to give us 
<br/>the list of the consultations they do and when we move around to check those centres where they 
<br/>conducted the consultations, people do not attend in numbers.  Even the Solicitor-General does not 
<br/></span><span>facilitate us with the submissions that were provided during the executive consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why we need to have checks and balance, the consultation conducted by parliamentary 
<br/>committee so that we can move around and do a wider consultation where more people will have 
<br/>their say on how the law that should govern them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to add to the earlier discussion, I agree 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1193 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with honourable Bulitavu that we must try and adopt that process when these are substantial  Bills. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is just another example of what the previous Administration tried to do 
<br/>in terms of bringing laws without any consultation at all.  In fact, we have adopted a slightly different 
<br/>process in the sense that those laws that need quick amendments such as this, the Attorney-General’s 
<br/>Office, after Cabinet, does the consultation.  Sometimes, it is actually quite an appropriate thing to 
<br/>do, Mr. Speaker, for new laws or amendment to laws to have the discussion first before you do the 
<br/>drafting.  We have seen how poorly drafted laws without any consultation through Standing Order  
<br/>51 have resulted in really bad consequences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  a  pretty  straightforward  and  urgent  as  well,  so  we  do  not  want  to  delay  this  until 
<br/>September or October.  That is why we are using Standing Order 51.  It is different from what they 
<br/>used  to  do  -  no  consultation  at  all,  it  used  to  come  like  no  one  knew.    We  had  some  very,  very 
<br/>substantial serious Bills, and this law was bad in the sense that when a government loses a case in 
<br/>the Court, then they come and change the law to prove their point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is not just one example, there are several examples of 
<br/>what  happened,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  think  the  Opposition  should  accept  that  this  is  a  pretty 
<br/>straightforward change that was brought.  It is a bad law and let us debate it on Friday and do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I love the change of tunes.  One day it is Jimi Hendrix, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>next day it is Santana.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am actually flabbergasted, to use the word, that they have cried out in the 
<br/>origins of this particular law right at the beginning.  Why have we not consulted?  We have not done 
<br/>this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a matter of fact, a lot of consultations went on with respect to the electoral laws and it 
<br/>think it was almost eight months, if I remember correctly, and honourable Bulitavu actually sat there.  
<br/>I am talking about the electoral laws and not a specific law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular Bill and the issue within it has had quite a 
<br/>number of opinions on it across the board, whether it is good or for bad.  So, taking a lesson out of 
<br/>that particular book, you would say, “Alright, maybe we need to do that consultative exercise.  Let 
<br/>the committees deal with it because there is quite a degree of independence when they actually do 
<br/>that to find out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  importantly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  this  is  extremely  important  and  such  a  critical 
<br/>component of it, is the report that needs to come out from the Elections Office which was pointed 
<br/>out by honourable Bulitavu.  That is important, and that has a bearing on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we are not saying anything with respect to what the content of the Bill is at the moment, 
<br/>we are actually objecting to the fact that you are bringing this in.  But this is the question that now, 
<br/></span><span>everyone on this side of the Parliament is thinking.  What is the hurry?  Are they anticipating having 
<br/></span><span>a failed Budget?  Are they anticipating having snap elections?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- In your dreams! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- What is the hurry? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  No,  it  is  not  about  dreams.    The  harsh  reality  is,  this  is  politics.  
<br/>Remember, things change overnight.  The point is, Sir, what is  it that they are trying to pre-empt 
<br/>here? Is there some kind of fear factor? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- For the women.   This is for the women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am not talking about the content of the Bill, honourable Member.  You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will hear our opinion on it when we debate the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is urgent because it is for the women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  You are saying urgent because it is for women? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- What about everyone else? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What if it was for men? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The point is that there is large amount of diverse opinion on this, and it 
<br/>requires it to go before the committee.  As a matter of fact, you are starving the committee of works, 
<br/>Sir, which they really should need to do and we would do quite thoroughly, as you have seen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Sir, it is something that we gravely object to with respect to how it is actually being 
<br/>dealt.  We will argue the merits of  what  is  in  it  at  a later stage.  But  what  is  the fear?  Why the 
<br/>urgency?  No explanation proffered by the honourable Attorney-General - none to say that this is 
<br/>going  to  be  detrimental  to  something  tomorrow, so  it  needs  to  be  done  today.    That  is  not  being 
<br/>offered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  very hypocritical of all of them  to  stand  up, “Oh, we are using Standing Order 51 
<br/>because it suits our purpose right now.”  That is exactly what they were saying to us that we should 
<br/>not be doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Attorney-General to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  issue  here  is,  the  other  party  have  a  fixed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mindset.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You have a fixed mindset! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- After being articulated by honourable Tabuya as to the need, how can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they understand because it is the women who are crying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- That is why we are, as the Government for the people and elected by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the people. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>out of ten.  The merits will be discussed on Friday.
