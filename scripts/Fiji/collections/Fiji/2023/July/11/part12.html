<h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3>
<div><span>SPEAKER’S RULING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Points of Order – Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, we saw a bit of fiery exchanges that occurred on the floor of  Parliament, and I 
<br/>intervened by stating that the Secretary-General will take note of those exchanges that happened on 
<br/>the floor.  For the information of honourable Members, a Point of Order pursuant to Standing Order 
<br/>62(4)  was  raised  yesterday  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance, 
<br/>Strategic Planning and National Development and Statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  whilst  the  Uncorrected  Hansard  Report  for  yesterday  has  not  been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>finalised, I can confirm that I have reviewed the relevant excerpts in question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, privilege is accorded to everyone in this august Parliament as a matter 
<br/>of right as stated by a few honourable Members just a while ago and that is pursuant to Standing 
<br/>Order 133, which states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Every Member, and any other person speaking in Parliament, has; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, subject to these Standing Orders.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, any honourable Member can say whatever they want in Parliament but what you 
<br/>say in Parliament is subject to the Standing Orders. The dignity and respect of this Parliament must 
<br/>at all times be upheld.  Honourable Members, it is pertinent to highlight that deliberately misleading 
<br/>Parliament is a very serious matter, and maybe viewed as contempt of Parliament.  There are three 
<br/>elements which must be established in order to show that a Member deliberately misled Parliament: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The statement must, in fact, have been misleading.   
<br/>The Member must have known at the time the statement made was incorrect.   
<br/>In making the statement, the Member must have intended to mislead Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The following extract from the Uncorrected </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> from honourable Parveen Bala 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>states, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, does nothing for the sugarcane farmers.  Who in 
<br/>the cane belt is  still asking, “What  happened to  the promise of $110 per  tonne by the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Parveen Bala continued as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “Mr. Speaker, Sir, I came from a cane belt area. No matter what he says, he can 
<br/>bark like a dog to anyone, but let me say this and I am going to put my point very clear 
<br/>to him, that it was him and his candidates, during the campaign, said to the farmers that 
<br/>they are going to give $110. At the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government, the 
<br/>media and the Sugar Industry Unions are silent on the suffering of the poor cane farmers.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Parveen Bala further stated: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The new scholarship system that replaced TELS, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a selling-out 
<br/>of  the  principle  for  equal  access  to  higher  education,  just  to  keep  a  badly  thought-out 
<br/>election  promise.  The  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  is  simply  keeping  his  job  by 
<br/>keeping these promises. In fact, he knows very well that the scheme such as TELS, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1181 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they may be, is the only way to have a system that provides the most accessible means to 
<br/>higher education for all the people of Fiji.  Its replacement is a system that many suffered 
<br/>under,  and  he  would  know  of  the  discrimination  faced  on  racial  grounds,  as  he  was  a 
<br/>student from the 1980s and 1990s”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In both statements, the honourable Parveen Bala did not provide proof or evidence.  In respect 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Standing Order 62(4) it states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It is out of order for a member, when speaking, to use - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>offensive words against Parliament or another member; 
<br/>(a) 
<br/>(b) 
<br/>treasonable words; 
<br/>(c)   seditious words; or 
<br/>(d)   words  that  are  likely  to  promote  or  provoke  feelings  of  ill-will  or  hostility  between 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities or ethnic groups within Fiji.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I indicated earlier, deliberately misleading Parliament is indeed a serious matter which can 
<br/>also be a contempt of Parliament. It is equally important to ensure that whilst speaking in Parliament 
<br/>one needs to be factually correct as the public is listening and we do not want to mislead the public 
<br/>or create any community or ethnic tensions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, allegations of bringing dishonour and disrepute to Parliament are very serious 
<br/>in nature which should not be taken lightly without proper factual foundation.  Examples of conducts 
<br/>can  be  categorised  as  bringing  dishonour  and  disrepute  to  Parliament  or  offensive  words  against 
<br/>Parliament  or  another  Member  include  statements  which  had  been  referred  to  the  Privileges 
<br/>Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, in light of the above, I hereby rule that the honourable Parveen Bala must provide 
<br/>proof that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance did say those actual words, the place 
<br/>he said it, when he said it, the date he said it, or he should withdraw both his statements on those 
<br/>issues before the Budget debates are completed on Thursday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023.  I further rule that in 
<br/>the event that these are not done, the matter will then be referred to the Privileges Committee for 
<br/>consideration.   
<br/></span></div>
