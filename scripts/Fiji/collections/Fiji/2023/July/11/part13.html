<h3>LIQUOR (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>LIQUOR (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 16/2023), be considered by Parliament without 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a standing committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Friday, 14th July, 2023 but that 
<br/></span><span>ample time be given to debate the Bill after the vote on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 
<br/></span><span>2023 and Consequential Bills with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving 
<br/>this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Liquor Act 2006 provides for, </span><span>inter alia</span><span>, the
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>1182 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regulation of liquor licensing and permitted hours for the sale of liquor and as generally had a direct 
<br/>link to the opening hours of various venues which sell liquor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Schedule to the Act, special zones are identified as areas in the city of Suva and 
<br/>township  of  Nadi.    In  recent  years  there  has  been  numerous  reports  regarding  brawls,  robberies, 
<br/>attacks during the early hours in Suva and Nadi and these also resulted in serious injuries and loss of 
<br/>lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023, it seeks to amend the Act to remove 
<br/>the special zones which provides for the sale of liquor for extended hours in taverns, restaurants and 
<br/>nightclubs in areas of Suva and Nadi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill must be considered urgently to address and assist he social issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>arising out long hours of night clubs and the subsequent for consumption of alcohol.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Criminal activity in the early hours of the morning of Suva and Nadi have also resulted in 
<br/>serious  injuries  or  loss  of  lives  and  therefore  we  need  to  look  at  one  of  the  solutions  to  assist  in 
<br/>advocating this problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honorable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. At 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity. I think the motion at 
<br/>the moment is that we will debate this using Standing Order 51. So, once again the word that I have 
<br/>used before in Parliament - flabbergasted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the honorable Turaga who is the Attorney-General was not a Member of the former 
<br/>Opposition and the honorable Member was not here at that time, but the Members of the Government 
<br/>time and time again, we continually say this. Why bring things through Standing Order 51? If this is 
<br/>an issue that is so important why not allow it to be debated through Committee and other means.  
<br/>That is my response to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is an issue that needs to be addressed, why do we have to rush it through this way 
<br/>because I think ultimately on Friday we will talk about the contents of this particular motion. But 
<br/>once again, why do we have to rush it? Why cannot be go through the normal processes where we 
<br/>can have a different view being aired and discussed on this particular issue. That is why I object to 
<br/>the idea of this being rushed through Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just quickly add to it and I agree with honorable 
<br/>Usamate.  In all fairness to all the nightclub owners and the tourists, et cetera, that frequent our bars 
<br/>and taverns post1.00 p.m. These special economic zones were created for a reason, so again I agree 
<br/>with the fact that you might want to do a consultative exercise with all the nightclub owners, et cetera, 
<br/>before you do this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is a considerable amount of revenue that is generated during those hours. I do 
<br/></span><span>not drink but I am sure those that drink will agree that there is quite a lot of money that is actually 
<br/></span><span>spent. So, there were specific reasons for those particular zones.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, that is something that we can argue on Friday but we do not see any reason being 
<br/>proferred by the honorable Attorney-General to say that there is an urgency because of x, y or z, say 
<br/>for in a Bill itself saying that there has been incidents of brawls, robberies and attacks. How does that 
<br/>become attributable to the nightclub opening hours, no one knows. So, the use of Standing Order 51, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1183 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we are the ones who did it, we agree. We can use Standing Order 51 sometimes.  Who has an urgency, 
<br/>honorable Attorney-General.  Why is it going through this particular process?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  your  own  words  have  you  gone  through  this  consultative  exercise  with  respect  to  the 
<br/>nightclub  owners.    I  do  not  think  so.  Why  not  allow  the  Committees  to  canvas  it  properly, 
<br/>independently instead of knee-jerk reacting out of something because that particular provision that 
<br/>was made, was done for a very important reason.  Ask the officers at that Ministry for Finance they 
<br/>will tell you.  Mr. Speaker, I do not think the use of Standing Order 51 for this particular amendment 
<br/>to the Act is quite appropriate at this time, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Just a quick contribution on this one. I am sure the honorable 
<br/>Attorney-General  will  speak  about  the  consultation  that  we  had.  I  take  the  point  that  ideally,  we 
<br/>would  like  any  Bill  which  is  not  consequential  to  go  through  appropriate  Committees  and 
<br/>consultation.  Honorable Usamate is right, we always argued that non-urgent Bills ought to come 
<br/>through, even if it takes one session of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this one, we had quite a bit of extensive consultation. I take honorable Koya’s point that 
<br/>the Committee is probably the right forum to do that. This is really not a substantive Bill in that sense.  
<br/>A lot of consultation was done with the nightclub owners and communities generally. Since we came 
<br/>into Government, a lot of representations have been made to us through consultations that I had.  It 
<br/>is a catch-22, I know what you are saying but generally the substance will debate, but generally we 
<br/>thought that this is an urgent Bill that we should go through it, so have two or three days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, your Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were wide consultations. They were held at 
<br/>the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-General,  Level  9.  Public  consultations  were  also  held  in  Suva  where 
<br/>members of the public were invited to come and submit, attend or send in their submissions. Also, in 
<br/>Labasa, Nadi, Lautoka, Beqa, Vanua Levu, Lomaiviti and the Central Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  beginning  we  said  we  will  be  a  Government  that  will  listen  and 
<br/>consult.  This  went  through  Cabinet,  Cabinet  endorsed  it  for  consultation  then  we  went  for 
<br/>consultation. It came back to Cabinet, now we endorse. We care what was going on. We see what is 
<br/>going on.  As a responsible Government, we have taken the lead.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As to the honourable Usamate and honourable Koya, on Friday I will give a litany of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that were tabled that were not consequential. I do not know why you find it offensive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Votes cast: 
<br/>-  28 
<br/>Ayes 
<br/>Noes 
<br/>-  17 
<br/>Not voted  -   8 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- At this juncture, I intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea and when 
<br/>we will resume when the bell is sounded, I will once again offer the floor to the honorable Attorney-
<br/>General for his other motion.   The Parliament is adjourned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 11.17 a.m.
