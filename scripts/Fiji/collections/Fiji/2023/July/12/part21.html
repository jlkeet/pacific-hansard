<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- $346,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, mine is on ACCF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sorry, it is a decrease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is an increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, a decrease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is an increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.-  Mr. Chairman, mine is  on ACCF.  Just  a concern, maybe the 
<br/>honourable Minister responsible can explain this.  I believe ACCF is still operating from that old

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>warehouse at Valelevu in the LTA compound, if I am correct.  The question is, that is a very busy 
<br/>place and we know what kind of work they are doing right now.  Is there a plan to get the team over 
<br/>somewhere that can be more central and easier for people to access? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I will certainly look into it.  I was concerned when I was told that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they operate from a small room at Valelevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, one of the issues that we have is related to the issue 
<br/>that was raised by the honourable Premila.  In some sectors at the moment, we have the issue of 
<br/>providers being regulators, for instance, in the electricity field, the provider is the regulator.  Ideally, 
<br/>we would have an ideal situation where the Government does policy, you have a regulator and then 
<br/>you have providers.  This is one of the issues that you find when you are trying to get companies to 
<br/>bring in solar energy, renewable energy, they have the problem of negotiating with the providers and 
<br/>also the regulator.  So, there is obviously a need to strengthen that technical component of FCCC.  I 
<br/>am just wondering under this budget, does that include the strengthening of the technical component 
<br/>within FCCC so you can separate this provider and regulator role that currently EFL plays?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  should  have  been  done  a  long  time  back,  but  that  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something that we will do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is in the question whether that is included in this increase?  That is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is part of the review that will happen at FCCC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So, it is not included yet? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What do you mean not included yet? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The separation of those roles.  Out of EFL, to be plugged here.  Does 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this budget it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- First we will do a review and see. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is not yet there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, it is not yet there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  just  in  regards  to  the  allocation  made  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>Independent  Commission  Against  Corruption.    I  have  noted  that  there  has  been  a  decrease  of 
<br/>$400,000.  Can I seek clarification from the honourable Minister the reason for the decrease?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You want to know why there is a decrease?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- A decrease of $400,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You want an increase?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Just seeking clarification on why the decrease. Have you narrowed down the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operations in terms of human resources? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1427 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, there are lot of factors that we take into account. The net 
<br/>decrease is due to the reduction in operational expenditures, travel and accommodation, training and, 
<br/>of course, all those components.  If there is a reduction, $400,000 reduction is fine, FICAC is happy 
<br/>with that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 13 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 14 – Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Programme-1-1(9), under SEG 9, there is a fund there to buy boulders.  
<br/>Is that related to the prisons ($250,000) for boulders. Can we just have some need clarification on 
<br/>that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The replacement at Nasinu, fencing of the boundary area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.

<div><span>Head 14 agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 15 – Ministry of Justice  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 15 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 17 – Ministry of Civil Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I have a query, Programme 2-1(8), the Renovation and Maintenance 
<br/>of Government Quarters and Public Buildings. I would just like a clarification if this included the 
<br/>Government quarters in Vunisea, Kadavu?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Specific renovation, all allocations have been transferred to 
<br/>Head 50. Essentially what we are trying to do is to make sure that, all Government quarters are in 
<br/>such a bad state. Some of them are almost not liveable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My question was if the cottage in Vunisea in Kadavu are included in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this $3 million allocation?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They would be, but I can check on the specific one. I do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have the details. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I will appreciate if you get that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I have a further question on that because hearing 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Minister and most of the Ministers during their Budget response, they have also been 
<br/>allocated  through  the  Asset  Management  Units  in  their  respective  Ministries  allocation  on 
<br/>renovations.  Before we used to have institutional quarters and its all now known as Government 
<br/>quarters and Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) has been shifted to PSC as well.  How does 
<br/>this link up with Asset Management Unit (AMU) in the respective Ministries? What will they be 
<br/>responsible for and the demarcation of responsibility.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I can add first, Honourable Usamate, Vunisea included. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, CIU is essentially disbanded now. What we found out is that as a result of 
<br/>how  it  was  managed,  a  lot  of  things  were  not  happening.  There  was  a  lot  of  wastage  and 
<br/>mismanagement. Some things are still being looked into. That function will now be with the Civil 
<br/>Service and the Public Works Department will be involved. They are already starting to do a lot work 
<br/>in  terms  of scope, et  cetera.  The different  ministries, their Asset  Management Units will also  be 
<br/>strengthened. Right now, everything is to go to CIU. It was set up as a temporary thing after  </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston</span><span>, but it took a more permanent structure and most ministries had to rely on the efficiency and 
<br/>the effectiveness of CIU and it was not happening. So, this transition will take a while, but it will 
<br/>become more efficient, in my view.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You have duplication of these services. You bloat your operational 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenditure.  When you centralise it, you have a smaller unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not necessary, if it is manageable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is the other side of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, perhaps a final question from me because one is 
<br/>Office and Accommodation and then you have buildings and quarters.  This is the question that I 
<br/>want to raise because most of the quarters need a lot of repairs as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Essentially, the Strategic Planning Office will coordinate the 
<br/>AMU in different ministries and make sure that the work is done.  The Ministry of Works will be 
<br/>part of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Last question, Sir.  On that SEG on the rent for all UN Officers of 
<br/>$3.315 million.  We know that there are issues with that particular building at the moment.   There 
<br/>was an intent to build a building for the UN, I am just wondering if that is still in the pipeline of the 
<br/>planning of current Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is still in the pipeline but, Mr. Chairman, if I can add to the 
<br/>honourable  Seruiratu’s  earlier  question.    In  fact,  CIU  was  a  kind  of  an  operation  where  lead 
<br/>consultants  used  to  make  millions  of  dollars  and  it  was  operated  in  a  way  that  whom  you  knew.  
<br/>Increasingly, we are finding out, so that is why we have taken this decision immediately to disband 
<br/>CIU and move these functions to PSC which is under the honourable Prime Minister, and we feel 
<br/>that from there, things will fall into place.  The National and Strategic Planning office working with 
<br/>AMU and Public Works Department would create better efficiency and value for money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 17 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 18 – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(8)    Retention  Payment  – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Namarai Government Station.  What is the progress, Mr. Chairman?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Retention  payments  for  the  Government  Stations  at  Namara  and 
<br/>Wainikoro for their construction has been completed.  Retentions are due to be paid in the 2023 – 
<br/>2024 financial year.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1429 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman on Programme 1-1(8), I just need a clarification from the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister.  The upgrade and renovation of existing Government Quarters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Nath, we are into Programme 2-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I did switch on, you missed out, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have moved on. Sorry about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You can ask him privately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just a clarification on Programme 3-1(10) - Seafaring Entrepreneur 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistance Subsidy.  What in particular is this and how is it going be spent? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  It  is  a  new  expenditure  allocation.    It  is  allocated  to  subsidise  the 
<br/>purchase of fully  equipped and operational  fibreglass boats  for Fijians living  in the most isolated 
<br/>coastal  areas  of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu and maritime islands.  The initiative known as Seafaring 
<br/>Entrepreneurs Assistance furthers our longstanding commitment to the self-starting culture in our 
<br/>maritime  communities.    Eligible  applicants  will  have  to  provide  contributions  under  the  Subsidy 
<br/>Assistance; the one third, two-thirds component. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It used to be with Ministry of Economy before? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Yes, it used to be with Ministry of Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And the Grant for Self-Help Projects, is that also under one-third, two-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thirds basis? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- In what SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Same SEG - $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.-  No change.  It is to promote and encourage communities initiating 
<br/>development over their own social-economic projects in partnership with Government.  It is one-
<br/>third, two-thirds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr.  Chairman, still on on SEG 10  -  Rural  High Risk  Water Sanitation 
<br/>Project.  Can the honourable Minister elaborate more on that $800,000 and how many projects so far 
<br/>we have successfully completed in the red zone area in the last six months? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- It was provided with $800,000 in this financial year 2022–2023 given 
<br/>that the case of water related diseases such as Typhoid, Leptospirosis and Dengue Fever (LTD) has 
<br/>been on the rise recently.  In the 2023-2024 Financial Year, the Ministry is focusing on construction, 
<br/>installation  of  26  Ecological  Purification  Systems  with  the  duration  of  six  months  and  the 
<br/>construction of 131 sanitation structures on identified high risk areas where sanitation is below par. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As far as what has been completed, I can come back to you on that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman,  how many Ecological Purification Systems (EPS) are you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>looking forward to for this year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Sir, 26 Ecological Purification Systems is what we look to complete

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, will it stay with you or you are intending to give it to PWD 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or Water Authority of Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- No, it is part of the Rural and Maritime Development works.  It is part 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of our Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I believe it will stay with you because prior to this, it was transferred to 
<br/>Water Authority of Fiji.  They were the main organisation doing this project.  So you want to say 
<br/>from this year, it will  be under you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Yes, we have been doing it so far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 3-2(10) -  
<br/>Rural and Outer Island Programme.  If you can kindly elaborate more on this particular programme.  
<br/>Is it alternative livelihood, what is it all about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, the Ministry will work with relevant stakeholders to 
<br/>construct related infrastructures in the rural space.  For example, construction of collection centres, 
<br/>storage facilities for agriculture and fisheries produce, waiting sheds for rural commuters.  It will also 
<br/>include  improving  livelihoods,  facilitate  trade,  improve  transportation  and  expand  agriculture 
<br/>commodities through the provision of machinery to quicken agricultural development.  This will all 
<br/>be funded under the Rural and Outer Island Programme and I believe there was discussion also on 
<br/>helping with the Ministry of Fisheries with the blast freezers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I think this is the allocation for NDMO, if I am not 
<br/>mistaken.  We know that we have been talking about El Nino in the current system, so the importance 
<br/>of  flood  earlier  warnings.    We  know  the  biggest  disaster  that  always  affects  our  country  is  not 
<br/>cyclones but floods.  The maintenance of flood early warning systems.  Is this separate from the one 
<br/>that  is  done  by  the  Fiji  Meteorological  Service  or  is  this  something  else  over  and  above  the 
<br/>Hydrological Unit at the Fiji Meteorological Service and what they do or is it just a linkage back to 
<br/>that particular system?  I can see it is only $10,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Which SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Programme 4-1(5) - Maintenance of Flood Early Warning System. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- It is due to land activity anticipated to be carried out in this financial 
<br/>year.  It is just the maintenance of early flood warning systems, related activities include also site 
<br/>visits,  GIS,  tool  mapping,  conducting  standard  checks  on  water  level  installations,  undertaking 
<br/>evacuation drill procedures, exercise and revisiting municipality evacuation plans and preparedness 
<br/>plans.  I think it is something that we co-operate with the Fiji Meteorological Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So, that will be your river gauges?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Yes, river gauges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Programme  5-1(10)  on  Rural  Housing  Assistance.    Any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clarification and what are the criteria? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1431 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- It has been allocated to provide affordable and resilient housing for 
<br/>rural dwellers, again the one-third and two-thirds applicant’s contribution, four schemes altogether.  
<br/>Scheme  1  is  assistance  in  transportation  of  materials  to  the  maritime  islands.    Scheme  2  is  the 
<br/>purchase of housing materials on one-third and two-thirds basis.  Scheme 3 is the procurement of 
<br/>partial house or housing materials.  Those who have timber and in-kind materials can use that as their 
<br/>one-third.  Scheme 4 is the assistance to support the Vatukoula Scheme which is an initiative started 
<br/>by the FijiFirst Government but not implemented up to-date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable P.K. Bala interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. DITOKA.- No, no just facts.  The programme was previously allocated under the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Housing  but  it  is  now  administered  under  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development and Disaster Management.  It is a creation of a new programme and activity so we have 
<br/>to  establish  the  new  unit  and  it  is  going  to  be  manned  by  seven  staff  to  manage  the  entire 
<br/>implementation and monitoring of the Rural Housing Programme with the intention of construction 
<br/>of 50 houses under Schemes 2, 3 and 4 planned for 2023-2024.  We are also discussing co-operation 
<br/>with Nadave, as well as the RFMF Rural Development Engineering Unit to assist us with that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, if you may, can you elaborate further on Scheme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4 which you think was not good enough.  It was not fully implemented, you can elaborate…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I think there are only nine people left for their homes to be constructed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, for those ones, once we construct, then Scheme 4 will be completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I just wanted to highlight when we took over the Ministry of Housing, 
<br/>one  thing  they  did  not  have  was  a  cyclone  category  5  certified  housing  plan  and  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Housing has done that.  They have done a category 5 certified housing plan.  Previously, they had a 
<br/>housing plan and it looked really odd where you have a house with a step and a person sitting on a 
<br/>wheelchair with a step.  It just did not look right, and it was not done by the architects and engineers. 
<br/>Everything was done, even the materials was worked out, like how much it will cost to build that 
<br/>house, whether you want two bedrooms, three bedrooms and that whole thing was available for free, 
<br/>no one had to pay anything. It was just a one-time cost.  I thought I will just highlight that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, I believe we have worked on that as well.  We have 
<br/>worked  with  the  Government  engineers  from  PWD,  we  also  worked  with  other  stakeholders  in 
<br/>designing  these  rural  housing  unit  houses  and  I  believe  that  they  are  category  5  strength  at  the 
<br/>moment. We are also making sure that there is easy access for the disabled.  I think those were all 
<br/>lessons learnt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- It is along that line as well, honourable Minister.  Through you, 
<br/>Mr. Chairman Sir, which design are we going to take now because previously it was the 24 feet x 16 
<br/>feet.  The Koroipita model is the one that the Minister is referring to so which one are we going to 
<br/>take because we need to advice our people as well in terms of the cost so that they can provide their 
<br/>one-third.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.-  Yes, the 24 feet x 16 feet is the one that is going to be made available 
<br/></span><span>and also the plans will be made available on our websites.  We will also be offering them on all our 
<br/>social media platforms so that they can be easily downloaded and also all our offices are available 
<br/>for advice if anyone wants to seek advice.  The prices and the quotations will also be made available 
<br/>for them there. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 18 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 19 – Republic of Fiji Military Forces: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I had a question for Activity 1(7) and I will be 
<br/>dealing with Head 19 on our behalf.  It should be fast.  Review of Military Act ($50,000), I am just 
<br/>trying  to  clarify  honourable  Minister,  is  this  review  on  top  of  the  review  that  the  New  Zealand 
<br/>Defence Force were doing for RFMF or is this a separate one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, that work has actually been completed.  It is 
<br/>coming through the Government system through the Solicitor-General’s Office.  It is now on my 
<br/>desk, but we want to do it after the process of the Defence Review so its holistic.  Once the changes 
<br/>are done, we can review it.  So, that fund is allocated for it in case there are major changes like for 
<br/>consultations and other matters but definitely the work with the New Zealanders has already been 
<br/>completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  next  one  is  still  on  SEG  7  -    Annual  Asia 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific Chiefs of Defence Conference.  I take it this is the hosting team of the conference? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  That  is  correct.  The  Commander  is  co-hosting  with  US  Indo-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific Commander and it will be held in Denarau. That is our contribution to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- There is no further question on Activity 1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  1-5(1),  just  a  clarification  for  the  Navy,  there  is  a 
<br/>decrease.  Is there a decrease in the number of people who are serving in the Navy? Why the decrease, 
<br/>can I get that clarification, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  No,  honourable  Member,  through  you  Mr.  Chairman.    This 
<br/>$6,647,514 is just for the established strength of the Fiji Naval Divisional at 418. It is a bit of a funny 
<br/>situation this one because it appears that certain establishments that were already running that have 
<br/>yet to be funded which just came up through Cabinet, particularly through Maritime Essential Service 
<br/>Centre (MESC).  The agreement here that they would source from within to start the process and 
<br/>then we would review it.  That is part of the reason why we have continued with the $6,647,514 to 
<br/>cater for the current establishment of the Navy right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, $9 million?  Head 19-1-5(1), the total for SEG 1 is 
<br/>$9,746.7 million, in 2022 it was $10,670.7 million, there is a decrease of almost a million dollars and 
<br/>I am taking that because this is SEG 1, that this is a decreased in the number of people in the Fiji 
<br/>Navy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I apologise, I lost you there, honourable Member.  So, you are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talking about the reduction of $923.9 million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Professor B.C. Prasad interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- It is in SEG 1.  If you look at the Established Staff, the total for SEG 
<br/>1  for  Established  Staff  has  dropped  from  $10  million  last  year  to  $9,746.7  million.      I  seek 
<br/>clarification as to whether that indicates that there is a decrease in the number of people that you are 
<br/>employing in the Navy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Sorry, let me just get my notes in order.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1433 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Minister, if I can answer that?  It was a one-off 
<br/>expenditure because the additional was funded through redeployment, so it was basically zero in this 
<br/>budget.  It was used in the current budget.  You get that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Sorry, no. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was a one-off expenditure.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- For SEG 1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- For SEG 1 because there was an additional requirement which 
<br/>was funded from redeployment so that was covered in this Budget.  When it came to this Budget, we 
<br/>went back to the original.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Sorry, I still cannot work it out if it is Established Staff, you are talking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We were told that they do not need this funding for next year, 
<br/>that is why we considered it as a one-off expenditure.  This is from the Military itself.  We were told 
<br/>that that additional $10,143.11 million was not needed for this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- That is people’s pay you are talking about.  You mean, if they do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>need money to pay people this year that means.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- No, it was an additional expenditure that was required in this 
<br/>Budget which was redeployed and paid, but now it is part of the regularised budget so that amount is 
<br/>no longer there.  It is not a decrease in the number of staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is 418 and everyone is adequately paid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- It was a one-off adjustment so that is why they needed that this 
<br/>year.  That was provided through redeployment but in this Budget, they will not need that.  That is 
<br/>why we went back to the original. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Alright,  maybe  you  confirm  that  the  number  of  people  who  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>employed in the Navy is still the same? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, there is no reduction in staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I have a general question because I have been looking for the increase 
<br/>for the engineers because in the Budget announcement you said there is an increase in the engineers.  
<br/>However, you look at all those, even in the engineers, it does not reflect an increase in the number of 
<br/>people. So how many are your recruiting for engineers in this budget given that it was announced? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, 60 - this is for the re-establishment of the TTS, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- The 60, you mean the TTS, not engineers to go into the regular force? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, this is a new one-off.  Remember TTS was gone.  So now 
<br/>we have re-established the school to teach it again; that was the request that they made.   So we have 
<br/>added on 60 people as part of that. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- So the 60 people that you are adding on to the engineers are going to 
<br/>be brought in, trained through the TTS system and the TTS system pushes them out again.  They are 
<br/>not employed, that is the way TTS works.  If they come, do the TTS training and they go back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, these people will actually be taken on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- So they get absorbed into …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, yes it increases the strength of the regiment by 60. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- So, 60 is the total increase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, that is correct.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on Head 19 – Republic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Fiji Military Forces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 19 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 20 – Fiji Police Force: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-2(6)  – INTERPOL. Can I request honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister to elaborate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, INTERPOL are one of our partners.  This is to 
<br/>facilitate the organisation registration fees to international enforcement agencies such as INTERPOL, 
<br/>International Proliferation Program (ICP) and Melanesia Spearhead Group (MSG) to allow smoother 
<br/>security networking.  So this is what this amount is required for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, FFIU do  present to the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/>Affairs  and  when  the  Director  came,  he  had  a  lot  of  good  items  with  him,  in  fact,  linking  with 
<br/>INTERPOL.  As  you  know,  over  the  year  it  is  beyond  our  control  and  beyond  anyone’s  control, 
<br/>having drug washed up to our shores.  What I suggest that we should increase it to $100,000 so that 
<br/>we can train our officers especially, proper training given by INTERPOL on tackling these issues.  
<br/>The inter zone officers  we have  can be trained  properly so that they  can tackle this drug issue.  I 
<br/>suggest an increase and I have given a submission, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  is  only  for  subscription  budget.  Our  contribution  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>different, it it is specifically for subscription. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, Programme 1-1(9) - Installation of CCTV Camera 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>($700,000). I am assuming someone did not get their England right or is it one camera? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, there many cameras. At CPS and in the other stations we 
<br/></span><span>have controls where we have CCTVs everywhere, essentially throughout the city, through the major 
<br/>centres from Nasinu to Nausori. We have not quite covered all those areas that we want to look at. 
<br/>This is primarily to cover those areas, so we have better visibility of what is happening. That is where 
<br/>the money is going. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- There is more than one camera? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1435 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, definitely.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister  of  Finance,  I  think  you  need  to  get  your  proof 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>readers right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I have got two questions. One is still on CCTV camera. 
<br/>I can see the amount shown here is just around $700,000. Iny my view it is not sufficient because 
<br/>really, we need to have lot more CCTV cameras around.  Just now I got a news on my phone that 
<br/>Eden Restaurant got robbed as we are seated here.  So, it is very worrying, and that particular street 
<br/>is always safe. To hear all these things happening, I would like to suggest while I appreciate SEG 7 
<br/>where you have Police Beat Patrol which means if I understand properly, is it foot patrol?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, a bit of work that I had done when I was with municipal councils 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it was to do with CCTV camera, why London is safe?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>London is safe because they have got almost 22 million CCTV cameras on the streets which 
<br/>makes people feel safe and they go out at night.  Police Beat Patrol, yes, it is hit and miss.  You are 
<br/>walking in the streets, yes, of course it is needed but having a camera and probably working with 
<br/>municipal councils so that they invest in the cities as well, that will help the Police and people will 
<br/>be safe. So, that is just my suggestion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, that is the ideal situation we would like to have eyes 
<br/>everywhere. To cover like the gaps, there are hundreds of cameras there already.  This is really to 
<br/>cover the other areas where we actually cannot see. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- There is none. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Now for the Police Beat Patrol,  we were just talking about it 
<br/>today, how to integrate the best effects on presence on the ground and actually people knowing that 
<br/>they are on camera. Cameras are good. It develops a consciousness in people to realise someone is 
<br/>watching them then it is good, but it is not going to stop them also from doing something because 
<br/>then we have to react to investigate after that.  But Police on the ground is actually quite different 
<br/>because when it is there, people know it is there.  We show our presence, Sir, whether we are working, 
<br/>on horse or on back of a vehicle.  That is why we have allocated this.  It is important that the people 
<br/>actually see it. So, you should see a bit more …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, of course at a later stage we would like to know a little 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bit more about how effective this particular programme is in terms of the crime rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, absolutely, I think we capturing it.  The reason why we have 
<br/>done this because in these dark areas are our most vulnerable spots and where people are vulnerable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 1-1(7).  I request a clarification 
<br/></span><span>from the honourable Minister. I have noted there is a new item under Police Beat Patrol, the sum of 
<br/></span><span>about $700,000. There are two parts to my questions - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>what does this entail as this is the first time, I have seen it; and 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>whether that element of Community Policing, you spoke about it in your response to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget, where is that covered in this Budget? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember, it used to be the core of our engagement with the community under the Duavata 
<br/>Community Policing. I have not seen anything on it on this one here and I feel it is an important part 
<br/>of addressing some of these challenges the Police are facing right now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, through you I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>that question. Obviously the Duavata is the current framework on how the Fiji Police Force relates 
<br/>to the community in the work that they do.  Apparently, in the brief that I have received, the context 
<br/>of the Duavata Policing covers in parts certain areas that may be a wider context of the community 
<br/>policing which could still be developed a little bit further, which is integrated really into the work 
<br/>that the Police do both in the rural and also in the urban areas.  It is that concept that we would like 
<br/>to  develop  a  little  bit  further,  based  on  the  current  context  of  the  Duavata  partnership  which  is 
<br/>developed by Doctor Eci Nabalarua and other people from USP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other experts in the Police have also told us that it has its own limitations, but we need to 
<br/>push this out a little bit further and I agree with you that that is very important; to be pro-active, to 
<br/>go out to the community, to reach out, to prevent rather than to cure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Police Beat ($700,000) will actually allow us to increase our presence and also with the 
<br/>use of Duavata use this to get out into communities and talk to them (both rural and also urban areas). 
<br/>It  will be quite helpful  in that regard.  We are just  talking  over the concept  because this is  a new 
<br/>allocation,  increasing  Police  presence  in  the  community  because  that  has  been  the  gist  of  the 
<br/>complaints.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Can  I  ask  another  follow-up  question,  Mr.  Chairman?  In  the 
<br/>Budget proposal that has been presented, honourable Minister, I have noted there are investments in 
<br/>technology and equipment.  Does this include the body camera or there are plans to introduce that 
<br/>later?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.-  Yes, that  is  part of the plan, honourable Member. Specialised 
<br/>equipment that the Police will now need as part of this, perhaps the international requirement about 
<br/>arrest, et cetera.  We are only acquiring for units as we go, part of it also with PSRU specialised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know, the handling of evidence is quite a complex process so a trial within a trial in 
<br/>terms of how people complain that they have been mishandled by Police.  As you know, during your 
<br/>honourable Member, now we have cameras inside interviewing rooms. Now the Police cannot really 
<br/>do the things they used to do before if they cannot get through to an accused person because it is fully 
<br/>recorded.  Likewise, cameras on their vests, which is something that we are trying to do to increase 
<br/>transparency, accountability of the Force and, of course, the relationship with the people which is 
<br/>really to abide by the law and not do extra legal stuff.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is in relation to SEGs 1 and 7.  In SEG 1 
<br/>there is CID Allowance of $50, 200 and then SEG 7 states CID Expenses.  What is the difference 
<br/>between the two? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Programme 1-2, you said CID? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, CID. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- And the question is CID Allowance?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- And CID Expenses.
