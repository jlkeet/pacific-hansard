<h3>REVIEW OF THE STANDING ORDERS -PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW OF THE STANDING ORDERS - 
<br/>PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the amendments recommended by the Standing Orders Committee in the review 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Standing Orders of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji be adopted by Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you 
<br/>for  giving  me  this  opportunity  to  debate  the  amendments  recommended  by  the  Standing  Orders 
<br/>Committee in the review of the Standing Orders of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji.  I had 
<br/>tabled  the  Report  of  the  Standing  Orders  Committee  on  30</span><span>th</span><span>  June,  2023  after  the  Budget 
<br/>announcement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as I had alluded to when I tabled the Report of the Standing Orders Committee, 
<br/>I had mentioned that the Committee met on three separate occasions. Firstly, on 1</span><span>st</span><span> March, secondly 
<br/>on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May and finally on 5</span><span>th</span><span> June respectively to discuss the amendments to the Standing Orders.  
<br/>There  were  amendments  proposed  by  representatives  of  three  parties  that  are  represented  in 
<br/>Parliament namely the People’s Alliance Party, National Federation Party and the Social Democratic 
<br/>Liberal Party.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you had addressed in Parliament before, I tabled the Report that it was unfortunate that 
<br/>the FijiFirst Party’s proposed amendments were not included due to a misunderstanding in the mode 
<br/>it  was  received  by  the  Secretariat.    However,  as  you  had  mentioned,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  another 
<br/>meeting will be held after the Budget this week to allow their proposed amendments to be deliberated 
<br/>at the next Standing Orders Committee meeting.  At this juncture, I convey my appreciation on the 
<br/>extensive  deliberations  and  work  undertaken  by  the  Standing  Orders  Committee.    I  seek  the 
<br/>honourable Members’ support for the motion this morning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in its meeting on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May, the Committee agreed to allow the Secretariat to 
<br/>finalise the verbatim notes, minutes of the meetings and drafts of the amended Standing Orders as 
<br/>well as the Committee Report.  Subsequently these documents were then conveyed to the Committee 
<br/>Members for their perusal, comments and finalisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the proposed amendments to the Standing Orders, Mr. Speaker, the proposed amendments 
<br/>to  the  Standing  Orders  which  had  been  circulated  to  all  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  are 
<br/>necessary  because  they  impact  the  way  Parliament  conducts  itself.  These  proposed  amendments 
<br/>relate to the performance, functions and the working of Parliament.  In considering and reviewing 
<br/>the practices and procedures of Parliament, the proposed amendments which the Committee agreed 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Standing Orders – Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1295 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to are hereby presented to Parliament as mandated by Standing Order 128 which all Members have 
<br/>received a copy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will now proceed to the proposed amendments starting with the provisions 
<br/>relating to the voting procedures for the election of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>Speaker,  Deputy  Speaker  and  the  President.  These  are  Standing  Orders  13,  14,  17,  19  and  136 
<br/>respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first set of proposed amendments intends to remove the secret ballot voting procedure 
<br/>for election of the mentioned officers and replaces it with the roll-call voting procedure.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>the roll-call voting is consistent with the Constitution and ensures accountability and transparency as 
<br/>each Party represented in Parliament would be able to know how each Member voted.  Roll-call also 
<br/>caters for cases of false or glitches in the Electronic Voting System that we have here in Parliament, 
<br/>Sir, whereby there is a need to have other options available.  That is the first set of amendments, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next  set  of amendments  are relating  to  the use of vernacular languages in  Parliament 
<br/>mainly  the  </span><span>Vosa  Vaka-Viti</span><span>  and  </span><span>Hindi</span><span>  languages.  The  relevant  Standing  Orders  to  which  these 
<br/>proposed amendments relate to include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 28 whereby a Member of Parliament may speak in the English</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Vosa Vaka-
<br/>Viti</span><span> or </span><span>Hindi</span><span> language and that interpretation of these are provided. 
<br/>Standing  Order  29  whereby  there  is  a  reference  to  an  exception  to  the  rule  regarding 
<br/>documents in Parliament being in </span><span>English</span><span>. This exception is captured in an amendment to 
<br/>Standing Order 37 which provides that petitions to Parliament by members of the public 
<br/>may be in English, </span><span>Vosa Vaka-Viti</span><span> or </span><span>Hindi</span><span> language provided that if it is in </span><span>Vosa Vaka-
<br/>Viti</span><span> or </span><span>Hindi</span><span> language that an English translation should also be provided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Sir, Standing Order 32 which is amended as a consequence of amending Standing 
<br/>Order 28. This amendment will provide that speeches in </span><span>Vosa Vaka-Viti</span><span> or </span><span>Hindi</span><span> languages will be 
<br/>captured in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> with its English translation also attached. This will ensure consistency 
<br/>in the Standing Orders namely those that related to the </span><span>Daily Hansard.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next amendment is on Standing Order 30 which relates to the choice that is given to the 
<br/>Speaker of Parliament or a Member that will be presiding as Speaker whether to recite the prayer 
<br/>provided in opening prayer that will be recited when starting each sitting day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the next amendment is on Standing Order 34 which relates to the Order of 
<br/>Business  of  a  sitting  day.    After  discussions  amongst  the  Committee  Members  representing  all 
<br/>members in this Parliament, we believe that the Order of Business is to be amended so that questions 
<br/>are  considered  earlier  on  in  a  sitting  day  and  giving  prominence  in  the  Order  of  Business  of 
<br/>Parliament, thus the reason for the proposed amendment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the remaining amendments are considered equally as important as those that 
<br/>I have mentioned.  And the first of which relates to the general voting procedures in Parliament as 
<br/></span><span>provided under Standing Order 54.  The amendment here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, looks to again cater for 
<br/></span><span>the  possibility  of  their  being  false  and  glitches  in  the  electronic  voting  system  whereby  we  have 
<br/>agreed to provide another option such as having votes cast through acclamation.  But these options 
<br/>will be at the discretion of the honourable Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next amendment is on the maintenance of order and decorum as per Standing Order 75 
<br/>and Standing Order 76 whereby the amendment seek to fortify and provide a clear guidance for the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review of the Standing Orders – Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>processes and avenues available to the Speaker when maintaining order and decorum of Parliament 
<br/>during a sitting day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also a proposed amendment to Standing Order 111 which relates to 
<br/>the  functions  of  the  Standing  Committees  specifically  on  the  function  of  making  inquiries  and 
<br/>investigating  into  certain  matters  within  its  mandate.    We  believe  that  this  function  needs  to  be 
<br/>fortified with additional checks so as to ensure that any matter intended to be investigated by such 
<br/>Standing Committees, adheres to certain guidelines that are within the jurisdiction of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second last amendment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, deals with Standing Order 121, Presentation 
<br/>of Standing Committee Reports whereby the amendment proposes to minimise the time given to the 
<br/>Minister responsible for the government department affected by the report from 60 days to 21 days 
<br/>to submit a response to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and Members of Parliament, the last amendment is on Standing 
<br/>Order 124   It relates to the decisions of the Business Committee whereby the amendment proposes 
<br/>to provide the Business Committee decision making functions that ensure the proper functioning of 
<br/>the proceeding of Parliament during a sitting week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion by convention, the report of the Standing Orders Committee 
<br/>is a functional document.  The recommended amendments are reflected in annexure 1 of the Report 
<br/>and the minutes of the proceedings of the Committee are reflected in annexure 2 of the Report. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir,  as alluded  to  earlier,  I convey appreciation  on the  extensive deliberations and work 
<br/>undertaken  by  the  Standing  Orders  Committee.    I  thank  the  Members  of  the  Standing  Orders 
<br/>Committee from both sides of Parliament, and I hereby commend these amendments to Parliament 
<br/>and seek your support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  allowing  me  to  speak  on  the 
<br/>Standing Order Report, basically the Review Report of the Standing Orders of the Parliament of the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji.  I, as a member of this Committee, would like to thank each and every one who had 
<br/>participated as member during the deliberation and as you might see, my signature is missing from 
<br/>this Report, but nevertheless, Opposition did participate and the only reason why my signature is 
<br/>missing is due to unforeseen circumstances that our submission was not presented and we took  a 
<br/>principle decision to wait for your decision and ruling on what is going to transpire with regards to 
<br/>our submission that was given to the Secretariat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a couple of amendments with regards to this Report that I would like to highlight.  
<br/>Firstly, Business Committee Rulings is going to be recorded.  We agreed to this.  We also agreed that 
<br/>the response from the Ministers is now 21 days instead of 60 days, so we look forward to getting 
<br/>those responses from the Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once we get to that stage where we will be discussing some of the amendments proposed by 
<br/>the Opposition, most of these are practical scenarios that we have faced for the last two terms and 
<br/></span><span>this was one of them whereby once the Committee presents a report, we never used to get response 
<br/></span><span>on time and at times our recommendations.  A lot of work was hindered in its scrutinising annual 
<br/>reports especially for the Public Accounts Committee where they scrutinise audit reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of languages, </span><span>Vosa Vaka-Viti</span><span> and  Hindi</span><span> </span><span>languages, I 
<br/>believe this was a ruling made in the Business Committee.  As Opposition, we took a principle stand 
<br/>then, and we objected to it.  At that point in time, we did say that it should go through the Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Standing Orders – Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1297 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Order Committee for a review, and we still take that principle stand from Opposition that we believe 
<br/>the official language in this Parliament should remain as English.  It is a policy decision.  Now that 
<br/>it has come through the Standing Order Committee as we debated back then that it should not be the 
<br/>Business Committee but the Standing Order Committee which should make a decision on whether 
<br/>other languages should be allowed in Parliament or not.  Now, that is being done and it is here for us 
<br/>to debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Red card and yellow card, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is something new and we are grateful that 
<br/>privileges is with the Speaker to decide and not with anyone else.  We have faith in the Speaker to 
<br/>make the right decision at the right time, not just for the Opposition, but for the Government members 
<br/>as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Voting procedures, by roll calls - I believe we had a lot of discussions and we agreed that 
<br/>vote by acclamation is needed especially when we go to Committee of Supply.  We cannot be calling 
<br/>for rollcall every time there is an amendment, otherwise it will take us at least two or three months 
<br/>to  pass  the  Budget.    This  was  also  appreciated  by  the  Government  Members  and  we  came  to  an 
<br/>amicable solution that we can have vote by acclamation as and when suggested by the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point that I would like to raise which is a concerning one.  I raised 
<br/>this in the Standing Order Committee as well with regards to the prayer.  I still take that stand and 
<br/>this is my personal view as a Hindu, I have no issues with the incorporation of the word “Jesus” in 
<br/>the prayer.  We can have a Christian prayer though we are a secular state.  Again, it is policy decision 
<br/>that has been taken by the Government and we were voted against this particular issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I  am  saying,  I have  no issues of the word “Jesus” used in  the prayer.  As a Hindu,  as 
<br/>honourable Koya who is a Muslim, as honourable Charan Jeath Singh as a Sikh, what we are saying 
<br/>is, to be incorporated in this prayer, there is a phrase where it says and I quote:  “… heal us from our 
<br/>differences and unite us”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the Committee stage, I was told that the Government has reservations 
<br/>of the word “Fijians” to be used in the prayer.  I still urge that the prayer should read: “… heal us 
<br/>from our differences and unite us all as Fijians”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, that the honourable Prime Minister is on record saying that every citizen in Fiji will be 
<br/>called a “Fijian”, there is no harm in incorporating other individuals who are not Christian believers 
<br/>to be incorporated as Fijians in this particular prayer.   That is my request and I propose an amendment 
<br/>to this particular report, especially in the prayers that this particular phrase should read: “Heal us 
<br/>from our differences and unite us all as Fijians.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That will actually see anyone else apart from a Christian believer who sits in this Chamber is 
<br/>incorporated in this prayer, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is a request from our side.  As I said this is my 
<br/>personal opinion as a Hindu, that we need to be incorporated in this prayer. We are actually taking 
<br/>part.  Whenever you come pray and if the word “Fijians” is incorporated into the prayer, we will also 
<br/>feel inclusive as part of the prayer.  With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you very much and 
<br/>hope that the amendment that I have proposed would be accepted by the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Since there is no one  else who would like to speak on the motion,  I now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank 
<br/>the honourable Opposition Whip with the points have been made and I do understand that this is also 
<br/>part  of  their  submission  that  the  honourable  Speaker  has  allowed  time  or  after  this  sitting  to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>

<div><span>Review of the Standing Orders – Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>considered  and  it  will  be  something  for  the  Standing  Orders  Committee,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to 
<br/>deliberate on. However, at this point in time, since there are no objections to the current Standing 
<br/>Orders that are before us which are been agreed to by both sides, but for the other submissions that 
<br/>are to come, I seek the support of Parliament that we do pass these amendments and that we will be 
<br/>conveying the Standing Orders Committee after the sitting to consider those submissions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  couple  of  things  that  I  wanted  to  raise.  Just 
<br/>generally speaking, I agree with what honourable Maharaj has actually mentioned, with respect to 
<br/>certain things in there, he is quite fervently saying those things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that is very important, and I mentioned this at one of the meetings I had 
<br/>attended to because of his absence.  What we needed to do was ensure that we were also compliant 
<br/>with the Constitution, and it is an issue that probably needs to be vetted and vented instead of adopting 
<br/>it now.  There are couple of things.  Section 23 of the Constitution and I specifically refer to Section 
<br/>23(3)(b).  In a Constitution there is a provision, it literally states in Section 23(3)(1), and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Every citizen has the freedom to make particular choices, and the right to- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>form or join political party; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>participate in the activities of, or recruit members for a political party; and  
<br/>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>campaign for a political party, candidate or cause.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also states in Section 23(3)(a) and (b), and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Every citizen who has reached the age of 18 years has the right - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to be registered as a voter; 
<br/>to vote by secret ballot in any election or referendum under this Constitution.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, if this is being done, and given the citizen has been given the right, there is no clear reason 
<br/>why we need to set it out the way it has been in the amendment.  I think it is something that actually 
<br/>really clearly needs to be debated. There are certain things in there, the ones that are marked in red 
<br/>with respect to the changes that will require us vetting.  Case in point, Sir, what is the reason behind 
<br/>the yellow card and the red card?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the authority to remove someone from Parliament vests with you, Sir. It has always 
<br/>been there.  It is your discretion that is there for you to exercise if and when someone in here, it has 
<br/>been in some occasions where it has been used but it is used very sparingly, but it is your discretion.  
<br/>We are actually saying that, why do we need to change that? What is the reason behind it?  There is 
<br/>no quoted reason being offered with respect to yellow cards and red cards.  It does not make sense, 
<br/>Sir.  Why do we need to actually add those particular provisions within the Standing Orders? I can 
<br/>understand some provisions that, along the course of time, may need amendments. I can understand 
<br/>the discussion regarding some of the other ones but those two particular reasons, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the very important provisions, again, as I go back to the first one is, when someone 
<br/></span><span>votes, at the moment from what I understand, correct me if I am wrong, honourable Tabuya, is if you 
<br/></span><span>are going to vote in Parliament, you get called out to say, “I vote for X, Y or Z”.  So that right to vote 
<br/>and do it by way of secret ballot is actually very important. It is not just for us; it is for both sides of 
<br/>Parliament. We have seen this on many occasions, not just in this Parliament, previous Parliaments 
<br/>before us where you actually hold that right. It is something that we should really clearly look at with 
<br/>respect to jurisdictions around the world and how it is done.  And the reasons behind that particular 
<br/>right existing. It is not something that needs to be taken lightly, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1299 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I go back to what I had spoken about yesterday.  We are given some rights that we take for 
<br/>granted and we cannot curtail those, we cannot force people in particular situations where if someone 
<br/>wants vote for someone else, if the Prime Minister’s being elected, that is his or her choice.  What is 
<br/>the reason?  I need to hear, what is the reason behind it having to be disclosed?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Really, I have not anything, Sir.  So that is an objectionable part from our perspective, Sir.  
<br/>As  I  have  said,  are  we  in  line  with  the  Constitution?  If  I  remember  correctly,  I  think  that  was 
<br/>something that, correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Speaker Sir, you had said, “ask to see if we could get 
<br/>some kind  of opinion on it whether we are  actually encroaching  on the Constitutional  rights of a 
<br/>particular person to vote”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, all of those things, Sir, if I am wrong, I am wrong but at the end of the day I think it is 
<br/>something very, very important.  There are certain things, as I say again, probably as time goes along, 
<br/>we need to amend or fix from a past practice, that is understandable.  Again, no reason being proffered 
<br/>with respect to this.   What is the yellow card status? What is the red card status?  What purpose does 
<br/>it really serve when you, Sir, already have that discretion.  I know you use it wisely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We take note of what was being said by honourable Koya but in view of 
<br/>the Right of Reply that has been given, we will take note of that and we will ensure that we will bring 
<br/>it up when we review the issues raised by the honourable Leader of the  Opposition  in  the whole 
<br/>review of Standing Orders and that will considered when we review it next.  Also, nothing is set in 
<br/>stone, we are flexible with this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament will now vote on the motion, and I notice you are opposing the motion, honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition when your side  agreed to  in  the Business Committee, so again  you are 
<br/>opposing it out here? Let us be clear on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We agreed to it in the Business Committee and that is the very thing that we are trying to 
<br/>amend here, otherwise it becomes a joke and laughingstock.  You go to a meeting, you agree there 
<br/>and  you  come  out  here,  you  oppose  it  again  for  the  sake  of  opposing.    So,  please,  honourable 
<br/>Members if you oppose it, then we will put it to the vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Votes cast: 
<br/>Ayes 
<br/>-  28 
<br/>-  20
