<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2023-2024 APPROPRIATION BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members in the gallery, to the FijiFirst 
<br/>family, thousands of Fijians listening or tuned into the Parliament session and every Fijian abroad 
<br/>who has Fiji at heart, </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we live in the best nation in the world, and I call that “Fiji Islands” – my 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>home.    I believe that a National Budget should be the welfare and for the betterment of the people 
<br/>of the country. Here, we have a Coalition Government that has conjured a deficit budget in which it 
<br/>is inhumane to the thousands of the Fijian people in time to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Budget  is  not  for  the  people  of  this  country,  this  Budget  is  rather  to  support  the 
<br/>incompetence, demands and the desires of the Coalition agreement.  This Budget does not address 
<br/>the challenges faced by Fijian families and households.  It does not inspire confidence in our people 
<br/>to invest in the country.  This is evident, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ever since the Coalition Government came 
<br/>into power, we saw a massive migration, people left the country, zero confidence in this Government.  
<br/>The numbers speak and you have been travelling a lot as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What are the numbers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You are at the airport a lot as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 the honourable Minister of Finance under the Coalition 
<br/>Government said, “we need to find the money.”  I did not know he was targeting the pockets and the 
<br/>savings of our hardworking Fijians, else why would the Coalition Government increase VAT on our 
<br/>people and this is collective taxes that our people will be paying. There is a removal of concession 
<br/>from various items as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Coalition Government we have a Minister of Finance that says, 
<br/>“we need to find wealth.”  I would like to tell the honourable Minister of Finance as a national leader, 
<br/>you  are  not  supposed  to  find  wealth,  you  are  supposed  to  create  it.    This  is  why  this  Budgetary 
<br/>allocation has zero new capital investment projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I think they made the budget overnight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- No wonder Fiji holds a very dark future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What about it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Listen you might learn.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Coalition Government has painted a grey picture about debt.  I would 
<br/>like to share with the people of this country, for example, if a young couple decides to progress in 
<br/>life, they take loans from the bank, they buy a house, they have invested in an asset, if they smart 
<br/>with their finances and I hope the other side is listening, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this young couple can take 
<br/>their loan, build a house, create a flat, have a return on investment and they pay off their debt before 
<br/>the timeframe.  What happens is they own a asset, in a couple of years they are able to refinance,  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1307 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>invest in business or build more.  That is called progress and prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, any government would borrow to build infrastructure and 
<br/>that  is  considered  as  good  debt.    If  you  take  debt  to  build  roads,  build  buildings,  you  create 
<br/>accessibility, you create affordability. This establishes startups, entrepreneurship, new businesses, 
<br/>current  business  can  scale  up  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  create  jobs.    When  you  create  jobs,  there  is 
<br/>economic activity, money is generated, the economy flows.  It is very simple; I do not need to have 
<br/>a PhD or be a professor to understand this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- You need it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Who is talking?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is very artistic in painting a picture that debt is 
<br/>bad, the people need to pay for it and then the government needs money.  That is the picture they 
<br/>have painted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  30th  July,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  under  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government comes up with a $639 million deficit Budget which will take Fiji’s debt from $9.9 billion 
<br/>to $10.5 billion.  The very leaders who campaigned and complained about Fiji’s debt crisis, “</span><span>oh bahut 
<br/>karza, karza bharo desh chalao</span><span> that was the mentality, Mr. Speaker, Sir and that is happening but at 
<br/>the expense of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 in one of the articles it says and I quote, “Honourable 
<br/>Biman Prasad attacks FijiFirst for their reckless spending.”  Mr. Speaker, Sir, reckless spending, the 
<br/>first  quarter  of  this  year  the  Coalition  Government  has  borrowed  $223.2  million  with  over  65 
<br/>international trips.  Is this not wastage, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Is this not reckless? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- They should be looking into the mirror before they speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  cost  of  living  will  sky  rocket  and  may  seem  out  of  control  because  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government makes bad and poor economic decisions and it is evident.  This Budget is the evidence 
<br/>of the poor economic decisions.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget creates a gross-borrowing requirement 
<br/>of an estimated $1.2 billion and this is higher because maturing debt is refinanced and not repaid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  brings  my  attention  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar.    On  21st 
<br/>March,  2023  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  in  Auckland  held  a  mini-press  conference.    The 
<br/>article says on 21st March, 2023 that the Minister promised that the Rakiraki Mill will be established.  
<br/>When will it happen, Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Answer  to  the  farmers.  When  will  ethanol  be  produced,  3,500 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sugarcane tonnes, 350 days operational.  When will it happen Minister?     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Sugar also  promised that the Labasa Mill  will be turned into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>refinery mill.  When will it happen?  The farmers want to know.  When will it happen?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- But then Mr. Speaker, Sir, we find out that majority of the funds for 
<br/>sugar is under the honourable Minister of Finance. I urge and plead on behalf of the farmers to the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Sugar to knock harder on the door of the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>and get the job done for the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  pursuit  to  build  the  Rakiraki  Mill,  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Sugar has taken to </span><span>Facebook </span><span>that he has guaranteed $400 per tonne.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You should follow him on </span><span>Facebook</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, $400 per tonne for cassava. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- That fix the sugar problems, then will plant cassava. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  guess  the  various  international  trips  has  really  helped  our  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Sugar and is coming to good use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You are jealous! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Jealous of you, in your dreams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this brings me to corporate tax. I am an entrepreneur 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I started from nothing.  I could say that it is immensely difficult to start a business, 
<br/>it is not easy, so many suffered during that pandemic and so many have been resilient, relevant and 
<br/>they have survived.  I congratulate all businesses people for doing what they do and what they love 
<br/>to do and contribute to the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Did you get some Government grant? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R SHARMA.- I deserved it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because  I  worked  for  it  and  I  deserved  it  and  that  is  what  FijiFirst  Government  is  about, 
<br/>cultivating the next generation of leaders.  Where are the youths?  Where are the youths on your side? 
<br/>None of the youths, nothing for the young people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, talking about businesses, businesses create jobs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, businesses creates jobs, innovation and contribute 
<br/>to  the  regional  development  but  this  Coalition  Government,  some  of  the  businesses  still  face  the 
<br/>ramifications of the global pandemic yet the Coalition Government decides to increase corporate tax.  
<br/>They do not know when businesses are not able to survive, they will pass down their corporate tax 
<br/>to the selling price of the product with their added profit and their added fiscal duty and the added 
<br/>VAT increase.  Collective tax will destroy this country from businesses to the consumers.  This is 
<br/>what the Coalition Government has been harping about with this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if businesses do not survive, they will reduce the hours of the staff, people 
<br/>will have less pay.  There would not be jobs, people will be jobless, how will people survive, this 
<br/>will increase the crime rate which is very evident in Fiji right now.  Crime rate has increased in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there seems to be a new policy on the streets - you scratch my back, I scratch 
<br/>your back.  You give me $1,000 today, I will help you on a rainy day.  Some of the policies, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, on the streets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming to tourism.  Tourism is Fiji’s backbone and it collapsed during the 
<br/>global pandemic, but we showed our resilience and we are one of the fattest growing economies in 
<br/>the world.  More opportunities, a sustainable, resilient and inclusive Fiji.  I would like to thank all 
<br/>those Fijians working in our tourism sector for their immense contribution in making tourism the 
<br/>backbone of our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  like  to  congratulate  the  very  hard  working  and  dynamic  staff  of  Fiji 
<br/>Airways and to FijiFirst Government for their achievement as the best airline in Australia and the 
<br/>Pacific.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  staff  of  Fiji  Airways  and  the  FijiFirst  Government  for  their 
<br/>achievement as to be ranked 15th globally.  I would like to thank the staff of Fiji Airways and the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government  for  Fiji  Airways  being  ranked  12th  globally  for  the  Cabin  Crew  category.  
<br/>Thank you FijiFirst for keeping our airline alive with their strategic measures and visionary plans 
<br/>and this achievement would not have been possible without the hardworking and dedicated staff of 
<br/>Fiji Airways. Thank you for making us proud. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with geopolitical tensions on the rise internal and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>external wars….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, no running commentaries please.  Allow honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sharma to make his contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With geopolitical tension on the rise and ongoing wars internally and externally with various 
<br/>countries that are suppliers of raw materials, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is forecasted that fuel prices would 
<br/>increase.  Yet, this Coalition Government thinks to increase departure tax.  On top of that, there is 5 
<br/>percent increase on excise duty for alcohol, tobacco and 5 cents per litre for carbonated drinks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is very unfortunate, the Coalition Government thinks that the tourism 
<br/>sector is their day-to-day bank or pot of gold, whenever they want, they can get all the money out 
<br/>from it and run their operational expenses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will make Fiji a very expensive destination. We already have throat-
<br/>slitting competition in the region with Tonga, Vanuatu, Samoa and Cook Islands and then also global 
<br/>competitions such Bali and Maldives. Why? When tourists want to  travel, they do their thorough 
<br/>research.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that jeopardises our tourism sector. One is the increase taxes 
<br/>by the Coalition Government and the other is the high crime rate that is  happening in  Fiji.  Why 
<br/>would anyone want to come to a nation and be robbed?  That is the question people will be asking.  
<br/>So, by imposing high taxes on the tourism sector, this actually jeopardizes the jobs of thousands of 
<br/>Fijians who have the seen the worst of the pandemic and this is nothing or something very close to 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, speaking of VAT. The additional cost will be passed down to the consumers, 
<br/>the  ordinary  Fijians,  higher  prices  mean  it  reduces  the  buying  power  of  every  Fijian.    This  will 
<br/>contribute to a decrease in economic activity.  Through their multiple consultations, I think they did 
<br/>it with their friends and supporters.  The failed Fiscal Review Committee and the lavish economic 
<br/>summit, this was just a preview when the movie was all about tax increases. So, why would they? 
<br/>Oh well they know what they are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  increase  in  taxes  is  inhumane  to  the  people  of  this  country  and  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Women went on </span><span>TikTok</span><span> and said 12.5 percent is inhumane, then what is 15 
<br/>percent, I ask her? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable L.D. Tabuya interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- That is your budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- If five things were bought for $20, now for ordinary Fijians will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>able to buy two or three things for $20. That is the state we will be all living in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I bring my attention to the honourable Assistant Minister for Women. She 
<br/>has spoken about addressing the needs of the poor, vulnerable and how deprived they are of nutrition 
<br/></span><span>and the Welfare Support Scheme, but the amount of collective tax that the Coalition Government is 
<br/></span><span>charging them, they will take all the welfare in the blink of an eye.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- When you go and visit them, honourable Member …. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1311 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- </span><span>Ka boliyo ulon ke</span><span>? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when she goes and makes her visitations, I hope she has the honesty to say 
<br/>to her vulnerable and marginalised people and communities that the Government she is part of has 
<br/>increased collective tax on the very same people they think, “oh, we have given you welfare by an 
<br/>increase of $15 to $25.” You must be joking!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, she spoke about termites. Yesterday a business owner messaged me and 
<br/>said that their raw materials just arrived, 3 percent duty has increased, 15 percent duty on that and 
<br/>the price of finished good is high. Construction will be extremely high. So, when someone wants to 
<br/>rebuild their homes after the termite infestation, what will honourable Assistant Minister Sashi Kiran 
<br/>go and tell her people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable S. Kiran interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>ka jayek boliyo aap ulon se? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Copy and paste Budget.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  ask  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  “is  she  going  to  build  more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Golden Age Care Homes because …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- …with  their high  collective tax, that is  where she will be putting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government states that the Budget is about tightening your 
<br/>belts as things will get difficult from here. So, thousands of Fijians are told to tighten their belts only 
<br/>so these Ministers in the Coalition Government can tighten and loosen their belts flying in aircrafts 
<br/>from one country to the other. That is evident from all the international travels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 29 Ministers, 65 plus international trips - $223.2 million in borrowing in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>four months is extreme wastage in Fiji’s history. A very historic Government we have over here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order. He is misleading Parliament because he stated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>twice …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Could you provide me the Standing Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO  F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Standing Order  62 imputing misleading  facts  here. He has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expressed that Government borrowed $223 million for overseas travel. Can he prove that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue, honourable Sharma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to respond to this very quickly. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>think he is not listening.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  said  65  international  trips  alone  and  $223.2  million  borrowings  alone 
<br/>according to the financial report from the Ministry of Finance. You can have a read, it is from the 
<br/>quarterly report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 27</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023 the honourable Minister of Finance said, “As a Minister of Finance, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been inherited a mess.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask the people of this country. When you love 
<br/>what you do, you do not complain. You should have the vision to find the solution in a problem. Full 
<br/>of complains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The debt could have been paid off with new and innovative investments and projects; where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are the creative ideas, Coalition Government? No creative ideas at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it took the honourable Prime Minister so long to convene the COC meeting 
<br/>which led to the appointment of the members to the Electoral Commission.  It just shows that we 
<br/>could be in fully capacity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they talk about New Fiji, they talk about democratic values and they talk 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about the Constitution. I know the honourable Minister for Sugar is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Interference!

<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Do not let them distract you, honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Honourable Prime Minister says to work with them, we are here to 
<br/>work with you as well for the betterment of every Fijian, but Mr. Speaker, Sir, our goal is the same.  
<br/>The  goal  is  the  welfare  and  well-being  of  our  Fijian  people,  but  our  parts  are  different.    I  can 
<br/>understand it must be hard for three parties to work together in the first place, I mean it is kind of 
<br/>evident on their faces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to correct this confused Government. This is very important. 
<br/>They call themselves the People’s Government. Let us put it to the test, Sir.  This Budget, does it 
<br/>give to the people, or does it take away from the people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  which  government  calls  itself  the  People’s 
<br/>Government but takes away from the people their savings, deposits, income and salaries?  The reality 
<br/>is  three  parties  formed  a  Coalition  Government  to  defeat  FijiFirst  Government  that  was  for  the 
<br/>people,  that  gave  equality,  that  gave  into  the  people.    Even  during  the  pandemic,  we  never  once 
<br/></span><span>complained.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  evident  and  now  we  know  that  the  Coalition  Government  cannot 
<br/>manage money and when they want more, they will come after your savings.  Again, I repeat this, 
<br/>for the point of order that  was raised.  Mr. Speaker, Sir $223.2 million in  borrowings in  the first 
<br/>quarter was done by this Government.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1313 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  one  question,  I  ask  the  students  who  were  on  TELS  and  think  their  loans  have  been 
<br/>forgiven, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you are forgiven, are you let go of or are you held on to?  This is 
<br/>what I want to ask the students.  They are educated, knowledgeable with great knowledge comes 
<br/>great responsibility and I hope you make your parents and your country proud.  but, again, I would 
<br/>like to ask, did the Coalition Government honour their promises? Have they left gone of you or have 
<br/>they held on to you by a bond - in the name of bond?  That is for them to answer because they are 
<br/>the ones who hold the real power of this nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government likes to swim in an empty swimming pool. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- They have to listen to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  misleading  statements  on  the  Lautoka 
<br/>Swimming Pool, the initial estimate by the project consultant was $2 million.  This estimate was 
<br/>based on a different location - smaller pools to be constructed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then Lautoka City Council resolved to construct another pool on another location… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- This is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initial estimate of the project 
<br/>consultant was $2 million and the estimate was based on a different location, smaller pools to be 
<br/>constructed.  Then Lautoka City Council resolved to construct another pool at another location at a 
<br/>higher ground with international standard facilities with other facilities as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Lautoka City Council requested the project consultant to provide 
<br/>an estimate cost on the new location and new scope of work because it was scaled up to international 
<br/>standards, which came to around $7.8 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Then  Lautoka  City  Council  invited  public  tenders  for  the 
<br/>construction of the pool based on the new scope of work which was now at $12.6 million and that is 
<br/></span><span>the difference, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They are unable to understand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the confusion here is that, the estimated cost by the consultant was $7.8 
<br/>million and the best tender price received by Lautoka City Council was $12.6 million.  The whole 
<br/>idea of the FijiFirst Government at that time was to support the project to give it an opportunity to 
<br/>the younger generation for training, competition and the use of international standard pool.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the vision was also the same with what we have done with Churchill Park.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are hosting international… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- What happened to Shirley Park? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I will come to that, do not worry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope I have cleared this misinformation which has been coming time and 
<br/>time again.  For the information of Parliament, only $6 million was paid out to relevant contractors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I look forward to concluding my speech.  This brings me to the speech of 
<br/>honourable Qereqeretabua.  Her speech was very fancy and very polished.  She spoke about the law 
<br/>and order in Fiji, but we have a law and order situation in Fiji - increased robberies, home invasion, 
<br/>and that is evident.  This is why even the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, 
<br/>Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications  is very ambitious with his 
<br/>revenue projections and collections and about investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, crime rate, and the evidence that the honourable Minister for Women always 
<br/>ask, where is the evidence?  Here is the evidence.  The US Embassy in Suva issued security alert 
<br/>regarding crime.  On 10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, an international embassy is stating crime rate is high in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he does not understand it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do round off, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a Coalition Government that has an approach to rebuild Fiji with a blind eye, with 
<br/>a textbook Budget, a Budget that is disconnected from reality and this would bring pain, suffering 
<br/>and disappointment among thousands of Fijians.  We must not forget we were voted in by the people, 
<br/>we have a national responsibility to serve the people of this beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the real power and the final decision lies with every Fijian citizen.  The 
<br/>Government’s job is to be fair, but how are we fair to the thousands of ordinary Fijians when they 
<br/>have  to  pay  so  many  taxes  and  those  rich  people  earning  above  $270,000  gets  a  5  percent  tax 
<br/>reduction?  This is the new Fiji, the new democracy that they are harping about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In times of calamity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a real leader is at the forefront of the calamity but here, 
<br/>we have a Coalition Government, that has put the public at the frontline to bear the burden of the 
<br/>debt.  This is not leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Your debt! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  We have a Fiji here, the new democratic Fiji that they talk about 
<br/>where the poor, the vulnerable, grassroots, marginalised, the middle class income earners pay more 
<br/>and the rich pay less.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To help you and your families to plan and get ahead, FijiFirst always believe in a core

<div><span>principle, and we believe that every hardworking Fijian should keep more of what they earn.  Our 
<br/>people should be rewarded and the best reward for them was lower taxes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this high deficit Budget deprives and will disappoint thousands of Fijians 
<br/>to just 22 zero-rated items and that is something our people do not deserve.  To my fellow Fijians, I 
<br/>ask you all, do we deserve this kind of leadership?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support this Budget.  We are national leaders and we should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be capable and competent enough to tackle challenges, but not at the expense of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I tend to adjourn Parliament now so that we can take a morning tea break.
