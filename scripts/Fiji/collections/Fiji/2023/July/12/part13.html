<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 107, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the amendments to the Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2023, Bill No. 09/2023, 
<br/></span><span>which was tabled in Parliament on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023, be considered by Parliament during the 
<br/>debate along with other Consequential Bills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very small amendment. The

<div><span> Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2023 was tabled in Parliament on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 as Bill No. 9 of 
<br/>2023  to  amend  the  Excise  Act  1986  and  to  address  budgetary  policy  changes  in  the  2023-2024 
<br/>Budget.  Since the tabling of the Bill, four anomalies have been identified in relation to Clause 4 of 
<br/>the Bill which have been updated.   This has been picked up by Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 
<br/>(FRCS) and at the outset, I apologise that, that anomaly was there.  The Bill is tabled with the relevant 
<br/>amendments in Magenta for ease of reference, if you look at the amended Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 4 of the Bill amends Schedule 2 to the Act to reflect 
<br/>the  increase  in  the  rate  of  excise  duty  on  alcohol,  tobacco,  sugar  sweetened  beverages  and  other 
<br/>excisable goods.  Sir, after the Budget Address, the two items of excisable goods under Schedule 2 
<br/>to the Act that I had referred to in my speech are item 103 in relation to cigarettes containing tobacco 
<br/>grown outside of Fiji and tobacco grown in Fiji, and item 203 in relation to manufactured tobacco 
<br/>containing tobacco grown outside of Fiji and tobacco grown in Fiji. So, that is the change that was 
<br/>not properly reflected and we thought that, that should be corrected so that there is no mistake in the 
<br/>interpretation and the application of the excise duties.  It is a minor amendment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  being  no  one  willing  to  make  a  stand  on  the  motion,  I  now  call  on  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this is just a minor correction, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so honourable Members would have the opportunity during the debate to discuss if there is anything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  I  rise  on  a  Point  of  Order.    Just  a  quick  clarification  from  you,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  We have  all  been handed a  copy  of the gazette which says, “This  is  the Amended 
<br/>Standing Orders and pursuant to Standing Order 15(3)(1) and as directed by the Speaker, I hereby 
<br/>publish  the  Amended  Standing  Orders  of  the  Parliament  of  Fiji”.    Was  this  gazetted  prior  to  us 
<br/>actually agreeing to it, Sir?  Has this already been gazette?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a clarification.  Was it gazetted before we actually met?  From 
<br/>what I see here, the Secretary-General has it dated today and it was already gazetted before we have 
<br/>vented/vetted it.  That is the query and question that we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Minister of Finance, the question now as has been raised…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- How come this is done before we discussed it in this House?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is just the Standing Orders, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Before we agreed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  just  would  seem  highly  unusual  that  you  would 
<br/>gazette something prior to it being approved.  It is something that we need to correct. It is already 
<br/>gazetted prior to us having gone through that last previous motion raised by honourable Tabuya.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We would like an explanation, Sir, if we could on whether it was gazetted 
<br/>prior to all of these happenings.  That is what it says, that is what we have all received.  Maybe the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General can shed some light on it.  I am not sure, Sir, but some clarification 
<br/>that we need, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Koya,  could  I  humbly  ask,  please,  we  need  a  lot  of 
<br/>concentration in the way we meet in this august Parliament.  When a question has been put and there 
<br/>is no response from either side, we have continued as is in the Standing Orders in how we operate in 
<br/>this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, when the question was asked, “Does any Member oppose the motion?”, in that span of 
<br/>time, no one responded by saying, “We oppose the motion”, so we moved on.  You still have your 
<br/>right if you want to address this on the issue that you have raised, honourable Koya, but we have 
<br/>covered this and we have gone ahead so all I ask is that we continue and that leaves the door open 
<br/>for anyone all the time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Should you dispute that, there are always avenues available to seek redress on this. But all I 
<br/>ask, honourable Members, when we sit and deliberate in this Parliament, when a question has been 
<br/>raised, please, make your response there and then. Otherwise, we will not be able to move forward. 
<br/>As we move forward, we take another 10 steps back because of the way that the delay is pulling us 
<br/>back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For papers such as this to be provided to you, honourable Members, at the very time that you 
<br/>are sitting to deliberate on it, it is nothing new. This is how we have been doing it in the last so many 
<br/>years.  Bills just come to us and amendments, as we were about to deliberate on it. Do we have the 
<br/>time read it?  No.  But when the Bill is presented, you have to do all your best. This is how best you 
<br/>can actively participate in the decision-making process when it is there for you to decide on.  So, all 
<br/>I ask is that we continue because we have covered them. I hope we are not going to be going back 
<br/>and front on these issues every time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, just a matter of clarification.  I am not sure if you are aware, 
<br/>Sir, this copy was handed to us just now when the amendments that honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>gave. So, we did not know or have a copy of the gazette already gazetted before the vote or during 
<br/>the motion that was filed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand what you are saying, Sir. I do not disagree with you. It was just an issue that as 
<br/>a Party, we wanted to query with respect to this being gazetted prior to. I understand the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition will write formally to you, Sir.    Thank you very much and we appreciate 
<br/>your time.
