<h3>PAYE…</h3>
<div><span>PAYE… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and Social Responsibility Tax (SRT) together in a single 
<br/>tax tabled with a 5 percent reduction in (SRT) across the board as it was unfairly high and targeted a 
<br/>small group of lawyers and accountants by the previous government.  Again, it was made to punish 
<br/>some people.  There is a history and let me explain.  When the previous government introduced… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Shut up! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is a good one.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Listen!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …  SRT,  they  got  it  fundamentally  wrong.    The  SRT  was 
<br/>applied on full income rather than marginal income because any good taxation system, for it to be 
<br/>progressive, you should look at the marginal tax rate. So, they applied on full income rather than the 
<br/>marginal income on additional income which should be the case to make the tax system progressive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By that foolish change, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had hundreds of taxpayers earning gross income 
<br/>of over $270,000, having a lower net take-home pay compared to those earning below them.  You 
<br/>do not have that anywhere in the world.  So, if you are earning $270,000 and above, after the SRT, 
<br/>your take home pay would actually be lower than someone who is earning $200,000 or whatever the 
<br/>number is there.  That is how absurd the rate was.  After the complaints, the Government recognised 
<br/>this stupidity  and we have reversed the policy to  apply  the SRT not on full income but  only Mr.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker,  Sir,  on  marginal  income  which  is  the  incremental  income  or  additional  income  above 
<br/>$270,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  means  that  the  anomaly  highlighted  earlier  was  eliminated,  however  while  these 
<br/>anomalies were sorted there was another major problem because the corporate tax rate was set at 20 
<br/>percent and what happened when this SRT came in, the PAYE and salary combined was much higher, 
<br/>in  fact, maximum of 49  percent then with  hundreds of people scaping  SRT.  So those who  were 
<br/>directors were receiving salaries, they escaped SRT by forming companies or paying the reduced tax 
<br/>rate of 20 percent and taking tax free dividends.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because there was no progressivity, we were losing income.  The only group left paying SRT 
<br/>in that case were the lawyers and the accountants who by the virtue of law could not form companies.  
<br/>That was why it was done because it was targeted, it was very unfair.  So, what we have done is to 
<br/>make it more fairer, make it more progressive, nothing. We suggest that we are favoring the rich. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the kind of uninformed debate that we have heard from the Opposition 
<br/>in the last two days.  A couple of other things that I wanted to quickly point out, honourable Naupoto 
<br/>talked about the drug problem, and he was talking about police in this Budget.  As the honourable 
<br/>Minister explained, we provided additional funding for police patrol, police beat, we know drug is a 
<br/>problem.  Let me just remind some of them and especially honourable Usamate because he seems to 
<br/>completely ignore that.  Honourable Pio Tikoduadua, while in the Opposition two years or three years 
<br/>ago, moved a motion in this very Parliament to have a national inquiry on the drug problem.  What 
<br/>happened?  He was assaulted by the then Prime Minister and checked out of Parliament and all of 
<br/>them were sitting there gulping the injustice that was done to this man because he raised an important 
<br/>issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- </span><span>Isa</span><span>, sad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We know there is a serious drug problem in this country and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already the honourable Minister had laid down what he needs to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the level of debate that we had from the Opposition.  I wanted to 
<br/>finish it in an hour but I have gone past, if I followed the microwave I would gave gone for three 
<br/>hours.  As has been said by my honourable colleagues on this side, this Budget has fundamentally 
<br/>put the country back on track.  Since we have come into Government, there is a sense of freedom, 
<br/>optimism and exuberance within the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You can look at all the indicators, you look at the indicators with respect to tourism numbers, 
<br/>you look  at  the spending you look  at the expectations of the investors, honourable Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister Kamikamica talked about the pipeline, the banks are telling us that the uptake on loans and 
<br/>borrowings by the private sector is very buoyant, and so all the indicators that are there, shows that 
<br/>our economy was on the right trajectory.  What this Budget has done is to create a fine balance to 
<br/>looking after our people, making sure that our spending on health, education, infrastructure and social 
<br/>social welfare is adequate.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, brings the Budget into focus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One last point that I wanted to discuss because a lot of misinformation has also come from 
<br/></span><span>the  other  side.    When  they  talked  about  TELS  forgiveness,  they  deliberately  forgot  or  they 
<br/>deliberately manipulated the narrative or tried to manipulate the narrative, but I am pretty sure, that 
<br/>is not going to work because the young people are celebrating; university students are celebrating 
<br/>and  high  school  students  are  celebrating.    They  know  what  this  Government  has  done,  they 
<br/>understand  what  it  means.    So,  they  are  equating,  they  are  saying,  “Oh,  you  have  replaced  loan 
<br/>repayment with bond.”  So, there is no chain.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, how naïve can they be.  Bond is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1383 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about students serving our country.  We did that.  I studied on a scholarship, and I signed the bond 
<br/>for four years for which the scholarship duration was, to serve the country, and if I did not, I had to 
<br/>pay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Exactly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That is not forgiven.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You do not equate a bond with a loan that you have to pay.  It 
<br/>is not cash.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are talking about all these misinformation that Government has 
<br/>lost its revenue.  They do not understand a simple thing.  When the Government gives loan, it is an 
<br/>expenditure, it is supposed to be a revolving fund, it is supposed to be paid, but as we had pointed 
<br/>out, in many ways, that loan was already forgiven. Sir, TELS told us 21,000 students paid, they spent 
<br/>close to about $150 million to $190 million…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Point of Order!  He is misleading Parliament, Sir.  The point is that 
<br/>that money was never forgiven.   Students had to pay the loan but for the last three years because of 
<br/>COVID and all, they were given a break.  As soon as the economy improves, they were supposed to 
<br/>pay back.  So that was the formula.  Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has been misleading Parliament 
<br/>simply by saying there is so much of excitement, et cetera, but he fails to understand as the Minister 
<br/>of Finance and also looking after the growth of the economy, he should understand better that this is 
<br/>not a sustainable model, which means that we all have to pay that amount of money every year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Just listen to the lecturer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kumar and I published the article 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>together.  I think honourable Kumar is more confused.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You seem to be the only one that is not confused.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What I was simply saying is that, 21,000 students who took 
<br/>loans, TELS does not even have the record of those people.  So that money that was spent on 21,000 
<br/>students is dead money already.  The rate at which the collection was coming, I am not talking about 
<br/>forgiveness during COVID-19, she is misinterpreting what I am saying.  I am just saying that what 
<br/>we have crafted as part of the new scholarship is a real well thought out strategy to ensure that we 
<br/>produce a labour market requirement that is commensurate with what the economy needs, what are 
<br/>the human resource needs, there will be proper planning, students would be put into different skill 
<br/>area, different  subject  areas, different  professional  programmes and there will be both  equity and 
<br/>access to scholarships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  was  not  collecting  the  money  anyway.    So,  what  we  have  done,  is  we  are 
<br/>forgiving all that was there.  Some students who have a small percentage would have paid everything, 
<br/>that is fine, we cannot go back.  However, for those who still owe, all their loan agreements will be 
<br/></span><span>converted into bond agreement.  If they had served like four years and they are left with one and a 
<br/></span><span>half years, the bond agreement will be for only 1.5 years.  It is a very good scheme and that will be 
<br/>good for the country and good for the students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had said in my Budget Address, this may seem a tough 
<br/>Budget, but it is a very compassionate one.  It is a well thought out Budget, it brings into picture in a 
<br/>particular way fiscal prudence, and it will provide the confidence that is needed not just to the private

<div><span>sector, but our international partners, donors, lending agencies and to our people.  This is our first 
<br/>Budget and this Budget, we understand is not going to solve every problem, given the magnitude of 
<br/>the problem that we have.  So we do ask the Opposition  and our people understand this already, but 
<br/>we have to make sure that the Opposition understands this that we need patience, we have to make 
<br/>sure that what we have provided for in this Budget, our honourable Ministers understand this very 
<br/>well.  We are strengthening our Planning Office within the Ministry of Finance, our monitoring and 
<br/>evaluation  will  be  much  stronger  and  much  more  focused  so  that  we  are  able  to  deliver  the 
<br/>expenditure that had been provided for in the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, I want to once again thank the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership 
<br/>of  the  Cabinet  Sub-Committee  on  the  Budget,  including  my  two  colleagues,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  Kamikamica  and  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Gavoka,  all  the  honourable 
<br/>Ministers, Permanent Secretaries who made very good presentations to the Ministry of Finance in 
<br/>the formulation of the Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also want to take this opportunity to thank my Permanent Secretary who made very good 
<br/>presentations to the Ministry of Finance in the formulation of the Budget.  I also want to take this 
<br/>opportunity  to  thank  by  Permanent  Secretary,  Mr.  Shiri  Gounder.  A  very  competent  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary and all his staff who have found the process that we used to formulate the Budget seamless, 
<br/>much more congenial, easy yet it gave time to everyone to think through this Budget carefully. So I 
<br/>want to extend my gratitude and thanks to all those who worked very hard in the office to get this 
<br/>Budget out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the people who participated in the Economic Summit. All 
<br/>the  thousands  who  made  written  submission  as  well  as  the  Chairman  of  the  Fiscal  Review 
<br/>Committee, Mr. Richard Naidu and all the members because they worked very hard in compiling the 
<br/>statistics, going through the details and putting out a report independently which informed the country 
<br/>as to the state of our finances, our economic situation and that helped not only us but the people at 
<br/>large to understand how and why we have got this Budget. I want to thank all of them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, I commend this Budget and I invite the Opposition to do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something different, get out of that microwave and support this Budget, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I was listening  to the Right of Reply and the fiery 
<br/>exchanges. I heard correctly that questions were coming from this side of the House asking that the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance just explain a bit on the so much talked about exemption of bottled 
<br/>water taxation. That has been done. Despite that, there were still Point of Orders being raised to try 
<br/>and point score on how the Budget has progressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Honourable Members, pursuant to Standing Order 99(3), the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 
<br/>2023 (Bill No. 3 of 2023) has been read a second time and without questions being put, the Bill and 
<br/>the Estimates now stand referred to the Committee of Supply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before we go to the Committee of Supply, I would like to take this time to adjourn Parliament 
<br/>for dinner before we get back and go straight into the Committee of Supply. I will explain later when 
<br/></span><span>go  onto  the  Committee  of  Supply  on  what  is  the  objective  for  this  evening  and  what  we  should 
<br/></span><span>achieve and complete.  The Parliament is adjourned, and dinner is being served in the Big Committee 
<br/>Room.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 7.13 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1385 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 8.25 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, for the benefit of those who are experiencing the 
<br/>Budget process for the first time, Parliament will now resolve into Committee of Supply to consider 
<br/>each Head in the Budget Estimates.  It is envisaged that this process will be completed on Thursday 
<br/>evening after which the Committee of Supply will then vote on the Schedules and Clauses of the 
<br/>2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, we will attempt to complete debate and votes 
<br/>on the Heads of 1 to 22 before we adjourn tonight.  I know it is getting late into the night honourable 
<br/>Members, but this is how we were taught by the previous government on how to sit late into the night 
<br/>and address Budget processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of all honourable Members, please take note that for the Committee stage, 
<br/>I  will  be  sitting  down  there  with  the  Secretary-General  and  Members  will  refer  to  me  as  “Mr. 
<br/>Chairman”.  The mace will be placed (pointing to the mace) on the lower brackets signifying that the 
<br/>Parliament is in Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please take further note that the Secretary-General will announce each 
<br/>Head separately and once the Head is announced, you know the time that we are in, there will be no 
<br/>repeat nor going back.  May I repeat that, there will be no repeat or once we have covered the Head 
<br/>and then all of a sudden you want to take us back again, I think I will not allow that to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members may then speak on that Head and you may speak for more than once 
<br/>on each Head.  Please take note that in some of the Heads, there will be several programmes and 
<br/>activities listed.  I remind honourable Members that we will deal with these progressively and we 
<br/>will not regress to the Programmes and Activities that have been earlier discussed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members  may  also  move  amendments  to  the  Estimates  under  the  respective 
<br/>Heads.  If a Member moves an amendment, I will call for a seconder and then debate will ensue and 
<br/>at the end of the debate, the mover will have a Right of Reply and this will be followed by the vote 
<br/>on the amendment.  All the votes on the amendment will be done through acclamation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please take further note that the final vote on the Head will be taken electronically.  For the 
<br/>information of the honourable Members, amendments are limited to those permitted under Standing 
<br/>Orders 100(2) and these are an increase, decrease or removal of the item or subhead from the Head 
<br/>being debated.  And there are no further amendments and debates, we will proceed to the vote on the 
<br/>Head and then we will continue to the next Head. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, take note that the amendment slips (I think you have already 
<br/>got them) and copies of Standing Orders 100 have been placed on your tables to assist you during 
<br/>the Committee of Supply stage.  There are Heads 1 to  50, and we need to get through today and 
<br/>tomorrow and therefore I seek your full cooperation during this crucial process.  I hope we are all in 
<br/>agreement on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Committee: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 1 – Office of the President 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Just a quick query, Mr. Chairman, we have not filed a plus or minus on

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 1-1-8 on Construction of the Executive Office and Administration Block listed at $1.5 
<br/>million.  Just a quick explanation from the honourable Minister might just satisfy instead of … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are just seeking clarification? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Is this at the same place, is it somewhere else,  are the plans already in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>place or is it in stages? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Same plan, same location and same amount and is still on “R”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is at the same place.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, just a follow-on question from honourable Koya.  Have you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>got any plans, the amount has increased?  Is there any scheme plan? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not know what he means Mr. Chairman, but that is an 
<br/>allocation which used to be there.  That was not utilised so we reallocated that allocation which used 
<br/>to  be  there,  that  was  not  utilized  so  we  have  reallocated  that  and  it  is  at  the  same  place  in  the 
<br/>President’s Office.  That is why it is under “R”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, we understand it is under “R” but I just want to know 
<br/>in a nutshell, it shows an increase but we want to know how are you going to use it?  Have you any 
<br/>preplans or the money will just be sitting there or how did you get to that figure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You mean that $1.5 million?  Let me just explain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Head 1-1-1-8.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, that is what I am trying to explain to you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Do you have any scope of work, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Just  listen.    The  Executive  Office  and  the  Administration 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Block was….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Vijay Nath, you have raised your question. I think you have 
<br/>added  on  another  question  and  another  question.    I  am  trying  to  get  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance to reply to your first question.  Now, you are adding scope of work, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is pretty straight, Sir.  A sum of $500,000, this was under 
<br/></span><span>the 2022-2023 Budget under Head 50 to undertake the preparatory works, however no works has 
<br/>commenced.  Site inspection has been conducted by the Ministry of Public Works and are currently 
<br/>working on the initial drawings. The estimated cost of the project is $2.85 million as quoted by the 
<br/>Ministry of Works. This will include the demolition of the existing structure and reconstruction of 
<br/>the  contemporary  modern  Executive  Office  for  His  Excellency  and  an  Administration  Block  to 
<br/>support the responsibilities of the office.  The project will be undertaken in two phases hence $1.5

<br/>funds will be allocated the following year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have covered the General Administration.  Parliament will now vote 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on Head 1 – Office of the President. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 1 agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 2 – Office of the Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Are we on Programme 1-1 or the overall Head? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Programme 1-1, can we just have some clarification on SEG 6 – the 
<br/>Grant  to  Fiji  Servicemen’s  Aftercare  Fund.    This  was  not  there  before.    Can  we  just  have  some 
<br/>clarification of that huge increase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I can answer that.  This increase is due to the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Transfer of Grant to Fiji Servicemen Aftercare Fund of $14,947,350; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Transfer of Department for Public Enterprise, Information, Environment, National Archives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the Office of the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is just a transfer or reallocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Head  2-1-2(3),  it  says  that  overseas  travel  for  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  ($500,000).  We  can  see  that  there  is  no  change  as  alluded  to  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance.  He said that the travel allowance will decrease for all the Ministers 
<br/>including the Prime Minister. Why is it not reflecting there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are confusing with the allocation and the allowance rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What was announced in the Budget is that the travelling allowance and per diem will be reduced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Head  2-1-2(6),  the  provision  there  is  an  increase  in  the  provision  to 
<br/>Rotuma Council which is getting half-a-million dollars and again this is a clarification before I ask 
<br/>for an increase or decrease.  Then you have got Rabi Island Council ($155,000), Kioa Island Council 
<br/>($70,000); Grant to Melanesian Vasu-iTaukei ($100,000). The only increase is to the Rotuma Island 
<br/>Council.  Could  we  be  profit  to  the  reason  as  to  why  only  Rotuma  has  an  increase  and  the  other 
<br/>communities remain stable at one particular amount?  Can we just get an explanation on that, Sir?  
<br/>The question really is, is there a plan for the other communities and the reason for the increase to 
<br/></span><span>only Rotuma.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The reason for the increase is the submission that was made 
<br/>by  the  Rotuma  Council  and  we  appreciated  the  need  for  an  increase  in  the  grant  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>activities they plan.  What happened was for some reason, the grant was held back for almost like 
<br/></span><span>two years and a lot of activities that were supposed to be undertaken was not undertaken. So, it sort 
<br/></span><span>of reflects the legacy and that is why we have decided to increase it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, if I may also, is that the case with only Rotuma or the other councils 
<br/>also if there were some non-movement in there? Have they all been dealt with equally in terms of, 
<br/>were there submissions made by the other councils?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Head 2-1-2(10) – Small Grants Project ($2,000.000). Can the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister clarify what are these small grants project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, the former Prime Minister had made a lot of promises 
<br/>to some of the rural areas.  When we go around, they are asking the former government had promised 
<br/>us the seawall or that community centre.  We are catching up on those, I have not used this fund for 
<br/>any of the new projects.  They are carry overs from the last administration and we have added another 
<br/>$1 million to cater for what we will be funding this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What are the criteria placed for these small grants project?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, at the moment everyone applies.  They come through 
<br/>their village council, </span><span>bose vakoro</span><span> or community and we try and do that because it is outside the main 
<br/>budgetary allocation, so they come for the small grants and it is limited to $50,000 and below. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- This is the one you used for the kitchen and the sinks, et 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Community halls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, I believe honourable Prime Minister also wanted to 
<br/>explain about Programme 1-2(6) about Rotuma Island Council.  What the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance  has  explained  is  they  were  not  given  funds  for  the  past  couple  of  years.    I  believe  as  a 
<br/>Committee Member, I do understand they were not given the funds because their accounts were not 
<br/>up to-date.  If we are going to back pay them like this, are we setting the right precedence for other 
<br/>Councils as well where they do not provide accounts on time and then later on they get it.  Just a 
<br/>clarification on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  In fact, it was wrong the way the grant was withheld, so all 
<br/>those audit requirements, et cetera will be met before this is released.  What happened was, out of 
<br/>the annual grant of $500,000 that is allocated, 70 percent of the funds are diverted for development 
<br/>projects and only 30 percent is used to meet the operational cost.  We are aware of that and that will 
<br/>be taken care of before the funds are released.  As I had said to you, nothing happened for almost 
<br/>three years.  What we felt was once all that is cleared, this is the fund that is allocated and that will 
<br/>help them to catch up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, just in relation once again to Programme 1-2(6) on the 
<br/>Grant  to  the  Melanesian  </span><span>Vasu-i-Taukei</span><span>  ($100,000).    I  think  this  group  does  not  appear  to  have  a 
<br/>Council.  I do not see a Council here.  Is there any basis of the grant on the basis of the number of 
<br/></span><span>people who constitute this particular group?  Why I ask this, as a former Minister of Lands, I am 
<br/></span><span>aware of the issues that they face in the very communities they have.  I think there is a substantive 
<br/>number of people that we are talking about here.  Looking at the amount that is allocated to this grant, 
<br/>is it purely on the basis of a request or does it also take into account the total number of people who 
<br/>might be included in that group? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There is no increase in the grant, but the annual grant of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1389 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$100,000 is provided and 100 percent of the funding is diverted towards development.  A sum of 
<br/>$50,458 has been utilised to undertake the supply of fibre glass boat and engine for Coboi Village 
<br/>and  Macuata  and  supply  of  brush  cutter  for  Nabunikadamu,  Bua.    Currently,  the  Council  is 
<br/>undertaking  the  construction  of  fibre  glass  boats  while  awaiting  availability  of  stock  of  outboard 
<br/>engines from the supplier.  They do not have any other source of funding, so this is what we have 
<br/>provided and there was no additional request.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, it is a development grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-    I  just  wish  to  add  to  that.    It  is  basically  demand  driven.    When 
<br/>communities are organising themselves and they have to submit proposals, of course, there is quite 
<br/>a large number of people there, to support all of them will be quite significant.  For this year, we are 
<br/>trying to improve the mechanism to support them through the Council.  For the last couple of years 
<br/>there has not been any active Council, so we will be prioritising Council formation, meetings and 
<br/>coming up with priorities for each village.  But, of course, there are other sources of funds within the 
<br/>Government to also look after the Melanesian communities.  This is not the only fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  SEG  7  former  Prime  Ministers’  and  Presidents’ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Benefit ($170,000).  Would that also include the benefit for the immediate past Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- It was approved two weeks ago and the Secretary to Cabinet is liaising 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with their solicitors, they had put it to the lawyers before it came to my office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-    Mr.  Chairman,  on  SEG  5  I  have  heard  about  4R  and  5R,  just  a 
<br/>clarification, what is this 7R -  7R and Litter Awareness ($10,000)?  Just want to know, that is all, 
<br/>not a big deal.  Tell me what is that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Let  me  explain  to  him,  Sir.      It  is  a  programme  for  litter 
<br/>awareness programmes in all Divisions and 7R refers to rethink, you probably already heard about 
<br/>it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I heard about 4R and 5R. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me read it for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Yes, do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Rethink,  Refuse,  Reduce,  Repurpose,  Reuse,  Recycle, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recover.  Happy?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Remember.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are still in the microwave.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  4-1(8),    just  one  clarification  on  the 
<br/>Construction of Naboro Landfill - Stage 2 Cell 4 ($2,740,000).  If you can give us an update on the 
<br/>preparatory phase, like how far have we reached?  Are we at the construction phase or we are still at 
<br/>the preparatory phase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Desludging have not started.  Once they first finish Stage 1 and Cell

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2 for Stage 2 has also not started. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Honourable Prime Minister, through Mr. Chairman, have we done the 
<br/>preparatory work?  This means that we done the plan and everything else is passed and we are at the 
<br/>construction phase?  If that can be clarified? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The project, as you know is for the construction of the new 
<br/>Cell at the Landfill.  The total amount of the design and bill for Stage 2 Cell will cost about $6.85 
<br/>million. So, duration of the project is two years and 40 percent of the work will be carried out in the 
<br/>first year and the remaining work will roll over in the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So the tender has been called?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Will be called soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Okay, thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Chairman, Programme 4-1(7) - Environment Programmes - Northern 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Western Divisions ($8,000). Can you explain the Environment Programmes, please?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Can you repeat your question, honourable Member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Honourable Prime Minister, can you explain what are these Environment 
<br/>Programmes under Programme 4-1(7), an allocation of $8,000 to Northern and Western Divisions?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is written there?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- I am asking what are these programmes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Because they are new, they are appearing here for the first time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- I need an explanation on what are these programmes.  I am a new Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I am just asking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Yes.  It is showing here for the first time, there was nothing showing 
<br/>in the 2022-2023 Budget. It was handled by another Ministry, transferred to the Prime Minister’s 
<br/>portfolio now. That is why they are appearing here. The notes are there with you, honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If you look at SEG 7, the allocation is for all different things 
<br/>- compliance, natural resource information database, convention, et cetera.  If you want all the details 
<br/>I can give you, I can read it to all of you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable J. Usamate interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, it says Environment Programmes and then it lists all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>components. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He is asking about the first one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- First one, $8,000 allocation.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Northern and Western? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is the fund to cater for compliance and enforcement of all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>legislations in the Western and Northern Divisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  in  the  second  one  Compliance  and  Enforcement  of 
<br/>EIA. Sir, EIA is something that is a requirement right across all different types of segments. I am just 
<br/>looking at that figure of $20,000, given the importance of the environment and making sure that EIAs 
<br/>are  undertaken,  I  am  just  wondering  is  this  $20,000  adequate  to  cover  all  these  or  the  cost  for 
<br/>enforcing EIA are totally within this office or is funded elsewhere?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Your  government  had  only  $10,000  we  have  increased  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>another $10,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  That  is  why  I  am  asking.  I  did  not  ask  what  my  government  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paying, I was asking you whether it is adequate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is adequate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Ketan, you are taking us back to your earlier question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have already done that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, I have just one more question on a different SEG though but still 
<br/>with  that environment programme on SEG 7. Can the honourable Prime Minister, a very quickly 
<br/>explanation, right at the end you have got Management of Methyl Bromide, Hydrofluorocarbons and 
<br/>Phase Out Management.  What is the actual plan? I just did some clarification on what it is actually 
<br/>for.  The last line on SEG 7, honourable Prime Minister. I know it is a bit of a technical one but that 
<br/>is why I am not quite sure about what it is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Which one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Honourable  Minister  it  is  the  management  Methyl  Bromide, 
<br/>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and the Phase Out Management Plan.  All those three things, what does 
<br/>it entail?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- We are trying to phase out Methyl Bromide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is to cater for the implementation of the HFC Phase Out 
<br/>Management Plan and Programme outlined is in Fiji’s Hydrofluorocarbon Phase Out Management 
<br/>Plan Strategy, so that is where it comes from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  5-1(5)  -  </span><span>Fiji  in  Focus</span><span>,  the  current  budget 
<br/>being given to it is $138,962.  What I understand, Sir, there is a decrease from about $252,438.  Just 
<br/>a quick explanation on why the decrease?

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Photographic expenses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.PRASAD.- This covers for the fortnightly publishing of 26 issues of </span><span>Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Focus</span><span> and </span><span>Noda Viti</span><span> per year in the local dailies. So, that’s the cost for a year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- My question relates to the fact that there is a decrease of $252,438 from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what I understand subject to correction by you. I just need an explanation on the decrease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.PRASAD.- According to the tender that we have received, the cost is much 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lower than what it used to be. So, we have made sure that the allocation reflects that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Programme-6-1(9) - Purchase of Specialised Equipment ($150,000). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister tell us what are these equipment or what type of equipment?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is funding support for the procurement of conservation 
<br/>and  bookbinding  materials  from  overseas  supplies  and  associated  security  cost.    Items  will  be 
<br/>procured from </span><span>Archival Survival</span><span> in Australia and it includes about 12 items. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, I suggest for a decrease on the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Have you got any reason? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- The explanation, Mr. Chairman, is not sufficient as he did not give the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>breakdown.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  You  just  write  your  motion  and  send  it,  that  is  when  we  discuss  the 
<br/>motion.  You should be filing that with us before we on the Head and the SEG.    That is how we will 
<br/>do it from now onwards.  If you want it, you go through the Report and then you highlight the ones 
<br/>that you want an increase or decrease, so when we reach it, you are able to inform us that you have a 
<br/>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this one here, we will accept the one that you have just sent honourable Vijay Nath. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, just a clarification on what you just said over here 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as the Whip.  What if we ask for a clarification and we want to move a motion after that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, ask for a clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- And after clarification, if we want to move? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Wait, wait wait, he is asking me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Just for the clarification sake because we can give it before but 
<br/>after clarification from the relevant Minister, if we feel that we should increase or decrease, can we 
<br/>still give the amendment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Just  like  you  always  do  to  us  every  time.  We  reach  a  new  stage, 
<br/>sometimes when we file our motion, my predecessor does not want to take note of it.  He will say,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1393 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“we have taken care of that, it is finished, we are now onto the next one.”  So we are moving that 
<br/>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You were saying that it be decreased by $50,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  reason  being  that  the  honourable  Minister  failed  to  explain  the  amount  and  in  fact 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>coordinating with the increase given there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The reason? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think the Member is totally confused of what he wanted. I 
<br/>said  to  him  very  clearly  that  the  funding  will  support  the  procurement  of  conservation  and  book 
<br/>binding materials from overseas suppliers and associated security.  We have a very clear itemised 
<br/>thing for </span><span>Archival Survival</span><span>.  Let me just read it for his information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is archival folders, inter-living tissue, acid free corrugated board, archival boxes, document 
<br/>repair type, double side police leaves, Japanese paper, face mask, disposable gloves, archival and 
<br/>gloss, pamphlet boxes and we have worked out the cost.  The people who made this submission just 
<br/>wanted $150,000 so there is no basis for asking for a decrease because it is based on the submission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will put that to the vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, there is a problem.  When honourable Kirpal asked for a…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Hold on, honourable Vijay.  We will put that to the vote now because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that has come here by way of a motion and seconded by honourable Kirpal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, one clarification on SEG 7 on Consultancy Fees.  Can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we just have some explanation on what the Consultancy Fees are in relation to SEG 7 ($500,000)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In the previous budget, it was $750,000.  We have reduced it 
<br/>to $500,000 and this is sufficient for the activities required under this allocation.  That is why we 
<br/>have reduced it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is just consultancy within the department? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, and sort of includes payment for Pack Order to SPX, 
<br/></span><span>trustee for monitoring airfield trust account, Brussels Mission, valuation cost, real estate hire to sell 
<br/></span><span>the buses property, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you.  Can I ask you a second question, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Can we go first to, honourable Premila Kumar?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I am alright, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- So, you can raise your second question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you,  Sir.   Looking  at  SEG  10,  I  can  understand  the  Capital 
<br/>Construction Grants that are being given to these different organisations.  I am not too sure how Post 
<br/>Fiji Limited comes there for $500,000.  I was under the impression that they were doing their own 
<br/>funding.  I understand the money being given to  all of those organisations. Can I just have some 
<br/>clarity on that $500,000 being given to Post Fiji Limited? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, this is partial funding for the construction of the new 
<br/>Post Fiji Shop at Lomaloma in Vanuabalavu.  The total cost of constructing the new post shop at 
<br/>Lomaloma is expected to amount to $760,000 of which the Government is funding two-thirds of this 
<br/>cost.  Unfortunately, in 2016 the Lomaloma Post Office was completely damaged by </span><span>TC Winston.</span><span>
<br/>For this reason, Post Fiji returned to operating from its original small shop.  The construction of a 
<br/>new  and  bigger  shop  in  Lomaloma,  Vanuabalavu  will  greatly  assist  the  rural  communities  in 
<br/>Vanuabalavu to better access improved facility and purchase of stationery and essential groceries 
<br/>and, of course, to transact money to Viti Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  If there is any need for Lakeba too, please 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just see how it can be fixed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Lakeba will come next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The one in Lakeba was promised during the last government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I have a quick question, quick clarification again to the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister on SEG10  -  Biosecurity Authority of Fiji  (BAF) is  being  given  $1.2 
<br/>million and it is a jump from $500,000 from last year’s budget.  The $700,000 increase, the question 
<br/>is, what does that incorporate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, in 2023-2024, the Budgetary allocation will be provided 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to support the following projects: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Animal Disease Surveillance ($90,000).  The project aims to carry out Animal Disease 
<br/>Surveillance throughout  Fiji in order to identify the  presence  of exotic animal  pest  and 
<br/></span><span>disease and also to control and prevent the spread of animal pest and disease.  Already at 
<br/></span><span>present in Fiji with the emphasis on zoonotic diseases and diseases of economic relevance 
<br/>that may affect international trade.  Zoonotic is when the disease is transferred from animals 
<br/>to people. 
<br/>Biosecurity Authority of Fiji will carry out farm visits, animal pest and disease surveillance 
<br/>on terrestrial and aquatic animals, collect samples, test train and conduct awareness with 
<br/>relevant stakeholders including farmers, procure animal test kits and disinfectants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, would this not have been a negativity being 
<br/></span><span>undertaken by BAF in the initial budget of $500,000 earlier on, for this is now an additional activity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- This is an additional activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir, appreciate it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Sir, it is still related to the same question, further clarification.  As you 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1395 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have said that so many other things will be done, but why are we calling it capital grant? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- It is a capital grant because there are a number of capital projects that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are included there, so that is why we call it capital grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- But the explanation you have given Minister it was more to do with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the activities. So, that is why I am a bit confused, if you can clarify that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- The second one is the termites project of $300,000.  This project is to 
<br/>control and contain the spread of AST which are vigorously present in some parts of Lautoka and 
<br/>Labasa and also involved in the continued monitoring and surveillance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Just before I give the floor to honourable Ketan, you have a motion here? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- I withdraw it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Withdrawn it again? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Koroilavesau, this is your forte, you are very good in…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  That  is  why  I  am  being  quiet,  I  wanted  it  to  go  through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quickly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, this is a new item – termites.  We have just been told that 
<br/>the  termite  allocation  is  here  but  we  were  told  that  $3  million  was  allocated  for,  so  under  which 
<br/>activity is that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You looking for it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who is looking?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, no, I am asking him because he has just mentioned in response to 
<br/>honourable Premila that termite allocation is there but termite allocation we were told is $3 million.  
<br/>So, where is that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is not from the …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Exactly, so where is it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is in another Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you. So, when we will come to that, then we will address it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Honourable Bala was looking for $3 million or $5 million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- $3 million.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- For the whole thing?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Biosecurity  Authority  of  $1.2  million,  an  increase  of  $700,000;  Animal  Diseases 
<br/>Surveillance  $19,000,  the  termite,  they  came  in  during  the  time  when  you  were  Mayor  there, 
<br/>$300,000, Market Access $70,000, International Corporation $80,000, Non-commercial obligation 
<br/>$466,000, National Plant Health Surveillance $60,000 and Iguana in the North $434,000.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Honourable  Prime  Minister  through  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  honourable 
<br/>Premila asked about Programme 7-1(10) on the Biosecurity. I am not trying to have an argument or 
<br/>anything.  I just need a clarification, the amount here is $1.2 million but we were told that for termite 
<br/>allocation is $3 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Can I answer that, Mr. Chairman?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Anyone, as long as we get an answer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Sir,  $3  million  is  in  Head  50.  That  is  what  we  said  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, that is what I have been asking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is in Head 50. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, let me say something.  This is not the way the Minister 
<br/>should response.  They must at least have some respect for us.  I mean we are not sitting here for 
<br/>nothing.  I am just trying to add on what the honourable Assistant Minister has said on that particular 
<br/>activity and SEG; that is all. Why is there so much argument. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There is no argument on saying $3 million is in Head 50. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman,  that means my question is still not answered because 
<br/>my question was, it says here capital grant but if you are conducting surveillance, surveillance is not 
<br/>capital grant.  When the Minister mentioned that it is for termites then I understood that yes, probably 
<br/>something is being built, et cetera. So, if that can be further clarified as to why are you calling it 
<br/>capital grant when it is actually a surveillance work which is not a capital grant.  You are not building 
<br/>anything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Hold on, honourable Nath.  Honourable Premila is still not content with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the reply being given. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Minister of Finance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The component allocation was always under capital grant, so  
<br/></span><span>sometimes it is a combination of surveillance (building something) with equipment, et cetera so put 
<br/></span><span>it as capital grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Honourable  Minister,  you  will  understand  that  if  you  conduct  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>surveillance, it is an activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Most capital grants, honourable Member have components of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="108">Page 108</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1397 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operational  staff.    So,  when  you  say  capital  grant  for  Fiji  Roads  Authority,  there  are  always 
<br/>operational components.  That is why it is called capital grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this explanation is actually …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Like the maintenance of laboratory and other equipment is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>capital grant. The combinations is always there, but it is all under capital grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Okay.  Still not happy, but I will accept it.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just further explanation or clarification on that?  
<br/>Under  Independent  Bodies,  I  believe  up  in  front,  Biosecurity  has  been  handed  a  separate  budget 
<br/>altogether.  So,  why  does  this  appear  over  here?    According  to  what  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance explained that it can be used for operations but it is an independent body which actually gets 
<br/>a grant for operations.  So, it is basically not making sense why it is over here, and also operational 
<br/>grant is given to independent bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  is  what  I  explained.    It  is  capital  grant  but  what  the 
<br/>honourable Kumar was asking that there are components which does not look like that they are capital 
<br/>and that is why I said that most capital grants have operational components/activities and that is why 
<br/>it is listed like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- But SEG 6 has Operating Grant in it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is different.  See this is what I am saying. Capital grant 
<br/>is  capital  grant.  Some  activities  look  like  they  are  operational,  but  it  is  under  capital  grant  and 
<br/>operational grant is separate which includes emoluments, et cetera.  It was like that before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  The  explanation  given  by  the  honourable  Minister,  I  just  want  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>progress with things but I am really not happy with the response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well I cannot make you happy, if you do not accept that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, no because there is money involved and we are here to find out 
<br/>how that money will be  used, whether we should increase it, give more or decide to  base on the 
<br/>activities that will be carried out.  Someone says, “look we are going to carry out a surveillance.”  
<br/>Surveillance involves nothing, not really that kind of money to construct or to do all that.  So, if I…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I think the honourable Member is labouring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this point unnecessarily.  Let me just read what that surveillance is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, please do that, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- National plant help surveillance programme - plant, pest and 
<br/></span><span>disease  surveillance  monitoring,  the  purchase  of  laboratory  consumables  for  pest  and  diseases, 
<br/>diagnostic activities, local and referral laboratories, repairs, upgrading and maintenance of laboratory 
<br/>equipment; that is all capital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Right.  Thank you for you for your explanation.  That is precisely what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wanted rather than just surveillance.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what I said, it is a combination.  Capital grants always 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have operational components.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mention it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I mentioned it to you before and you do not want to believe it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are just prolonging it unnecessarily.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 8-1(7).  Honourable Prime Minister there are 
<br/>three portions - Fiji Climate Change Portal, Implementation of Fiji Climate Change Act ($5 million), 
<br/>and Australia Climate Change Support - NDC Implementation (DFAT).  These would two fundings 
<br/>that are coming in from our development partners and being given for this particular purpose and 
<br/>what are some of the activities that being undertaken with respect to the implementation of the Fiji 
<br/>Climate  Change  Act,  and  the  actual  NDC  implementation?    What  used  to  be  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy, it has actually moved to the Prime Minister’s Office. That is why the clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Fiji Climate Change Portals?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mainly the second and third one. The first part of the question was the 
<br/>funding is from the EU and also from DFAT and what are some of the activities being undertaken 
<br/>within the implementation of the Fiji Climate Change Act and NDC Implementation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- For the financial year, the whole programme is $30 million for the 
<br/>next three years. The allocation will be used to support entry into force of the Climate Change Act, 
<br/>a  comprehensive  legal  basis  enacted  in  2021  during  your  time  in  government  to  support  Fiji’s 
<br/>sustainable  development  objectives,  long  term  climate  ambition,  net-zero  nation  targets  and 
<br/>commitment to protecting our environment.    You know all these because these are your words.  Fiji-
<br/>Australia Climate Change Support, that is the DFAT one.  Fiji -Australia Climate Change Support 
<br/>Programme, funding allocation will help support our implementation of the concept notes outlined 
<br/>in Fijian DC investment plan, Fiji National Climate Finance Strategy, and support projects that the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition had been involved with in the last three years or four years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I was going to raise questions in here as well.  This 
<br/>is an area that in my Budget address I did raise this about potential areas where we can invest target, 
<br/>particularly in terms of energy and transportation sector as well because in the NDC Implementation 
<br/>these are two key sectors that we need to target.  I am also interested because that is quite a significant 
<br/>amount in the implementation of the Fiji Climate Change Act.  I thank the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>for the explanation, but is it focused more on adaptation plans or is it focused more on mitigation 
<br/>plans?  That is the question that I have because it is quite a significant amount of money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Seeking clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Clarification on whether we are concentrating on implementation or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>adaptation?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Adaptation and mitigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- The actual allocation or just in general? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- All.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1399 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  In general, because we have our National Adaptation Plan, but of 
<br/>course in terms of the lowering of the emission, we need more of mitigation so that we can reduce 
<br/>this.  I am just asking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, as he would now, we have those ambitious in the old 
<br/>term when we were looking at those developments of hydro and solar affordable programmes.  We 
<br/>have those online now, and the funding also online.  The funds allocated here is for us to go and 
<br/>implement those and continue right through the year in the implementation and maybe start on some 
<br/>of the surveys.  You would be aware of the ongoing programme now in Ovalau and is now being 
<br/>funded and stores landed last week.  Those are things that are covered under this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Chairman, just one question and along the same line.  I think the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister has identified some of the things that we do.  We have a renewable energy 
<br/>target of electricity 100 percent by the year 2030.  But we also have some bigger targets for zero 
<br/>carbon by the year 2050 where the big NDCs that we have are in the transport sector.  This is the 
<br/>bigger  challenge,  I  think  for  electricity  we  will  get  there.    I  am  just  wondering  in  the  NDC 
<br/>Implementation, we have targets specifically for renewable increase in the transport sector.  I am just 
<br/>wondering whether you are aware whether that would be included in this NDC Implementation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I do not know whether we will immediately implement those but the 
<br/>policies are in place for us to discourage the importation of those old vehicles and old ships that we 
<br/>are getting, and we would like to get to the next generation of environmentally friendly propulsion 
<br/>systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 2 – Office of the Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 2 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 3 – Office of the Attorney-General  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  I  have  a  motion  here  by  honourable  Maharaj  and  that  is  Head  3  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decreased by $1 million on Programme 1-1-1 Personal Emoluments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Chairman,  before  I  actually  move  that  motion,  can  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General explain the allocation, why that $1 million is for established staff and 
<br/>who are going to be recruited because that is an additional $1 million to the Office of the Attorney-
<br/>General?  There is an increase of $1.077 million for established staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Here it is decreased, you are saying increased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  My  motion  should  read,  it  should  be  decreased  by  $1  million, 
<br/>provided if the explanation is not satisfactory.  If the explanation is satisfactory, I will withdraw the 
<br/>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I can explain that generally for other SEGS as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are like on a fishing trip, honourable Alvick, throwing one and you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are pulling the line this side as well.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, if I can just explain this generally this might 
<br/>help them for other Heads.  We are restoring FNPF contribution to 10 percent, so generally for all 
<br/>Heads, there will be an increase in emoluments.  Some will have bigger  increases, and some will 
<br/>have smaller.  That is why there is an increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Chairman,  for  this  particular  Head,  $1  million  seems  to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quite excessive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, you did not get what I said.  I had said, generally there 
<br/>will be an increase for emoluments right throughout the Heads. In some cases, it will be more than 
<br/>what  is  just  the  FNPF  because  we  are  giving  more  positions,  for  example,  for  the  Office  of  the 
<br/>Solicitor-General,  we  have  given  15  additional  positions.  So,  that  is  why,  but  what  you  will 
<br/>throughout all the Heads is an increase in emoluments which caters for the FNPF contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, with that explanation given, I withdraw my motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman,  I have a question on Programme  -1-1, the question is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>twofold, so that I do not go back and forth, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My first question is to do with Programme-1-1(5) on the Mercy Commission, just a progress 
<br/>on  the  Mercy  Commission  activities  and  also  for  SEG  7  with  respect  the  Fiji  Law  Reform 
<br/>Commission which I understand, honourable Usamate, has also got a question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, just an update on those two activities - how far, where are they and what is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the plan, just for us to make an assessment whether we give it more or ask for it to be taken away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, for Mercy Commission, there is really no set timetable 
<br/>in the past Administration. What have decided to do it on a quarterly basis.  The fund is for members 
<br/>who are required to meet four times in a year.  The funds are for their sitting allowance - 350 per 
<br/>member  for  four  members;  refreshment’  travel  expenses  as  there  is  a  member  who  travels  from 
<br/>Labasa; accommodation; taxi fare for member staying in Labasa and ancillary cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Are you saying that you are now going to have  a quarterly sitting of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mercy Commission? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Confirmed quarterly sitting that is why the allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- And it depends to on the  application.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Alright.  The second part with the Fiji Law Reform Commission? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- What is your question on the Fiji Law Reform? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The same question, just the activities being been undertaken, how far , 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where are they, what is the plan, et cetera? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Sir, $388,160 to cater for the Fiji Law Reform approved positions 
<br/>that have not been funded. The Director, there will be a new Chairperson, two Legal Officers, Senior 
<br/>Secretary, Executive Officers; and $11,000 for administration purposes.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1401 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, under the same activity - SEG 5, we have something 
<br/>there in terms of drafting of laws - $30,000 and then under Programme 1-1(7) on Page 29.  You also 
<br/>have a figure of $195,000 for revision of laws. Are these two completely separate things because 
<br/>they seem almost related to me - those two amounts of money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  They  are  different.    As  you  can  understand,  a  lot  of  laws  will  be 
<br/>reviewed. We have a small team but the volume of work is huge so at times, we will have to recruit 
<br/>special expertise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  revision  will  also  be  covered  probably  with  Fiji  Law  Reform  but  those  are  for 
<br/>engagement of our people with specialised expertise just to expedite or add value to the work that 
<br/>will be provided by our drafting team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  So, revision of law is for outsourcing of the service?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Usamate, all you asked was the difference between review 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and revision? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And the drafting, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I think the honourable Attorney-General has explained that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I apologise, I did not fully understand that. I thought they were talking 
<br/>about almost the same thing.  I am just clarifying the revision of law - whether that is consultancy 
<br/>for those who will come outside and do the work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  In fact, if I can just add to that, as explained the Solicitor-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General’s Office was badly understaffed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, I know, but I am just asking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, we have allocated some of this funding, like drafting of 
<br/>laws, for example.  The work itself requires very specialised skill and as the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General explained, that is why there are different allocations for different activities to support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Are they for the same thing or different thing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Drafting is different.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Different things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, just on the back of what honourable Usamate has raised, 
<br/>if you are saying with respect to drafting of laws it is $30,000 extra really because it is a specialised 
<br/>skill and $30,000 with respect to all the laws that are being drafted and that specialised skill being 
<br/>used,  is  that  enough,  honourable  Attorney-General,  bearing  in  mind  if  you  bring  him  in  from 
<br/></span><span>overseas?  I do not think we have specialised skilled drafters here.  That is quite a minuscule amount 
<br/></span><span>of money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- That has been discussed by the team and  that is the amount that has 
<br/>been put forward.  We even received some quite interesting amounts, much lower than what some of 
<br/>the locals provide.

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  just  in  regards  to  SEG  7  also,  Fiji  Law  Reform 
<br/>Commission with an allocation of $400,000. It is noted that there was a significant increase from last 
<br/>year’s  allocation.    Last  year  the  allocation  was  $100,000  and  this  year,  the  Fiji  Law  Reform 
<br/>Commission is receiving $400,000.  Just on verification and the details,  have you expanded your 
<br/>operations in terms of the Fiji Law Reform Commission?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You already explained that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes, the Fiji Law Reform was defunct. We now setting it up with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>totally new staff with a Director, Chairman, Principal Legal Officers and Support Staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  My  last  question,  Sir.  So,  this  is  just  the  operational  cost  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>emolument cost are included in SEG 1 for the members of the Law Reform Commission? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- No, it covers everything.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the total budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head No. 3 – Office of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Head 3 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Head 4 – Ministry for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-1, I think honourable Koya has got a motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, I think we have now gone past it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme-1-2?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A.MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-2(9), Financial Software Upgrade of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$14 million.  I seek explanation as to the kind of software and which Departments will be covered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is a new expenditure allocation and the cost breakdown 
<br/>is payroll software of about $6.5 million;  FEMIS software is $6.5 million; and logistics is $1 million.  
<br/>In fact, the request for tender for the supply and installation of the maintenance of the payroll system 
<br/>was called on 28</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I can tell you is that, our payroll system is so old, in fact, it is a big risk and as soon as 
<br/>I got in and one of the things that came to me from the Ministry staff was the urgent need for this 
<br/></span><span>upgrade.  So, we had the technical assistance by way of a consultant from ADB and that is what we 
<br/></span><span>want to address urgently because if someday it collapses, we will not be able to pay anyone, including 
<br/>Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  person  who  was  handling  is  almost  85  years  old  and  if  something  happens  to  him 
<br/>tomorrow,  the  whole  system  could  be  at  risk.    This  is  a  very  urgent  expenditure,  and  I  cannot 
<br/>understand why it was not upgraded and re-done, so that is the allocation. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1403 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, just a further clarification on that, honourable Minister.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know $14 million has been well spent on the actual upgrade.  I am not an accountant, so is it a 
<br/>system that will take a long while to set up or is it simply just a plug and play? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, I think that is a good question.  The current  system  is 
<br/>manual, so we have the done the technical assistance, all the work has been done.  As I have said, the 
<br/>tender has already been called and we hope that this will be done as soon as possible within this 
<br/>financial year.  Right now, all our budgeting process is manual, this is also manual, so this upgrade 
<br/>will  ensure  that  we  digitise  and  have  a  very  efficient  well-secured  payroll  system  as  well  as  a 
<br/>budgeting system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, in view of there being a lot of cyber problems and issues 
<br/>that occur worldwide, does that include a back-up system that you would have again when something 
<br/>that you would have more knowledge of disappears? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Yes,  of  course.    These  days,  any  software  ideally  and 
<br/>technically  is  required  to  have  a  back-up  system,  appropriate  security,  but  it  is  always  a  risky 
<br/>proposition.  But for this one, definitely that will be part of the requirement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our FEMIS is 20 years old and we are hoping that this will be changed in the next 12 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  As  you  have  mentioned  about  the  tenders  that  have  gone  out,  is  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>locally or locally and overseas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Before the tender, I can also tell you that these days,  a lot of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back up is available on cloud, so the system will allow that as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tender was issued locally, and I have not seen the final approval by the Tender Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or anything yet.  It has already been tendered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  another  clarification  on  the  same  SEG,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister just mentioned that FEMIS is going to be replaced with this new software or 
<br/>FEMIS will remain? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The whole system of FEMIS is manually driven right now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, once we move on to the new software, it will be all electronic - digitised, that is the idea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Will it only cover the Ministries or it will cover Municipal Councils 
<br/>and Provincial Councils as well because there is a lot of issues with regards to the accountability of 
<br/>these Councils? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let us fix this first and then we will look at Local Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, the same question to the honourable Minister, this kind of 
<br/></span><span>programme is often assisted by the donor partners.  Were any donor partners approached as we have 
<br/></span><span>seen in past years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are still on Activity 2, am I right? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Yes, Mr. Chairman, the question on the Financial Software Upgrade. The 
<br/>explanation by the honourable Minister is alright but I was seeking further information on whether 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="115">Page 115</a></div>
<div><span>1404 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any  other  donor  partners  were  approached  because  our  donor  partners  have  often  assisted  on  the 
<br/>software upgrade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I had already said that the technical assistance is from ADB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Head  4-1-3(7)  –  Implementation    of  New  Budget 
<br/>System.  Given that you are coming up with a new accounting system, are you going to implement 
<br/>these things simultaneously - a new finance system and a new budget system, or does one follow 
<br/>after the other?  These two big expenses, the $14 million in the other one and the $2 million in this 
<br/>one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, they have been done simultaneously because as I have 
<br/>said to you, right now the whole budget process, they have to use excel software and in this day and 
<br/>age, we are doing a budget almost manually.  In the past, you would know honourable Usamate that 
<br/>we have had errors in the actual estimates and partly because everything is done manually, so this 
<br/>will improve the system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-10(7)  Apprenticeship  ($50,000).    I 
<br/>cannot really relate how apprenticeship funds are sitting in this Strategic Planning Office General 
<br/>Administration  because  apprenticeship  is  normally  for  the  development  of  trade  workers  or 
<br/>technicians.  Can we just have some explanation on why Apprenticeship funding is doing here, just 
<br/>for clarification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is to cater to for apprenticeship programme for tertiary 
<br/>students.  Within the Ministry for Finance, what happened over the years, we used to have individual 
<br/>standalone Ministries of national planning and Development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially  over  the  years,  there  was  no  planning  departments  or  unit,  so  we  are  re-
<br/>establishing  the  Central  Planning  Office  which  will  also  have  components  of  monitoring  and 
<br/>evaluation.  Right now, there is very little coordination between different Government Departments 
<br/>and one of the things that we found out is the uptake of expenditure up to end of July, the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture, for example, would have spent only about 38 percent of its total budgeted expenditure.  
<br/>There is no monitoring and evaluation, apart from the Ministry of Social Welfare, so this is a new 
<br/>initiative for us… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is apprenticeship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, and the Government Departments are also losing a lot of 
<br/>staff as well.  We lost about 30 percent of our staff in 2022 and we will probably lose more, so we 
<br/>are trying to bring in internship/apprenticeship programme, to ensure that we build some capacity 
<br/>there as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Just  one  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Chairman.    Traditionally, 
<br/>apprenticeships are for trade workers or technician workers.  I think from your explanation, you are 
<br/>also talking about office workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  used  to  have  a  fund  in  Government  to  train  technical  trade  apprentices  in 
<br/>Government, in Government Shipping, Government Printing and also in PWD.  Those funds used to 
<br/>be there to develop these apprentices.  So, I can see this might be just a coordination fund but probably 
<br/>in the future, if you are going to develop apprentices, would that be something that you will consider? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It will also include some areas, like HR and planning within 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="116">Page 116</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1405 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry.  So, we will have apprenticeship programmes there as well so some of that will go for 
<br/>paying allowances, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Internship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, internship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Programme 1-10(5)    – Personal  Protective Equipment  ($5,000), 
<br/>can the honourable Minister explain what are these going to be used for in the Strategic Planning 
<br/>Office?  It would have made sense during COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This will be protective equipment to execute monitoring and 
<br/>site visits for strategic planning office staff because as I have said, this is a new initiative to coordinate 
<br/>the activities with different Ministries and monitor expenditure and priorities, especially in the area 
<br/>of capital projects or capital expenditure because a lot of wastage that we are finding now has taken 
<br/>place because there is total lack of monitoring, evaluation, procurement is not done, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We went to Wainikoro Hospital and I asked the x-ray person, how is the work going.  She 
<br/>said that for three months, x-ray was not done and the only reason why the x-ray machine was not 
<br/>working was because the battery was not procured.  The battery life is known for two years, so some 
<br/>of those monitoring and evaluating and making sure that systems work is very important.  So, site 
<br/>visit inspections are important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 1-10(SEG 7)-Policy Advisors ($300,000) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Formulation of New National Development Plan ($200,000).  Are they interlinked for one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are both interlinked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- So, the Policy Advisors are there for the National Development Plan? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Why is there a separation, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You mean the $50,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No, you have specifically put out policy advisors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, because those would be hiring of policy advisors within 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Planning Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Coming from overseas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Local people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, I mean, if we have to get people from overseas, we will, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but right now the idea is to …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Recruit policy advisors?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- With respect to the formulation of the New National Development Plan, 
<br/>is this a completely new development plan being formulated or is it an amendment to the current 
<br/>National Development Plans that we have? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is something that we will have to look at but, obviously, 
<br/>we will take into account what is there and what needs to be upgraded, updated, depending with the 
<br/>appropriate statistics and data.  That is how it is done. So, if you are moving from one development 
<br/>plan, if you are revising a development plan, you obviously take that into account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Is this somehow related also to the Singapore Corporation people that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are here? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is different.

<div><span>Head 5 – Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(10)  –  Village  Improvement 
<br/>Scheme. The honourable Minister has stated that this is on a one-third two-thirds basis but as you are 
<br/>aware, Mr. Chairman, there are 14 provinces in Fiji.  Is this on a ‘first come first serve’ basis or there 
<br/>is a guideline to, sort of, address the issues of fairness?  Just a question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>through you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  The  iTaukei  Affairs  is  undertaking  the  village  profiling  exercise  in  the 
<br/>village and from that data, we will form the development of the integrated village development.  The 
<br/>amount will only go up to $10,000 when we started because it is firstly introduced for each village. 
<br/>The plan was for $50,000.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we are doing is it is a one-third contribution from the community and two-thirds is given 
<br/>by the Government on the understanding that they are not giving the </span><span>soli ni yasana</span><span> (provincial levy), 
<br/>the amount that they collect can be provided as their one-third contribution and the Government will 
<br/>give the two-thirds from that $2 million.  It is a first come first serve and we will also set up the 
<br/>criteria.  We will work with  the Ministry of Rural  Development  because they have already run a 
<br/>similar programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme-1-1(7)  -  Feasibility  Study-Setup  of 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei Financial Institution ($100,000). Honourable Minister, just a little bit of an explanation on 
<br/>that, is  it something  completely new or has it already been given a feasibility  study,  et  cetera, or 
<br/>where are we with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.-  This  is a new budget  item which the Ministry is  directed to  conduct  the 
<br/>forum meeting annually to allow the coordination approach towards capturing the challenges, risk

<div><span>opportunities and aspirations of the resource owners on the utilisation of their resources. We have 
<br/>done one this year…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Sir,  I  think  that  is  the  wrong  one.  It  is  for  the  setup  of  the  iTaukei 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Institution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- This is a feasibility study for the set-up of the Rural iTaukei Bank.  This is 
<br/>part of the economic empowerment for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> which Cabinet had endorsed recently.  The Rural 
<br/>Bank is an integrated component of the Solesolevaki Framework. It will facilitate access to capital 
<br/>for those who want to do land development or any resource development. This has been tasked in 
<br/>providing the scope of this work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  iTaukei  Executive  Forum  will  meet  and  discuss  it  further  the  criteria  that  will  be 
<br/>followed, and how they will move forward.  They are in the initial stage, but we will get a feasibility 
<br/>study on the plan.  They have planned for this a few years back, but they have now this is the right 
<br/>time for them to start. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Chairman, can I ask a question first on Programme 1-
<br/>1(6) – Turaga-ni-Koro Allowance and deal with the motion later?  I would like to ask the honourable 
<br/>Minister for iTaukei Affairs, and I will speak in the vernacular.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Head 5-1-1(6) - Vanua Leadership Allowance be increased by another $777,600. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Niudamu, your motion is quite difficult to follow because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here it says to be left out of Head 5, and now you want the increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- It should be increased, Mr. Chairman.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-</span><span> </span><span>I hope I am clear on that. If you are asking for an increase, show it in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I apologise, honourable Niudamu, I understand this is fairly new.  I think there is a couple of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forms there - one for increase and one for decrease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Whip! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  No, MPs training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Training?  No, this is hands-on training.   You have amended that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Yes, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You want an increase? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- I would like an increase, Mr. Chairman, just to double that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amount.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Chairman, I beg to second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, I will now put this motion to the vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on Amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have another motion from honourable Bulitavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Head 5-1-1(10) – iTaukei Land Development ($4,000,000) be increased by $16 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Chairman, when this allocation was first introduced by the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government  it  was  $10  million  but  when  COVID-19  came,  it  was  reduced.    Given  the 
<br/>amount of interest by most </span><span>mataqali</span><span> who want to subdivide their land, I think one of the requirements 
<br/>of developing land - land clearance, drainage and roading, the cost is too high.  The more money the 
<br/>more landowners can benefit and that is why I am suggesting that there should be an increase to a 
<br/>total of $20 million so that many </span><span>mataqali </span><span>in the Western Division and Northern Division can benefit 
<br/>from this and they do not have to wait. This is for the betterment of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  a  good  motion  but  from  your  experience,  the 
<br/></span><span>amount of money that you allocated in the previous Government for this was not taken up because it 
<br/>involves a lot of planning and a lot of negotiations, so we have learned from your lesson and we have 
<br/>kept it at this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And you were worried about the deficit too.

<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on.  Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I thought that we are still on Programme 1-2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, honourable Usamate is correct.  We are like going in a merry-go-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>round now.  We down to 10, then to 6 and then down again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No, Sir, we were talking about Activity 1 just now.  Now, we are on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Activity 2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are right and we are still on Programme 1-2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-2(10) - Survey of Un-surveyed Lands 
<br/>($300,000).  Can I have a clarification if the Province of Lau has been completed, in particular the 
<br/>island of Lakeba? I know that Lau is one of the Provinces that are late.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Lau, Namosi, all the same, they have not been surveyed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- NLC survey? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, Survey of Un-surveyed Land, I assumed that that is for all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provinces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. CHAIRMAN.-  No,  I am  just raising that  with  honourable Nalusima,  I recollect that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Namosi has not been, especially the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of </span><span>Nuku</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, I understand for Lau, the work is still in progress. I can report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back to honourable Usamate in regards to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Can  I  clarify  whether  Lakeba  is  included  this  year  and  it  will  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- I can come back to you in regards to Lakeba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Koroilavesau, you have a motion here, Sir, Head 5-1-2(10) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>– Demarcation of Un-surveyed Lands ($125,000)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  motion  is  basically  in  relation  to 
<br/>unsurveyed land. I have travelled around Fiji for the past years, and this is one the issues that have 
<br/>stopped  development  within  the  Fijian  villages  -  the  demarcation  of  land.  That  is  why  I  am 
<br/>suggesting, especially in Lau where a lot of islands and villages are unsurveyed. There is  always 
<br/>disputes between the landowners. There was a school or secondary school that was supposed to be 
<br/>built there but the survey has not been done and the demarcation causes risk between the landowning 
<br/></span><span>Units. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just suggesting, I know the Government will defeat it but it will be taken notice of that 
<br/>in  the  next  round  of  budget,  if  this  could  be  looked  at.  It  is  SEG10  and  involves  all  those  three 
<br/>allocations.  I am suggesting that allocation for unsurveyed land be increased to $500,000; survey of 
<br/>unsurveyed land and digital  mapping be increased to  $200,000. So, I am suggesting $1.2 million 
<br/>increase in that SEG. I know they will defeat my motion but at least they should take note of it.

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We will take note of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are not going to put that to the vote because you have taken note. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I suggest we just put it on vote so that there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is someone here that wants to second my motion and then we can disperse of my motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- So, you have  two seconders one has withdrawn. So, will now put that

<div><span>Question on amendment put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-1(7)  Traditional  Knowledge  and 
<br/>Expression of Culture Legislation – Awareness and Implementaton Programme ($100,000).  That is 
<br/>something that we have talked about for a number of years now. I know that has finally been done. I 
<br/>would like to have some elaboration on what you mean by awareness and implementation programme 
<br/>of this particular legislation.  I think it is something that is of particular interest to a lot of us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.VASU.- For this one, it was just approved in Cabinet this year and the paper is with 
<br/>the Office of the Solicitor-General to do the final details of the work. What is written here is to finance 
<br/>the legislation which will provide for registration, ownership and protection of traditional knowledge 
<br/>and traditional culture and expression.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once established, traditional communities will have a legal recourse to claim against a person, 
<br/>company  or  an  institution  they  feel  is  misusing  their  traditional  design  –  totem  or  traditional 
<br/>knowledge. That is what written here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So, I assume this is for drafting the legislation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Because the way it is written here is awareness and implementation. 
<br/>From that, I thought the legislation was ready and about to be implemented.  So I assume this is just 
<br/>for drafting the legislation or law, is that correct? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  I am  not  sure because here it says implementation,  his  explanation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suggests drafting.  So, I am a bit confused.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- We are aware that this particular legislation, the Bill has been pending 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for more than 10 years. So, we are trying to perfect that and thereafter, do the awareness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, a quick question on Programme-2-2(10).  I am 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>getting too fast, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No, it is alright, you have taken us forward.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1411 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This SEG is twofold. There is Rehabilitation of Levuka World Heritage 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Structure ($1,500,000) and upgrade of Fiji Museum ($1,062,000).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to the first portion, which structure are we referring to – is this an upgrade that 
<br/>is ongoing or about to start?  The second part of that question, with respect to that, Fiji Museum has 
<br/>actually got a grant on its own and the upgrade of that particular museum in last year’s budget was 
<br/>$718,000.  How  far  have  we  gone  with  that  and  why  is  it  that  the  upgrade  is  now  going  cost 
<br/>$1,062,000?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- The first it is an ongoing one. This one is closed to the old wharf in Levuka, 
<br/>the old MH Building. They are working on that. When I visited the last time, they were putting up 
<br/>the roof.  They renewed the inside of the building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regards to the second one, they have requested for it and we have continued upgrade the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>current Museum here in Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  perhaps  this  is  just  a  comment  and  may  be  the 
<br/>Minister can look into this as well. While sit on Levuka, in almost every meeting of the Lomaiviti 
<br/>Provincial Council, comes up with the old Levuka Hospital. It is an eyesore, and it is also becoming 
<br/>a health hazard. I am not familiar with the law concerning heritage sites but that has been an issue 
<br/>that comes up frequently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Activity 2-2(7) - Preservation of Historical Monuments ($150,000), there are some issues 
<br/>coming up also from the communities and perhaps, honourable Minister, I just want to bring to your 
<br/>attention is just the process, particularly when they are going to  an  </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>community because  I 
<br/>came across one in Veinuqa, Tailevu.  Honourable Ditoka can help you with that.  They just came 
<br/>straight into the piece of land, demarcated the area and according to the </span><span>Liuliu ni Yavusa</span><span>, it is such a 
<br/>big area and they, sort of, denying them access.  I just want to bring this to your attention.  It is good 
<br/>that we have the allocation in here but perhaps, the process that needs to be followed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Point taken, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I have two questions.  First one is SEG 7 - Preservation 
<br/>of  Historical  Monuments,  if  the  honourable  Minister  can  highlight,  particularly  which  historical 
<br/>monuments will be fixed with $150,000 and then I will ask my second question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  This  funding  increase  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  conditions  and 
<br/>requirements regarding the old Levuka World Heritage Sites and stated in the 5 Years  and 20 Years 
<br/>National Development Plan traditional historical sites, is the funding for the preservation of historical 
<br/>monuments in the site in Levuka World Heritage Town, Ovalau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  will help  the historical  sites  to  be upgraded  and preserved for the local  and overseas 
<br/>visitors to the Heritage Sites.  We will support the historical monument and site that can provide a 
<br/>base  for  community-based  heritage  tourism  project,  will  ensure  the  creation  of  necessary 
<br/>infrastructure  to  support  heritage  tourism  on  Ovalau,  will  support  the  historical  building  that  can 
<br/></span><span>support its function and its residence and user that will also be enjoyed by visitors to the site.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  will  complement  each  other  to  create  an  overall  atmosphere  on  the  conservation  of 
<br/>heritage, resources, from being lost and will also boost tourism, boost moral for heritage preservation 
<br/>in the local community.  Will support identification of heritage sites with place, name and information 
<br/>panels, will create a better presentations and promotions for the heritage resources, to be viewed and 
<br/>enjoyed by all visitors on the island.  It is mostly focused in Levuka.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you Minister for your very detailed explanation.  My question 
<br/>was very specific because if you go to Levuka, there are many historical sites and the preservation 
<br/>work  had  already  started  on  several  sites,  like  Deed  of  Cession  and  few  others.    This  particular 
<br/>amount ($150,000) being allocated for this financial year, which sites will be fixed?  When you come 
<br/>up with $150,000, surely you have got something in mind, so which particular site will you fix? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- May I assist the honourable Minister, it is the Deed of Cession 
<br/>site,  World  Heritage  Commemoration  Plaque,  Pigeon  Post  Fountain,  199  steps,  European  War 
<br/>Memorial, Nasau Park Foundation, Fijian War Memorial and replanting of the public spaces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  reason  why  I  asked  because  Heritage  and  Arts 
<br/>previously was under Ministry of Education and the list the Minister read out is impossible to fix 
<br/>with $150,000.  It may be for particular specific ones.  Why I am asking this question is because one 
<br/>way of maximising is by working with Levuka Town Council where they can also put in their money 
<br/>and then you can get few more monuments preserved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  next  question,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  on  Programme  2-2(6)  Grant  to  Cultural  Centres 
<br/>($150,072).  Previously, we did not have Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs, so because we did not 
<br/>have that Ministry, all multicultural centres were looked after by Heritage and Arts.  Now, that we 
<br/>have Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs, why is these multicultural centres still with Heritage and Arts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  can  answer  that  before  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister, I know the  honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs did not have enough time to go 
<br/>into the details.  We have planned to have a group which will be looking at what the Ministry of 
<br/>Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  would  do  to  look  at  all  the  other  ethnic  groups,  their  cultural  activities, 
<br/>languages and all that, and there will be a team that will be set up in this financial year, so that by the 
<br/>time  we  come  to  the  next  Budget,  we  would  have  a  proper  structure,  activities,  planned  for  the 
<br/>Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs.  That is why the allocation when we come to it, you will see is a 
<br/>very small amount at the moment for some specific projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  The  question  was  to  do  with  cultural  centres.    Honourable  Premila 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kumar was raising question on multicultural centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That will be part of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Anyway, he is quite content with the explanation given. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-2(7) - Culture and Education ($37,000), there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is an increase in the budget.  Could the Honourable Minister explain further? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- These are breakdown for and the additional allocation, consultation on the 
<br/>final draft of the Fiji National Strategy and Monitoring Evaluation and review of cultural programme, 
<br/>cultural centres, training of administrators, support for art education in the four Divisions - this is a 
<br/>pilot  school,  stakeholders  consultations  on  cultural  entrepreneurship,  curriculum,  composing  of 
<br/>cultural and educational tv programme with Hindi, Urdu, Rabi, Kioa and Melanesian communities; 
<br/></span><span>the Solomons and the Vanuatu for $37,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, just a couple of follow up question in regards to the question 
<br/>by honourable Ketan Lal.  The honourable Minister mentioned that including in that allocation was 
<br/>the training.  But  then you have another allocation still in SEG 7 which  is  Planning, Monitoring, 
<br/>Evaluation, Learning and Training, an allocation of $10,000.  What is the difference?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1413 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister are you clear with the question being raised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- A follow-up question from honourable Ketan Lal regarding SEG 7.  In the 
<br/>answer that you gave, honourable Minister, that included in that increase is the training. But then in 
<br/>another allocation, you have $10,000 for planning, monitoring, evaluation, learning and training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.VASU.- It is a quite a long explanation here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- No, just brief! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- In order to effectively carryout the requirement as per the above mentioned 
<br/>documents, the monitoring, evaluation and learning encompass adaptable framework with process, 
<br/>best practices and tools that are strategically tailored for the uniqueness of the organisation and set 
<br/>the  specific  initiatives.    The  purpose  of  this  framework  is  to  provide  consistent  approach  to  the 
<br/>monitoring and the evaluation of the department programmes and projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the sufficient data and information is captured to reveal the progress and impact of the 
<br/>department’s work programme.  Lessons learned will also be used to inform best practice guideline 
<br/>which will be brought back to the department for improvement purpose.  Monitoring and evaluation 
<br/>help improve performance and achieve results.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More precisely, the overall purpose of monitoring and  evaluation  is the  measurement and 
<br/>assessment of performance in order to move the effectiveness and management, the outcome and 
<br/>output known as the development result. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance is defined as progress towards the achievement of result. As part of the emphasis 
<br/>on results, it improves the need to demonstrate performance in placing new demands on monitoring 
<br/>and evaluation.  Monitoring and evaluation focuses on assessing inputs and implementation process.  
<br/>The focus is on assessing the contribution of various factors to a given development outcome. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, can I ask this question in vernacular, please.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turaga na Minisita, koya na</span><span> Programme 2-2(10), </span><span>upgradetaki nodatou vale ni yaya makawa

<br/>dua na vanua levu se tu sara tu ga vaka ca.  Koya oya se in phase tiko na kena vakavinavinakataki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Just a follow up question on the education and monitoring and 
<br/>evaluation, who does the training, where is the training carried out and who are the participants for 
<br/>this training?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Honourable Member, can I come back to  you so that I can get the details 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I can inform you on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- There is some disconnect and if there is something wrong, I think this is 
<br/>the best time to correct it.  Honourable Premila Kumar raised a very important and valid point and, 
<br/>that is, in regards to grant to cultural centre.  Now, you have an established Ministry for Multi-Ethnic.  
<br/>Why can we just not transfer that to Multi-Ethnic?

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what I explained to you that the whole structure… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is going to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is going to happen but I told you, it will happen this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I have a motion from honourable Ketan Lal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To increase the allocation in Head 5-2-2(7) – Community outreach from $6,000 to $50,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  increase  the  allocation  in  Head  5-2-2(1)  and  (7)  –  Personal  Emoluments  and  Special 
<br/>Expenditure from $200,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRPAL.- I second the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the reason for asking this increase is, once we 
<br/>went to Levuka for the Heritage Bill, there was no established office for the Heritage Department in 
<br/>Levuka.  It was a concern that was raised by residents of Levuka that they need an established office 
<br/>because that is only heritage site that is listed with UNESCO and this is the only site in Fiji which 
<br/>deals  with  humans.    So,  they  face  a  lot  of  difficulties  in  communicating  directly  because  the 
<br/>Department is based in Suva.  So, the increase is to have one or two established staff and a fully 
<br/>furbished office in Levuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, we can consider that in next year’s budget but we have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to conduct a good consultations with them, then we can look at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Motion is withdrawn.  We will now vote on Head 5 – Ministry of iTaukei 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 5 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 6 – Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(7)Infrastructure  Development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Project (50,000).  Can the honourable Minister clarify that, please? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1415 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, you will understand that there are projects that are 
<br/>currently running, like the MESK, BlackRock, which are the coordinated by the Ministry and started 
<br/>during your term.   It looks after also other special areas.  We need these funds to actually run the 
<br/>Committee that coordinates the conduct of these projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  I thought that there is  a new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>project altogether. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is the same one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(6) - Operating Grants and Transfer, 
<br/>there is a decrease of $12 million.  Can the honourable Minister explain what was the $12 million 
<br/>allocation for and if the job has been completed?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is quite simple.  Remember, we said that earlier, it has gone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the Prime Minister’s Office.  That is the Aftercare.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(7)  –  National  Security  Defence 
<br/>Review.  If I am  correct, I think this exercise had been undertaken previously under Commander 
<br/>Teleni  and  former  Minister,  Natuva.    I  am  just  wondering  is  this  a  review  of  the  work  that  was 
<br/>undertaken then, or is it something completely new? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Member. I think I have 
<br/>explained this a number of times in Parliament.  Reviews are conducted at times when new leadership 
<br/>comes and want to relook at the focus.  Obviously, one of those things that we first do is to look at 
<br/>what others did previously and that will become part of it.  But it is a new process that looks at our 
<br/>needs now, because it continues to evolve.  There is a need to come out more clearly in the strategic 
<br/>way that we want to, to get how we refit.  So, it includes all of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(7) - Human Trafficking ($10,000).  Is it a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>celebration or what is it about, because it just says human trafficking - $10,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  one  of  our  functions  is  actually  looking  at  the 
<br/>conduct of human trafficking in Fiji so that work is vested within the office.  It is a whole of nation 
<br/>committee that looks at this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need this amount to coordinate events only, but much of the responsibility really lies with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>every other department that does the work - for the police, Immigration, and a few others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  This is more of an operational allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, this is general administration.  This is just to run the office, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have nothing really.  There is a few people who do it – run the secretariat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, again, I am speeding it up to Programme 2, if I can?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 2-1(5) – E-Transaction Cost ($5,000).  Honourable Minister, the question is two- 
<br/>fold;  one  with  respect  to  SEG  5  -  E-  Transaction  Cost  ($5,000)  and  the  second  is  on  SEG  7  - 
<br/>Digitisation and Modernisation of Fiji’s Immigration Systems and Processes ($1,126,746), I think 
<br/>that is a grant component from DFAT.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second part of it, the question really is, almost of us have blue electronic passports.  Does 
<br/>this  particular  provision  that  has  been  given,  mean  that  we  will  be  able  to  just  simply  swipe  our 
<br/>passports and walk in when we go in and out of Fiji?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  can  I  just  get  the  first  one  first,  it  is  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>electronic transactions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Yes, the question really is, is it part of the same thing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, no, electronic transaction remember you go there and they 
<br/>have got EFTPOS and we hire those from the banks, so there is a fee to pay, and we need that money 
<br/>to pay the banks for the use of their services.  What is the second part of your question and which 
<br/>SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- SEG 7, digitisation, will it mean that we will be able to just go through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because generally in most countries, you swipe and go through.  It is all electronically done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.-  Yes, it is all leading towards that so things like, get passenger 
<br/>information  and  the  Australian  Government  is  helping  us  in  terms  of  the  ICT  infrastructure  for 
<br/>document management system within the Department.  So, this is an ongoing process and as you 
<br/>would  understand  that  much  of  the  work  that  we  do  is  still  partly  manual.    So,  to  be  able  to 
<br/>accommodate all these other work that needs the digitised system, IOMS is helping us to do that just 
<br/>to make the workflow better, particularly for online application and processing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- So this  is not actually the hard way that we will be sitting at the airport? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, not yet, not quite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  How  far  off  are  we  there  because  that  would  be  part  of  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>modernisation... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, that is correct.  Because we have now digital passports, those 
<br/>things actually help us to capture the information.  Much of the build-up also is around it.  Much of 
<br/>it is, at the moment, there is allocation here for Integrated Border Management System (IBMS) from 
<br/>Sri Lanka that we currently use.  We are now transitioning to the IOM which is under MIDAS.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of that work, MIDAS through the United Nations, is helping us to acquire these new 
<br/>capabilities  including  what  you  are  describing.    As  the  Department  becomes  more  digitalised,  it 
<br/>allows us to do all these, including online applications and processing and this is helping us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Within this modernisation component, what part of it does this relate to 
<br/>the other jurisdictions where we , for example, in Australia where they have the machines.  Are we 
<br/>now  up  to  speed  with  respect  to  our  modernisation  and  being  able  to  walk  through  into  Sydney 
<br/>Airport and just swipe your passport? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, not yet, unfortunately, not for the passports that we carry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We still need to go through the old system that they have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Manually? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes.  This is what we are talking to Ministry of Home Affairs 
<br/>about whether we can access to those systems.  That is all part of the plan in the pipeline to be able

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1417 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to benefit from that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- One of the reasons why I asked is because it is a DFAT funded thing, I 
<br/>thought it might include Australian component of us being able to travel to Australia, is we swipe 
<br/>our passports and get through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  We  are  doing  all  the  asking  and  much  of  it  is  in  their  own 
<br/>jurisdiction to allow us.  Once our systems are more compatible and expectable perhaps, then they 
<br/>may be allowed us after our systems have integrated for them to read and access openly.  You would 
<br/>understand the matters of sovereignty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  We  have  a  motion  here  by  honourable  Ketan  Lal,  that  Head  6  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decreased by $100,000 in Programme 2-1(8) - Renovation of Suva and Nadi Safe House ($250,000).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another one here, honourable Ketan you want a withdrawal too?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I am moving the motion of the deportation cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The motion is Head 6 to be increased by $20,000 in Programme 2-1(5) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the deportation cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J. NIUDAMU.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is to do with deportation, </span><span>Turaga na Tui Nalawa</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, we need to increase the allocation by another $20,000 or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in future be increased in criminal activities by non-citizens of Fiji that we might have to deport.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now vote on the amendment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 6  – Ministry of Home Affairs and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 6 agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 7 - Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  1-3(10)  -  Workmen’s  Compensation. 
<br/>These is a huge reduction.  So, just a matter of interest if the honourable Minister responsible can 
<br/></span><span>explain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, I think honourable Bala is aware that up to 2019, all of 
<br/>those Government workers who are either in jail or passed away, there is Workmen’s Compensation 
<br/>for them. After 2019, it has been passed on to ACCF. So, that is why whatever is left is there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, but there are still pending cases which have not been determined.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Those pending cases will be covered by that because so many cases 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been reduced.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- $400,000 is enough to cover.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Alright, that is what I wanted to know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One general person which relates to this Ministry, I have been going through the pages but I 
<br/>cannot find anywhere, this is in regards to the allocation for the Review of the National Minimum 
<br/>Wage.  I know they have said that it will be done next year but where is the allocation for the review?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- You will find it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Is that the answer, Mr. Chairman. Just look at him!   He is saying, “you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will get it.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I will look for it and answer you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is part of the operational budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- So, how much is there? It is not a specific amount. The review exercise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be part of the operational budget for the Ministry, as it was done in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Remember, how we used to address this, it is either yes or no.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, I used to give in detail. You remember, Sir, you were sitting here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme -1-4? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Honourable  Minister  this  is  to  do  with 
<br/>Programme1-4(7),  there  is  $230,000  made  available  to  Foreign  Employment  Mobility  Services; 
<br/>Attachment Allowance of $187,600; Fijian Volunteer Scheme for $194,000; and the Pacific Labour 
<br/>Scheme $250,000.  All of these fundings, in a very quick fashion, Sir, can you just explain what the 
<br/>actual funding does for those earnings? For example, Foreign Employment Mobility Services, what 
<br/>does that entail.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- The cost is to meet demand under the Labour Mobility Programmes to 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand. The allocation includes the operational and logistical cost of mobilising 
<br/>workers, including cost of hiring training venues, medical cost and hiring transportation.  This also 
<br/>includes the cost of planned Ministerial Visits to Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, I hear him saying ‘operation cost’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- We are talking about SEG 7 - Foreign Employment Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- All of them, what is an attachment allowance?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Attachment allowance, Mr. Chairman, the allocation is for creation of 
<br/>employment opportunities for local unemployed citizens to do attachment with employers as part of 
<br/>their capacity building towards full employment. This also includes cost of facilitating lives skills

<div><span>training, employment skills training and counselling. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The last one, honourable Minister, is the Pacific Labour Scheme that is 
<br/>$250,000.  In reality, under the Labour Scheme, why is it that we are spending that much money 
<br/>within the Ministry to facilitate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, the location is for an appointment of a country Liaison 
<br/>Officer and other operation costs in Australian, considering over 4,000 workers in Australia. The 
<br/>country Liaison Officer will be responsible for pastoral welfare support for workers on the ground, 
<br/>as well as promoting Fiji to the employers in Australia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, since it is a new allocation and new appointment, I would 
<br/>like to know specifically how much you will be paying to the Liaison Officer that you are going to 
<br/>appoint? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The package for the Liaison  Officer, it will be someone who is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>original Fijian now a resident of Austria. It will be between AUD80,000 and AUD100,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me the opportunity. I am glad to 
<br/>see that the Ministry is still very heavily involved in productivity services and the membership of 
<br/>Asian Productivity Organisation.  One of the big tasks in any country is to enhance productivity, and 
<br/>I am glad to see here that we have the implementation of a National Productivity Master Plan.  I 
<br/>would  assume  that  if  you  have  a  plan,  it  would  be  linked  to  an  increase  in  productivity  and  that 
<br/>increase would be measured somehow and related back to this plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But given that productivity is such a big thing, it boggles my mind that you try to improve 
<br/>productivity through some plan that is only going up to $40,000.  Is this just meetings or is it linked 
<br/>to  an  actual  improvement  in  GDP  per  capita,  or  something  measured  like  that  or  total  factor 
<br/>productivity or whatever it is?  What can we achieve in productivity in only $40,000?  It boggles my 
<br/>mind.  Sir, maybe the honourable Minister might explain that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is $40,000 cost to revitalise productivity 
<br/>movement in country through the implementation of the master plan, cost for implementation of the 
<br/>master  plan  stakeholder  engagement,  national  awareness  on  productivity  movement,  house 
<br/>productivity talks, symposium, workshops and appointment of a productivity champion in public and 
<br/>private sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  It is just linkage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- This is the initial one – revitalising. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- … it targets on productivity improvement.  Do you have a plan within 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10 years to improve productivity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- That will be the next step, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Alright, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu, </span><span>I look forward to seeing that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, there is an increase in the expenses of ILO Convention – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SEG -5.  Maybe this time, 20 or 30 delegation going.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- No, no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your problem? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Thirty was in someone else’s agenda, not ours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Chairman,  ILO  Convention  –  cost  of  the  112th  International  Conference,  honourable 
<br/>Bala is aware that this is an annual affair.  Every June, the ILC is convened and every government is 
<br/>required to pay for the Tripartite Delegation.  That is for the employer, the worker and the government 
<br/>delegate and government advisor.  We are taking only that specific number, whereas in the 2015 and 
<br/>2016 when some other people were going, a big number were going. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, further clarification on that, itis just for that one particular 
<br/>conference, I mean, jokes aside, normally the employer representative, the commerce representative 
<br/>and the Ministry staff.  What I am saying is that there is an increase from $30,000 to $130,000.  This 
<br/>is what I am saying.  You do not have to give me and tell me all those ‘bullshit’ that we were taking 
<br/>those people.  Just give me an answer, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, this is not bullshit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You withdraw your ‘bullshit’, honourable Bala.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, you need to withdraw, please, Standing Order 62.  Withdraw, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  I  will,  but  you  never  withdraw  when  you  were  eating  aeroplane.    I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdraw, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Minister, he has withdrawn that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Parliament  will  now  vote  on  Head  7  –  Ministry  of  Employment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Productivity and Industrial Relations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 7 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 8 – Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(6), about three-quarters of the way down, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just some clarifications on a heading - Comprehensive Nuclear Test.  What is that for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Member.    The  Comprehensive 
<br/>Nuclear Test budget, there is no change in this budgetary allocation.  The budget of $23,780 is to 
<br/>cater for the Fijian Government’s contributions on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  The 
<br/>Test  Ban  Treaty  organisation  works  to  hinder  the  development  of  nuclear  weapons  and  in  the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1421 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons and preventing the proliferation of nuclear 
<br/>weapons.  The Treaty Organisation’s ultimate aim is for the elimination of nuclear weapons and Fiji 
<br/>stands  for  global  peace  and  security  and,  therefore,  it  is  important  for  Fiji  that  we  remain  in  the 
<br/>CNTBTO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Might  I  suggest,  honourable  Assistant  Minister,  that  that  heading  be 
<br/>changed to reflect what you have just said because it says ‘Comprehensive Nuclear Test”,  and that 
<br/>is it.  It should be towards the Treaty, it is just our suggestion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, noted, </span><span>vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  2-1(7),    I  just  need  a  bit  of 
<br/>clarification  from  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  and  also  the  Foreign  Affairs  on  the  
<br/>announcement of the budget by the honourable Minister of on the  reopening of the four Missions 
<br/>and he had stated that $4 million was allocated for the reopening of the Missions in Washington, 
<br/>Papua New Guinea and Malaysia, including the setup of the proposed one in Israel.  I just need a bit 
<br/>of clarification on that.  We do not see a set up component of that on Israel in here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The reason why we have not included that is because we felt 
<br/>that by the time all the issues are explored, we will not be able to do that in the next financial year.  
<br/>These are immediate -Washington, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, so that is why it is not shown 
<br/>in this one.  But if all the work is done, then there are funding in Head 50 which could be utilised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- So we can assume at this point in time, honourable Minister, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it has to be considered later? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, that is right, because the preparatory work will continue 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- I am sure our friends from SODELPA are part of the component 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and will not be unhappy on this, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- You had announced it on the Budget Day, we all thought that that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was going to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is why we announced it, that it is going to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just a quick one with respect to Programme 2-1(8) – 
<br/>Refurbishment  of  Overseas  Missions  and  we  have  given  it  $2.2  million.    Does  this  mean  all  our 
<br/>missions are being refurbished or specific ones that have been refurbished? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- We will be looking at all but firstly those that are being closed for 
<br/>some time, for refurbishment.   A property is still there in Washington that will have to be upgraded.  
<br/></span><span>I  have  just  been  to  the  New  Zealand  one  which  needs  a  lot  of  work.  I  have  not  seen  the  one  in 
<br/></span><span>Australia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, we also have one in Brussels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Yes, it is still ours, not manned but it is probably that ones that we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be looking at also.

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Prime Minister, just one question, a lot of the issues that 
<br/>we have been saying from our end towards the Government is that a lot of things were microwaved, 
<br/>but I was just trying to think that goods things that not be microwaved, has the Ministry for Foreign 
<br/>Affairs considered the kind of approach that is  being  used by  countries like  Israel  and Singapore 
<br/>where their ambassadors and high commissions do not come and stay in country but they come when 
<br/>needed.  I was wondering if that is an approach that you are also considering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Like roving, based in Fiji.  That is also being considered but these are 
<br/>old traditional positions and locations.  Out of those we send our ambassadors out to the neighboring 
<br/>countries.  So, based in Malaysia he would have been looking after the other areas.  Now, recently 
<br/>while Malaysia was still there, we established Indonesia whereas before we could accredit the one in 
<br/>Malaysia to Singapore or went directly to Indonesia or directly from Fiji but yes, it is still an option. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I was just thinking in case when  you do not have a physical mission, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it might be considered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Prime Minister just quickly too, with respect again to those 
<br/>refurbishment  of  the  missions.    You  say  it  is  to  do  with  all  the  properties  that  we  own  in  all  the 
<br/>different missions that we have.  Is that a sufficient amount, Sir, because it is quite an expensive 
<br/>exercise to refurbish all the missions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- On prioritization basis, it will be the ones that has been left vacant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that will have to be upgraded quickly for the deployment of the personnel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 8 – Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 8 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 9 – Independent Bodies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- A question.

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not sure what he is asking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- No, hold on.  You hold, you talk too much.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You in one of those Independent Bodies. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Question, Mr. Chairman.  Programme 1-1(6) – Human Rights and Anti-
<br/>Discrimination Commission.  There are a lot of criminal activities and people are neglected by the 
<br/>authority.  There is an increase, can the honourable Minister explain further on that, please?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is not seeking clarification on the figures that has been allocated.
