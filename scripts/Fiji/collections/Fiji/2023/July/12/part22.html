<h3>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- SEG 7.</h3>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- SEG 7. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the the CID Allowance which has 
<br/>an allocation of $50,200. The Allowance is payable to Police Officers that are entitled to wear civilian 
<br/>clothing to perform special tasks required by the Head of the Department.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is the Expenses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, that is the Allowance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  CID  Expenses  to  facilitate  the  payment  of  criminal  informants  to  assist  in  the 
<br/>investigation of serious crimes that have slim lead but are of national interest.  CID personnel have 
<br/>been increasing together with their responsibilities of detection rate. This will also provide any urgent 
<br/>assistance on and criminal investigation and awareness and training. That is the difference. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, I went through all the Activities, perhaps it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a general question, I have two questions.  I do not know where it fits into the Activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Still on Allowance because it is not there with the PSRU nor with the CID - police that handle 
<br/>drugs. They are exposed to a lot, it is not only narcotics even </span><span>marijuana</span><span>.  I hope that they 
<br/>would have come up with this because given the terrain and as you understand in the military 
<br/>they have the height, diving and death allowance, whether we call it a Hazard Allowance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>The big risk also when we deal with drugs.  When they store it for exhibit, the stench is just 
<br/>horrible. We feel sorry for those that look after these storage facilities because it will have 
<br/>implications.  This is something that we have been raising with the Police if they can come 
<br/>up with it.  While still on that also, honourable Minister, the problem that the Police have with 
<br/>exhibit storage.  Whether we go into containers or given the Police Stations that we have were 
<br/>meant for the activities back in those days. I am just going through the Activities very quickly 
<br/>and I do not know whether it fits into here but I just want to raise it with you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I note that and those things that you are saying 
<br/>are actually important. In terms of the high risk, there are special allowances for the other places or 
<br/>things like CID and forensics have allowance for those.  I do not think there is any allowance for 
<br/>Police Special Response Unit (PSRU) going to Kadavu, that is just normal Police operations.  That 
<br/>is something we have actually considered but not specifically covered for.  I know in PSRU there are 
<br/>Extra Duty Allowance, that may not be adequate but as a special category, they should do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exhibits are a problem, they are definitely a problem.  I can tell you for sure when I went to 
<br/>Tukavesi, in the Conference Room which is about a quarter of the side of this side of the gallery, 
<br/>there were like 50 </span><span>marijuana</span><span> plants (sorry honourable Member).  They are thinking up smart ways 
<br/></span><span>to deal with those, I think they are coming through seeking legal advice from the Solicitor-General 
<br/></span><span>on how to be able to capture the evidence on site without having to bring it to Suva or to Court so 
<br/>that the Judicial Department with the laws would allow for that evidence to be amissible in Court on 
<br/>a criminal trial because otherwise they have to bring all these to Court and carried with you. It is just 
<br/>too heavy but definitely it is a big problem but I think as we build capacity, I must admit the new 
<br/>police stations do have the spaces to store those like in Nadi and Lautoka but they will get filled up

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quickly.  It is never enough but it is something that we need to continue to chase, so containering 
<br/>them is an option.  The points are noted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-4(5) - Crime Prevention Strategy listed as 
<br/>$10,000.  If I could just refer you to that.  But you got Crime Prevention Strategy as $10,000 for the 
<br/>Southern Division, Crime Prevention Strategy as $5,00 for the Eastern Division but nothing for the 
<br/>West or for the North. Is there a particular reason why it is only two divisions being given something 
<br/>under strategy and what does that entail? I see the West and the North do not have that particular 
<br/>provision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SEG 5 says Crime Prevention Strategy of $10,000 for the Southern Division and if you turn 
<br/>the  page,  Sir,  for  the  Eastern  Division  (I  have  to  go  forward  to  actually  do  the  comparison) 
<br/>Programme 1-5(5) there is Crime Prevention Strategy of $5,000 for the Eastern Division. But for 
<br/>Western Division, which is Activity 6 and for the Northern Division, which is Activity 7, you have 
<br/>zero.  Is there a reason or is that people from the North and the West are good people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is based on what they require in different divisions.  There 
<br/>are other expenses in some divisions, so it depends on what they need.  That is how this has been 
<br/>said,  
<br/>allocated  because  when  we  had  discussions,  we  did  ask 
<br/>“we just need this for this.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- What does the strategy entail, honourable Minister? Is it education? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  think  it  is  part  of  the  Duavata  Awareness.    It  is  called  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strategy, but it just focusses on Duavata.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Would it not be the same on each Division? That is the point, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Still unfair to the two Divisions.  If you are going to do the work in two 
<br/>of them and not on the two others. The hard question is what does it entail and why is it that it is only 
<br/>two divisions that are getting it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Usually  Crime  Prevention  Strategy  really  is  to  plan,  conduct 
<br/>proactive programmes by organising quick fixing and long-term alleviation of prevalent offences, 
<br/>relevant  scenarios will dictate roadmap towards reduction in  crime, engaging  the community and 
<br/>other stakeholders including the Duavata as the honourable Minister of Finance had alluded to. So 
<br/>those are some of the activities.  As submitted by the Force, they are doing this in Divisions that are 
<br/>funded. So, obviously, the other two do not have but I have to find out for you whether some reasons 
<br/>why it is not captured in this budget.  Maybe they are more law-abiding people, they need not to do 
<br/>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- West people are like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 20 – Fiji Police Forces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 20 agreed to.

<div><span>SCHEDULE I 
<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>Translation of the Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts’ 
<br/>iTaukei speech in response to the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 (Ref: Pages 1358-1360] 
<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise to speak in support of the Budget delivered by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister of Finance on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June this year.   First and foremost, I would like to congratulate the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  and  his  team,  as  well  as  the  members  of  the  Fiscal  Review  Committee,  for 
<br/>putting together and delivering the first Coalition Government Budget.  We should be thankful that 
<br/>it was crafted with a lot of ingenuity – a well thought-out and balanced Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, no Budget has and will satisfy all the citizens in a country. So, we must unite, 
<br/>be resilient and support the work of trying to build up a new foundation and economic status of our 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The strengthening of our current economic strategy will be good in the near future.  This is a 
<br/>Budget  for  the  new  Fiji,  so  we  must  work  together  to  improve  the  financial  development  and 
<br/>economic growth of our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I sincerely acknowledge the budget allocated to few sectors of Government, in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education  Sector,  $148.2  million  was  allocated  for  scholarships,  the  exemption  of 
<br/>TELS debt repayment by 53,700 students and the teaching of language and culture in 
<br/>schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Health  Sector,  I  sincerely  appreciate  the  increase  in  budgetary  allocation  for  the 
<br/>Ministry of Health.  It will better serve the public, improve health infrastructure around 
<br/>Fiji and will also increase the workers’ pay.  Health workers will be ready to address 
<br/>any health issues in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture Sector, I appreciate the increase in budgetary allocation to the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture  from  $57  million  to  $95  million.    It  will  assist  in  land  cultivation  for 
<br/>farmers, address food security and assist in the economic growth of the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection,  I  sincerely  appreciate  the 
<br/>budgetary allocation for the elderly and pensioners, as well as consideration given to 
<br/>women, the young girls and children in their different allocations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing Sector and Local Government, our sincere appreciation on the reconvening of 
<br/>the Municipal Elections as people look forward to be elected as representatives of their 
<br/>towns and cities, and the need to properly address the issues on informal settlements 
<br/>which include </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> who came from the islands and rural areas around Fiji to settle 
<br/>in our towns and cities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer my sincere appreciation to the effort given in monitoring 
<br/>and implementing the Budget in the last six months, which has enabled the Ministry of iTaukei to 
<br/>carry out most of its activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to acknowledge the 2023-2024 Budget.  There has been an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase in the budgetary allocation of the Ministry of iTaukei from $15.4 million to $38.6 million,
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="153">Page 153</a></div>
<div><span>ii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an increase of $23.3 million as compared to the budgetary allocation in the previous year.  This is an 
<br/>indication of trying to uplift the living standard and wellbeing of the iTaukei community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry will conduct a strategic review on three of its important Institutions 
<br/>–  the  iTaukei  Lands  Trust  Board,  iTaukei  Lands  and  Fisheries  Commission  and  the  iTaukei 
<br/>Administration.    Important  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  reviewing  its  legislations,  and  it  must  be 
<br/>reviewed to be in line with the challenges and changes faced today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, $300,000 has been allocated to the iTLTB to fund its review and allocation from 
<br/>Government will fund for the review the iTaukei Administration and iTaukei Lands and Fisheries 
<br/>Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  iTaukei  resource  owners  need  to  participate  in  the  economic  drive  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>country.  This was the aim of the Resource Owners Forum in March this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Economic Summit do acknowledge the request from the resource owners and it 
<br/>is incorporated in the National Budget.  So, for the first time in our National Budget, $100,00 has 
<br/>been allocated to implement this initiative of the Resource Owners Forum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  my  sincere  appreciation  also  to  the  $4  million  allocation  given  to  Ministry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which used to be allocated to the Office of the Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the issue raised by the Opposition Member, honourable 
<br/>Bulitavu.  I need to confirm that a Surveyor Section is currently under the Ministry of iTaukei.  They 
<br/>have assisted requests from </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, especially those who cannot fund the cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTaukei Trust Fund will assist in the entrepreneur initiatives, they will assist land iTaukei 
<br/>Resource Owners in regard to financial project management.  I have stressed to staff the importance 
<br/>of proper management of this budgetary allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a great challenge faced by the Ministry is the request from the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>to clearly 
<br/>demarcate their land boundaries.  Some requests that it be surveyed and have a digital map for village 
<br/>boundaries.  The  problem  is  that  the  Surveyor  Section  under  the  iTaukei  Land  and  Fisheries 
<br/>Commission are using old and archaic equipment.  The allocation $250,000 will be used to purchase 
<br/>new equipment to solve this problem.  The Ministry and </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners sincerely appreciate this 
<br/>allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry will focus on improving the livelihoods of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  After 15 
<br/>years,  Village  Improvement  Plan  will  be  reinstated.  There  are  funds  in  the  2023-234  Budget  for 
<br/>improvement of village infrastructure.  Villages will give one-third and Government will provide the 
<br/>two-thirds assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With reference to honourable Maharaj’s question, we will be working together with the Rural 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Maritime Development in assisting those living in settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Cabinet  has  endorsed  the  Consolidated  Development  Framework  for  the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  The central idea is to empower the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, with less dependence on Government. A mid-
<br/>term target is to set up an iTaukei Bank that will facilitate capital access for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and $100,00 
<br/>is being allocated to do a feasibility study. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  </span><span>Vanua</span><span>  governance  will  be  the  critical  link  to  development.    Without  strong 
<br/></span><span>vanua </span><span>governance, all developments above will be hindered. </span><span>Vanua</span><span> governance is on the decline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="154">Page 154</a></div>
<div><span>iii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, 53 percent of all </span><span>Liuliu ni Yavusa</span><span> are vacant. This means that more than half of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>are leaderless.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanua</span><span> governance is the foundation for </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communal living. The </span><span>Liuliu ni Yavusa</span><span> will 
<br/>be  given  an  allowance  of  $100  per  month  in  the  next  financial  year,  to  assist  in  their  traditional 
<br/>obligations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Turaga ni Koro and Mata ni Tikina allowance will also increase.  Sir, $2.1 
<br/>million has been allocated for their allowance, an increase of $641,000, as compared to the previous 
<br/>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the desire of the Coalition Government is to minimize </span><span>vanua</span><span> obligations for the 
<br/>development of Provinces. Therefore, Government has allocated $10.8 million to replace provincial 
<br/>levies, which is an increase of $6.5 million from the last Budget.  The idea is to allow the collection 
<br/>of levies from villagers to be channeled to village and community development, as stipulated in the 
<br/>iTaukei Administration policy and legislation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these are the programmes that have allocations in the Budget, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Village Guideline; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>National Action plan Against Gender Violence;  
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community-Based Integrated Natural Resource Management Project; 
<br/>Review of iTaukei Land and Fisheires Commission Organisational Structure; 
<br/>Increase in the number of participants for Traditional Leadership Course; 
<br/>Rehabilitation work at the Levuka Heritage Site; and 
<br/>Refurbishment of the Fiji Museum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as per my above statement, no budget will accommodate the needs of everyone.  
<br/>The Coalition Government is now ready to serve the people of Fiji.  We need to work together and 
<br/>unite to bring about a better Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I need to inform the honourable Leader of the Opposition and Opposition Members that the 
<br/>Ministry  will  properly  manage  its  budgetary  allocation.    The  Ministry  opens  its  doors  for  the 
<br/>Opposition Members to come on board and assist in the improvement of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> livelihood.  After 
<br/>our  time  of  service,  we  will  be  at  peace,  knowing  that  we  have  done  our  part  for  the  iTaukei 
<br/>community.  
<br/></span></div>
