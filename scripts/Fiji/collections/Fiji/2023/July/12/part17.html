<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2023-2024 APPROPRIATION BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, my fellow 
<br/>Fijians present here today and those watching this Parliamentary session live; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide my response and support the 2023-2024 Budget.  I also 
<br/>wish to join previous speakers in congratulating and thanking the honourable Prime Minister for his 
<br/>vision and leadership. I also wish to thank the honourable Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics for the very well consulted and prepared Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to extent my deepest sympathy for the loss of Filomoni Tikoi, 
<br/>originally  from  Nasau  in  Wainibuka.  The  fellow  officer  who  have  been  serving  at  the  Vunisea 
<br/>Agriculture Station and also Joseva Turagasau Rawace, originally from Nakawakawa in Wainunu, 
<br/>Bua, who had served at Naduruloulou Agriculture Station.  To Mrs. Tikoi and Mrs. Turagasau and 
<br/>your families, we send our deepest condolences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the Budget for the New Fiji, the Budget for Rebuilding our Future 
<br/>Together, a Budget that will provide relieve to many, a Budget that will meet the needs of the rural 
<br/>population, a Budget that will provide opportunities to our younger generation and a Budget that will 
<br/>impact  the  lives  of  our  fellow  Fijians.    This  Budget  will,  once  again,  promote  our  reliance  on 
<br/>agriculture, not only for income generation, but more as a source of livelihood, contributing to our 
<br/>national economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had received a lot of very positive comments on the Budget that is before 
<br/>us,  comments  from  farmers,  market  vendors,  exporters,  agro-input  suppliers,  comments  from  the 
<br/>general public, especially the rural communities.  They are very confident with the budget, and they 
<br/>are committed to the Ministry in reviving the agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to record at this point in time that in the last six months of this year, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1317 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  had  spent  bulk  of  my  time  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  and  concerned  groups  on  how  the 
<br/>agriculture sector can be taken back on track.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  rural  farmers  believe  that  they  had  been  deprived  from  required  support  from 
<br/>Government to maximise their benefits from agriculture. This had been the reason for the low growth 
<br/>in the agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to make known that in previous years, most of the funding for the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture may have been targeted at areas that has not really made impact to the growth of the 
<br/>agriculture  sector.  This  includes,  but  not  limited  to  initiatives  that  are  sustainable  and  can  meet 
<br/>domestic demands - hotels, agro-processing and the export markets.  The impact of climate change 
<br/>to agricultural production had not been evaluated well in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very happy to assure you that the Ministry of Agriculture will be rolling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out programmes that will counter the effect of climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture’s direction in Fiji was guided by the 2022 Strategic Development 
<br/>Plan.  Because of the inability to align well to the SDP, performance of the agricultural sector has 
<br/>been very badly affected.  Let me draw our attention to areas which we will be assisting in our next 
<br/>budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Dairy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji still imports around $99 million worth of dairy products. The 
<br/>annual demand for liquid milk is 24 million litres and we are producing only 29 percent of the milk 
<br/>in the formal sector.  Moreover, this is worsened by poor genetics, old infrastructure and poor hygiene 
<br/>and nutrition in our dairy farms. This is a disaster, and the dairy industry is on the verge of collapsing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we have started reviewing the entire dairy industry and the Ministry has put aside 
<br/>$5.5  million  to  the  Dairy  Programme,  which  is  the  highest  budget  ever  allocated  for  the  dairy 
<br/>industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a budget of $800,000 on milk price incentive, a top up of 18 cents 
<br/>for every litre produced by all registered dairy farmers in Fiji.  This is a relief, but far from solving 
<br/>the rise in the production cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  farm  gate  price  of  milk  was  not  formulated  by  the  consultant  when  the  review  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>restructure of the dairy industry was done more than 12 years back and it has not been completed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget has  an allocation of $2 million for the importation of genetic material for the 
<br/>dairy  sector,  which  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  dairy  industry.    This  is  a  very  crucial 
<br/>intervention for the industry that had suffered badly from the losses of good breeds of cattle due to 
<br/>Bovine Tuberculosis and Brucellosis re-emergence in 2014.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the ongoing works, the Government will be assisting farmers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the supply of supplementary feed on a one-third and two-third basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Dairy Extension Programme, activities such as Improvement to Dairy Access Farm 
<br/></span><span>Roads  and  Milking  Sheds  Improvements  and  Smallholder  Farms  Development  will  motivate  the 
<br/>farmers to increase their milk production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current budget will assist the Ministry in its commitment to support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provisions of services that will control zoonotic diseases in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tuberculosis and Brucellosis has  significantly contributed to  the loss of  production of the 
<br/>beef  and  dairy  sector.    A  $1.6  million  support  programme  has  been  provided  to  the  ongoing 
<br/>Tuberculosis and Brucellosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC).  The Ministry will also maintain active 
<br/>disease surveillance on other zoonotic diseases.  This allocation has been revised based on last year’s 
<br/>utilisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to make matters worse, last year, 16 positions in the BTEC Project were not 
<br/>filled and are still vacant, despite the provision of funds.  This has caused major delays in testing 
<br/>coverage.  To-date, the Ministry is already working on procedures of recruiting project staff.  Disease 
<br/>surveillance will continue very shortly in the livestock sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on our studies with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tourism industry consumes a large amount of imported beef.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be investing $1 million to develop and maintain good cattle breeds.  These are the 
<br/>high producing climate resistant breed.  The programme includes the construction of facilities that 
<br/>will enable us to adopt modern breeding technologies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initiative of sheep and goat for commercial agriculture has less impact on the industry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>due to the criteria used for beneficiaries by the former Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The breeding programme will develop the nucleus herd which will be used in the Sheep and 
<br/>Goat Breeding Programme.  Offspring with good genetic traits will be supplied to farmers and the 
<br/>Ministry will vigorously carry out necessary studies to improve herd performance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is noted that in the last few years, there is a huge shortage of veterinarians 
<br/>in Fiji to address animal health issues.  Currently, there is only one registered Veterinarian out of the 
<br/>five available positions in the Ministry of Agriculture.  Further to the above, the source of veterinarian 
<br/>practitioners who can be registered to practice in Fiji are limited to recognised universities around 
<br/>the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  provision  of  $50,000  in  the  next  financial  year  will  allow  the  Ministry  to  engage  a 
<br/>consultant, who will set up a qualifier’s exam for veterinarians from other Universities so that they 
<br/>can  be  registered  to  practice  in  Fiji.    It  is  anticipated  that  the  shortage  of  veterinarians  will  be 
<br/>addressed through this programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of $100,000 has been allocated to the product development of ginger 
<br/>paste,  fruit  juice  concentrate  and  other  local  indigenous  fruits.    The  programme  will  continue  to 
<br/>provide training on value added products from local agricultural commodities to various women and 
<br/>youth groups.  This will support what the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways had 
<br/>mentioned regarding agro-processing to address seasonality of commodities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  lack  of  coordination  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  with  other 
<br/>organisations such as Fiji National University (FNU), the School of Agriculture in Koronivia had 
<br/>been noted with grave concerns.   There had been courses that are offered at the Koronivia Campus 
<br/></span><span>with very minimum consultation as to the relevance of the courses in the agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  already  initiated  proper  consultation  processes  and  there  will  be  close 
<br/>consultations  with  academic  institutions  like  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  (USP),  FNU, 
<br/>University of Fiji and other institutions around the region, to address needs from different agriculture 
<br/>sectors.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1319 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  is  highly  a  technical  and 
<br/>scientific field of work.  It requires personnel with specialised training both, in academic and in their 
<br/>capacity to be competent in their work.  Unfortunately, bad and wrong decisions in the last years had 
<br/>been one of the main reasons that most staff and personnel of scarce skills resources had been drained.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today,  the  Ministry  is  left  with  no  Veterinary  Pathologist,  no  Entomologist,  no  Animal 
<br/>Nutritionist, no surveyors, but only one Veterinarian Officer and one Engineer.  The Ministry will be 
<br/>addressing brain drain through revision of policies and proper remuneration of staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to build strong momentum by strengthening and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expanding agriculture production through the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development of product standards; 
<br/>access to planting material and seeds;  
<br/>increase in private sector engagement by strengthening industry approach and dialogue; 
<br/>and  
<br/>organise farmers’ groups through cooperative registrations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to thank honourable Tuinaceva for commenting on the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services’ concerns regarding the allocated funds to address NCDs in Fiji.  I 
<br/>wish  to  assure  you,  Sir,  that  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is  committed  to  producing  healthy  and 
<br/>nutritious food for the citizens of our nation.  The Ministry is going to roll out programmes that will 
<br/>address over-reliance on cheap imported food and be dependent on local foods to reduce NCDs to 
<br/>our population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry notes with concern urbanisation at this age and time, as raised by honourable 
<br/>Naivalurua.  The Budget for New Fiji will support youth and women movement in agriculture, and 
<br/>it will initiate programmes that promote high value crops for export markets.  I am confident that our 
<br/>Ministry has been allocated with funding that will reverse urbanisation, especially for communities 
<br/>in Vanu Levu and Taveuni.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Waterways Division had been neglected and ignored in the past years.  
<br/>They have lost all their Surveyors and Engineers.  Programmes had been given less priorities and 
<br/>they work in very difficult working conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The local farmers and communities need them.  Their work is important to all of us.  I thank 
<br/></span><span>them for the hard work they have been doing and I thank the honourable Minister of Finance for the 
<br/></span><span>support given to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Waterways Division is mandated to safeguard our food security system, 
<br/>housing  and  rural  economy  and  ecosystem  through  a  resilient  and  effective  National  Waterways 
<br/>Programme.  The demand for our service is no longer focussed only on the two main Islands, but it 
<br/>is also mandated to expand to the rural and maritime island communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more than $22 million is  being allocated for the Waterways Division  to 
<br/>deliver its service.  Approximately 73 percent of the allocated amount will be spent on a number of 
<br/>capital projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our major concern today is delivering our mandate in this climate change era.  The change in 
<br/>climate has increased the frequency and intensity disasters, affecting our ability to maintain steady 
<br/>growth in the agriculture sector.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these impacts contribute to Fiji’s flash flooding, heavy silted waterways and 
<br/>coastal  and  riverbank  erosion.    In  this  budget,  the  Ministry  has  been  allocated  with  $200,000  to 
<br/>undertake surveying and mapping of four major rivers in Viti Levu, which will be the initial works 
<br/>required to develop a 20-year National Waterways Programme that addresses silt deposit into our 
<br/>major rivers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  understood  that  dredging  is  important,  however,  the  Ministry  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>committed to address siltation through upstream sustainable land management practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address watershed problems in Ba Town and low-lying areas, the Watershed Management 
<br/>Programme has been allocated money $1 million for the construction of Qalinibulu Retention Dam 
<br/>in the upper catchment of Ba River. This is designed and intended to control peak flow and reduce 
<br/>flooding at the surrounding catchments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dredging of major rivers and creeks is a programme designed for flood 
<br/>mitigation purposes. Sir, $3 million has been allocated for works in the major rivers and creeks that 
<br/>are prone to flooding. Dredging of rivers and creeks is an essential programme that will help mitigate 
<br/>and reduce flooding and reduces impacts on agricultural production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the removal of the Drainage Board in 2018 saw the severe backlog in the 
<br/>maintenance of existing drainage schemes affecting sugar and non-sugar crops.  The allocation of 
<br/>$200,000  will  assist  in  the  planning  and  preparatory  works  required  for  the  reinstatement  of  the 
<br/>Drainage Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, flooding, worsened by poorly managed drains contribute to high economic 
<br/>losses during floods.  The Ministry has allocated more than $5 million to address the growing threats 
<br/>of flooding through the maintenance of the drainage systems for the non-municipal areas, drainage 
<br/>for farmlands and drainage for rural residential areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  unregulated  and  unsustainable  land-use  practices  continue  to  increase 
<br/>siltation and sediments of our waterways.  A substantial amount of $3.8 million has been allocated 
<br/>for Drainage and Flood Protection Programme. This work can never be overstressed for it has been 
<br/>a problem area in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterway in his 
<br/>Budget response, we have the potential to improve local rice production.  An allocation of $800,000 
<br/>will  enable  the  Ministry  to  provide  necessary  support  services  for  rice  production  through  the 
<br/>maintenance of existing irrigation schemes in Bua and Macuata in the Northern Division and Navua 
<br/>in the Central Division, ensuring that irrigation infrastructures are operational and water is available 
<br/>to farmers all year round. At this moment, the potential of these Schemes is yet to be realised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, sea-level rise has long been a threat to coastal communities. Sea-level rise 
<br/>has  further  rippled  effects  of  coastal  erosion,  saltwater  intrusion  and  inundation,  affecting  the 
<br/>community’s land and freshwater aquifer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address these issues, $1.5 million has been allocated to construct seawalls, such as nature-
<br/></span><span>based solution seawalls that will reduce community exposure to coastal erosion and high wave action 
<br/>during storm surges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, a total of $50,000 has been allocated for the preparatory works 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Coastal Protection Works for Nasilai Village in Tailevu.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, drought is a slow onset disaster not seriously considered and addressed in 
<br/>the past.   Irrigation Support for Farm Development is a programme that is designed to increase the 
<br/>resilience of farmers from drought through the provision of micro irrigation systems to allow them 
<br/>to better manage water.  Selected farmers will be supplied with the basic irrigation kits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  above  programmes  are  designed  to  support  the  Government  in  the 
<br/>implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and the Green Growth Framework for Fiji through 
<br/>recognising  the  need  to  have  resilient  infrastructure  to  improve  livelihoods  and  also  reducing  the 
<br/>vulnerability and risks of climate change impacts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, within the Ministry, information gathering is an exercise that is regularly 
<br/>undertaken through surveys by our Extension Officers and Statistics Unit Team.  A total of $200,000 
<br/>has been allocated for the collection of agriculture data. This will help in policy formulation in the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  will  maintain  a  forward  focus  in  leading  the  agriculture 
<br/>transformation  agenda  beyond  incremental  growth.  We  recognise  and  support  the  efforts  and 
<br/>contribution to the sector by the women and youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways for the hard work they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have all been doing and braving situations in the past few years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I send my best wishes to the many who lost their jobs due to the nature of policies of the last 
<br/>Government, and I encourage you to continue your support for the growth and development of the 
<br/>Agriculture Sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my response, and I fully support the 2023-2024 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for  this opportunity to respond to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget as delivered in this Chamber on Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  your  understanding  my  missing  in  the  last  two  days  in 
<br/>Parliament due the bad flu that is going around and may I add that your staff here in Parliament are 
<br/>so efficient.  They sent me your signed letter to say that you had approved just a few hours before I 
<br/>send my sick leave.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the lead up to the Budget announcement and as I prepared in my own way, I 
<br/>was not really one hundred percent sure as to what I was supposed to do.  This is a milestone event 
<br/>for me to deliver my Budget response in my very short political career. But there was this lingering 
<br/>thought in my mind that was telling me, “Give them the benefit of the doubt, this will be the first 
<br/>Budget and it is the first Budget of a new Government.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure whether you should say those things when you are in Opposition but those were 
<br/>my  very  honest  thoughts.    I  was  looking  forward  to  the  new  plans,  the  new  programmes,  new 
<br/></span><span>initiatives, new incentives and to be fair, new ideas and new programmes need to be given time to 
<br/></span><span>run before they can be critiqued fairly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the Budget delivery, those thoughts began fading. I was dejected with the lies, the 
<br/>misinformation, the blaming, the excuses and name calling that featured in about one-third of the 
<br/>Budget Address.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when the honourable Minister of Finance finally came around to talk about this 
<br/>new Budget that I was waiting to hear, there was nothing new.  For the most part, they just took the 
<br/>FijiFirst programmes and ran with it - a little bit of renaming here and there to create an illusion of 
<br/>newness.  However, in some way, it made sense because when came into power, instead of laying a 
<br/>foundation for this Budget through a mini-budget, they just ran with the Budget that was prepared by 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government.  Again, this made sense because it was that budget prepared by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government that has allowed the projected growth of 8 percent that they are now boasting about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  their  actions  and  what  they  say  do  not  match.    This  Budget  has  now 
<br/>threatened  the  achievement  of  that  projected  growth.    I  hope  that  the  projected  growth  will  be 
<br/>achieved and even increased, and I sincerely do, for the benefit of the people that sent us here and to 
<br/>whom we owe service to the best that we can offer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not one that will just sit on this side and rub my hands together, hoping 
<br/>and wishing that the Coalition will crumble.  That, to me, is a waste of my time because that day will 
<br/>come and is coming.  That, I guarantee 100 percent, but before that day arrives, whenever it arrives, 
<br/>we, on this side of the Parliament, have the honourable job of compelling those on the other side of 
<br/>Parliament to do right for the people of our beloved country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Qereqeretabua, when she spoke, said that we, on this side, 
<br/>should not lecture this Government, whilst at the same time they are lecturing us on what they think 
<br/>we should have done four years ago, eight years ago, some even going  further back.  But  in  this 
<br/>Chamber, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, we do the lecturing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I have heard you lecture before, Sir, in your own way when you were 
<br/>on  this  side  because  when  we  see  injustice,  discrimination,  abuse  of  power,  corruption, 
<br/>unconstitutional action, favouritism, nepotism and violation of institutional integrity, I would remind 
<br/>the Government that, yes, you will be told off and, yes, you will get lectured because that is one of 
<br/>the tools we have as Opposition, to compel you to do right for our people.  You will ignore them at 
<br/>your own peril. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, right now, when you think about it, the role is reversed.  They are doing the lecturing and 
<br/>we, the FijiFirst, the alternative government in Opposition, is indirectly running the Government and 
<br/>running the country because they are using our budget.  They are using all the good policies and 
<br/>programmes that we had put in place, and they are running with it right now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  have  the  more  pleasant  duty  and  obligations,  I  must  add,  to 
<br/>acknowledge and thank the Government when they do right for our people. We do that on people’s 
<br/>behalf, we must give credit where credit is due.  Unfortunately, this is something that is so hard for 
<br/>those on the other side today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank and acknowledge the Government for not abandoning 
<br/>our children, our future generation, and continue with the Free Education Initiative that was started 
<br/></span><span>by the Bainimarama-led Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was fortunate to be there on that day when we started it off and said, “yes”.  
<br/>Myself, honourable Usamate and Mr. Filipe Bole, who is a long time education practitioner, were so 
<br/>emotional.  He said that he never thought he was going to see free education in this country while he 
<br/>was still alive.  We both and we all understand that an educated society is the bedrock of economic 
<br/>growth and prosperity.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Government for continuing the various social 
<br/>welfare and pension schemes – thank you for looking after those who need to be looked after here in 
<br/>Fiji.  Also, those were programmes initiated by the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is carnage on our roads right now.  There is increase recklessness on 
<br/>our roads.  The death toll on our roads in June was 44, compared to 14 for the same time last year.  
<br/>Even in those first few days of July, we are hearing the same bad and sad news of road fatalities 
<br/>almost everyday.  The pain of losing loved ones away from home is so unbearable.  To all the families 
<br/>of those 44 and those who had passed recently, I send my sincere condolences for your loss.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that if you are listening, you know about the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji 
<br/>(ACCF), which provides compensation for victims without the burden of proving fault.  You can go 
<br/>there to claim your compensation, if you so wish.  I think, take the option of going to court, if you so 
<br/>wish also.  If you do not know, please, ask Government officials around your place or those who 
<br/>know, to help you access that facility if you so wish.  If you want, my number is 9908703 - you can 
<br/>call me, and I can see if I can also help guide you to that facility that is available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an initiative of the Fiji Government and I thank the current Government for continuing 
<br/>with it.  I know it faces a lot of criticisms and objections in its initial implementation, but I think we 
<br/>are so glad that it is still continuing.  To all the road users who are listening today, please, be safe on 
<br/>our roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the amount is substantial, let me tell you a quick story.  I was driving 
<br/>back from Nadi  with my wife and this black car with flashing lights and a white Kia behind just 
<br/>zoomed passed us.  I have a dashboard camera that is installed in my car.  I looked up and made sure 
<br/>it was recording and it did.  But, instead of just passing us, it went ahead and passed all the other cars 
<br/>that were in front of us. I was talking with my wife and say, “Those two cars are really driving fast.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we arrived at Wainadoi, that black government car and Kia (I think it was GS361) was 
<br/>parked there where they sell </span><span>bu</span><span>.  The lights were off, the red lights were no longer flashing and I do 
<br/>not know who was in there.  So, we drove passed them and kept driving.  All of a sudden, it was 
<br/>zooming passed us again, really fast.  I looked up into my  dashboard camera to  make sure it was 
<br/>recording because I was worried that it was going to get into an accident because there were a lot of 
<br/>cars in front of me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I tell that story and plead, and I think of the carnage on our roads, if the fight against it starts 
<br/>here in Parliament.  I told that story to the members of my Committee and they can attest to it.  I 
<br/>know you get driven around but, please, take charge and tell your drivers to slow down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Get rid of those flashing lights, it is a distraction.  Even when I drive and when I see flashlight 
<br/>at the back, I concentrate more looking back instead of what is in front.  You need to follow the road 
<br/>rules.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the biggest offenders on our road are government vehicles.  I see a 
<br/>lot more abuse on the use of government vehicles - picking children from school, park and people 
<br/></span><span>going shopping, I see a lot more of them parking in private homes right now after working hours.  In 
<br/></span><span>the past during the FijiFirst Government, the practise was, if you are taking the car home, you park 
<br/>it in the nearest police post or police station, just to cut off that opportunity of abuse if it is parked at 
<br/>home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a grant of $130,000 that is tucked away in this book that I would 
<br/>like to thank the Government for continuing.  It is a grant to the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Animals (SPCA) and we all know that SPCA is an animal shelter here at Walu in Suva, but may I 
<br/>remind the Government  that there are other animal shelters and sanctuaries around  - one is in Ba 
<br/>which is a ‘no kill shelter.  You can take stray animals there and they will not put them down unless 
<br/>it is really necessary. Can you imagine when strays are brought there because they have a ‘No Kill 
<br/>Policy’, dogs and cats they live, say 10 years all that time, they get fed and they get looked after.  
<br/>They are around, and I hope Government can look into supporting them also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The high number of stray dogs and cats in our urban and peri-urban areas is the reflection of 
<br/>the  inhumane  treatment  and  cruelty  that  we  do  to  our  animals.    It  is  not  a  good  reflection  of  the 
<br/>character of our society. One day I went up to SPCA delivering old newspapers and an injured owl 
<br/>that came home.  I think it was our cats that probably caught it but it was still alive, but it couldn’t 
<br/>fly.  I took it down to SPCA and whilst I was there, I think this lady who was on her way to work 
<br/>was holding a small kitten.  I asked her, “Where did you get it from?” She said, “Oh, someone threw 
<br/>it on the road, I stopped, picked it up and took it to SPCA”.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be the voice of 
<br/>our furry friends, and I am sure a few of us too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me turn to the honourable Minister of Finance’s Budget Address. In his 
<br/>Address, he talked about how they started but even that Party got robbed.  So, let me remind him 
<br/>how they actually started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they started by creating history when they made themselves all Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers and perhaps, the only country in the world, small as we are, having three Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers and with it came the perks - cars, drivers, backup cars and more drivers, office space, 
<br/>support staff, stationery,  pays and allowances for Ministers and Assistant Ministers, Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers, business class travel, first class travel, so they started off in the red.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How do we know that it started off in the red?  Because they did not do a mini-budget, but 
<br/>they worked with the current Budget and the current Budget only caters for a much, much less number 
<br/>of Ministers and Assistant Ministers, no Deputy Prime Minister and for less overseas trips too.  From 
<br/>the word go, they had already busted their budget.  That is not a good start.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why they structured themselves this way was not service driven. 
<br/>That was not the way they saw was the best way to serve, no.  It was not service-driven but it was 
<br/>driven only need to survive as a Coalition. And this is very much reflected in the way the Budget is 
<br/>done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministers, Sir, started sacking the Heads of our very institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I will continue, Mr. Speaker. I will just go back a little bit, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after that, they had power, then they started sacking the Heads of our very 
<br/></span><span>institution that uphold our young democracy.  And in that process, create doubt and mistrust in their 
<br/></span><span>ability  to  function  justly  and  fairly  in  their  service  to  our  people  -  the  Commissioner  of  Police, 
<br/>Commissioner of Prisons, Supervisor of Elections, Chief Justice, Director of Public Prosecutions and 
<br/>Permanent Secretaries.  Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they went after Boards and CEOs of State-Owned 
<br/>companies and statutory bodies, like FBC, iTLTB, FRCS, FRA, LTA, FNPF, and the list goes on, 
<br/>and this is still continuing, Sir, the latest victim being the CEO of Post Fiji.  Now, they are being 
<br/>replaced by their own people, mostly, candidates that did not make it through or their strong by their

<div><span>own  people,  mostly,  candidates  that  did  not  make  it  through  or  their  strong  supporters  and  their 
<br/>donors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this must stop.  Some of these acts of removal and appointments to these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>positions were unconstitutional.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, even the Tribunals to adjudicate on the drummed-
<br/>up allegations against some of these hardworking but now unfortunate people, have not even been 
<br/>stood up, almost seven months later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very lately, I read in the news that the honourable Attorney-General has said that FICAC was 
<br/>weaponised.  Weaponised is a very common word in America right now with Trump and what he is 
<br/>going through, I think that is where he took it from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I suspect, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that FICAC could be the next.  Honourable Attorney-General, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you really need to stop.  You need to stop, the damage that you are doing to this country is irreparable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, damage was already done, even before this Budget.  
<br/>There is  a lack of public trust  and  faith in  these  important  institutions, and that has  a bearing on 
<br/>investor  confidence  and  consequently,  on  our  economy,  as  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance 
<br/>himself  said  in  his  Budget  Address  that  Everything  is  Connected  to  Everything  Else,  which  is 
<br/>commonly known as the First Law of Ecology.  And there is a practical version of the First Law of 
<br/>Ecology and that is attributed to Bruce Mau and he said, “When everything is connected to everything 
<br/>else, for better or for worse, everything matters”. So, all that I have said matters when we deal with 
<br/>the National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whist listening to the Budget Address by the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>and listening to the contributions from the other side, I think that they are looking at us and treating 
<br/>us as their enemy when we are not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a democracy like ours, that side of Parliament leads and governs and, we 
<br/>on this side of Parliament, keep them in check on behalf of the people. But, Sir, we both fight the 
<br/>same  enemy  and  the  enemies  are  poverty,  unemployment,  crime,  corruption,  lawlessness,  drugs, 
<br/>extreme climatic events due to climate change, to name a few. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reason  why  most  of  those  issues  I  had  raised  were  not  adequately 
<br/>addressed by the honourable Minister of Finance is because he is looking at the wrong direction, he 
<br/></span><span>is concentrating on us.  Look the other side, that is where the problem is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me talk briefly, Mr. Speaker, if you allow me, I know the bell has rung, about two issues, 
<br/>and the first issue is climate change.  The world right now is talking about the coming </span><span>El Nino</span><span>.  It is 
<br/>the warming of the sea in the Pacific Ocean.  It starts from the East, along the Coast of South America, 
<br/>coming towards us in the West.  And when this event happens, there is extreme drought in some parts 
<br/>of the world, extreme rain and flooding in other parts, and extreme hurricanes too.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have just come out of a cycle of three years of </span><span>La Nina</span><span> which the cooling of the ocean.  
<br/>The last </span><span>El Nino</span><span> was in 2015 and 2016, and yes, that is when the second strongest cyclone in the 
<br/>world ever recorded, struck Fiji - </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  In this Budget, Sir, there is no fiscal space to deal 
<br/>with such extreme events.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem of drugs in Fiji is increasing at an alarming rate, but that is to 
<br/>be expected because globally, there is an increase in drug use.  I was listening to a BBC News item 
<br/>talking about this issue.  But we, most of the time, we tend to think and talk about drugs from the 
<br/>perspective of health and how it messes up people’s health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bigger problem when it comes to drug is that it creates a secretive 
<br/>segment of our society and it operates just below the normal level where we operate, just out of radar 
<br/>range, so that they are not detected.  But, if we pull it up and expose what is happening there, it is 
<br/>what we, at the normal level, call corruption.  There is bribery, “You do this for me, I will do this for 
<br/>you” or “Do this for me, I will get that person to do something for you”.  It is corruption in the normal 
<br/>sense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the level above is corrupt, or simply perceived to be corrupted, the 
<br/>two levels pull at each other, they combine and then corruption thrives in our society.  It is one of the 
<br/>reasons why I harp about institutional integrity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The budget for the Police Force this year is for business as usual.  The drug problem in Fiji 
<br/>cannot be and should not be dealt with as business as usual.  The drug problem is a flickering red 
<br/>warning  light  right  now,  it  needs  to  be  dealt  with  urgently  and  with  energy  and  with  the  right 
<br/>resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lawlessness rampant the freedom that this Government so triumphantly proclaim when they 
<br/>formed  Government  is  translating  to  freedom  to  do  whatever  you  want,  reflected  in  the  level  of 
<br/>lawlessness in this country.  Two of my golfing friends who are senior citizens got marked recently.  
<br/>The gentleman got injured in his arm and around his neck and the lady luckily held on to her purse a 
<br/>little bit hard and long enough for the guy to get scared and ran away in broad daylight.  Now, in our 
<br/>email grouping, we now talk to each other and say, “Do not go here, do not do this”, just to be safe.  
<br/>These are all senior citizens, Sir.  The honourable Prime Minister is also a member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  US  issued  recently  a  security  alert.    Let  me  read  it  to  you  again.    I 
<br/>apologise if you have heard this before but let me read it again.  It says that as of 10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, the 
<br/>US Embassy in the capital, Suva, has issued a security alert regarding crime concerns in the city.  
<br/>The alert notes that crime is a prevalent issue, particularly in tourist areas, such as downtown Suva, 
<br/>the waterfront and seawall area and on Victoria Parade Street.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The alert further notes that violent crime and assault is also a concern, particularly, within the 
<br/>Colo-i-Suva Forest Park.  Individuals should take basic precautions such as exercising heightened 
<br/>vigilance in crowded areas, keeping valuables secured and avoiding public display of affluence and 
<br/>should monitor official sources for updates.  That is what is happening in our society and guess who 
<br/>reads it too, tourists.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Budget, we are not only pricing our tourists, but we are also pushing them away because 
<br/>of  lawlessness  in  our  country.    We  have  big  problem  in  our  hands,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  I  ask 
<br/>Government, what are you doing about it?  So, I urge the Government to focus on the real enemy, 
<br/>the real problems that our society is facing, and not on us.  We will focus on you to make sure that 
<br/>you deal with the problems diligently and efficiently.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  two  gentlemen  from  Tailevu  sitting  in  between  the  handsome 
<br/>gentlemen from Naitasiri, need to sort themselves out because in their response to the Budget, the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management questioned why 
<br/>they  are  employing  engineers  in  rural  development,  that  they  should  go  back  to  their  combat 
<br/>engineering role, while the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration said that they are 
<br/>given money to increase engineers because of the role they play in rural development.  Which is it, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker?  You need to sort it out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance, in his Budget Address, said that the 
<br/>Coalition Government is a government of the people, by the people and for the people.  Those are 
<br/>the words of President Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address in November 1863.  But, Sir, if they are a 
<br/>government of the people, by the people and for the people, why is the seat empty?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  Are we rounding off? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this is important. This seat is for a representative of the people, and you are deliberately 
<br/>muzzling the voice of the people when you do not allow their representative to come and sit.  As you 
<br/>have said and reminded us, one of the most important events in a Parliament is Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the words that he said – govern by the people, of the people and for the people, 
<br/>I do not like it when people misuse it, because those words were meant and said in relation to soldiers 
<br/>who had fought and died.  He was speaking at the dedication of the soldiers National Cemetery in 
<br/>Gettysburg.  They were dedicating the cemetery in Gettysburg and the Battle of Gettysburg was the 
<br/>deadliest battle during the civil war in America.  The full context of those words is, “That these dead 
<br/>shall not have died in vain; that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that the 
<br/>government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from this earth.”  When 
<br/>you say that you are for the people, by the people and of the people, and keep this seat empty, you 
<br/>say it and do something else, you make those hallowed words hollow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is inward-looking, same as when they formed their Government; 
<br/>they make it sound good by weaving it into a false narrative of debt situation; and it does not tackle 
<br/>the problem that this nation is facing down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, let me put it in a simple way to the ordinary people who are listening.  From 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> August, if this Budget is passed, your electricity bill will go up, your water bill will go up, your 
<br/>food bill will go up, the cost of your children’s uniform will go up, the cost of your children’s school 
<br/>stationery will go up and what will go down for you, is nothing.  But if you earn $270,000 and more, 
<br/>you pay less tax.  If you are a rich bottled water company, you do not pay tax, with all the other 
<br/>bottled water companies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Budget  does  not  do  right  for  the  people,  and  I  cannot  and  will  not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, fellow Members of Parliament; good afternoon 
<br/>to  you  all.    I  take  this  opportunity  to  welcome  all  Fiji  citizens  joining  us  this  afternoon  whether 
<br/>through television, radio, livestreaming or Parliament Website or through social media platforms.

<div><span>Before I begin, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I offer my congratulations to Salote Elenoa Biukoto, I 
<br/>would say the first </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> lady CEO of Fiji Vodafone.  She rises from the village of Lawaki in Nairai 
<br/>from Yavusa Qalisau, Mataqali Ione, a daughter of a school teacher.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I begin with my Budget may I address this House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on some of the 
<br/>issues raised by honourable Naupoto. Matthew Chapter 75: Why do you look at the speck of sawdust 
<br/>in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye.  </span><span>Leuta mada mai na malamala 
<br/>mai na matamu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Naupoto, would agree that he lost the Election in 2014.  I mean, how many votes 
<br/>400 or 300? Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time for someone who has finished from the RFMF, stood 
<br/>for elections and then went back as Commander, that is outside the norm. Never find it in Australia, 
<br/>New Zealand or anywhere else, but we know the reason.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What is the reason? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Because someone in  the Government  must  have  some connection 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the Military.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. I take offence of what he said and that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a personal attack.

<div><span>Did you cite the Standing Orders you are quoting from?

<div><span>people on the Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 74. I take offence, that is a personal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>attack.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could we just continue, honourable Member?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Another response, Mr. Speaker, and is related to honourable Bulitavu. 
<br/>I would like to briefly respond to honourable Bulitavu’s comments on Monday which he reiterated 
<br/>yesterday. He referred to the removal of the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Bulitavu  stated  that  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  should  remove  me  as  the 
<br/>Attorney-General and Minister of Justice because I am a threat to his leadership.  He used to be in 
<br/>this Party but then he moved to FijiFirst.  I think the answer lies with him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, his speech clearly violates Standing Order 61.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- As you know, he is an old guard of Parliament and he has been there all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I hope he stays there and does not come back here. He has to make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a decision - stay in the line.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing  Order  61  states,  and  I  quote:    When  speaking,  a  member  must  confine  to  the 
<br/>observation to the Budget under consideration.  Standing Order 62(1), states, and I quote: “When 
<br/>speaking a member must not impute improper motives to any other member.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order, Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I stand under Standing Order 74, Sir.  I just want to correct the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General and the correction is that Standing Order 61 refers to judicial proceedings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- My correction, it is an oversight. Well, it is basic, we all know that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may, this speech serves to malign, smear and cast that person or the Attorney-General.  
<br/>Furthermore, it does not relate to the subject matter - the Budget which is under consideration and 
<br/>motions table for consideration of additional Bills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unwarranted, uncalled for and highly inappropriate. The comment is otherwise irrelevant 
<br/>and amounts to a breach of the Standing Orders. I urge, honourable Bulitavu, to be respectful and 
<br/>observe the decorum of this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  shall  now  provide  my  contribution  the  Budget  before  this  Parliament.  
<br/>There  is,  no  doubt,  that  we  are  living  in  perilous  times  -  times  of  uncertainty  and  times  of 
<br/>unprecedented  volatility  due  to  the  current  geopolitical  environment.    I  would,  therefore,  like  to 
<br/>commend the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance for a realistic and sensible 
<br/>Budget before this august Parliament. There is no doubt, a Budget that makes tough and responsible 
<br/>decisions, given the high debt level this Government has inherited from its predecessor - the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, which irresponsibly borrowed to finance Government expenditure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the World Bank’s Fiji Public Expenditure Review reported in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> on 
<br/>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023, it is troubling that Fiji recorded the fourth worst GDP decline in the world and that 
<br/>its GDP was four times worst to the average for Pacific Island Countries in 2020 and 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, the low economic growth  trends  were emerging prior to the COVID-19 pandemic 
<br/>which, together with the severe tropical cyclones and Russian/Ukraine war, merely aggravated the 
<br/>economic crisis on unprecedented scale.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Its already going down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bible reminds us in  Luke 12:48: “Everyone 
<br/></span><span>who has given much, much will be demanded and for the one who has been entrusted with much, 
<br/></span><span>much  more  will  be  asked.”    The  prevailing  economic  conditions  requires  Government  to  make 
<br/>suitable structural adjustments under the Budget to ensure the sustainability and long-term survival 
<br/>of our nation.  Under this Budget, Government has developed safeguard measures and will implement 
<br/>relevant and practical policies to address the challenges facing our economy today.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  now  refer  to  some  of  the  events  pertaining  to  the  Ministries  and 
<br/>institutions under my responsibility, which demonstrates the irresponsible measures inherited from 
<br/>the previous Government and how this Coalition Government will rectify them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Attorney-General is the Chief Legal Advisor to the Government.  Despite 
<br/>its constitutional advisory role, the previous Government failed to ensure that the Office is running 
<br/>in full capacity, when it failed to fill and, in fact, defunct 50 percent of the established staff positions 
<br/>within the Office of the Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the inception of this Government, the Office of the Attorney-General advertised all the 
<br/>defunct vacant positions and filled those positions, except for the Deputy Solicitor-General and the 
<br/>Executive Support Manager positions which are still being processed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Attorney-General is also working towards the setting up of the Fiji Law 
<br/>Reform Commission which is established under the Fiji Law Reform Act 1979.  It saddens me to say 
<br/>that despite the significant statutory role of the Commission which keeps law applicable to Fiji under 
<br/>review, it has been defunct under the previous Government.  We will ensure that the Fiji Law Reform 
<br/>Commission  becomes  operational  to  perform  its  statutory  functions.    This  will  generally  ensure 
<br/>simplification, improvement, modernisation of the law and also ensure that our laws are also aligned 
<br/>to international best practices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recognising the significant role of the Commission, an additional budget of $400,000 has 
<br/>been allocated to the Office of the Attorney-General’s to enable the set-up of the Commission.  I am 
<br/>also pleased to inform this august Parliament that the Director of the Law Reform Commission, Ms. 
<br/>Raijeli Tuivaga, has just been appointed in the Ministry of Justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to some of the mismanagement of the public funds by 
<br/>the  previous  Government  relating  to  the  Ministry  of  Justice  which  is  responsible  for  the 
<br/>administration of the law and justice in Fiji.  The Ministry delivers service through legally mandated 
<br/>registries to maintain official records of legal documents.  This includes the Registrar of Companies, 
<br/>business,  credit  unions,  money  lenders,  Justice  of  Peace,  land  titles,  deeds,  births,  deaths  and 
<br/>marriages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the blunders of the previous Government relates to the procurement of services by a 
<br/>Singapore Enterprise between 2017 and 2019. This company was engaged to undertake business, 
<br/>process and review at US$602,640.  I am told it is about 25 to 50 pages of study. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  worrisome  that  the  previous  Government  paid  over  FJ$1  million 
<br/>without  anything  to  show  for  it.    This  will  ultimately  affect  ease  of  doing  business  in  Fiji  which 
<br/>affects promotion of investments.  The previous Government also allocated $7 million in 2021–2022 
<br/>Budget and $2.6 million in the 2022–2023 Budget for implementing of Fijian Vaccine Pass System 
<br/>to  cater  for  Fiji  citizens  and  permit  holders  who  wishes  to  travel  abroad.    This  project  has  been 
<br/>abandoned  but  the  Government  had  wasted  public  funds,  including  the  procurement  of  relevant 
<br/>equipment such as scanners, computers, camera, the leasing of office space and recruitment of staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  this  Government,  the  Ministry  of  Justice  is  working  to  digitalise  the  Office  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Registrar of Titles and increase staffing to improve service delivery.  The digitalisation project will 
<br/>improve and ensure safe record-keeping and the ability to utilise records efficiently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Justice in consultation with the Ministry of Trade and Communications is 
<br/>also working to digitalise the registries for ease of doing business and potentially, include issuance 
<br/>of hotel permits and construction permits in order to expedite registration of permits.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1331 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Judicial Department, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to briefly address some blunders 
<br/>relating to the Judiciary by the former Government.  As we know, the judicial power and the authority 
<br/>of  the  State  is  vested  in  the  Judiciary.    The  Judicial  Department  is  the  administrative  arm  of  the 
<br/>Judiciary.  It is comprised of non-judicial officers employed in the Judiciary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may just address one of the matters raised by honourable Naupoto, as we came in, I told 
<br/>the Government that we are going to follow the process.  That means if someone is suspended instead 
<br/>of summarily terminated, they will go through the process.  We will appoint the Tribunal, they hear 
<br/>their complaints and pay is orderly.  That is the process we have taken now, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Well,  I  think  history  speaks  for  itself  if  you  look  at  the  previous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government, is it not?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament  is  constitutionally  required  to  ensure  that  the  Judiciary  has  adequate  financial 
<br/>resources to perform its functions and exercise its power properly.  Yet, the previous Government 
<br/>failed to ensure this when it unilaterally removed the judicial rooms and office from its premises at 
<br/>Government  Building  in  order  to  establish  the  Parliament  complex  here,  despite  the  existing 
<br/>Parliament complex at Veiuto. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of this august Parliament, this Parliament complex used to accommodate 
<br/>the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal rooms, registries and members of the Magistrates Court 
<br/>and  other  administrative  offices,  particularly  the  IT  and  Assets  Department.    As  a  result  of  the 
<br/>restructure, the Judicial Department spent over $4 million to-date to lease another building, namely 
<br/>Kelton House, to house some of the administrative services of the Judiciary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An additional $13 million has been used to renovate and refurbish the Veiuto Parliamentary 
<br/>Complex to accommodate the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court rooms and their respective 
<br/>registries and Chambers.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this Government, we will ensure that the Judicial 
<br/>Department which is the administrative arm of the Judiciary is adequately resourced to ensure the 
<br/>proper and efficient operational running of the Judiciary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, the Budget provides an additional budget of $3 million, compared to the last 
<br/>financial  year,  to  the  Judiciary,  which  should  cater  for  the  necessary  appointments  of  improved 
<br/>service delivery.  Justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service (FCS) plays a crucial role in the administration of the criminal 
<br/>justice system.  Corrections, formerly called the Fiji Prisons Service, continues in existence under 
<br/>the Corrections Service Act 2006.  The FCS is mandated to treat prisoners humanely, aid in their 
<br/>rehabilitation and prepare them for the productive law-abiding lives once they are free.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous Government failed to ensure that FCS filled all 
<br/></span><span>its  established  positions  to  effectively  fulfil  its  mandate.    In  fact,  under  the  2020–2021  National 
<br/></span><span>Budget funding, 84 positions for FCS were defunct.  Unfortunately, this wrong was not corrected 
<br/>after COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, the FCS has been requesting for virement of funds to cater for the salaries of some 
<br/>84 positions which needed to be filled to function properly.  This may also affect planned capital 
<br/>projects namely, the construction of the Supervisor Northern Division Office which was earmarked 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the previous budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  is  taking  a  progressive  approach  to  ensure  budget 
<br/>availability for FCS so that it may fund its 84 positions. Government has accordingly agreed to fund 
<br/>30 out of the 84 positions from this Budget.  To-date, the FCS has been able to fill 946 out of the 963 
<br/>established positions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, it is regrettable that the FCS has been requesting for funding of their database under the 
<br/>previous Government.  The database is intended to store important information regarding inmates 
<br/>such as their personal details, their history, particularly of their conviction and sentence, whether they 
<br/>have attended any rehabilitation programmes.  The database will also store information of recidivists 
<br/>or reoffenders.  These are important  information  that allows FCS to  make relevant  determination 
<br/>pertaining to inmates, such as their eligibility for parole. This Budget provides a funding of $180,000 
<br/>for the establishment of the database.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous Government has also failed to provide adequate funding for construction of the 
<br/>retaining wall required for the Levuka Corrections Centre of about $900,000 which poses a risk of 
<br/>soil erosion to the inmates housed at the Levuka Corrections Centre.  The previous Government had 
<br/>only agreed to fund part of the retaining wall of only $200,000, making it impossible for FCS to 
<br/>construct the retaining wall.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because of that, the FCS has not utilised the monies allocated by the previous Government.  
<br/>However, I am relieved to say that this Budget will allocate $700,000 to Corrections so that it may 
<br/>construct the retaining wall for the Levuka Corrections Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to Legal Aid, there are 248 established positions.  During the last financial year, 
<br/>the Commission was able to fill 175 positions.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Office provides a very critical 
<br/>role in terms of providing legal service to members of the public who cannot afford a lawyer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  this  Government,  the  Commission  has  been  able  to  fill  an  additional  36  positions, 
<br/>bringing staff capacity to 85 percent.  This is expected to address the staffing capacity to enable the 
<br/>Commission to effectively provide legal assistance to the impoverished.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will go on to the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) which was referred to 
<br/>by honourable Naupoto.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ACCF also falls under my responsibility.  The ACCF 
<br/>was established under the Accident Compensation Act 2017.  It pays compensation to all persons 
<br/>who suffer from personal injury or death, suffered by any person arise out of the accident in Fiji on 
<br/>a non-fault basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Act, accidents refer to those caused by motor vehicle, those are riding of/and in the 
<br/>cause of employment or occurred in a school premises or during a school event or activity.  To-date, 
<br/>ACCF had approved a total of $51,989,000 in compensation since its inception in 2018. This is based 
<br/>on  the  2,585  approved  applications  received,  that  is,  2,291  applications  for  injury  and  294 
<br/>applications for death.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance indicated 
<br/></span><span>the  Government’s  intention  to  review  the  NPTC  levy.    In  fact,  the  previous  Government  had 
<br/>redirected 40 percent of the NPTC levy to be paid to the Accident Compensation Fund established 
<br/>under the Act.  This is another intended review by Government to ensure that the NPTC levy is being 
<br/>used for its original intent, that is, to fund the training of  workers in Fiji. However, this will also 
<br/>mean  that  Government  will  need  to  look  at  an  alternative  source  of  funding  if  the  NPTC  levy  is 
<br/>reversed to is original intent.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1333 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  iTaukei  Land  Development,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  previous  Government  provided  $10 
<br/>million to assist </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners to develop their land for residential and commercial purposes.  
<br/>As of yesterday, all files relating to this programme have been transferred to the Ministry of iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs. The Government’s view is that the proper authority that should be doing this is the iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs rather than the Attorney-General’s Chambers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this grant, 10 subdivisional projects have been approved, out of which 
<br/>three projects have been completed with leases handed over to their respective landowners in 2022. 
<br/>The  remaining  seven  projects  are  still  in  progress,  which  shows  the  delay  in  processing  of  the 
<br/>applications and issuance of titles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  thing  strikes  me,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  appears  that  there  were  selective  clients  of  this 
<br/>project  and  it  overlooked  the  people  of  Suvavou,  the  people  who  gave  their  land,  the  people  of 
<br/>Tamavua, the people of Kalabu, and that is the reason why this project has been shifted to the Ministry 
<br/>of iTaukei Affairs so that they can deal with it in a more fair manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The total cost of the development of land and the projects is about $23.6 million, out of which 
<br/>$7.9 million had been paid. This means that the Government will need to pay another $15.6 million 
<br/>for completion of the entire project.  According to our records, the grant was also used to assist the 
<br/>loan repayment on behalf of the Mataqali of</span><span> </span><span>Natogadravu in Tailevu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government has agreed to continue with the project through the Ministry of 
<br/>iTaukei  Affairs as the relevant  Ministry dealing with  matters affecting</span><span> iTaukei</span><span> people.  This  also 
<br/>ensures  that  the  proper  awareness  of  the  project  is  carried  out  so  that  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  people  can  take 
<br/>advantage of the opportunity to develop and obtain proper lease titles for their land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight some of the law reviews that have been endorsed 
<br/>by  Government  which  we  will  consult  the  public  on.    This  Government  has  recently  conducted 
<br/>consultations  on  the  Child  Justice  Bill  and  the  Child  Care  Protection  Bill.    In  fact,  the  previous 
<br/>Government  had  approved  the  review  of  the  Juvenile  Act  1973  and  the  Child  Welfare  Act  2010 
<br/>review over 10 years ago. That eventuated in the draft Bills of the Child Justice and Child Care and 
<br/>Protection  for  Mutual  Dominant  under  the  previous  Government.  As  such  our  people  have  been 
<br/>denied the potential benefits of those Bills for over 10 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ratify that, the Government has conducted several consultations on the two draft Child 
<br/>related Bills. I am informed that there are future plans to conduct another around of consultations 
<br/>with  stakeholders  and  the  wider  community  before  the  draft  Bills  are  finalised  and  submitted  to 
<br/>Cabinet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also undertaking consultation in the review of the following Bills, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Legal Practitioners Act 2009; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>High Court Act 1875; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Magistrates Court Act 1944 and the Anti-Corruption Court; and  
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local Government Act 1972. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also plans to review and replace the Surfing Areas Act 2010. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cabinet also endorsed the review of the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are,  in  fact,  ensuring  that  genuine  and  regular  public  participation  is  enabled  in  the 
<br/>development of the review of the law.  This will ensure that the rights and interests of the people are 
<br/>considered in any formulation of law that will, no doubt, impact their daily lives.  This underscores 
<br/>Fiji’s democratic society which should be based on human dignity, equality and freedom.  This is a 
<br/>fundamental neglect of the FijiFirst Government that this Government is trying to ratify. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  relation  to  TELS  debt  write-off,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Tertiary  Scholarship  and  Loan 
<br/>Service (Budget Amendment) Act 2003 will give effect to this.  By forgiving TELS loans, recipients 
<br/>now can have more disposable income, allowing them to spend more on goods and services which, 
<br/>in  turn,  stimulates  economic  growth.    This  can  also  improve  their  overall  financial  well-being, 
<br/>allowing  them  to  invest  in  other  areas  such  as  buying  a  home,  starting  a  business  or  serving  for 
<br/>retirement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also removed the “No Jab No Job Policy” which was legalised by 
<br/>way of amendment to the Health and Safety as Work General Workplace Regulations 2003. That 
<br/>amendment was unilaterally made by the previous Government, which failed to adequately consider 
<br/>the  impact  of  the  amendment  on  the  affected  workers’  rights  and  their  livelihood.  Under  this 
<br/>Government affected workers can now re-apply for their positions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will also look into reviewing the Civil Service renumeration which will address 
<br/>numerous  requests  made  on  this  to  the  previous  Government.    Moreover,  and  noting  the 
<br/>constitutional right to adjust the minimum wage, it is also appropriate that Government will work 
<br/>towards reviewing the current Minimum Wage rate in the next financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, going back to the review of the NPTC levy, it is a fact that 1 percent levy 
<br/>of the employers payable under the Fiji National Training Levy Order 1998 was intended for training 
<br/>of Fijian employees to promote employment productivity.  Unfortunately, in its 2018-2019 Budget, 
<br/>the  previous  Government  restructured  the  allocation  of  the  levy  by  distributing  40  percent  of  the 
<br/>funds  to  ACCF  and  50  percent  towards  the  provision  of  medical  services  by  Private  Medical 
<br/>Practitioners.  On top of that the previous Government extended the use of the levy to be used for 
<br/>FNU capital projects. To ratify that, the Government will work towards reviewing the NPTC levy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to dwell on this, but I wish to address my concerns.  I guess 
<br/>the  50-page  anonymous  document  circulating  in  the  social  media  which  makes  accusation  that 
<br/>directly attacks the Government, and the values and principles of democracy that it seeks to uphold.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Those accusations are both, unfounded and without legal merit, and 
<br/>originated from anonymous sources, aiming to malign Government rather than engage in meaningful 
<br/>discussion.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I have just been told it was circulated by a former FijiFirst candidate.  
<br/>Perhaps, you can make connections. In fact, the author’s decision to remain anonymous reflects to a 
<br/>lack courage in taking responsibility for its claim.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the first month of taking office, I visited His Excellency the President 
<br/>and, in our discussion, what came out from the 50 pages was basically some of issues that were put 
<br/>forward and we can know where it is coming from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are your referring to me? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- The Members of Parliament can know where is it coming from.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>document has been referred to appropriate authorities for their necessary action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  given  the  high  debt  level  inherited  from  the  previous 
<br/>Government  and  taking  into  account  Government’s  projected  long-term  goals  which  includes 
<br/>reducing  debt  to  GDP  ratio  by  2030,  the  Budget  appropriately  seeks  to  implement  structural 
<br/>adjustments  to  raise  revenue  while  also  safeguarding  the  needs  of  the  most  vulnerable  through 
<br/>appropriate social measures.  The Budget also ensures that we, the elected Members of this beloved 
<br/>nation,  are  leading  by  example  and  making  the  necessary  sacrifices  to  ensure  the  recovery  and 
<br/>sustainable growth of our society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the 2023-2024 Budget before this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will resume when the bell is sounded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 1.35 p.m.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.47 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  all  those 
<br/>watching from the comfort of their homes, a very good afternoon, </span><span>ram ram</span><span> and </span><span>bula</span><span> to you all.  I 
<br/>would like to thank the honourable Minister of Finance and his team for the hard work and dedication 
<br/>in preparing and presenting this National Budget.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, Permanent Secretary and the team at the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance.  A very prominent, thriving and inspirational Budget.  This is what I would have 
<br/>said, but unfortunately, I cannot.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You just said it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- At  first glance, we had critics praising the Budget, commentators 
<br/>were all over giving running commentaries and made it obvious that without a VAT increase the 
<br/>economy  cannot  survive just like the narrative that has brain-washed people that debt  is  a wrong 
<br/>thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  the  commentators,  the  only  way  to  bail  out  Fiji  is  through 
<br/>increasing the revenue of Government by increasing the VAT, duty and corporate tax.  My colleagues 
<br/>have said a lot about the unfulfilled promises made by the Coalition Government that were to be 
<br/>achieved in the first 100 days, then later it changed to six months and now in this financial year.  So, 
<br/>I will not dwell on it, but what I would like to focus on is this Budget, and if the Budget itself has the 
<br/>depth to achieve the desired outcomes.  One thing that is obvious that this Budget will achieve is 
<br/>increased inflation, which totally contradicts what honourable Ditoka was saying that this Budget is 
<br/>to help </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities because according to him </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities live in poverty.  So how 
<br/>can the increase in inflation help not just the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities, but anyone?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> One  of  the  points  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  is  that  Government 
<br/>revenue needs to increase.  Let us see how the Government can increase its revenue and its effect on 
<br/>the general public.  In very simple terms, there are two ways.  The first one is by making policies that 
<br/>should be sustainable and would yield the desired effect over several years without putting additional 
<br/>burden on its citizens.  This would include Government investment in public enterprise that would 
<br/>give direct return in terms of dividend and investment in infrastructure which will give a pathway to 
<br/>increase  economic  activity  that  contribute  towards  the  growth  of  the  economy.    The  second  way 
<br/>would be to burden the citizen by increasing the tax, thus increasing the revenue.  This is what a lazy 
<br/>government does and that is exactly what has been done by this Coalition Government in this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to create stimulus in the economy by increasing the buying powers of individuals 
<br/>and decreasing  tax by ensuring that people have more money in  their pockets.   The more money 
<br/>people have in their pockets, the more they are going to spend, that would mean more income for the 
<br/>Government.  The policy should ensure that people are always in the spending mode, but over here, 
<br/>the Coalition Government is doing totally the opposite.  It is better to collect $5 from 20 individuals 
<br/>than to collect $20 from five individuals.  Collection in both scenarios will give you $100, but the 
<br/>first scenario puts less burden on the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Comparing the living standards of people in 2006 and now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost every 
<br/></span><span>second house along the Suva-Nausori corridor must have a vehicle such as 4x4 or SUV.  Was this 
<br/>possible in 2006?  No, it was not.  No matter what one says, no one can deny that there were so many 
<br/>developments  taking  place,  such  as  roads,  electricity,  water  supply,  civil  service  delivery,  school 
<br/>education, rural roads, airports, jetties, bridges, police stations, digital technology, </span><span>Walesi, </span><span>et cetera.   
<br/>After the election when the Government changes, they should not change the basics, which was set 
<br/>by the previous government with regards to development of the nation.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1337 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The continuity should be there in terms of development.  One can argue that this Coalition 
<br/>Government will also do the development, but it is not reflected in the Budget especially when the 
<br/>FijiFirst  used  to  present  a  budget  that  used  to  have  at  least  40  percent  capital  investment  and  60 
<br/>percent operational.  This Budget is offering 80 percent operational expense and 20 percent capital 
<br/>expense.  Yet, FijiFirst was blamed for excessive expenditure.  So, if capital expenditure has been 
<br/>reduced by 50 percent, one can only imagine how many capital projects will take place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The number of any new major capital project in this Budget is zero.  Even during COVID-
<br/>19, the FijiFirst Government ensured that all capital projects continued as it benefitted Fijians, and 
<br/>post-pandemic when our economy is within the five fastest growing economies in the world, we slow 
<br/>our development by reducing the capital budget.  No way this makes sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, I agree to what the honourable Minister of Finance said that it will take time for Fiji to 
<br/>recover.  One for sure that I know, it will take time to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.  What 
<br/>other recoveries is  he talking  about,  that I am  not  too  sure.  The biggest global crisis  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic has gone, the economy is back on track and growing very rapidly with major contributing 
<br/>factors being tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is interesting to see the Government Members flying high in the clouds visiting overseas 
<br/>on the same Fiji Airways that most of them wanted to be either sold or eaten as dinner at the height 
<br/>of  pandemic.    Where  would  Fiji  have  been  if  it  had  sold  Fiji  Airways  aircrafts?    Honourable 
<br/>Kamikamica, please go and read the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>, it is on record that former Opposition Members 
<br/>requested planes to be sold especially the one sitting right next to you.  That reminds me, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I request the honourable Minister of Finance to go and get the toilet fixed in Fiji Airways’ A330 
<br/>Airbus as it does not look good, our national carrier ranked 15th globally, flying tourists to and fro 
<br/>Fiji when the toilet is not in operation.  We were blamed for the toilet doors at CWM Hospital, now 
<br/>please go and fix the toilet in the aircraft. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  You  need  to  do  it  because  under  FiijFirst  it  was  ranked  15th 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>globally and if you do not attend to these kinds of things, the ranking will definitely go down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same note the products in the duty free has hiked up to almost 
<br/>200 percent.  Duty free products are almost the same price even without duty compared to the local 
<br/>market price.  This will also have a negative effect on the tourism industry.  First, go and get these 
<br/>basics right.  Would we be on the path to recovery had we sold Fiji Airways aircrafts?  I do not think 
<br/>so, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to admit that harsh decisions were taken during COVID-19 pandemic and positive 
<br/>results of those decisions can be seen now.  On one side, it was the health of the people, and on the 
<br/>other side it was the livelihood of Fijians and on top of that, keeping the economy floating.  These 
<br/>three aspects were kept in balance which is why we see a boom in the economy today.  Now, that we 
<br/>are over the pandemic period, let us look back on some of the statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  and  foremost,  the  debt  level  which  the  Government  members  do  not  get  tired  of 
<br/></span><span>criticizing, every government borrows money not just in Fiji but throughout the world.  Even the 
<br/>Coalition Government will borrow with this current Budget where they have a deficit of $639 million.  
<br/>Debt to GDP was only 48.6 percent pre-pandemic. It was during the pandemic that the government 
<br/>had to borrow that showed that there was an increase in debt to GDP ratio and it crossed 80 percent.  
<br/>Had it not been for COVID-19, we would have been sitting well below 50 percent.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why did we not borrow and why did it have to increase to 80 percent? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It had to increase to 80 percent -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Overnight we lost tourism income accumulating to about $2 billion.  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Could inject money into the economy and at the same time ensuring our foreign reserve 
<br/>is healthy as Fiji is dependent on imports.  Borrowing overseas brought foreign currency 
<br/>thus increasing foreign exchange.   
<br/>To support more than 115,000 people of Fijians who lost their jobs overnight.   
<br/>To  ensure  that  Fijian  families  do  not  die  because  of  hunger  during  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Our health system does not collapse.   
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure that the education of our children are not affected.   
<br/>To help businesses with much needed cash flow to keep their business going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FijiFirst faced criticism that we borrowed and took the country into a debt level from 
<br/>which we cannot rescue ourselves as a nation.  We were tagged that because of our borrowing, the 
<br/>economy was about to collapse.  What a joke, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We became the fifth fastest growing 
<br/>economy in the world. Borrowing is not bad but what is that money used for is more important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Exactly, now you find out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- And that money was used for capital investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- This reminds me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of a famous advertisement</span><span> </span><span>that 
<br/>comes on </span><span>Navtarang</span><span> where a guy tries to borrow money to buy bread and that is exactly what the 
<br/>Government is going to do.  I believe that you do not borrow money to buy bread, you borrow money 
<br/>to  establish  a  bakery  which  in  return  will  give  you  more  business  and  you  will  have  a  return  on 
<br/>investment.  That is exactly what FijiFirst was doing to borrow money for capital projects and not 
<br/>for day-to-day-operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What was happening that you overspent in the past, that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Let us compare the figures to what FijiFirst used to offer and what 
<br/>is there in this Budget.  I can see that this Budget also has a deficit, and that the Government will 
<br/>have to take loan to manage the deficit.  So, how is this loan taken by the Coalition Government any 
<br/>different to the loan taken by the FijiFirst Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-Very different. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Yes,  because  ours  was  for  capital  and  yours  is  going  to  be 
<br/></span><span>operational and a loan is a loan.  How can you stand in Parliament and criticise the loan taken by the 
<br/></span><span>FijiFirst Government and when you are sitting on the other side, you take loan.  How is that possible? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Half a million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Do not use the loan. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1339 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  The  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  tried  to  play  smart  and  he 
<br/>talked about the percentage deficit being the lowest and not mentioning anywhere that he is going to 
<br/>borrow.  Maybe he thought people are not smart that they would not understand and guess what?  
<br/>Some NFP supporters posted on </span><span>Facebook</span><span>, “Finally a Budget without any loan.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The deficit percentage seems to be less, but one needs to see how it is.  There is an estimated 
<br/>$3.7 billion revenue projection.  Remember, this is just an estimate, it is not that $3.7 billion will be 
<br/>actual revenue. Now, this is what I am saying, the cooking up of numbers and not what you claimed 
<br/>we were doing to show nine years of consecutive economic grown.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister of Finance must remember, there are 28 members on the other side 
<br/>waiting to spend this $4.2 billion budget and he is the only one who is responsible for collection.  
<br/>Remember this is not a $3.7 billion cheque waiting to be cashed.  It is just an estimate, and he has to 
<br/>collect  this  amount  worth  $3.7  billion.  By  forecasting  hire  revenue,  one  can  show  the  lower 
<br/>percentage deficit.  Interestingly to see after one year if this revenue is going to be collected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- We will keep a close watch, do not worry but all the Fijians need 
<br/>to realise is where is this $3.7 billion coming from.  Out of $3.7 billion, $800 million is from direct 
<br/>tax and $2.2 billion from indirect tax. So, a total of $3 billion is directly going to be paid out of our 
<br/>pockets.  Yes, from our pockets through increase in VAT that will have a huge impact on the savings 
<br/>and spending powers of Fijians.  Secondly, the increase in corporate tax and thirdly increasing the 
<br/>duty on certain items. Who gets affected by this?  Who is at the end of the supply chain ends up 
<br/>paying for all these?  Ordinary Fijians from their own pockets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No company will fork out money from its pocket to pay additional corporate tax of 5 percent. 
<br/>It will be passed on to the customers.  The amount of indirect tax that Fijians consumers would be 
<br/>paying will be massive, in excess of $3 billion and it will have a huge impact on those who are living 
<br/>under poverty and as claimed, there are almost 10 percent Fijians living under poverty. If we calculate 
<br/>this amount per capita, it accumulates to a huge amount.  Unfortunately, these are the things people 
<br/>wanted and here they have it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  Members  from  the  other  side  suggested  that  Social  Welfare  would  take  care  of  the 
<br/>increase impact of VAT.  Let us be realistic about it.  Sir, $100 to $150 is spent on a single trip to 
<br/>town these days, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Is that enough? I do not think so.  FijiFirst was being blamed to 
<br/>burden the future generation with debt, but this Budget is not putting burden on the next generation 
<br/>but putting burden on this generation by increasing VAT, corporate tax and duty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  This  is  what  Government  Members  of  Parliament  were  selling 
<br/>during the election campaign and, unfortunately, people bought these lies.  Hard reality but have to 
<br/></span><span>deal with it now.  What is new in this Budget that was not there when FijiFirst used to offer a National 
<br/></span><span>Budget?  I recognised three things apart from increases in tax: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Beautification of villages and settlements; and 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Are we joking with people on the issue of the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs? Is it just to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fulfil someone’s ambition that Coalition Government has created this Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Sugar and Multi-Ethnic’s total budget is $51.6 million, out 
<br/>of which $2 million is for Multi-Ethnic Affairs with $1 million done under “R”; one of the smallest 
<br/>ministries in the history of Fiji.  Is this blatant abuse of power and unnecessary spending?  Close to 
<br/>40 percent of Fiji’s population fall under Multi-Ethnic Affairs and a budget of $2 million and $1 
<br/>million under “R”?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who is the Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What are we doing?  Whose idea was this?  Government can do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>much better than this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- So this is what the Minister was doing for past six months making 
<br/>a budget worth $2 million and because he was not too sure what was to be done in his Ministry, out 
<br/>of that $2 million he puts $1 million under “R”.  If I am able to come up with an idea, I will ask for 
<br/>the money, Minister of Finance, if I am not…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Speak when he is here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Unfortunately he is not here to listen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister’s company must be having a turnover of more than $2 million.  He 
<br/>could have done a much better job with his Ministry and $1 million is just for the operational cost of 
<br/>that Ministry which is abuse of money.  The two programmes under that Ministry are sitting under 
<br/>“R”.  That means $1 million is total waste of money, just paying for the civil servants by creating 
<br/>this new Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- As the Minister for Sugar, he could have utilised that $1 million or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$2 million to increase the price of sugar cane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 62(4)(a) on 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- No he did not.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1341 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- And promoting cassava.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- And promoting cassava, that is the second issue. Never mind, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, I will continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the second point, why is money only allocated to </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>villages and settlements? Why 
<br/>has the Budget started to divide people into ethnicity and race?  I am not against the fact that money 
<br/>is allocated for villages and settlements through the Ministry of iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Affairs, but there are other 
<br/>settlements with other ethnic groups as well.  Why can funds not be available to those communities 
<br/>as well to beautify the surroundings because at the end of the day, every beautification programme 
<br/>will beautify our Fiji.  So why the double standard?  Why have we started dividing people by ethnic-
<br/>base policies?  This needs to be rectified.  Just yesterday, the honourable Leader of the Government 
<br/>in Parliament talked about genuine reconciliation and such policies do not help in mixed communities 
<br/>and settlements we even have </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>as well, so why are they deprived to access these funds? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Standing  Order  62  (4)(d),  this  has  been  a  common  theme 
<br/>throughout by the Opposition.  Honourable Ketan Lal read it out so that they can understand.  It states 
<br/>and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Words that are likely to promote or provoke feelings of ill-will or hostility between 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities or ethnic groups within Fiji.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is imputing that the Ministry of iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Affairs’ budget is creating ill-feeling.  How can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you say that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That budget is particularly for the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, 
<br/>so how can you say that it creates ill-feeling because the other ministries also have budgets which 
<br/>cater for rural communities such the one you are saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Which one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Rural Development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Wait, hold on, I will come to it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue, honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am done with that beautification programme, no worries about that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Culture, Heritage and Arts for the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>community is very important.  No issues with 
<br/>it being moved to the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.  These are important, these non-tangible values 
<br/>need to be preserved.  The culture, dialect, custom, traditional dance, traditional foods and recipes 
<br/>needs to be preserved.  We need to train someone with philosophy degree who can preserve this for 
<br/>us.  We need to and we should invest in offering PhD in iTaukei Culture, Heritage and Arts in our 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>local universities.  Even if we can train at least few scholars who can preserve this for us would be 
<br/>great.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But at the same time, which Ministry is looking after the Culture, Heritage and Arts of other 
<br/>ethnic groups?  Other groups have been totally neglected as I said earlier.  With the Minister, the 
<br/>Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs is merely a joke with a given budget of $500,000 which is under 
<br/>“R”, why this disparity?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very true. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  you  have  been  advocating  about 
<br/>equality and that every citizen of Fiji will be called Fijian and they will have to share equal rights, so 
<br/>why is the budget announcement is not reflecting this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, we do understand that there is a shortage of skilled workers in Fiji at the moment but 
<br/>not just that, there is a massive shortage of nurses as well and one of the organisations which has 
<br/>been training nurses in Fiji gets $600,000 only.  Is Fiji’s Sangam Nursing Institute being victimised 
<br/>just because their National President is an Opposition member?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are serious about the health sector, we need to increase the support. 
<br/>Close to 300 students are enrolled at Sangam Nursing Institute.  These nurses will fill the gaps left 
<br/>by nurses who are leaving Fiji for greener pastures.  While still on the education sector, the write-off 
<br/>of $600 million on TELS loan, yes, I agree, you have done it, but at what cost?  On one side, you do 
<br/>not have operating surplus and on the other side waiving out such a huge amount and then paying 
<br/>close to $150 million every year.  The effect this is is going to have on the economy will be very bad.  
<br/>If a student took money for their studies, they should honour and pay it back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have a few questions with regards to the new scholarship: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The cut-off mark has not been clarified, is it 200 or more? 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>What will happen if I want to study something that is in demand and universities are not able 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to offer me a place, but I qualify for the scholarship? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>What will happen to the freedom of choice if I want to become a lawyer, but the scholarship 
<br/>is not offered?  Where will I get the money to study law since there is no option of loan and 
<br/>banks would not offer the loan?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Have we not removed the burden from the current students and placed it on the parents whose 
<br/></span><span>students are still at high school? While talking about high school, managements now are 
<br/></span><span>allowed to impose levies on students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Where is free education for primary and secondary school?  We all know it will come in the 
<br/>form of building fees, ground fees, logistics fees, management fees, name it. While ministries 
<br/>will pay for tuition, parents will have to pay for all these. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Why has the student ambition I had throughout high school to be in a particular profession, 
<br/>I will be forced to choose a different career path just because Government is not offering a 
<br/>scholarship and not providing me with a loan so that I can still choose my career path and 
<br/>pay the loan later? 
<br/></span><span>It is said that the students in high school will face the full brunt of such poor planned policies 
<br/></span><span>when they choose their career paths as early as next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>On the zero-rated VAT on medication.  Let us see the reality on the ground.  We know that 
<br/>the pharmacies are  giving prescribed medication both with and without prescription, it is 
<br/>either  we turn a blind  eye towards  it or  let us face  reality.   So, medication given out on 
<br/>prescription, what will they be classified as? Or if they are given without prescription, what 
<br/>are they going to be classified as? Either stop it totally or make prescription medication VAT 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>exempted instead of zero-rated - no pay, no claim.  And what about all those over-the-counter 
<br/>medications that  will  come  on  prescription  because  that  will  be  referred  to as prescribed 
<br/>medication. Will these items be VAT-free as well or not?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  believe  these  are  very  important  concerns  with  regards  to  the  Budget 
<br/>otherwise our people will suffer. In </span><span>Hindi</span><span>, there is a saying, </span><span>leep pot ke barabar karo. </span><span> This Budget 
<br/>is a truly reflection of this particular programme. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support 
<br/>the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to render my support to the 2023-2024 National Budget that 
<br/>was announced in this august Chamber on 30th June, 2023.  Firstly, allow me to congratulate and 
<br/>thank the honourable Minister of Finance and his hardworking staff at the Ministry for Finance for 
<br/>crafting a very considerate and fair budget which is a budget for our new Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I wish to point out that this Budget has been a fair and tough 
<br/>one, but none the less, one that we as citizens of this country deserve.  Given the financial status of 
<br/>our economy, one which we the Coalition Government have inherited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have long been living on freebies and unnecessary spending and now 
<br/>we as citizens of our country sadly must make the tough decisions including the increasing of VAT 
<br/>at 15 percent. Let me remind Parliament that the 15 percent VAT is not new to Fiji as it has already 
<br/>been  applied  by  the  former  government  without  exemption,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  here  they  are 
<br/>jumping up and down about the 15 percent VAT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Were they thinking about the people when they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>made the 15 percent VAT? I doubt that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Home Affairs for 2023-2024 Budget has been 
<br/>allocated  $12.4  million  so  as  to  manage  the  nation’s  security  by  outlining  policies  in  matters  of 
<br/>national security and defence.  Sir, $324,222 has been allocated for the upcoming National Security 
<br/>Review which is a much needed one to align our security and defence strategies as was alluded to by 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Home Affairs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  2023-2024  Budget,  the  Immigration  Department  received  an 
<br/>allocation  of  $8.6  million  in  the  upcoming  2023-2024  Budget  cycle.  The  Department  anticipates 
<br/>roughly a 19 percent salary increase from $2.5 million to $2.9 million. The additional $239,686 in 
<br/>this  year’s  Budget  makes  provision  for  the  employment  of  10  additional  Immigration  Officer 
<br/></span><span>positions.    This,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  is  part  of  our  initiative  to  strengthen  the  delivery  of  critical 
<br/></span><span>immigration services. A sum of $1.5 million has been allocated for the modernising of immigration 
<br/>through the procurement of e-passports to ensure security and forgery and a further $0.3 million for 
<br/>the installation of new passport kits in our missions globally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a further $250,000 has been provided for the renovation of the Immigration 
<br/>Department Safe Houses in Suva and Nadi. Both these houses, Sir, are not fit to be occupied given

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the deteriorating condition and inhumane facilities in them.  This, in turn will boost the work carried 
<br/>out by our Immigration Department in the apprehension of individuals who have breached the law 
<br/>and the deportation of individuals who do not follow our immigration laws   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Immigration  Department  continues  to  focus  on  resolving  the  many 
<br/>migration  issues.    The  continued  objective  to  strengthen  border  management  and  security  and 
<br/>facilitation  of  the  increasing  rate  of  mobility  at  our  borders.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allocation  of  the 
<br/>Immigration Department’s resources to its key programmes in this Budget allows us to contribute 
<br/>immensely  to  improving  efficiencies  in  the  facilitation  of  the  people’s  movement,  economic 
<br/>development on migration of skilled workers and investors and socio-economic well-being of our 
<br/>Fiji citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department is committed to creating new avenues to improve the Ease 
<br/>of Doing Business and ensuring that all facets of the Departments functions in accordance with the 
<br/>global best practices.  With that being said the Department is pursing few projects to enhance and 
<br/>raise the standards of immigration service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Budget  will  bolster  various  immigration  systems  and  processes.  As 
<br/>alluded  to  yesterday  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration,  it  will  also 
<br/>strengthen and further enhance border security priorities in combating internal and external threats. 
<br/>Given that Fiji is still a developing economy, the budgetary allocation for Immigration will further, 
<br/>reinforce and revamp travel and trade and ensure that Fiji adheres to international standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2023-2024  Budget  is  a  progressive  and  a  considered  one  for  the 
<br/>Immigration  Department.  The  Budget  prioritises  resourcing  the  Department  on  more  staff  and 
<br/>technology  to  ensure  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  immigration  services.    I  thank  the 
<br/>Government  for  its  understanding  of  the  ongoing  challenge  of  resource  constraints  with  the 
<br/>Immigration  Department.  The  Department  has  already  taken  some  action  to  reduce  the  load  on 
<br/>issuing temporary work permits.  They will also consider broader immigration law changes that will 
<br/>better position Fiji  in  the global economy  and take advantage of people’s increased mobility  and 
<br/>utilise this financial budget wisely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  damaging  effects  of  unnecessary  spending  debt  left  by  the  previous 
<br/>government have rattled and tarnished the Fijian economy.  Such a statement is evident in various 
<br/>failed projects that the previous government traversed on and to name are few, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>famous Lautoka Swimming Pool, Govind Park and as honourable Ketan Lal would agree with me, 
<br/>our very own Savusavu Market that we have always been waiting for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are some of the reasons why the Opposition has been asking why are 
<br/>there no capital expenditures?  I understand, Sir, there is a lot of things that we need to do first before 
<br/>we start of something new.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Running out of ideas, do not worry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- However, I feel empowered to stand here and say 
<br/></span><span>that  the  2023-2024  budgetary  allocation  includes  every  citizen  of  this  beloved  country,  and  that 
<br/></span><span>ensures that we all move forward stronger despite the challenges that had ravaged the nation for the 
<br/>past  decade  and  a  half.  Such  sentiments  are  evident  in  the  2023-2024  Budgetary  allocation  as  it 
<br/>involves all Fijians, regardless of differences especially vulnerable marginalise groups, the elderly 
<br/>who  have  sweated  to  build  this  nation,  the  current  working  population  and  the  young  rising 
<br/>generation who are the future of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1345 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increased allowances for the Social Pension Scheme from 
<br/>$147.7 million to $200.2 million to support our elderly citizens, shows the compassionate and moral 
<br/>responsibility of this Government.  This is also reflected in the budgetary allocation for the education 
<br/>sector, receiving a warping yet deserving a $845 million chunk of the Budget. In all its totality, this 
<br/>adds up to the national security of Fiji, prioritising the lives of every Fijian – young, youth and old 
<br/>and ensuring that no one gets left behind, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Yet may I say, this is what defines the 
<br/>Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also  would like to  take this time to  acknowledge the  allocation and increased budgetary 
<br/>allowance for the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> and </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span>. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a timely allocation 
<br/>for the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>and</span><span> Turaga ni Yavusa </span><span>as they are the guardians of our various villages across 
<br/>Fiji, such finances will enable them to carry out their work effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Sir,  I  would  also  like  to  commend  and  acknowledge  the  forgiveness  of  the 
<br/>Tertiary and Loans debt.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 55,000 students and families are debt free, thanks to the 
<br/>Coalition Government Budget.  In fact, many students were not paying the debt.  It was eventually a 
<br/>failed scholarship scheme which should have not been brought to life in the first place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maybe we should ask the students, what scholarship system do they want, fortunately, they 
<br/>have answered and that is why we are sitting on this side of Parliament and they are sitting on that 
<br/>side Parliament.  This would not have been possible, Mr. Speaker, Sir, without the support from the 
<br/>Government of the day, the honourable Minister of Finance and his incredible team and, of course, 
<br/>the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cancellation of the Tertiary Loans Scheme would not only empower students bonded by 
<br/>debt but will give them more space to breath in terms of budgeting for family and personal expenses.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight that more money is not the only solution for every issue.  
<br/>We are approaching this from an entirely new perspective, the efficient and effective utilization of 
<br/>every single dollar will now be the main focus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  questions  have  been  raised  by  the  Opposition  on  the  services  of  the 
<br/>Immigration Department on overseas labourer’s coming into our country.  Let me remind this august 
<br/>Parliament  and  Fiji  as  a  whole  that  as  gatekeepers,  the  Immigration  Department  wholeheartedly 
<br/>welcomes all to our country. However, as gatekeepers, the Immigration Department will be vigilant 
<br/>and remain steadfast on their decisions on all who aspire to enter our country that they follow our 
<br/>laws and when entering our country that they meet the entry requirements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to this Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems honourable Nath while speaking yesterday has 
<br/>come up with some sort of conspiracy theory and that the honourable Member has some evidence of 
<br/>a screenshot that someone has been told to go back to India.  I say to the honourable Member, “Please, 
<br/>lodge your complaint with the relevant authorities or even legal system which is why it is in place.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is just the beginning Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Coalition’s administration, assistance and 
<br/>support.  We will continue to work hand in hand with the ordinary people and ensure that no one is 
<br/>forgotten.  On that note Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the 2023-2024 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, Prime 
<br/>Minister  of  Fiji,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and people of 
<br/>Fiji who are listening in and watching today.  As I have said, thank you for the opportunity to be able 
<br/>to  contribute  to  this  debate,  the  debate  of  the  2023-2024  Budget.  First  of  all,  I  would  like  to

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>congratulate  the  honourable  Professor  Biman  Prasad,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance for the delivering the Coalition Government’s first ever Budget proposal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want everyone to know that I really, really, really want the 2023-2024 
<br/>Budget to be a great Budget.  I want it to be an appropriate Budget that will deliver a better quality 
<br/>of life for our people. I want it to be a great Budget, because I care for the people of Fiji like all of 
<br/>us.  We all really care for the people of this country so this needed to be, it needs to be a great Budget.  
<br/>The people of this country deserve the very best, they deserve a Budget that will move their lives 
<br/>forward, that will uplift their lives and the lives of their children and the people around them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want the Coalition Government to do well so that it can do the right thing 
<br/>for Fiji.  They have the mandate to decide what happens in this country, they have the power to make 
<br/>things happen.  They can make a difference and I am also quite confident in wishing the Coalition 
<br/>Government doing well because I know that the alternative government that I am a member of will 
<br/>always be able to do a much much, much better job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We have shown them over the last eight years and we will show it 
<br/>again in the future.  I am going to show you how we have done that, and I am going to show you in 
<br/>my address today how this Budget is going to lead to harsher lives for the people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  That  is  what  I  wanted  this  Budget  to  do,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  
<br/>Unfortunately, it falls far short of my expectations.  After sitting on that side of Parliament and my 
<br/>good friend the honourable Professor Biman Prasad sitting here for so many years, every time that 
<br/>we had a FijiFirst Budget, I would listen to him as he badmouthed every budget, as he said, “you 
<br/>have no ideas, everything that you say is out of date” and he said that over and over again.  All these 
<br/>verbiages, this  verbal  diarrhea that used to  come across from  this side of Parliament, questioning 
<br/>every single FijiFirst Budget, I sat there and listened to his accusations.  But what he has put together 
<br/>here, Sir is totally unimaginative, totally dull.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Budget based on false premises, highly likely and I think it will lead this country in the 
<br/>wrong direction.  It will lead us astray, it will lead this country astray.  There is nothing, nothing here 
<br/>that will build a better Fiji because that is what we on this side of Parliament stand for - Building a 
<br/>Better Fiji.  During the course of the debate, the Coalition Government has tried to present a very 
<br/>false picture of the situation that they had when they took over.  They referred to it as a grim state of 
<br/>things.  The terminology has come in grim like some big catastrophe has fallen, they have not really 
<br/>painted it in the way that it needs to, nothing could be further from the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Look at the health centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Let me tell the people of this country what our legacy has been – the 
<br/></span><span>legacy of the FijiFirst Government.  In this country there has never ever been a time when you had 
<br/>nine years - growth, growth, growth, growth.  Never ever happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Bainimarama boom. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, the Bainimarama boom gave birth to all the things that you will

<div><span>now try to imitate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Leader of the Opposition said, “your Budget is microwave.”  Everything 
<br/>that we do, you just reheat.  You put it in the microwave oven, you just reheat.  There is nothing new 
<br/>in what you do.  There is no innovativeness, there is no new thinking.  It is devoid of anything new.  
<br/>Absolutely nothing new. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it took governments around 34 years from 1970 to 
<br/>double GDPs, to make it increase rapidly like that.  It took us far less time to be able to do that during 
<br/>the time that the Bainimarama Government and the FijiFirst has been in power.  The GDP per capita, 
<br/>the amount of wealth we create in the country, apportion to all the people in this country increased 
<br/>from $6 billion to $12 billion in a very short period of time.  That is a creation of wealth.  When you 
<br/>create wealth, then you can provide service to people.  If you do not create wealth, you cannot provide 
<br/>to people the things that they need.  That is what we did.  When you start crossing your arms, I know 
<br/>this thing is hitting you right there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We delivered a Constitution that gave equality to everyone in this country. No matter where 
<br/>you stay, no matter what your religion is, no matter what kind of food you eat or language you speak, 
<br/>our Constitution gave you equality.  It gave stability to the  people of this country. That will be a 
<br/>legacy of this government forever.  We made sure that during the darkest times of our history, when 
<br/>people were hit by COVID, we got this country together ready to fly into the clouds and into the 
<br/>stars.  We revived the country and got it ready.  The learned Attorney-General has tried to say that 
<br/>the economy was already declining before COVID-19 hit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Do you think any country in the world has continuous growth all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time for 20 years or 30 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell me which country, honourable Attorney-General?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me tell you the basics of economics.  There are always cycles of economic growth.  In 
<br/>this country for the first time ever, under our leadership, we had one cycle, the only time we had the 
<br/>cycle of nine years of continuous growth.  When you have nine years, you go up the hill, sometimes 
<br/>there will be a slight dip, then you go up again, because it does not go up and up all the time.  You 
<br/>will see that that is what has happened here - growth was happening, growth was increasing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  COVID,  taxes  declined  by  50  percent  and  government  revenue  declined  by  50 
<br/>percent, but we had to maintain the expenditure.  We decided that we will look after the people of 
<br/>this country.  We decided it, so what did we have to do?  We had to borrow.  What would you do in 
<br/>the same case?  Would you leave them to die?  Would you leave them to flounder?  Would you leave 
<br/>them to have nothing to be able to look after their children?  What would you do?  You have no 
<br/>answer.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During that time, if you look at the deficit ratios, they were going down from 2017 to 2018, 
<br/>below 50 percent, going from 47 percent and going down.  Only in COVID did it take off.  What 
<br/>would you have done?  Would you just let them die and suffer?  Is that what you would have done?  
<br/>Every sane government in the world did the same thing.  Every sane government, for two years we 
<br/>had to have that deficit because it was necessary.  You are trying to compare what you are doing in 
<br/>this Budget to COVID time.  It was an abnormal time.  You are not comparing apples to apples, you 
<br/>are comparing apples to rocks.  You do not do that.  Totally insane!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, debt to GDP ratio was 48.8 percent in 2018-2019.  It only went up to 88.8 
<br/>percent at the end of 2020-2021.  It was necessary.  Why?  Because we in government cared for the 
<br/>people of this country.  You need to make sure that you show that you care for the people of this 
<br/>country.  This Budget does not show that you care.  What you are doing in this Budget is showing 
<br/>that you do not care.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We brought Fiji successfully through COVID-19 through strong and decisive leadership.  We 
<br/>made sure that our tourism sector was ready to take off. We did not chew on model aeroplanes, no.  
<br/>We did not sell of those new planes, we got it ready.  We worked with the industry.  So, when the 
<br/>borders opened up, before other countries could take off in tourism, we were there.  We hit that road 
<br/>running.  No one got to the tape before us.  That was strong decisive leadership.  That is part of the 
<br/>legacy we give to you, do not forget it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> We were also named as the world’s third fastest growing economy in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- By who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Investment  projections  in  the  pipeline.    This  pipeline  that  you  are 
<br/>talking  about,  that  is  the  one  developed  during  our  time.    You  are  talking  about  this  pipeline, 
<br/>developed during our time.  Honourable Deputy Minister, that pipeline, watch out the pipeline might 
<br/>disappear.  Some of those projects might disappear.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism arrivals are now at the same level or above pre-COVID, it is above 2019.  Why?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because we got it ready.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- No.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is the legacy we give to you, do not forget it.  We have a high 
<br/>standing, a highly educated workforce, high standing regionally, internationally and a Fiji competing 
<br/>well above its weight class.  So that is what we have given you.  We have given you a revived Fiji, a 
<br/>Fiji ready to shoot to the stars.  Do not take it to the gutter.  Shoot to the stars, that is what we have 
<br/>done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the problems that we had with the Government when they were in 
<br/>the Opposition is this word that I have defined before in this Parliament.  The word is “hypocrisy”.  
<br/>The word hypocrisy is when you say, “I will do this, I should not do this”, then I do the exact thing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Who was that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You.  That is what you have been doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initially  I  talked  about  how  you  used  to  talk  about  Standing  Order  51  all  the  time.  
<br/>Immediately when you got in, you went into Standing Order 51.  This week you have done it again - 
<br/>Standing Order 51.  You said, you said, you said, you do the exact opposite.  Secondly, over the past 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1349 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>few years, you have been yelling about  the nominal  value of debt.   Yelling  and shouting  and we 
<br/>always tell you, “Look at debt to GDP ratio”.  Do not just look at this bottle that it is just black from 
<br/>this side, it is also white from this side.  Look at the thing in totality, but as soon as you cross from 
<br/>this side to that side, you forget about nominal GDP, you start talking about debt to GDP ratio. What 
<br/>happened in this walk just across this aisle?  Did the shades come off your eyes?  Did you finally see 
<br/>what we have been telling you all of those years?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You did not pay attention during the lectures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has changed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his tune.  Now after all that, complain about debt, his very first Budget, he increases debt.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Is that hypocrisy or is that hypocrisy?  When you have been yelling, 
<br/>shouting and frothing at the mouth about debts and then you do the same thing, you increase it, I do 
<br/>not what else to say.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  good  friend  the  honourable  Tabuya  says,  “okay,  we  also  increased  the  budget  for  the 
<br/>social welfare.”  Yes, you did, you increased the budget.  You took that increase of $400 million or 
<br/>so from the VAT, you put a $100 million.  But my contention is this, what people lost is far greater 
<br/>than what they gained, your overall impact.  So yes, you are partially true, but not completely true.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My fellow Fijians in the villages and settlements of Fiji and in the urban centres around Fiji, 
<br/>I want you to know what this VAT is going to do to you.  Every fortnight if you spend around $50 
<br/>on VAT free items, you will pay the same amount for those VAT free items.  But every fortnight if 
<br/>you are paying a $100 on other things that are not VAT free, the amount of money you spend is going 
<br/>to go up by 6 percent, even up to 11 percent because company tax is also increasing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of that company tax can be passed on.  Those goods, the price will go up by 11 percent.  
<br/>So, you are spending a $100, it will become a $111, multiply that by the month of the year.  If you 
<br/>are buying ice-cream, and you have to buy an oven, if you want to take your children to McDonald’s, 
<br/>the price is going up and up and up – ice-cream, sweetened biscuits.  That is what is happening from 
<br/>this Budget.  That is what this Government is doing to you the people of Fiji.  This is the reality.  Bus 
<br/>fares, water, all of that is going to go up.  It is not a pro-poor Budget, it is the exact opposite.  This 
<br/>Government is saying the debt is so much that you have to go through the hardship of increased VAT 
<br/>so we can pay off the debt, but the debt stock is increasing.  If you are paying off debt, the debt stock 
<br/>should be decreasing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are contradicting yourself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is what is happening here.  He is saying I have to do this for that 
<br/>and he does the complete opposite.  This Budget is a pro-rich one.  What do you think this Budget 
<br/>will do for those earning the highest levels of income in this country?  Will it reduce their income 
<br/>taxes?  Will this Budget reduce the income taxes of the people earning the highest income in this 
<br/></span><span>country?  It will do the exact opposite.  So, for the poorer, raise the prices of the things that you have 
<br/></span><span>to pay.  For the people with the most wealth, give them more take-home money.  That is what is 
<br/>happening in this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of that, what is that going to do for the small struggling companies in Fiji?  All the 
<br/>strong struggling companies in Fiji, he is telling them, “We are going to increase your tax from 20 
<br/>percent to 25 percent.”  Some companies like multi-nationals that used to have tax holidays in this

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>country, telling them, “We are not going to pay tax on your profits.”  That is what happening.  You 
<br/>are talking about, we need to raise income and then you have these other sources of income, just cut 
<br/>it short.  There is total non-alignment, non-coherence in everything that is happening in this Budget.  
<br/>Total non-coherence, non-congruent, it is going all over the place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Hogwash.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, as I was saying. Do you know that under this Budget, 
<br/>companies like Fiji Water, very profitable organisation, very good organisation will pay no taxes on 
<br/>their profits. Nothing.  I want to tell you about some companies, the Budget gives all the company 
<br/>tax wherever they go. To make it worse, this Budget will increase company tax on all other areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have mentioned, we have some struggling industries in Fiji.  I have been a member replacing 
<br/>the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  on  the  Natural  Resources  Committee.    We  have  been 
<br/>looking at the Ministry of Fisheries.  We have some struggling sectors in Fiji.  These companies that 
<br/>sail on the high seas and catch fish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What were you doing for 16 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The offshore fisheries, under this Budget, they will have to pay an 
<br/>increase in 3 percent on all the money that they spend on packing goods and raw materials.  These 
<br/>companies already have to pay four times the freight cost of their competitors that live in South-East 
<br/>Asia.  These companies are operating, and process charges are twice those of their competitors in 
<br/>Asia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of this, this operation cost will increase.  They asked for some relief, they were not 
<br/>given it.  These companies that employ locals, some of these companies, if you go to Walu Bay, their 
<br/>ships are berthed there, they cannot move into the ocean because they are struggling.  They asked for 
<br/>some relief, they were not given, but that relief was given to a multi-national company that is making 
<br/>millions and millions of dollars.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other companies that we have in Fiji like garments, they bring in raw materials, they process 
<br/>it  then  they  send  it  out.    Now  everything  that  they  are  bringing  in,  the  duty  goes  up.    They  are 
<br/>competing  with  others  in  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  around  South-East  Asia.    Those  garment 
<br/>factories employ lots of women, those companies are not being given a break but the multi-nationals 
<br/>that are earning millions are given the break.  This is a pro-rich Budget.  It is not looking after the 
<br/>interest of the people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You are contradicting yourself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  other thing that  I  want  to  say, as  I have said 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have never seen you this confused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- As I said before, this Budget here is a real microwave one.  There is 
<br/></span><span>no new thinking, all the thinking, the hard work that was done this side, you just put it in a canister, 
<br/>put it in a microwave and turned it on.  That is all you have done, microwave oven.  The honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  Trade  was  talking  about  everything  that  they  were  going  to  do  in  the 
<br/>Ministry of Trade and I was looking at all these programmes that they had under MSME Coordinating 
<br/>Agency, Young Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES) - $100,000.  The Budget has been doubled but that 
<br/>was an initiative of this side of Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1351 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Northern Development Programme, budget going up to $1 million, that was also initiated 
<br/>from  this  side.    The  National  Export  Strategy  doubling  it  up  to  $200,000,  Integrated  Human 
<br/>Resources  Development  (a  programme  from  this  side  of  Parliament),  Trade  Enhancement 
<br/>Programme ($300,000), it is just microwaving of the things that we already put in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister when you talked about the ease of doing business and 
<br/>making the construction companies making that process work much faster, that was started under us 
<br/>under Singapore Cooperation Agency; all started from this side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Started, not finished.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Started and because we did it, do you know what happened?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is in a strong state, we give you the permission to stand on our shoulders from what we 
<br/>have done for you so we can give you that knee hop to make sure you do the best for the people of 
<br/>this country.  I listened very carefully, I think my time is going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are going overtime now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I think you need to hear it.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me the time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am hoping that you do not put a halt to this revival.  I think honourable Premila Kumar had 
<br/>talked about the importance of the middle class; people earning from $30, 000 to $60,000.  These are 
<br/>the people who spend in this country.  There are not too many benefits that you are putting in to make 
<br/>sure that, that group can continue to spend.  They are missing out from the means tested assistance 
<br/>$30,000 - $60,000.  They are missing out on all of those things, at the same time, they are being hit 
<br/>by the VAT increase.  You do not kill that group of people, do not kill their spending power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Already killed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The other one that you have to watch out for is tourism. A lot of the 
<br/>things that you are doing might dampen the tourism numbers.  Sir, VAT increase, company tax and 
<br/>all of those other things, all these projections that we heard about 8 percent growth, they were made 
<br/>in the context of the conditions that were in place when we were in government.  You have changed 
<br/>those things.  So, a lot of those calculations on the revenue might not be true.  If that happens, two 
<br/>things might happen; your revenue will drop, either you will maintain the same expenditure level and 
<br/>go into deeper deficit or you will reduce your expenditure levels.  The most saddest thing that I find 
<br/>as you increase this revenue, capital is not going up.  What is happening is this bloated operational 
<br/>expenditure that is just increasing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Naupoto talked about the number of Ministers that you 
<br/>have.    You  are  just  bloating  the  operational  expenditure.    It  is  not  leading  to  any  wealth  in  this 
<br/></span><span>country; just bloating it up.  It is not good for the future of our country. This is my message to you, 
<br/></span><span>the state that we have given this country to you, do not take it down the tube.  You have got to take 
<br/>it to the next level and to do the right things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister talked at length about the Film Tax Rebate.  I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just read some articles, here is a </span><span>Fiji Times </span><span>article of 27</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023 that noted that in 2016….

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you wish to round off, honourable Member?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Sir, these are the last few ones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That year we noticed that out of the $20 million of tax rebate that was given, the economic 
<br/>activity level was around $120 million.  Rebate of $20 million to get $120,000.  Is that a good deal 
<br/>or is that a bad deal?  That is what we did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  were  in  government,  we  started  new  industries.    The  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister goes to international conferences and talks about the growth of the communication sector.  
<br/>The  growth  in  the  communication  sector  happened  because  of  what  we  did.    We  took  away  the 
<br/>monopolies, we reduced the call charges, we built the Southern Cross Cable, Interconnectivity, the 
<br/>BPO Sector and all of those new industries happened during our watch.       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You need to find new industries to grow.  We need new jobs in this country.  Do not raise the 
<br/>revenue and spend it on your operational expenditure.  You need to get rid of your cronyism that has 
<br/>become rife.  You walk through all these ministries, when I became a minister, I did not bring any 
<br/>FijiFirst people into my Ministry.  I did not bring one FijiFirst person into my Ministry.  Now you 
<br/>go to all of these ministries, and you see them from your parties working in those ministries.  That is 
<br/>cronyism.  It is happening right across, we are seeing it.  You got to be able to look out to manage 
<br/>that particular issue to make sure that it does not become our practice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in finishing off, you know who inherited the real mess when it started, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was the Bainimarama government.  They inherited the real mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You are talking about the NBF billions, the Agriculture scam but here 
<br/>is a difference.  We did not sit down and cry.  We did not whinge and whine and groan and moan.  
<br/>We got on with the job and we did what we had to do.  So, stop whinging and moaning and groaning; 
<br/>grow up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, my last point.  In the annals of history, the FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will be remembered for the transformative changes made in this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Free education, I was sitting in Cabinet on the day that honourable Viliame Naupoto said that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cabinet decided to make education free and he is true.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It was not new. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I saw the late Mr. Filipe Bole, a very distinguish leader in our country, 
<br/>a person who dedicated a significant portion of his life to education.  The day that was announced he 
<br/>was very emotional about it.  I did not fully understand, now I can see.  When education is free, you 
<br/></span><span>will see now the number of graduates that are coming out of universities, more of them are women 
<br/></span><span>(females).  The barriers that used to stop girls from going to school is completely cut off. That is a 
<br/>major transformative shift, one change in government policy affects a generation of people.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost I wish to take this moment to 
<br/>express my gratitude to the Almighty God for the blessings and guidance I have received over the 
<br/>past  six  months  in  my  capacity  as  the  Assistant  Minister  for  Education.  The  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet colleagues and fellow Assistant 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  ladies  and 
<br/>gentlemen who are seated in the public gallery and those joining in via live stream from the comfort 
<br/>of their homes, workplaces here Fiji and abroad; a very happy Wednesday afternoon to all.  It is with 
<br/>great pleasure and humility that I stand before you today to deliver the response in support of the 
<br/>National Budget for the Fiscal Year 2023-2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  theme  for  this  budget  is  “Rebuilding  our  Future  Together”.  This 
<br/>resonates deeply with the Ministry of Education as it envisages to provide equal opportunities to all 
<br/>children  and  a  conducive  learning  and  teaching  environment  whereby  are  they  exposed  to 
<br/>opportunities to express themselves confidently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I proceed, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude to the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development  and  Statistics  and  his  esteemed  team  for  their  tireless  efforts  in  compiling  this 
<br/>comprehensive budget.  Their dedication and meticulous planning have ensured that the needs of our 
<br/>education sector are adequately addressed in the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  concur  with  the  honourable  Minister  of  Education  in  extending  the 
<br/>gratitude  of  the  $845  million  set  aside  in  the  2023-2024  Budget  for  the  education  sector,  thus 
<br/>reaffirming the People’s Coalition Government’s commitment to prioritise education and invest in 
<br/>our future generation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, within this allocation, $505.4 million has been designated for the Ministry 
<br/>of Education. One of the key areas of focus for this Budget is ensuring that we have a strong and 
<br/>resilient  teaching  workforce.  To  achieve  this,  a  significant  portion  of  $322.6  million  has  been 
<br/>allocated towards salaries and wages to fund the employment of our existing 14,000 teachers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our continuous efforts to embrace digital transformation learning, there 
<br/></span><span>is an allocation of $50,000 for e-transaction costs.  The Ministry is taking the initiative to venture 
<br/></span><span>into digital money online transactions, and this fiscal  year, we have created provisions to  receive 
<br/>revenue  through  M-PAiSA.  The  Ministry  for  Education  is  also  strengthening  financial  literacy 
<br/>through curriculum review not as a component of the commercial subject but a subject of itself.  This 
<br/>will  empower  all  the  children  to  be  financially  literate,  encourage  entrepreneurship,  value 
<br/>transparency and its relevance to everyday life and future investment.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is also committed in reviewing the curriculum as 
<br/>literacy &amp; numeracy rate in Fiji is a grave concern.  Thus, Ministry of Education is supporting the 
<br/>ICT  capacity  with  library  software  licence  and  strengthening  the  reading  programme  for  the 
<br/>curriculum review with an allocation of $90,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education supports the provision for special education grant 
<br/>to students with disabilities who are enrolled in both special and mainstream schools. We continue 
<br/>to promote inclusive education and $141.9 is allocated to cater for these learning resources of the 
<br/>1,067 students in special schools as well as 336 students in the 122 mainstream inclusive schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government  firmly  believes  that  every  child  deserves  to  be  given  equal 
<br/>opportunities  and  disability  is  not  to  be  used  as  an  excuse  to  deny  them  their  rights  to  equal 
<br/>educational opportunities.  For this reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, necessary funds to provide grants to our 
<br/>special  schools  is  also  included  in  the  Ministry’s  2023-2024  Budget.    By  prioritising  special  and 
<br/>inclusive education, we are not only fulfilling our moral obligation but also building a stronger and 
<br/>more equitable future for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker. Sir, the media has highlighted an increase in social ills in our communities such 
<br/>as crimes and graffiti, bullying in schools and brawls after organised school sporting competitions. 
<br/>Therefore, the need for chaplains in school is immense as they will provide pastoral care service, 
<br/>along with teachers and parents. They provide spiritual and emotional support and help students deal 
<br/>with a range of issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  committed  that  chaplains  or  the  religious 
<br/>teachers are given provisions of counselling training organised by the Training Unit of the Ministry 
<br/>in partnership with Substance Abuse and Advisory Council (SAAC).  The Ministry of Education has 
<br/>already started working in organising consultation with faith-based schools and management for the 
<br/>cost sharing provisions of the school chaplains under one of the six provisions in the Free Education 
<br/>Grant (FEG). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to recognise the significance of providing holistic support to 
<br/>our students and chaplains play a crucial role in supporting our young minds, providing guidance, 
<br/>counselling to nurture their emotional and spiritual well-being.  It is imperative that we continue to 
<br/>emphasize the value of developing a well-rounded individual, and chaplaincy contributes to this goal 
<br/>for the future of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  turn  your  attention  to  the  reinstatement  of  the  Board  of  Governors  in  government 
<br/>schools. During the Opposition’s tenure, the decision to abolish these boards might have been taken 
<br/>with the intention to centralize decision-making processes.  However, after a careful evaluation of 
<br/>the impact and feedback from various stakeholders, it has become evident that inclusive governance 
<br/>structures contribute to the overall success and efficiency of our education system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reintroduction of Board of Governors in government schools ensures that decisions are 
<br/>made collaboratively, taking into consideration the diverse perspectives of the parents, educators and 
<br/>community members in Fiji.  This approach guarantees a more transparent, accountable and inclusive 
<br/></span><span>system where all stakeholders have a voice in shaping the future of all our schools in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the Opposition may have doubts about the implementation 
<br/>and costs associated with these initiatives, considering their long-standing experience in government.  
<br/>However, it is important to keep in mind that change is essential in any dynamic society.  We have 
<br/>carefully assessed the potential benefits and the challenges associated with these decisions and have 
<br/>developed comprehensive plans to ensure smooth implementation and cost-effectiveness. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1355 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education recognises the need for increased counselling 
<br/>support for our students.  The allocation of $581,931 for counselling support in the Substance Abuse 
<br/>Advisory Council will ensure that young vulnerable students who indulge in substance and volatile 
<br/>abuse because they cannot cope with the socio-economic or family problems receive the necessary 
<br/>guidance and support to reclaim their lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  significant  development  is  the  allocation  of  $50,000  for  the  development  of  a 
<br/>National Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) policy.  Sir, TVET is an essential 
<br/>component of our education system, and it is crucial that we have a comprehensive policy in place 
<br/>to  guide  and  enhance  the  quality  of  vocational  training  offered  in  our  country.    This  budgetary 
<br/>allocation will enable us to develop a policy that is responsive to the needs of the industry and prepare 
<br/>our students for the workforce of tomorrow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  commitment  to  the  future  of  vocational  education,  is  evident  in  the 
<br/>allocation of a total funding of $690,520 for 32 vocational centres.  This will cater for 1,032 students 
<br/>on  an  acquittal  basis  of  $610  per  student  per  year.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  investing  in  vocational 
<br/>education,  we  are  equipping  our  youth  with  necessary  skills  for  meaningful  employment  and 
<br/>contributing to the overall economic development of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a founding member country of the University of the South Pacific (USP), 
<br/>the government of Fiji not only agreed to be a member of the USP family, but we also agreed to help 
<br/>fund  it.    That  funding  commitment  is  determined  by  the  University  Grant  Committee  (UGC),  of 
<br/>which Fiji has significant input.  The UGC determines member countries contributions following a 
<br/>process of consultation of all member countries.  The last government signed up to this commitment 
<br/>but  did  not  honour this on rather dubious grounds or even worse, that one would weaponize that 
<br/>commitment  and  mask  personal  as  though  one  is  trying  to  attain  a  critical  strategic  goal  to  the 
<br/>detriment of thousands of USP students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government through the Ministry of Education is 
<br/>committed to fulfilling this commitment and the fiscal year of 2023-2024 budgetary allocation for 
<br/>the education sector indeed includes a provision for the outstanding grant of $20 million to USP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our nation is among the most vulnerable in terms of climate change, and as 
<br/>a responsible government, we believe in taking proactive measures to mitigate its impact.  Hence, a 
<br/>significant allocation in the education sector budget is the $2 million set aside for the establishment 
<br/>of the Pacific Action for Climate Transition Center in collaboration with Monash University and the 
<br/>Fiji National University (FNU).  This Center will serve as a knowledge hub, facilitating research, 
<br/>education and the development of effective strategies to combat climate change in partnership with 
<br/>esteemed institutions.  The People’s Coalition Government recognises the urgency of this matter and 
<br/>remains steadfast in our commitment to future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  $300,000  is  allocated  to  the  Fiji  National  University  whereby  the 
<br/>Coalition Government remains committed to providing livelihood training to our people who live in 
<br/>the rural maritime areas.  With this provision, I congratulate the 211 individuals who graduated in 
<br/>this two-week programme last week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  many  Fijians  eagerly  wait  for  the  new  financial  year’s  Budget 
<br/>announcement, hoping for some positive news that could bring a sense of relief and stability and I 
<br/>am certain that it did exactly that for the 53,725 students whose TELS debt got written off.  This 
<br/>decision reflects our Government’s commitment to providing equal opportunities for all and easing 
<br/>the financial burden on our future professionals.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going forward, the reinstatement of the bond system whereby students will serve a designated 
<br/>period upon completion of their studies will ensure that our students contribute to the growth and 
<br/>development of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to this provision of scholarships with an allocation of $148.2 
<br/>million under the Fijian Scholarship Scheme to both new and existing students, ensuring that they 
<br/>can pursue their educational dreams without financial barriers.  One of the initiatives of the People’s 
<br/>Coalition Government is the provision of three PhdDs and five Masters by research awards for study 
<br/>in New Zealand universities.  In line with our commitment to rebuilding our future, these prestigious 
<br/>awards will allow our students to further their studies and bring back valuable knowledge and skills 
<br/>to contribute to the development of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Scouts Association plays a vital role in providing scouting activities 
<br/>and training to our individuals aged 8 years to 26 years old.  With a current registration of 10,000 
<br/>scouts and over 1,000 trained leaders including retirees who are teachers themselves, the Fiji Scouts 
<br/>Association is undoubtedly one of the largest youth organisations in our country today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The allocation of $98,000 towards the School Scouts Programme is a commendable move 
<br/>that will greatly enhance the capabilities and resources available to this organisation.  These funds 
<br/>will enable the Fiji Scouts Association to further their mission of fostering character development, 
<br/>leaderships skills and community service amongst our students and youth of Fiji today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Girl Guides Association has proven to be an invaluable 
<br/>partner in promoting leadership, character development and community service among our young 
<br/>girls.  The Budgetary allocation of $50,000 for the Fiji Girl Guide Association in the new financial 
<br/>year 2023-2024 affirm our commitment to their noble cause and recognise their contribution to our 
<br/>society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these provisions and initiatives signify the People’s Coalition Government’s 
<br/>unwavering  dedication  to  creating  a  conducive  environment  for  quality  education  and  lifelong 
<br/>learning.    We  are  committed  to  working  alongside  all  stakeholders  including  the  Opposition  to 
<br/>address any concern and build a stronger and more inclusive education system.  It is only through 
<br/>collaboration and open dialogue that we can truly aspire to create brighter future for our children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, it is worth noting that as we embark on this new fiscal 
<br/>year, we must do so with optimism and determination.  Let us remember that rebuilding our future 
<br/>together requires a collective effort from all sectors of life.  I implore all honourable Members in this 
<br/>august Parliament as well as all relevant stakeholders and education partners to not only support the 
<br/>National  Budget,  but  also  actively  participate  in  its  implementation.    Together  we  can  create  an 
<br/>equitable, inclusive and prosperous educational ecosystem that will shape the destiny of our beloved 
<br/>nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, I fully agree with the 2023-2024 National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for afternoon tea and when we resume, 
<br/>we will go straight to the next speaker, the honourable Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime 
<br/>Development and Disaster Management, who will then take the floor.  The Parliament is adjourned.

<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1361 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 5.20 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; </span><span>dou sa bula sia</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise to add my contributions and lend my full support to the 2023-2024 
<br/>National Budget.  But before doing so, Sir, let me reflect on some of the pertinent issues revolving 
<br/>around the Budget Debate during the week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the honourable Prime Minister was asked on Monday morning during 
<br/>our Caucus meeting before we came into this Chamber for the debate as to what he expects of us to 
<br/>say during the debate, as usual, he was cool and calm, and his response to us was; “Be yourself, do 
<br/>not try to be like others.  Do not emulate others, speak the truth and speak with conviction.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  interpretation  on  his  piece  of  advice,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that,  if  you  are  reading 
<br/>something written by others or someone else’s idea, be careful to fully understand it before you say 
<br/>it, otherwise you will get into trouble.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what saddens me is the continuous referral from some honourable Members 
<br/>of the Opposition that their leader is someone else and not the honourable Seruiratu.  We all know 
<br/>that honourable Seruiratu was sworn in as the Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber.  Not to 
<br/>recognise  him  is  an  insult  and  that  is  why  some  honourable  Members  from  the  other  side  of 
<br/>Parliament are being misguided since they are taking instructions from someone else and not the right 
<br/>leader that they should be taking instructions from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  let  me  begin  my  response  to  the  Budget  Address.  I  wish  to  offer  my 
<br/>commendations to the honourable Minister of Finance and his Team for a bold, comprehensive and 
<br/>visionary Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even while still recovering from the unprecedented economic blows of the 
<br/>COVID-19 to our nation’s economy, the Coalition Government has shown through the 2023-2024 
<br/>National Budget our ability to provide steadfast direction and sound consultative leadership.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  as  stated  by  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  in  his  National  Budget 
<br/>Address, the Coalition Government, “although six-month-old with a mandate to deliver change has 
<br/>walked into a deeply grim state of affairs”, it recognises the need for a carefully thought-out budget 
<br/>to address the present and setting a platform and pathway for shaping a better future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  has  carefully  crafted  the  2023-2024  National 
<br/>Budget  by  prioritising  productive  sectors  that  would  drive  our  economic  recovery  and  adopting 
<br/>policies and revenue measures that would bring about the change that the Fijian people had been 
<br/>longing for in the last 16 years. It empowers Fijians to fight back in the spirit of “Rebuilding our 
<br/>Future Together</span><span>”</span><span>.  Of course, we will feel the pinch of pain in the short term but a sacrifice for our 
<br/>future gains. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me provide a response to the honourable Leader of the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition and those on the other side of Parliament, by claiming that the 2023-2024 Budget is a 
<br/>Microwave Budget. Literature has confirmed that one of the properties of microwaves is that it travels 
<br/>in a straight line. This basically means that policy waves surrounding the formulation of this Budget 
<br/>is  built  on  good  governance  -  a  straight  line  where  participation,  rule  of  law,  transparency, 
<br/>responsiveness, consensus-oriented, accountability and inclusiveness are the building blocks leading 
<br/>to the formation of this Budget; and very straight where interests of the “same kind” is not a priority 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but the needs of the majority are central to the formulation of this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Bulitavu  claimed  that  this  Budget  is  a  painful  Budget.  The 
<br/>honourable Member simply refuses to understand that the decision to increase VAT from 9 percent 
<br/>to 15 percent is because of the mess left by the previous Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- More than $500 million worth of revenue was lost through selfish and 
<br/>arrogant policies, like the Film Tax Rebate,  </span><span>Walesi,</span><span> no strategic plan for FRA over the years and 
<br/>losses on Capital Gains Tax. If the previous Government had formulated good policies, we would 
<br/>have the fiscal space to operate on the same VAT rate but, unfortunately, that is not the case. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Hem  Chand,  in  his  Budget  speech,  claimed  that  this  was  a  hopeless  Budget. 
<br/>Hopeless to him because he has lots of investments to rely on but for those who are merely struggling 
<br/>and are social welfare recipients or pensioners, this is a hopeful Budget for them. They are receiving 
<br/>an increase in allowance in the new budget. Ordinary Fijians will also be able to afford beef, prawns, 
<br/>duck and lamb/sheep products due to reduction in fiscal duty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  talk  about  the  core  functions  of  my  Ministry,  and  that  is  rural 
<br/>development.    The  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  is 
<br/>grateful  for  its  budgetary  allocation  of  $29.1  million.  The  increase  in  our  annual  allocation  of 
<br/>$14.1million  portrays  the  Coalition  Government’s  priority  in  capitalising  the  development  of  our 
<br/>rural and maritime communities and effective of the National Disaster Management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir</span><span>,</span><span> the Coalition Government remains committed to improving lives and raising 
<br/>the living standards of our people in the rural Fiji.  The Ministry intends to utilise the $2 million 
<br/>funding  received  under  its  Community  Access  Roads,  Footpaths  and  Footbridges  </span><span>(</span><span>CARFF</span><span>)</span><span>
<br/>Programme to deliver more rural infrastructure projects to increase transportation access to markets 
<br/>and improve accessibility to markets and basic services of Government for our rural Fijians.  In the 
<br/>last three years, the  Government  has invested  about  $5.6 million  for over 230 community access 
<br/>projects throughout the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>Sir, through the $1 million allocation to the Ministry’s Self-Help Programme 
<br/>(SHP),  communities  will  be  encouraged  to  initiate  their  socio-economic  sustainable  development 
<br/>projects on a cost-sharing basis. While this will instill a sense of ownership over these initiatives, this 
<br/>arrangement  has  also  eased  burdens,  especially  on  those  living  in  our  rural  and  maritime 
<br/>communities, who come forward to access Government assistance offered under this Programme.  In 
<br/>the  last  three  years,  the  Government  has  invested  about  $3.4  million  for  over  280  multi-sectoral 
<br/>projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, about 10.4 percent of the rural population rely on high risk water source. 
<br/>This is equivalent to 8,611 households. Additionally, about 30.5 percent of rural households use high 
<br/>risk sanitation in Fiji. This is equivalent to 25,387 households or 102,996 people in a household of 
<br/>four people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is pleased that with an allocation of another $0.8 million in the next financial 
<br/>year for its High Risk Water Sanitation Programme, we will be able to assist these at-risk vulnerable 
<br/>communities and rural dwellers with the provision of proper sanitation facilities and procurement of 
<br/>purification water systems to treat high risk water sources for quality water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On reviving our rural economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, invigorating the standard of living of our

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1363 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rural populace remains a key commitment of the Coalition Government. Intensifying the economic 
<br/>opportunities  and  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  these  resource-rich  communities  is  the 
<br/>pathway to a vibrant rural economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for far too long, our rural economy has been neglected. There is a lot of 
<br/>growth potentials in rural Fiji, especially on Vanua Levu – our second largest island. Your People’s 
<br/>Coalition Government is devoted to harness these potentials through creating the right environment 
<br/>and  secure  financing.  I  am  glad  that  we  have  left  no  stones  unturned  for  the  past  six  months  to 
<br/>progress work in this area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, tourism industry development in Vanua Levu is long overdue. We need to 
<br/>develop the infrastructure first, like airports, roads and other key infrastructure to boost our tourism 
<br/>market in the North. There is also a great need to develop the infrastructure of villages that are located 
<br/>close  to  the  main  towns  of  Savusavu  and  Labasa.    I  am  glad  that  the  Coalition  Government  is 
<br/>progressing work in this area with a provision of $5 million funding provided by the World Bank to 
<br/>support  the  Vanua  Levu  Tourism  Development  Programme  which  aims  to  support  resilient  and 
<br/>sustainable tourism development in Vanua Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry is still a key development sector for Vanua Levu.  The 
<br/>intention  to  thoroughly  review  and  assess  the  industry  is  long  overdue.    We  know  that  this  is  an 
<br/>industry that was a backbone of this country many decades ago.  A number of urban areas – Lautoka, 
<br/>Ba and Labasa, still rely on this industry.  I am confident that with the allocation of $49.7 million to 
<br/>the Sugar Unit in the 2023-2024 financial year, it will enable us to re-strategise and revive this vital 
<br/>industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need collective efforts at all levels to revive our rural economy.  In the 
<br/>upcoming financial year, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster 
<br/>Management will be working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/>and  Forestry  in  complementing  each  other’s  programmes,  to  ensure  our  rural  people  receive  the 
<br/>much-needed support they rightfully deserve to enable them to contribute positively to the revival 
<br/>and boosting of our rural economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Rural  and  Outer  Island  Development  Programme  is  aimed  at 
<br/>complementing  activities  of  other  agencies  in  the  agriculture,  fisheries  and  forests,  and 
<br/>communication sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the commitment to address long overdue drainage issues across the country 
<br/>under  the  budgetary  allocation  of  $22.1  million  in  the  Department  of  Waterways  is  appreciated.  
<br/>Furthermore, the budgetary allocation of $16.1 million for coastal erosion protection, river dredging, 
<br/>watershed management and rice irrigation scheme is also commended.  These will definitely address 
<br/>disaster risk reduction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also commend the recognition of this Government of the contribution by 
<br/>the Dairy Industry through their budgetary allocation of $5 million for the new financial year.  It is 
<br/>time that the local dairy industry receives the attention it deserves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plan to construct a new market for Savusavu with a budgetary allocation 
<br/>of  $3.9  million  and  preparatory  works  for  Dreketi  mini  market  is  commendable.    One  of  the 
<br/>objectives  of  the  rural  and  outer  island  development  is  to  facilitate  easy  access  to  markets.    The 
<br/>establishment of such facilities will create an enabling environment to enhance economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, without question, our Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>classed as strengths in building local economies and bringing innovation that impacts communities. 
<br/>The allocation of $2.5 million for the Northern Development Programme (NDP) aims to re-ignite 
<br/>grassroots entrepreneurship and strengthen resilience through skills training, business management 
<br/>and economic guidance - all the while contributing to national economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, inclusive governance remains an epitome of the Coalition Government, as 
<br/>we endeavour to effectively serve and empower our people.  Rebuilding the economy will need the 
<br/>collective effort of all stakeholders, including our communities. It is through effective collaboration 
<br/>and dialogue that we can give voice to the ordinary people and incorporate their needs into funding 
<br/>interventions and policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  this,  the  increase  in  allowances  for  our  community  leaders  is 
<br/>commendable.  The allocation of $767,040 for our 302 District Advisory Councillors (DAC) will 
<br/>support  and  strengthen  the  link  between  Government  and  people  at  the  grassroots  level,  as  DAC 
<br/>members play a pivotal role in being the coordinating arm of Government in the various communities 
<br/>they serve in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In strengthening the iTaukei governance structure in our villages and districts, the allocation 
<br/>of  a  sum  of  $2.1  million  for  the  increase  in  monthly  allowance  for  our  Turaga-ni-Koro  and  an 
<br/>additional $585,800 for increase in allowances for the Mata-ni-Tikina is very much welcomed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of iTaukei empowerment and development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, already alluded to by 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  I  must  commend  the  concerted  effort  from  our 
<br/>Government  to  chart  a  pathway  in  empowering  our  </span><span>i  Taukei  </span><span>communities.  The  historical  re-
<br/>instatement  of  the  Bose Levu  Vakaturaga  (Great  Council  of Chiefs)  this year  has  been  restoring, 
<br/>rejuvenating  the  spirits  of  the  indigenous  people  in  the  hopes  of  improving  their  socio-economic 
<br/>status. The $2 million allocation for the Village Improvement Scheme and $4 million for the iTaukei 
<br/>Land Development Scheme are just a few of the timely interventions that will enable our resource 
<br/>owners to capitalise on empowering their economic capabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that the 2023-2024 Budget is reflective 
<br/>of a strong commitment by the Coalition Government to focus on macroeconomic stabilisation and 
<br/>implement  fiscal  policies  that  achieve  a  sustained  economic  growth,  stimulate  investment  and 
<br/>keeping Government debt at sustainable levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the best Budget ever.  This is the Budget for now and the foundation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the future, a Budget for a new Fiji and this is the blueprint for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  concur  and  fully  support  the  motion  that  the  2023-2024  Budget  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>endorsed by this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet colleagues, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>fellow Members of the Legislature, and the people of Fiji who are watching on live stream as well as 
<br/>those who are here with us in the public gallery; I rise to present my contribution to the Appropriation 
<br/></span><span>Bill before this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I would like to congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
<br/>Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for delivering a coordinated, 
<br/>well-planned  and  inclusive  2023-2024  Budget  to  support  economic  recovery  in  contributing  to 
<br/>“Rebuilding Our Future Together”. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1365 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to acknowledge the honourable Deputy Prime Minister’s 
<br/>Team at the Ministry for Finance for a careful, transparent, very consultative and effective approach 
<br/>in managing the public purse since the Coalition Government took over on 24</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022.  
<br/>The Budget now before Parliament is more realistic, prudent and deserving of all of our support in 
<br/>re-building  our  island  home  Fiji  together  on  the  foundation  of  bipartisanship  and  mutual 
<br/>collaboration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the outset of this Budget Debate, I wish to acknowledge the support as well as the guidance 
<br/>of all those who have made it possible for me to continue and discharge my responsibilities as the 
<br/>Minister  responsible  for  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  for  the  past  six  months  -  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Directors, Managers and all staff who have put together our request to 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance and my Parliament Team who,  I am sure, are glued on to the screen.  Thank 
<br/>you for a job well done!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will be the first of many budgets that will be presented to Parliament 
<br/>by the Coalition Government and I say of many Budgets in future.  There will be many to follow in 
<br/>years to come.  In other words, the People’s Coalition Government is here to stay for a long time.  
<br/>We are here to stay for a number of reasons: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>We are here to correct historical woeful economic policies that we have inherited from the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government for the past eight years, and eight years before that, in its military 
<br/>interim government form.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>We are here to correct short-sighted and ineffective fiscal and monetary policies that has 
<br/>led the country to a humongous national debt level that now needs to be paid.  We are 
<br/>paying off $1 billion of FijiFirst Government debt, even in our first year in office.  The 
<br/>Opposition appears to have very short memories, alleging that we would be responsible for 
<br/>raising that debt level beyond $10 billion.  What they do not appear to accept is that they 
<br/>were responsible for the increase of the national debt from around $2.8 billion in 2006 to 
<br/>approximately more than $9 billion in 2022.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  the  height  of  blankness,  to  all  of  a  sudden  allege  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government of high deficit in its first ever Budget of over $600 million, when they have 
<br/>lived  on  high  borrowing  and  high  deficits  in  all  these  years  between  2007  and  2022.  
<br/>Someone said on social media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Who is that someone?
