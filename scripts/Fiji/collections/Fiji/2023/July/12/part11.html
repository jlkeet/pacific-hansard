<h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3>
<div><span>SPEAKER’S RULING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order - Honourable S.T. Koroilavesau 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I will now go on a ruling, especially on the Point of Order that was 
<br/>raised by honourable Semi Koroilavesau in yesterday’s sitting.  I will now address Parliament on the 
<br/>Point of Order raised yesterday under Standing Order 60 by honourable Koroilavesau and I remind 
<br/>honourable  Members  that  whilst  the  </span><span>Daily  Hansard  </span><span>has  not  been  circulated,  I  have  obtained  the 
<br/>relevant excerpts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Koroilavesau stated, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It  has  been  the  protocol  in  Parliament  and  has  become  a  tradition  that  when  a 
<br/>Member presents his maiden speech or makes a contribution to the Budget, normally there 
<br/>is no Point of Order when the Member is on the floor.  This allows the fluency and for 
<br/>the  Member  to  stay  within  the  timeframe  of  20  minutes.    Normally,  if  there  are  any 
<br/>questions, it is directed towards the mover of the motion who will answer all their queries 
<br/>and, in this case, the honourable Minister of Finance.  I just wanted a clarification from 
<br/>you Sir, if this has moved away from the normal protocol and tradition of Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  Standing  Order  60  which  is  on  Speech  Must  be  Relevant  provides 
<br/>guidance  to  honourable  Members  when  speaking  during  a  debate  or  in  cases  where  amendment 
<br/>motions are moved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Point of Order raised by the honourable Koroilavesau can be considered to be on the 
<br/>issue of interjections, heckling and banging of the table by other Members whilst a Member is on the 
<br/>floor delivering his or her speech as opposed to the normal protocol and tradition of Parliament when 
<br/>accorded  to  a  Member  who  is  delivering  his  or  her  maiden  speech.    That  is  the  first  speech  the 
<br/>honourable Member has just made in this august House. There is usually clapping that follows that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to reiterate some of the accepted protocols and traditions accorded in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>During the opening of Parliament when His Excellency addresses Parliament, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members are expected to maintain courtesy, decorum, and not interrupt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>During the delivery of the National Budget Address, Members are expected to maintain 
<br/>courtesy, decorum,  and not interrupt nor interject  the Minister of  Finance.  Honourable 
<br/>Members, the same is also upheld when the Shadow Minister of Finance delivers his or her 
<br/></span><span>response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>During the delivery of maiden speeches, Members are expected to maintain courtesy and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decorum, and not interrupt or interject.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>During the second reading of the Appropriation Bill as well as all other debates, Members 
<br/>are not precluded from engaging in free flow of Parliamentary banter with the exception of 
<br/>completing or drowning out the Member who is on the floor.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review of the Standing Orders – Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, let me reiterate here the clapping that goes on. I have just stated earlier that, that is 
<br/>only  shown  after  an  honourable  Member  has  delivered  his  or  her  maiden  speech.  The  clapping 
<br/>continues from both sides of Parliament.  Yesterday, I saw that the Leader of the Government in 
<br/>Parliament was leading the clapping here.  I am sorry to be saying this, but I hope we will all take 
<br/>care in observing the respect and decorum of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that respect, having reviewed Standing Order 60 and the relevant excerpts of the  </span><span>Daily 
<br/>Hansard</span><span>  for  yesterday’s  sitting,  I  hereby  rule  that  the  Point  of  Order  raised  by  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau is out of order. 
<br/></span></div>
