<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2023-2024 APPROPRIATION BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  Parliament  will  now  resolve  into  Committee  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Supply to resume debate on the Heads in the Budget Estimates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Committee: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 21 – Ministry of Education 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman,  thank you for giving me the time. I just have a number 
<br/>of questions.  I noticed that in the Ministry for Education since the new Government has come in, 
<br/>there has been an infusion of advisers and other people they have been there.  I am not too sure how 
<br/>this is being funded, former politicians and so forth that are sitting in that office which we never had 
<br/>that before; whole host of people.  I think there may be two, three and four. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I just want to understand how that is being funded, maybe from the old budget, the current 
<br/>budget  and  also  from  this  particular  Budget  whether  it  is  covered  under  SEG1  on  personal 
<br/>emoluments or whether it is covered somewhere because this is a totally need development that I will 
<br/>never see before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.- It is up to you, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Sorry, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is up to you whether you want to answer that question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- It is all part of SEG 1 - Personal Emoluments,  and part of their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contractual consultant engagement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman I have a motion to move.  My motion is …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have not received it, Madam, only honourable Ravunawa’s.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have two motions here.  The first one is by honourable Premila Kumar.  She is moving 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that $250,000 be left out of Head 21.  Would you introduce your motion now, Madam? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I move that:
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1443 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$250,000 be removed from Programme 1-1(7) - National Education Summit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  we  understand  that  there  are  a  number  of  activities 
<br/>being undertaken at the Ministry and the most important one at the moment is developing a 10-year 
<br/>Education  Sector  Plan  which  is  funded  by  Global  Partnership  in  Education.    Having  a  National 
<br/>Education Summit as well as the various processes involved in global partnership education funded 
<br/>consultation will lead to the same result. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other words, if you are going to have a National Education Summit, it will tell us exactly 
<br/>where we are; where the strengths, where the weaknesses and what we need to do.  Similarly, when 
<br/>we are going to develop the 10-year Education Sector Plan, it will involve the same process.  We 
<br/>need to know the strengths, weaknesses and how we are going to develop each area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we talk about the education sector, it is in totality.  Everything to do with the education 
<br/></span><span>per se.  </span><span>Rather than using $250,000 just for the Education Summit, you can also use $250,000 from 
<br/>Global Partnership for Education (GPE) to hold the Summit.  My suggestion is, that can be taken off, 
<br/>you can still have your Education Summit rather than using this money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(1) - Teacher In-Service Training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Hem  Chand,  could  we  complete  this  motion  that  is  here 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before me, then we go to your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Sorry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- It is on Head 22, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, Head 22.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- We are on Head 21 at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you and I apologise for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(1) - Teacher In-Service Training.  My 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister, are Early Childhood Education Teachers and Special Education 
<br/>Teachers covered in that $50,000?  If yes, what is the allocation for ECE and Special Education? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- It is the In-Service Training.  Mr. Chairman, the allocation is to 
<br/></span><span>carry for 50 percent salary while on study leave and the current budget allocation will cater for one 
<br/>officer who is currently on study leave with partial pay.  Those teachers who are on the verge of 
<br/>completing  their  programmes  of  study  and  in  the  priority  area  of  study  in  the  Ministry  will  be 
<br/>considered for study leave with pay for one semester.    So those teachers with four or less units will 
<br/>be given due consideration.  Priority for maritime areas are Maths, Physics, Industrial Arts, Early 
<br/>Childhood Education (ECE), Primary Education and Special and Inclusive Education (SIE).

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, this is just a clarification I am seeking from Programme 
<br/>1-1(5) - E-Transaction Cost.  Can the honourable Minister give us an update on the progress for this 
<br/>particular activity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, this is the same provision for last year and the 
<br/>actual  expenditure  was  only  $399  so  that  is  the  progress  that  transpired.    Out  of  the  $50,000 
<br/>allocation, only $399 was used.  For this particular E-Transaction Cost for $50,000, the progress so 
<br/>far, only $399 was used from the $50,000 that was budgeted for, actuals to-date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  created  a  provision  to  receive  revenue  through  M-PAiSA  rather  than 
<br/>collecting cash over the  counter, so provisions are also  available  and has  been used to  pay  exam 
<br/>supervisor allowances through M-PAiSA.  This Government initiative to venture into digital money 
<br/>online transaction will give options to customers to make payments for Government Services from 
<br/>the  comfort  of  their  homes  and  schools.    The  customers  will  be  able  to  save  time  and  travelling 
<br/>expenses to visit nearest offices to make payments.  Students can use these services to pay fees for 
<br/>exam remarking and exam recounting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just a further clarification, precisely Minister what you have said is 
<br/>the purpose of that money that was given last year.  My question is whether M-PAiSA services have 
<br/>been put in place in different divisions so that students in rural and outer islands can use that service?  
<br/>Normally they used to go to the physical offices to do the payments, so how have you worked that 
<br/>one out? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- First of all, we are trying to get the connectivity for all the rural 
<br/>and maritime areas in place in order to allow the  M-PAiSA facility to be accessed from the respective 
<br/>divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you honourable Minister, through you Mr. Chairman, I hope 
<br/>you know that 96 percent of our schools are already connected.  So you have to work on the 4 percent 
<br/>for  connectivity,  but  the  whole  idea  for  having  this  e-transaction  cost  shown  in  the  Budget  is  to 
<br/>improve the services for our students who had to wait for a very long time to get feedback from the 
<br/>Ministry whenever they wanted to get their marks checked.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you very much, honourable Member.  We also note that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>more than 90 percent too is intermittent connectivity.  It is not full-time connectivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  note  that  under  SEG  6,  you  have  a  number  of 
<br/>operating grants and transfers to various organisations.  I am interested in the one in relation to the 
<br/>Fiji Higher Education Commission.  I realised that this is a grant, but the grant will be used in various 
<br/>different places.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the interest currently in TVET and the importance of using TVET, I just like to know 
<br/>whether  under  this  grant  are  things  in  relation  to  the  National  Qualifications  Framework  and  the 
<br/></span><span>development of a stronger competency-based training qualification that all TVET providers can use 
<br/></span><span>across the country? Would that be something that is included as part of this grant? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- As part of the operations cost for the operation of Fiji Higher 
<br/>Education  Commission,  it  is  currently  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>development of a TVET policy first and we also look into the qualification framework.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1445 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-3(6).    I  need  clarification  on  Grant  to 
<br/>Special Schools. Does this grant also include inclusive schools?  If yes, how many inclusive schools 
<br/>are covered? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- You can answer your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- No, I do not because this figure keeps changing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  There  is  an  additional  funding,  Mr.  Chairman,  of  Grants  to 
<br/>Special Schools.  Last year’s allocation was $730,000, so we actually utilised $455,000 - 62 percent 
<br/>utilisation and this year is $1 million, an increase of $311,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- My question is, does this grant also include inclusive schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  I  am  trying  to  answer  the  question  which  I  will  end  up  with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>saying yes to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Thank you. How many inclusive schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- The allocation is to cater grant payment to 17 Special Schools 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with 125 students, 87 Special Inclusive Schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Thank you, I got the answer of 87. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- So why ask? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND. – Thank you, honourable Minister, you gave the answer which is 87. The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Prof. Prasad said 344. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will not go into that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- No, that is not the total, honourable Prof. Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Chand, we will not go into that kind of questioning where 
<br/>you have the answer and you are trying to do something that has been proven.  We will end it there 
<br/>because we need to cover other areas as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, on the Grant to Special Schools, honourable Minister.  
<br/>There are lot of children who are born out of autism which is a spectrum and we see a lot now.  I 
<br/>think the trends is getting higher with kids  who are born of autism.  They need special attention, 
<br/>speech therapy and they speak much later.  When I read into it, it just says that their brains are just 
<br/>wired differently from us who think that we are normal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In these Special Schools, do we have those specialists who deal with autism where parents 
<br/>can take their kids there?  I also read that, the earlier it is detected, the better. Are they included in 
<br/></span><span>these Special Schools? If not,  I plead that it is an area that we need to  be looking into and get  it 
<br/></span><span>funded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.-  Thank you, honourable Member.  That  is  an area that we are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trying to beef up in terms of having our schoolteachers to specialise in that field. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Thank you.

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, before I ask the honourable Minister, I would like to thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you for your understanding of my matter. Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, through you, just going back to the Grant to Special Schools.  The Ba Special 
<br/>School was destroyed through fire and what I have been hearing from the last two days that now the 
<br/>respective ministries have got their own capital allocation.  Is the funding in this allocation for the 
<br/>construction of the new Ba Special School? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- I have to get back to you on the listing, Sir, but the ownership of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ba Special School is Sanatan? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I have a question on Programme 3-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No. Is it Programme 4-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I am on Programme 3-1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- We have finished. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Yes, we were there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I put my hand up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Madam is asking a question here, with respect to her as a lady, we will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allow that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Sir, but I had put my hand up.  My question is on Programme 3-1(6) - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remission of Fees.  If the honourable Minister can provide some details on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- This is a new allocation. Mr. Chairman, 5,361 boarders received 
<br/></span><span>half remission of $27 per year then we will need an additional of $126,945. Most of the rural schools 
<br/></span><span>will receive full remission since most of their parents do not have fixed employment. The total budget 
<br/>request is to cater for the variance in boarders roll: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>0 to 2,500 - full remission of $50; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>2,501 to 6,500 - half remission of $27; and  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>6,500 and above - do not qualify for this remission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new proposal using the Term 3 in 2022 audited boarder’s roll, an additional funding to 
<br/></span><span>remain at $126,000 to cater for the alteration and the eligibilities.  On social welfare recipients and 
<br/></span><span>students whose parents died while serving in peacekeeping will be receiving full fees charged but 
<br/>schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  can  move  on  to  Programme  3-2(5)  -  Boarding 
<br/></span><span>School Food and Supplies of $2.8 million allocated for Government Secondary Schools. My question 
<br/></span><span>is, how many students will benefit from this grant and how are school farms contributing to the food 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1447 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supplies?  Now that the VAT has gone up and this amount has remained the same, how will this be 
<br/>managed?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRORO.- Mr. Chairman, this allocation is  the same as last  year, the $2.8 
<br/>million has not changed but the utilisation rate is only 99 percent.  The allocation this year is still the 
<br/>same.  This allocation is to cater for Government Boarding Schools to procure food and supplies for 
<br/>boarders with a total of nine Government Boarding Schools, a total of 2,899 boarding students roll 
<br/>was  noted  for  Term  1  in  2022  and  the    nine  Government  Boarding  Schools  with  an  average  of 
<br/>311,000.  Food ration grant is provided per year to cater for boarders’ food expenses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, just a supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are we still on the same SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, Madam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.-That will also be complemented by the school farms that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Honourable Minister, if you can tell us about the school farms.  I do 
<br/>understand that VAT has gone up, the food prices will go up because VAT will apply on chicken and 
<br/>other items which the children consume.  How are you going to manage this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Apart from the school farm, it is giving majority of the food to 
<br/>boarders in terms of cassava, </span><span>dalo</span><span>, </span><span>rourou</span><span>, milk, beef and fish.  They are purchased around the school 
<br/>areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  honourable  Minister  mentioned  about  Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>schools.  Just a small question, rebuilding of RKS Dormitory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- We have gone past that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Following  on  from  honourable  Premila  Kumar,  you  mentioned  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Just  answer.    It  is  something  good.    You  must  be  aware,  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister that the dormitory at RKS burnt down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Nath, you raise your question this way and I will direct it to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- No direct communication.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No direct communication from there straight across to him, please.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  My  apologies,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thought  you  signalled    to  go  ahead 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unfortunately.  May I, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Thank you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rebuilding of RKS dormitory.  As we are aware, the dormitory at RKS burnt down and I do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not see no reflection in the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- We will reach there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  in  relation  to  Programme  5-1(5),  I  see  there  are  a 
<br/>number of issues there that relate to TVET.  They have a sum for Technical Equipment - Secondary 
<br/>Schools of $300,000, Development of National Qualification Framework of $10,000.  I know that 
<br/>this  National  Qualification  Framework  was  brought  into  being  may  be  10  years  ago.      and  the 
<br/>Development  of  National  TVET  Policy.    So  given  that  there  is  a  sum  of  money  of  $300,000  for 
<br/>Technical Equipment, I take it that to mean that there are some secondary schools that are still doing 
<br/>TVET type programmes and not just woodwork, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  relates  back  to  the  question  that  I  had  earlier  on  in  relation  to  the  Higher  Education 
<br/>Commission,  Development  of  National  Qualification  Framework,  Technical  Equipment  and  the 
<br/>Development of National TVET Policy.  I would just like the honourable Minister to elaborate how 
<br/>well this is working together to assist the development of the trade and technical skills that we need?  
<br/>If I can just elaborate slightly, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the problems that we have is the disconnect between the kind of programmes that are 
<br/>held in different places - at the school level and different institutes so that there is no flow in the type 
<br/>of learning that they have so it becomes articulate into the same sort of qualification.  In other words, 
<br/>there is no portability of what people learn. I am just wondering whether this is being addressed in 
<br/>this way through competency-based frameworks and whether that is being addressed in all of these 
<br/>allocations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, there is an allocation there that will accommodate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what you have just stated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-1(8), my question is on Vatuwaqa 
<br/>Primary School, I live near the place.  This school was burnt on the eve of election day.  It is probably 
<br/>the first school that fell onto your lap when you became Government.  I see that you are dealing with 
<br/>the dormitory from RKS that just burnt recently, Vatuwaqa is still in ruins, are there plans to get 
<br/>Vatuwaqa also  in this upgrade? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Vatuwaqa is currently awaiting the fire report.  
<br/></span><span>Once we get the fire report then we will initiate the technical scoping which will be funding request 
<br/>to probably a donor or to the Ministry of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Six months later?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- We are still waiting for the report.

<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I do not normally try and stop the flow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- If I am going to ask a question, I have to declare my interest 
<br/>in that question.  Programme 6-1(10) - Building Grant – Non-Government Secondary Schools.  I can 
<br/>see  that  there  is  a  grant  to  Non-Government  Secondary  Schools.    Why  I  said  that  I  declared  my 
<br/>interest is, I am asking about Richmond Methodist High School in Kadavu.  I just recently returned 
<br/>from the school and a lot of school buildings (I attended it in 1972) children still continue to occupy 
<br/>those school buildings. I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister if that is being considered under 
<br/>this Head? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  there  is  a  lot  request  coming  to  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Education  from  various  schools.    Our  team  have  identified  the  schools  that  will  be 
<br/>upgraded  in  these  Non-Government  Secondary  Schools.    SEG  10,  $149,000  will  be  used  for  the 
<br/>construction  of  new  facilities  for  three  schools  -  Moce  Secondary  School  Science  Laboratory, 
<br/>Nakorotubu Secondary  -  1x2 classroom,  Vatukaloko to  cater construction of new 1x1 classroom.  
<br/>The remining $195,000 will cater for upgrading and maintenance of the existing facilities for seven 
<br/>secondary schools to improve the deteriorating structures - Nakauvadra High School Dining Hall, 
<br/>Yasayasa  Moala  College  School  Block  Renovation,  William  Cross  College  -  extension  to  new 
<br/>sewing room, St. Vincent College - walkway, Nadogo Central College - renovation of the dormitory, 
<br/>Rewa Secondary School - upgrading of school foyer and Saraswati College - upgrading of school 
<br/>fencing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  my  question  is  on  SEG  9  -  Purchase  of  Tractors 
<br/>($325,000).  Can the honourable Minister provide some details in relation to this particular item, and 
<br/>how these tractors will  be used by  who, which  school,  what  is  the programme surrounding  these 
<br/>purchase of tractors? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, this question is related to the earlier questions 
<br/>regarding  boarding  rations.    This  is  for  three  new  tractors  that  are  needed  for  three  Government 
<br/>Boarding Schools - RKS, ACS and QVS to be utilised on the school farms and boost farm production 
<br/>for hostel consumption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Just  a  supplementary  on  my  previous  question,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Chairman, please. I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister if this school can be considered on 
<br/></span><span>the building and also there is a huge soil erosion on the bridge side which is taking part of the school 
<br/>away and the school ground is about  halfway gone into the sea.  I am just asking the honourable 
<br/>Minister if that can be considered in the future? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- You have to fill the building request form.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- His answered your question, honourable Koroilavesau? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  to  answer  that,  as  well  as  honourable  Premila 
<br/>Kumar’s question on the National Education Summit and the private secondary schools (if we can 
<br/>call  them  that),  the  Methodist  Church  has  recently  made  an  announcement  that  it  intends  to  stop 
<br/>levying the members their </span><span>vakamisinare</span><span> and </span><span>soli ni cakacaka levu</span><span>. So, congregations in Kadavu can

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote.

<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 21 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 22 - Ministry of Health and Medical Services  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on    Head  22-1-1(4)  in  regards  to  Sanitary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Services.  You have the motion in front of you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is a motion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I second the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You may want to elaborate on your motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Sir,  we  can  all  recall  the  message  by  the  honourable  Pio 
<br/>Tikoduadua in this House about the male cloak room in the hospital facility. Now with the increase 
<br/>in women graduates, I think the sanitary service needs to be increased in  its allocation from $10,000 
<br/>to $50,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I second the motion. 
<br/>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, if you are with me on Head 22-1-1(7) – Health 
<br/>Seminars/Meetings a mere $10,000 for this financial year.  I believe it is not enough. This is a big 
<br/></span><span>Ministry and I propose that it be increased to $100,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 1-1(7) - Implementation 
<br/></span><span>of  National  Action  Plan  Gender  Based  Violence  Against  Women  and  Girl  with  $50,000  being 
<br/></span><span>allocated.  Can the honourable Minister tell us how this money will be used? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- The 2023-2027 National Action Plan for Gender Based 
<br/>Violence Against Women is the first two five-year plans intended to progress the decade of action 
<br/>led  by  the  Government  of  Fiji.  Funding  has  been  allocated  to  four  pilot  Ministries  -  Ministry  of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education, Ministry of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>Affairs, Minister of Youth and Sports and Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services as the Government’s commitment towards the implementation of the programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Supplementary question, Sir. First of all, I appreciate the fact that this 
<br/>money has been given to different ministries to address this particular issue, but you can tell us like 
<br/>if this money will go to the Ministry of Health. How are you going to use this money? I know you 
<br/>have a plan but what activities will be undertaken? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- That will be looked after by one of our Core Centres, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Family Health Division and their programmes that they will run on this allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Okay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now go on to the motion by honourable Ketan Lal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I move a motion on Head 32-1-1(8) – Refurbishment  of 
<br/>Savusavu Hospital.  Currently it is $250,000. I am requesting for an increase of another $200,000 
<br/>because in the previous FijiFirst budget, there was an allocation of $1.8 million for the refurbishment 
<br/>of the hospital. Unfortunately, as soon as the new Government came in, they relocated that fund to, 
<br/>I think Child Support or School Support.  Now they are allocated only $250,000. I understand the 
<br/>people  of  Savusavu  who  are  currently  watching,  the  business  operators  had  come  together  and 
<br/>contributed some amount of money to help the hospital refurbishment, but I think the Government 
<br/>needs to support more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You have completed all that you are supposed to do, honourable Ketan 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lal. Introducing and elaborating on your motion all one go, that is very great. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- So, now we will put that to the vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sir, if I can on behalf of the honourable Minister for Health 
<br/>add,  I  think  the  honourable  Member  is  kind  of  misleading  the  Parliament  in  making  all  those 
<br/>references where funds were moved from here and there. The Savusavu Hospital, Mr. Speaker, was 
<br/>in  one of the worst  conditions  that we saw.  In fact,  even in  2022 it was  so bad that the business 
<br/>community had to get into it.  I mean I am just responding to him because he is misleading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  of  Health  explained  in  his  Budget  response  very  clearly  that  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work that was done was already completed and we saw .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable K.K. Lal interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Let him finish.  Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The reason why I am answering  this, honourable Member, 
<br/></span><span>you do not understand this because the CIU was in your former Minister of Economy’s Office. All 
<br/></span><span>the maintenance was under the Ministry for Economy and that is why until the CIU was handling 
<br/>that.  So, the funds was taken away. Now the allocation is appropriate, it will be done like all the 
<br/>other health centres and subdivisional medical hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, we will put this to the vote.

<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman in relation to SEG 6 of that same Activity in relation to 
<br/>the Sai Prema Foundation Fiji.  I would just like a clarification from the honourable Minister.  I am 
<br/>aware that the agreement between Sai Prema Foundation and the Ministry of Health (if I am correct) 
<br/>was that the land would be provided.  The Ministry for Health would be providing some of the staff 
<br/>and that they would be meeting the operational cost.  If I am correct, this would be a new grant.  Is 
<br/>this now a change in the relationship between Sai Prema, Fiji Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  with  regards  to  the  Sai  Prema 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocation, yes this is a new grant, the allocation  brought about through their submission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So that would mean there is now a change in the original understanding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between the Government of Fiji and Sai Prema.  Is that all changed now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not all changed.  The relationship that was built previously, 
<br/>the understanding is still there.  Like any grant funding, there will be a grant agreement, there will be 
<br/>a proper process of how the funds will be utilised through appropriate accountability mechanisms. 
<br/>Because  of  the  shortage  of  health  personnel,  nurses  and  others,  we  did  not  want  to  make  the 
<br/>commitment that we will provide additional staff, et cetera. We are going to just provide the funding, 
<br/>they are doing a good job looking after the kids and that is what we want.  It is like giving grant to 
<br/>universities and other tertiary institutions.  That is the model that we have used. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, under SEG 10, I am just referring to the Direct 
<br/>Payment  - Fiji COVID-19 Emergency Response and Aid-In-Kind - Prevention and Control of NCDs.  
<br/>I would kindly ask the honourable Minister, through you Mr. Chairman, if he can just give us the 
<br/>details of these two allocations, please?  How is it going to be utilised and where? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Is  it  SEG  10;  Fiji  COVID-19  Emergency 
<br/>Response Project (World Bank).  It is adjusted to the estimates provided by the Climate Change and 
<br/>International Cooperation Unit, it is a direct payment.  On the Fiji COVID-19 Emergency Response 
<br/>Project is adjusted to the estimates again, it is donor support for infrastructure assessment at CWMH. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  a  matter  of  national  interest  given  the 
<br/></span><span>experience during COVID-19.  I  am not sure if anything is there in the Ministry, honourable Minister, 
<br/></span><span>about CDC because when CDC was compromised, it really put us in  a very difficult situation during 
<br/>the COVID-19 Response. That is very critical for us should we have the next pandemic.  That is why 
<br/>I was interested in this allocation, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Fiji CDC is now a Cost  Centre of its own.  They 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have their own allocation now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  a  very  small  clarification  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/></span><span>Finance with respect to that specific Sai Prema issue you raised.  It would be us giving them a grant, 
<br/></span><span>does that mean that we are not going to provide them with the staff completely or is it a partial thing?  
<br/>I think it is a very important institution for our children, phenomenal charitable institution.  We all 
<br/>understand that.  I am just wondering whether that funding that has been given (grant) is in full for 
<br/>them to source their staff whether it is here or offshore or whatever it is or are we still partially going 
<br/>to provide the staff?  That was the original agreement, I understand. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1453 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  think  the  honourable  Member  has  asked  a  very  good 
<br/>question.  You are right, what we have done is, we did not want to commit that we will provide staff, 
<br/>nurses and doctors.  That will be entirely left with the Ministry of Health working with Sai Prema; 
<br/>giving them all the support and if there is a necessity at a particular point in time, that will be another 
<br/>arrangement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  this  is  direct  funding  support  grant  to  the  institution  as  part  of  their  operational 
<br/>expenditure. It is just like we give funding to a university. The grant is given, the grant agreement is 
<br/>signed, the process of accountability of funds is included in that agreement.  We did not want to be 
<br/>involved in it directly.  They are doing a good job and it would be unnecessary for the Government 
<br/>to involve itself when we have to deal with so many other things in Government hospitals and other 
<br/>areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, again just a quick supplementary.  Honourable Minister, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I only asked because I know the scarcity…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Remember  the  words  you  are  using,  honourable  Member  –  small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is small, Sir, but it is a very important institution and maybe I might 
<br/>want to ask we give them some more because I know about the scarcity of our health staff.  If we are 
<br/>going to assist them in that particular way, the staff may actually come from overseas and it may cost 
<br/>us a hell of a lot more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As I said, we have just given them the money, we have left it 
<br/>to them to use it in the way that they want, as long as they are serving the purpose and achieving the 
<br/>objectives that we as a Government and the previous government supported. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you Mr. Chairman, it is for children so I am …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I noticed under Aid-In-Kind the continuation of the 
<br/>programme from JICA for the NCDs and also for the 5S-KAIZEN-TQM.  This programme has been 
<br/>going for some time and I am glad to see that they are still running. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just for the establishment to the 5S-KAIZEN.  Can you just explain for this $2 million, I do 
<br/>not know whether there are any deeds as to what exactly, because there has been a lot of complaints 
<br/></span><span>about doorknobs and things like that and KAIZEN and 5S would look at cleaning things up.  Just a 
<br/></span><span>slight elaboration on exactly what the two $2.586 million will cover for 5S? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Honourable Usamate, through you Mr. Chairman,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you wanted to know about the improvement of health service of the 5S-KAIZEN? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- It is another project by JICA.  It is a pilot project 
<br/></span><span>started off mostly in the North and it is now with some of our facilities.  It is to do with sorting and 
<br/></span><span>improving the facilities in terms of sorting.  The quality of health has improved with this in terms of 
<br/>the sorting of materials.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Now it started in the North, has it now moved into the Central Division 
<br/>in the large hospitals because this is about keeping a place clean, making sure that there is a place for 
<br/>everything and it is always in place. So, it is now in the Central Division too?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1(1),  I  noticed  the  reduction  in 
<br/>Doctor’s - Salary together with their FNPF from $81million to $76 million.  I seek clarification from 
<br/>the honourable Minister about the reduction in the salary allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for that question. The posts are still the same, in fact the reason for the reduction: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span> </span><span>Medical Intern to Medial Officer transition previously was from January to July.  Now it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>March to July so we have taken away two months from that; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2)</span><span> </span><span>Removal of substantive Medical Officer salaries due to acting appointments, secondments, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>study leave or leave without pay; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3)</span><span> </span><span>Some of the specialists are still attending their respective specialist qualifications, especially 
<br/>Radiology and Pathology so they are still in acting positions. I want to beef up our capacity 
<br/>in  terms  of  speciality  availability  and  when  they  do  get  their  qualifications,  they  are 
<br/>formalised into their roles as a Specialist Consultants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are three reasons but the posts are still the same.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  this  In-Service 
<br/>Training is mainly for midwifery and excludes all Medical Officers and Dental Officer as you know 
<br/></span><span>they have to go through TELS.

<br/>apply  for  assistance?  There  is  a  quite  number  of  NGOs  that  exist  and  associations  that  are  also 
<br/>supported by different bodies. Is there a list of NGOs that you have already? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, the list are currently utilising the 
<br/></span><span>funds for this financial year but for this one in the next financial year, they will have to go through 
<br/>the same process of EOI.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(5) - Emergency Radiology and 
<br/>Laboratory Services  of $4 million and under “R”. I believe this is for specialist tests that are sent 
<br/>overseas, but for the Radiology Department at CWMH, they now have a space for the software.  The

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>utilisation of the PAX software system is a vital tool for radiologists to display, capture, store images 
<br/>and share images in the fastest and reliable way.  I seek clarification from the honourable Minister, 
<br/>it is a reduction as well from the previous financial year and if the PAX system software for the  
<br/>X-ray Department at CWMH is also part of this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  the  Emergency 
<br/>Radiology  and  Laboratory  Services,  this  is  an  allocation  for  emergency  outsourcing  and  it  is 
<br/>increased from $3 million to $4 million this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  One  more  question,  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  may?    This  is  a  very 
<br/>pertinent question about the Laundry Service at CWMH. Again, the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>has allocated $1.3 million although they are dissatisfied with the previous arrangement.  Maybe if 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  can  clarify  and  also  inform  Parliament  if  there  is  any  plan  for  the  new 
<br/>Laundry Service Arrangement for CWMH. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  The  current  allocation  through  you,  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman, is for the outsourcing of laundry service in the Central Division only as we plan and scope 
<br/>for the new laundry in-service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- I am satisfied with that, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just one more question, I noticed that Community Health Workers’  allowance has moved 
<br/>from the Public Health Allocation to Policy and Administration - Programme 1, an allocation of $3 
<br/>million.  Just a clarification from the honourable Minister as to why they moved it to this Programme 
<br/>as it is purely a Public Health Programme. It is on SEG 7 – Community Health Workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Through you Mr. Chairman, the reason why it has 
<br/>being  brought back to Headquarters is to allow easier transition of payments.  Usually before when 
<br/>it is within the divisions, the approval has to come back through Headquarters. So, we have moved 
<br/>that to Headquarters to allow the easier transition of payment to our Health Care Workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- It is for administration purpose. I am happy with the explanation, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just in Public Health, I do realise that all the Public Health aspects of 
<br/>the Ministry are not totally covered by this Activity, that it is spread out in others. When I first saw 
<br/></span><span>the total, I was a bit worried because it had dropped by $3 million. I just want to be sure, maybe the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister can give some reassurance that Public Health which a preventative part of health 
<br/>has not diminished its importance or its prioritisation in the Ministry. I have got that feeling when I 
<br/>saw this allocation because I said, I realised things are spread out.  Can you just give some reassurance 
<br/>on that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-    Most  of  funds  for  this  programme  has  been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reallocated to others such as the new Cost Centre for CDC as well. It used to come under this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is still a key priority? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- It is very much a priority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, while still on Programme 2-1(5) - National Food 
<br/>and  Nutrition  Security  Programme  -  $200.000.    Probably  between  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Agriculture and the honourable Minister of Health, this is one of the commitments that we made way

<div><span>back  in  2016  to  FAO  Rome  on  the  Zero  Hunger  Policy,  and  Fiji  was  to  develop  and  Food  and 
<br/>Nutrition  Security  Policy.    It  has  been  formulated  already  but  where  in  the  system  is  this  being 
<br/>withheld, because that is the commitment we made to FAO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, the budgets have been increased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What was your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman through you, a policy has been developed already, 
<br/>but where is it?  Honourable Minister for Agriculture, maybe we can discuss it after this because that 
<br/>is a commitment we made to FAO and this is linked to our NCDs and the Food and Nutrition Security 
<br/>too from the Ministry of Agriculture.  I think the honourable Minister is well aware of this as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I am aware of the policy well and it is within our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wellness Unit at the moment.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  There  is  a  whole  Unit  there  within  the  Ministry  of  Health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dealing with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  That  does  not  stop  you,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discussing it with them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, I have a motion.  This is on Programme 2-1(5) 
<br/>on Non- Communicable Disease Prevention and Control.  The motion that I have put across is in that 
<br/>slip seeking for an increase on that particular allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You have introduced your motion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  The  motion  is  that  Head  22-2-1(5)  be  increased  by  $650,000  –  Non-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communicable Disease Prevention and Control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, NCDs, as we all know is our number one killer.  
<br/></span><span>There is 80 percent death every year coming from NCD-related diseases.  We even know that this is 
<br/>costing our economy around $400 million a year.  They are saying that the amputation rate is three 
<br/>in a day.    The idea that I am coming up with is just to assist the Ministry in getting more funds to 
<br/>help them in the awareness and education programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I saw on Programme 1-1 right at the end about the Aid- In-Kind given by JICA, but I thought 
<br/>it will be good because it is that bad.  At least we are seen that we are standing on our two feet, having 
<br/>funds that we provide ourselves and not depending on aid to fight this.   It is more than a pandemic.  
<br/></span><span>A figure here, I think in 2020 or 2022, about 2,000 deaths in our country on that.  Mr. Chairman, that 
<br/></span><span>is the reason I am putting this up and the motion is to increase the allocation so that the Ministry of 
<br/>Health  can  be  more  effective  job  in  curbing  these  NCDS  in  terms  of  awareness  and  education 
<br/>programme.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-1(5)  Rheumatic  Heart  Disease 
<br/>Prevention and Control Programme where $200,000 has been allocated.  In fact, we have just talked 
<br/>about Sai Prema just a while ago, and Sai Prema specialises in this particular area.  My proposal 
<br/>would be that this money be given to Sai Prema so that they can do a better job in raising awareness 
<br/>on Rheumatic Heart Disease and contribute more to the work that they do, unless, the honourable 
<br/>Minister can explain to us what exactly this money will be used for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, honourable Premila.  Mr. Chairman, 
<br/>Sai Prema deals mostly with corrective heart surgery from congenital heart defects.  This funding 
<br/>will  help  with  the  planned  activities  under  the  programmes.  It  is  to  do  with  the  training,  Acute 
<br/>Rheumatic  Fever  and  Rheumatic  Heart  Disease  quarterly  meetings,  community  engagement, 
<br/>supervisory and outreach, guidelines and printing of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart 
<br/>Disease.  So, even though Sai Prema and this allocation both deal with the heart, Sai Prema deals 
<br/>with the corrective heart surgery of congenital heart defects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, although overall there is a reduction in the public 
<br/>health allocation, but the heart of this public health service is with SEG 5 and SEG 7.  There is a 
<br/>marked increase in the allocation, and I thank the honourable Minister of Health and Medical Services 
<br/>and the honourable Minister of Finance for boosting some of these programmes, even doubled.  I 
<br/>hope  for  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  these  programmes  so  that  we  see  their  effect  and  the 
<br/>outcomes on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  again  on  Programme  2-1(5).    Seeking 
<br/>clarification from the honourable Minister on the Vaccine Rollout of about $100,000.  I know it is 
<br/>next to Rheumatic Heart Disease and Prevention and Control Programme.  Honourable Minister, is 
<br/>the Vaccine Roll Out to do with Rheumatic Heart Disease?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman, this allocation is  to  support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>maintenance and procurement of vaccine fridges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, once again on the Rheumatic Heart Disease Prevention 
<br/>and Control Programme.  I am a grandfather who has two of my grandkids who get their injection on 
<br/>a monthly basis, so I am just wondering, I am not too sure if there is an increase.   I know there is 
<br/>still a lot of need for awareness, especially around our settlements and villages.  I am not too sure 
<br/></span><span>whether that allocation has been increased, is it enough, is it having an impact on the incidents of 
<br/></span><span>rheumatic fever so it does not progress to rheumatic heart disease? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, it is an increase by $150,000 and 
<br/>the $200,000 is for this financial year.  Together with this, we work with other NGOs through MFAT 
<br/>to look after programmes based on rheumatic heart disease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, just a follow-up question from honourable Naisa 
<br/>Tuinaceva with regards to the Vaccine Roll Out.  I believe the purchase of vaccine is further ahead 
<br/></span><span>under FPBS of $4 million.  So, can the honourable Minister, explain what the rollout is about? Is this 
<br/></span><span>for the outreach whereby nurses go and give vaccines in rural areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Yes.

<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We are very thankful that we have a Recompression Chamber in CWM 
<br/>Hospital.  We are just wondering because they have a lot of diving incidents  and problems  in  the 
<br/>West. Is there any thought of doing something similar in the West?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.-  There is one available at Black Rock in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I have two motions from honourable Ravunawa with Activity 5 to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased by another $101,000 that is to do with Programme 2-5(5) - Crutches. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- With the increase in NCDs and the vast increase in amputation, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is a need for patient support with crutches. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- The allocation of $10,000 is not enough considering the rate of 
<br/>amputation and the palliative care for the patients that are being compromised with their movement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, it is to do with Programme 2-5(5) with Prosthesis 
<br/>Materials. This is to help artificial prosthesis for patients who have gone through surgical amputation 
<br/>at our hospital mainly due to NCD related cases, also some through the motor vehicle accidents and 
<br/>the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.-  I second the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- The prosthesis material and  support, we need a better allocation. 
<br/>Also, when I see SEG 5, I do not see wheelchairs.  Many of the wheelchairs that we have in the 
<br/>hospitals are donated. That is why crutches, wheelchairs and all those supportive devices to help in 
<br/>the mobility of patients who are compromised need a better allocation than this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Programme 2-7(7) - Outreach Programme.  This programme for 
<br/>the health protection mainly deals with Health Inspectors or Environmental Health Inspectors.  For 
<br/>an effective outreach programme, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That we look into the allocation for this SEG.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Like last night, I like the teamwork.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, the Outreach Programme for Health Inspectors 
<br/>have a vast scope to cover and it is to do with health promotion and awareness in communities also 
<br/>surveillance in times of any outbreak of disease. The allocation of $50,000, in my view, is merely 
<br/>not enough.

<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- This is on the Programme 2-7(5), similar to what was raised by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Ravunawa. This is on the Leptospirosis Control Programme together with the one on 
<br/>Dengue Prevention and Control Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You seeking clarification? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  seeking  clarification  from  the  honourable  Minister  on  this  amount  especially  on  the 
<br/>threat that we know how this can be deadly diseases - Leptospirosis and Dengue.  Only $50,000 is 
<br/>given  to  Leptospirosis  Control  Programme  and  $200,000  on  Dengue  Prevention  and  Control 
<br/>Programme.  Honourable Minister, can I just see clarification on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman, through  you, this allocation for 
<br/>Leptospirosis,  it  is  for  its    ongoing  programme.    In  terms  of  the  need,  if  there  is  an  emergency 
<br/>outbreak such as the ones, we had in the last few weeks with typhoid in Labasa and leptospirosis in 
<br/>Kadavu. There is a special allocation in the Headquarters of about $500,000 that they can come and 
<br/>get for emergency purposes. But this allocation is for their ongoing programmes, awareness, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  is  that  the  same  with  Dengue 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prevention and Control?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.-  It is the same, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-7(5)  -  Food  Unit.  Sir,  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Economic Affairs when we met, we called Food Unit representative just to have a 
<br/>better understanding of their role and we found that one of the constraints they related to us was to 
<br/>do with funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Food Unit plays a very important role in imports and exports of food. They look after the 
<br/>standards, they control the quality of foods that is coming into the country, and they are always short 
<br/>staffed, they do not have enough people to do their job.  We are very concerned that the quality of 
<br/></span><span>food sold in the supermarket is of such a low standard and during our discussion, the whole idea is 
<br/></span><span>to strengthen this unit.  Currently with $200,000, it is still not sufficient.  I just wanted to flag this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There was no budget allocation for this before.  This year, we 
<br/>have allocated $200,000 and I think it will be enough for them to plan and if they need additional 
<br/>funding in the following financial year, they will get it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, just a point of clarification. Last year, Food Unit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was provided $150,000 allocation.  Just to clarify with the Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- All that was raised by honourable Premila is to flag it, that is all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- There was an allocation for Food Unit. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Northern  Division  from  your  beautiful 
<br/>islands,  Outreach  Programme  of  $30,000  is  merely  not  enough.    I  move  that  we  increase  that 
<br/>allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, I seconded the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.-  The Northern Division covers a wide area and I believe there 
<br/>should be a better allocation than this to be able to cover the three provinces of Bua, Cakaudrove and 
<br/>Macuata properly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- As this is to do with an increase, we will now put that to the vote.

<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, 3-4(5) – Ambulance Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are still on Activity 2.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Sorry, Sir.  Programme 3-4(5) – Ambulance Service.  I think this 
<br/>is  for  the  whole  Northern  Division.    I  experienced  a  bit  of  problem  in  getting  the  patients  from 
<br/>Savusavu  to  Labasa  and  around  the  other  areas  in  Seaqaqa.    I  am  not  sure  about  this  allocation 
<br/>whether this is enough.  I know with this $25, 000 you cannot even buy any, but I believe this is some 
<br/>kind of service outsourcing.  I just seek clarification from the honourable Minister on that, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.-  Through you, Mr. Chairman, this allocation of 
<br/>$25,000 is for maintenance and repair of ambulance and pay for services provided by FNU or St. 
<br/>John Ambulance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- We gave them two new ambulances in the last six months, so this is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just for maintenance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have two motions.  The first one is by honourable Ravunawa for an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase on staff clothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, I move that we increase the allocation for staff 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 4-1(5), from experience, I know the 
<br/>staff clothing only covers the nurses uniform.  We have the other cadres that are in the hospital, the 
<br/>practise at the moment, they buy their own scrubs in order to do their work in the clinical setting, Sir.  
<br/></span><span>That is why I move that we increase an allocation that is written before you Sir, to buy staff clothing 
<br/></span><span>for  dental,  physio,  x-ray  or  all  other  health  cadres  under  the  Ministry  of  Health.    Maybe  the 
<br/>honourable Minister can also clarify that. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1461 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You were asking that the honourable Minister do some clarification or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Yes Sir, if the honourable Minister can just confirm whether this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>staff clothing allocation is only for nurses, putting aside all other health workers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Through you Mr. Chairman, yes, it is to cater for 
<br/>the purchase of staff clothing nurses, uniform shoes, dietician’s uniform and laboratory coats.  It does 
<br/>not include the scrubs, as you mentioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The other motion submitted by honourable Ravunawa is to do with an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase of $24,722 for bedding and linen.  May you introduce your motion.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, the need for bedding and linen is known in all 
<br/>our health facilities and with the expansion of converting the nursing station to health centre level, 
<br/>there is also a need for more beddings and linen.  I move that we increase the vote, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Sir,  I have elaborated a bit. Just with the expansion of service, 
<br/>the demand has increased hence we need an increase in the budget allocation for beddings and linen 
<br/>for all hospital facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 4-1(5)  - Infection Control Programme.  I 
<br/>see an allocation of $1 million.  Honourable Minister, if you can tell us what was the utilisation of 
<br/>this amount last year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, honourable Premila 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can I come back to you with that information later on? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. KUMAR.- That is fine, honourable Minister.  The reason why I am asking is, 
<br/>normally people who visit hospital are always concerned about the infection control programme in 
<br/>the hospital.  If you have a better infection control, then we will be able to reduce the number of 
<br/>people falling sick when they visit hospitals or even when they undergo operations.  So, I just wanted 
<br/>little bit more details on this which I will have a discussion with the honourable Minister later on. 
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  4-1(5)  -  Expansion  in  Drugs  and 
<br/></span><span>Medical Supplies ($78,000).  Can the honourable Minister explain what this programme is all about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- This allocation is for drug regulatory activities, 
<br/>for example, inspection of retail pharmacies, registration of exams of new Pharmacists, supplemented 
<br/>by fees from the Fiji Medicinal Board and Fiji Pharmacy Profession Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is your interest as well, honourable Maharaj?

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, Programme 4-1(5) – Laboratories 
<br/>Reagents, I seek clarification on the vast increase in this allocation  from $9 million to $13 million. 
<br/>If the honourable Minister can briefly highlight and clarify the need for that increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the additional 
<br/>funding is aligned to the planned procurement activities to be undertaken by the Ministry in the new 
<br/>financial year to cater for the purchase of more than 800 items.  Those are lab consumables, reagents 
<br/>for medical laboratories, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Chairman, I understand there 
<br/>was a change with mindray machine and the lab biochemistry machines, hence there is a need to 
<br/>get new reagents for the new machine.  At the moment, some of the machines that are sitting out in 
<br/>the peripheral clinics are not getting the reagents for the completion of their blood sample test and I 
<br/>also understand that reagents for the new machine is not in the country at the moment. If the 
<br/>honourable Minister can just elaborate a little bit on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  this  allocation  of 
<br/>laboratory  reagents,  as  the  honourable  Member  has  mentioned,  one  of  the  machines  is  mindray, 
<br/>currently at the moment, that lab equipment is one that is giving us headaches at the moment.  So, in 
<br/>order to change that, specific equipment comes with specific reagents that is not compatible with the 
<br/>others. That is why the increase in that allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, before we vote on Head  22, I just have one final 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister. Having gone through the Programmes and Activities, I see that 
<br/>there is nothing allocated for Rotuma Hospital. Can we assume that it is completed and are in the 
<br/>process of commissioning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Yes, we are just finalising every detail in terms of 
<br/>moving.  As I have mentioned, when we will open Rotuma, we will do it  right,  as compared to 
<br/>Navosa. So, we will shift all the new equipment and everything.  At the moment, it is just the final 
<br/>touches and I have met with the Rotuma Council Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on Head 22 – Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Health and Medical Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 22 agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament and this is for lunch 
<br/>break as well. So, we take both, tea and lunch in one go, and then we will come back.  We will break 
<br/>for about an hour.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 1.07 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 23 - Ministry of Housing  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 23-2-1 (Housing and Community Development), be increased by $5 million 
<br/>with respect to First Home Grant below $50,000 and $3 million in the range of $50,000 to 
<br/>$100,000, and this can be increased by $2 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, the reason why I have made this motion for an increase 
<br/>in grant by $5 million is purely based on the economic activities that these projects generate.  We 
<br/>have seen that when the Government invests money in this programme, the rate of return in eight 
<br/>times more because when people construct their homes or when they take loan from the bank, both 
<br/>the financial services sector as well as the construction sector does well.  But what we have seen is 
<br/>that the money was diverted last year or early this year for something else which was around $2.8 
<br/>million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have also noted is that there is a very, very high demand for this project.  People are 
<br/>on the waiting  list and sometimes at  the end of the year when there is  any money left  within the 
<br/>Ministry, we used to assist these homeowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, from 2014, we have noted that more than 3,760 households were assisted.  So, 
<br/>at  a  time  like  this  when  we  are  talking  about  recovery  and  rebuilding  the  future  of  our  people,  I 
<br/>believe that if we increase this grant,  it is just going  to  contribute to  the economic growth  of the 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  allocation  for  Head  23-2-1(10)  Housing  Assistance  to  Fire  Victims  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased by $500,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Mr. Chairman, there has been an increase in fire to personal property and 
<br/>I think the value is still less.  There is a lot of our vulnerable and poor hardworking citizens facing 
<br/>the unfortunate event, such as Mr. Mahendra in Labasa, so I think we need to provide more to our 
<br/>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I have some questions for clarification. Programme 2-
<br/>1(6)  –  Public  Rental  Board  Subsidy  ($1,116,451),  I  see  there  is  a  decrease  in  the  sum.    If  the 
<br/>honourable Minister can kindly inform us why the subsidy has been reduced? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  rent  subsidies  that  are  given  to  tenants  by 
<br/>Public Rental Board (PRB) are normally given to those tenants with household income of $10,400 
<br/>and below or earning weekly income of equivalent to $200 and below.   What happened was, after 
<br/>the survey that was done by the PRB, about 10 tenants have graduated from that level to the next and 
<br/>that has led to the reduction in subsidies as far as rental is concerned.  So that justifies the reduction 
<br/>in subsidies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister; 
<br/>if 10 people have graduated, surely the new ones must have come in to occupy those premises.  How 
<br/>can you say that the subsidy needs to come down because it is based on the number of flats you have? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- The subsidy is not based on the number of flats, it is based on an 
<br/>income, so when the survey is done and confirmed that the tenants are earning above $10,000 they 
<br/>will  pay  rent  that  is  not  subsidized,  so  they  normally  pay  whatever  rental  that  is  offered  at  that 
<br/>particular time.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  2-1(8)  –  Improve  Basic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amenities (Informal Settlement), I believe this is a new allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I can answer that, Mr. Chairman.  This is a new allocation, 
<br/>honourable Member, because there has been a lot of submissions about improving basic amenities 
<br/>within the informal settlements until such time that proper infrastructure can be put in place.  So, 
<br/>simple things like footpaths, walkways, are things that people need to get by on a daily basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  in  the  last  few  days,  we  have  heard  about  the 
<br/>development  of  informal  settlements  and  I  do  remember  that  we  have  secured  around  40  to  42 
<br/>development leases.  During the honourable Minister’s speech, if I heard him correctly, he said that 
<br/>there were certain development leases that had expired.  So, to renew that, where is that allocation 
<br/>reflected here?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  that  is  part  of  Formalisation  of  Informal 
<br/>Settlements ($10,000,000).  We have allocated a total of $250,537 for the renewal of development 
<br/>leases for the following informal settlements: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tore/Tukutora in Lautoka; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2)</span><span> </span><span>Uluisila in Sigatoka; 
<br/></span><span>3)</span><span> </span><span>Vunarewa in Nadi; 
<br/></span><span>4)</span><span> </span><span>Delainamasi in Lautoka; 
<br/>5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Togabalavu in Lautoka; 
<br/>6)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Siberia in Labasa;  
<br/>7)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Solove in Ba; and  
<br/>8)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Tuatua in Labasa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  those  are  the  eight  development  leases  that  have  expired  that  we  will  be  arranging  for  their 
<br/>renewal in the next financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  again,  I  am  seeking  clarification,  honourable 
<br/>Minister,  on  Programme  2-1(6)  –  Lagilagi  Housing  PCN  Refund  ($150,000).    If  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister can tell us:  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1465 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how many applicants were refunded in the last financial year;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2)</span><span> </span><span>what was the value of the refund; and  
<br/>3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how many are on the waiting list to be refunded this year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.-  Mr. Chairman, Sir, maybe just to enlighten Parliament on the 
<br/>Lagilagi issue, these are for the residents of Jittu Estate, off Grantham Road. I think the scheme came 
<br/>about in the 2021-2022 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  a  brief  background  on  those  people  that  have  paid  housing  deposits  to  People’s 
<br/>Community Network (PCN) but were not offered any flats based on whatever information that we 
<br/>received, it amounted to $2.2 million and that is close to 336 households that have made payments 
<br/>to PCN. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To-date, we have assisted a total of 434 applicants or families/individuals with a total amount 
<br/>of close to $3.4 million.  We have seen the reduction of those who have paid and were affected that 
<br/>have come forward and produced their receipts, as well as a letter to confirm that they have made 
<br/>such payments to PCN.  Based on the reduction in the number of families or applicants that we have 
<br/>received based on the enquiries that we have received, if you put an average, for those 434 families 
<br/>it is close to $7,800. So, if you equate that $7,800 based on$150,000, so we expect close to 19 because 
<br/>the numbers have reduced.  So, we are projecting to assist close to 18, 19, 20 or 30 people based on 
<br/>an average of $7,800 per applicant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- …on the waiting list, like they have made their submission and they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are waiting for the assessment and payout. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- At the moment, all that we have received, we have processed and 
<br/>we have cleared.  There are some that have come forward to us but the policy says if you pay, you 
<br/>must make sure that whatever narration in the receipt must say deposit housing.  So, these are some 
<br/>of  the  things  that  we  have  clarified  with  all  those  that  have  come  forward  and  lodged  their 
<br/>applications with the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 23 - Ministry of Housing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 23 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 24 - Ministry Of Women, Children And Social Protection 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  1-1(7)  -  Economic  Empowerment  of 
<br/>Persons with Disability ($10,000), I seek clarification from honourable Minister on the reduction of 
<br/>$8,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the reduction of that amount is based on 
<br/>the utilisation but we have allocated more to those programmes and organisations that are more active 
<br/></span><span>in this space.  There has been an increase for the National Council of Persons Living with Disabilities 
<br/></span><span>and other programmes, like the Implementation of Rights of Persons with Disability Act which has 
<br/>gone up by $20,000.  So, again, it is based on the utilisation.  We hope to have more programmes 
<br/>and outreach, but  we encourage individuals  to  join  organisations so  that they can be part of their 
<br/>empowerment programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, would like to request clarification from the honourable
