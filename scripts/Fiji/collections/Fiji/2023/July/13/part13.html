<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- SEG 8 – Drainage for Farmlands ($1.5 million). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, there is an increase of $1 million. The increase 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is to ensure adequate drainage works are undertaken on the farmlands in the following divisions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Central Division - $500,000 for farms in Tailevu, Rewa, Naitasiri, Serua and Namosi; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Western Division- $500,000 for Sigatoka, Nadi, Lautoka, Ba, Tavua and Rakiraki; and  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Northern Division -  $500,000 in the whole of CBM. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Total is $1.5 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, can I have a supplementary question? The supplementary

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question to the honourable Minister is, do this farmlands include cattle farming as well? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Include what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Cattle farming like in Cakaudrove. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Yes. Once the farmland is dry, it is really up to the farmer what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he does whether he wants cattle on it or he wants to plan cassava.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You may introduce your motion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I move the motion on Head 30-5-1(8) for Coastal Erosion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Protection Works. I would like to have another increase of $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You may elaborate on your motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, our former Prime Minister was a climate change champion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all around the world and Fiji has been affected.  Our costal lines ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are talking about him? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- The Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN- The champion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, our honourable Leader of the Opposition and also our former Prime 
<br/>Minister  as  well.    Our  country’s  name  was  there  in  COP23.  Mr.  Chairman,  Fiji  is  affected  with 
<br/>climate change, our coastal lines are being eroded and that is the reason I am requesting that another 
<br/>$1 million is allocated for coastal erosion protection works especially for our upcoming towns and 
<br/>cities like Savusavu which is affected.  We have some tourism projects coming up o Nawi Island so 
<br/>we need to beautify our coasts as well, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, in view of this motion, I want to put it to the vote 
<br/>and that is regarding Head 30 to be increased by another $1 million in Programme 5-1(8), this is 
<br/></span><span>regarding Coastal Erosion Protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA- Mr. Chairman, Programme 6-1(7) - Climate Smart Agriculture. Can 
<br/>the honourable Minister please provide some clarity on this and maybe the level of innovation and 
<br/>the projected implementation efforts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, this project is on improving and retention of soil 
<br/>logging organic matter content – soil carbon, soil health, soil fertility and water management.    It 
<br/>also includes agriculture drought management on degraded land through Climate Smart Agriculture. 
<br/>This  involves  replanting  of  trees  in  dry  areas.  As  you  know,  Fiji  is  signatory  to  the  three  Rio 
<br/>Conventions  -  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  United 
<br/>Nations Convention on Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the Convention on Biological

<div><span>Diversity (CBD).  This programme works in collaboration with these organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question please.  Is there any level 
<br/>of  innovation  or  any  automated  systems  or  any  digitalised  systems  because  it  is  climate  smart.  
<br/>Basically, we are working within the parameters of certain things to get an outcome and output. So 
<br/>any level of technology? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- This project makes use of technology but I will have to get the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information and then come back to you, honourable Member, through you, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Parliament  will  now  vote  on  Head  30  –  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Waterways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 30 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 31- Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1, it is listed there as Aid-in Kind - 
<br/>Project on Pacific Islands Capacity Enhancement for Achieving SDG14 (Life Under Water).  Can 
<br/>the honourable Minister elaborate on what sort of work is undertaken in the Ministry together with 
<br/>JICA? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, please may I come back to you on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  just  like  to  request  that,  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Natural Resources had the opportunity of meeting with the fisheries sector.  There 
<br/>were a lot of issues that were brought up there.  I am just trying see the forums that are available to 
<br/>the Ministry to be able to talk to its stakeholders.  We have a Fisheries Stakeholders Consultation of 
<br/>$30,000 in Programme 1-2(7).  I would just like to know exactly how this will be undertaken and 
<br/>where it will be undertaken?  What sort of issues will be addressed in that stakeholders’ consultation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I think there is no change to cater for any promotional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>show and awareness activities done for fiscal reason. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Is it more of the Ministry showing what it does or it is about actual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engagement with the various stakeholders in the fisheries sector which is a very important sector? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  The  honourable  Member  is  right,  it  is  for  stakeholder 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Programme 1-2(7) - Trade Shows.  I need clarification on the Trade 
<br/></span><span>Show, how many Trade Shows are planned ahead, what are the investment returns of these Trade 
<br/></span><span>Shows and the evaluation done to determine the improvement if needed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think the discussion with the Ministry was based on the plans 
<br/>to develop some promotional activities and awareness in a number of areas, for example, beche-de-
<br/>mar exports and production.  Some high value products need that kind of exposure as well.  So, Trade 
<br/>Shows includes some of those activities, so we have allocated a small amount to see what they do in

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-2(6) - Annual Infofish Subscription.  
<br/>I know that we have been a member of Infofish for quite a number of years.  Can the honourable 
<br/>Minister tell us what sort of benefits are we getting out of Infofish? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  provision  is  the  payment  for  annual  Infofish 
<br/>Subscription for Fiji. The Infofish International is an inter-governmental organisation for marketing 
<br/>information, technical advisory services for fisheries products in the Asian and Pacific Region.  The 
<br/>Ministry  benefits  from  this  through  provisions  of  fisheries  market  statistics  and  promotional 
<br/>programmes and through ongoing training and capacity building.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  that  is  exactly  my  question.    It  is  all  textbook 
<br/>explanation.  The Infofish is based in Kuala Lumpur, and we have been a member for quite a number 
<br/>of years.  Exactly in what areas, you have talked about marketing and technical assistance, what have 
<br/>we benefited from as a result of our membership? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Leader of the Opposition would know that 
<br/>some  of  these  memberships  subscriptions,  I  just  want  to  add  because  this  is  the  discussion,  it  is 
<br/>statistics.  A lot of the statistics are not compiled domestically.  So, if you want to look at national 
<br/>and regional statistics, these are databases that they create and they do it for Fiji as well and other 
<br/>Pacific countries.  There is a benefit to being a member of this.  As we are with all other organisations, 
<br/>you know that we have been paying this subscription for a while. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Would you like to make some comments, honourable Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, it is a useful organisation to be in.  This week we have 
<br/>been  talking  about  PAFCO  workers  being  laid  off  because  of  the  reduction  in  fish  produced  for 
<br/>PAFCO.  When I asked whether we can increase our intake of purchase of fish, I was told, “we get 
<br/>the migratory species we offloaded in Fiji?”  How do we increase it?  Can we keep a track of those 
<br/>things?  A lot of flak was fired against Fiji Water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  amount  of  money  they  have  put  into  Caltech  and  in  space  research  as  it  includes 
<br/>monitoring the fish stocks of the world which we can benefit from.  The improvement or increase in 
<br/>their commitment to Fiji agriculture, aquaculture and our marine industries will help us develop this 
<br/>keep us even ahead of the Kuala Lumpur organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-1(7)  –  Inshore  Compliance  and 
<br/>Enforcement.  We had the opportunity to visit fishing areas all around Fiji and if there is one thing 
<br/>that  people  are  always  complaining  about  is  ensuring  compliance  inshore,  not  only  inshore  but 
<br/>offshore.    You  know  there  is  a  lot  of  illegal  fishing  that  takes  place,  people’s  </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span>  are  being 
<br/>exploited.  We  have  set  up  systems  of  fish  wardens,  et  cetera  that  sometimes  do  not  seem  to  be 
<br/>working as well as we would like it to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  have  an  update  from  the  honourable  Minister  on  how  well  this  inshore 
<br/></span><span>compliance  and  enforcement  is  going  and  if  there  are  new  measures  that  Minister  of  Fisheries  is 
<br/></span><span>looking to bringing into being, perhaps working in partnership with communities to try to make sure 
<br/>that there is stronger compliance and enforcement of the usage of the </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> areas that we have all 
<br/>around Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1495 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The programme has two components – the 
<br/>Marine Stewardship Council (MCS) certification for the certification of fishing vessels and meeting 
<br/>international standards and to get a premium export market price.  With the premium export market 
<br/>price,  companies  will  however  need  to  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  which  includes  Marine 
<br/>Stewardship Council (MSCS) certification in environment standard identifies sustainable fisheries, 
<br/>encourage good stewardship of fisheries resources.  The programme will promote future health of 
<br/>tuna stock in the region and better price in a domestic fisheries sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  I  think  that  is  offshore  fisheries,  but  this  is  inshore  compliance  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 2-1(7)  – Inshore Compliance and Enforcement.  Tuna is offshore. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- They come for their bait – white bait. That is the </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> areas.  How do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you get rid of these people.  The big fishing boats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, we have just started with inshore fisheries legislation, 
<br/>started off with a new budget for this year, as you can see in the budget allocation.  We are trying to 
<br/>work out and monitor these vessels coming into Fiji on engaging in illegal fishing in our shores.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just one last supplementary question on this same 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Could I give the floor to honourable Semi Koroilavesau before I come 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back to you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  I  just  want  to  help  the  Minister  in 
<br/>clarifying those issues since he is quite recent introduction to the Ministry of Fisheries. Firstly, the 
<br/>inshore fish although headquartered in Malaysia, the annual meeting is held in Bangkok, Thailand.  
<br/>The benefits  that Fiji  gets  out  of it is very wide  -  marketing, resource protection and  the various 
<br/>industries also include the technical experts that come into these conferences help with monitoring 
<br/>the various fishing sectors that is involved both in the Pacific and Asian region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For inshore compliance, we have purchased inshore fishing protection vessels.  One is based 
<br/>in Lautoka for the Western Division, one is in Labasa for the Northern Division then we have got 
<br/>Fisheries Wardens which we rope in to report to Fisheries and then Fisheries goes out and assists 
<br/>them in the protection of inshore fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  inshore  is  not  well  protected  like  offshore  which  is  covered  by  the  Forum 
<br/></span><span>Fisheries  Agency,  the  Navy  and  also,  we  have  got  the  monitoring  section  within  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Fisheries that have the same satellite equipment that attract every fishing vessel outside, around the 
<br/>EEZ for tuna industry. But  inshore it is a development.   The honourable Minister is  right, it was 
<br/>developed about two years ago. There is more left to be done, New Zealand assisted us in providing 
<br/>us the legislative requirement to do the inshore fisheries but it is development in progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you for your intervention, honourable Semi Koroilavesau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Supplementary, Sir.  I think one of the useful thing that is being done 
<br/></span><span>in the past for the inshore fisheries compliance is the development of fish wardens.  As we go to these 
<br/>villages, there is one constant complaint that they have, sometimes they are appointed but they do 
<br/>not have the boat et cetera, would that be included as part of strengthening of the inshore compliance 
<br/>of making sure that the fish wardens in the various </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> have the equipment that allow them to 
<br/>carry out their job.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- The wardens boat that you had promised we are now funding through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>small grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, for offshore fisheries, this is one of the sectors that 
<br/>has been suffering greatly these past few years.  Part of it is due to the change in migratory patterns 
<br/>of tuna and other fish but there are a lot of other challenges.  In our meetings with them as part of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Natural Resources, they were looking for avenues, a lot of these companies 
<br/>if you go to Walu Bay the boats are actually anchored.   Sometimes if they have ten boats, one will 
<br/>go and if they cannot find the fish then it comes back.  So, they were looking for ways in which they 
<br/>can get access to finance and other support to sustain them.  I am trying to look at this whether some 
<br/>of  these  programmes  that  you  have  here,  I  do  not  see  any  programmes  under  this  particular 
<br/>programme to Activity 2 that might try to assist the revival of this sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know it is dependent on migratory fish pattern and they are competing with companies that 
<br/>are subsidized by mother country.  They are competing with all these, they have high freight cost to 
<br/>the places that they go to. So, they were telling us that they were talking to the Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/>to deal with financial institutions to give them some sort of assistance.  I do not know where that 
<br/>could  come  under  this  particular  programme,  but  with  your  permission,  Mr.  Chairman,  if  the 
<br/>honourable Minister might be able to update us on how well those discussions have been going with 
<br/>those offshore fisheries companies, Ministry and Fiji Development Bank, I think, to get them that 
<br/>assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  discussions  have  been  done  with  FDB  regarding  the 
<br/>issues raised by the honourable Member.  Also with the tuna industry, in establishing a tuna hub in 
<br/>Fiji which will bring back those boats and also feeding our local factories like PAFCO.  For the past 
<br/>couple of years, there was a levy given to the fishing industry which is US$450 per tonne which 
<br/>drives them away from Fiji, so we are trying to get them back.  We need to get the tuna hub to Fiji 
<br/>where they can prepare their boats, refuel and re-stock their boats before going back fishing.  It is 
<br/>understandable  that  we  have  some  old-aged  boat  anchored  at  the  Suva  harbor  and  we  have  been 
<br/>discussing with financial institutions to give them extra loans so as to repair or buy new boats.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 2-3(8) and and probably I will link 
<br/>that  too  with  the  Naduruloulou  Freshwater  Research  Centre  on  SEG  4.  This  is  all  linked  to  my 
<br/>previous  question  too  involving  inshore  fisheries.    This  Fish  Cage  Culture  Research  Project  is 
<br/>something that will also make significant improvements in our food and nutrition security and, of 
<br/>course, economic security as well.  My simple question to the honourable Minister is, I assume that 
<br/></span><span>this is freshwater fish cage culture and perhaps my other question as well that I wanted to raise with 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Minister through you, Mr. Chairman is, just like animal health, nutrition is something 
<br/>that will significantly improve our aquaculture production in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have alluded to already in this august Parliament, unfortunately when it comes to feed, 
<br/>the feed that is provided in Fiji is produced by livestock feed specialists namely Goodman Fielder 
<br/>and Pacific Feed.  Perhaps if certain efforts can be also made on nutrition development for our fish 
<br/>farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.-  Mr. Chairman, we  are working  on feed research right  now.   We  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>using the same old feed protein which is 24 percent and we are looking for a binder and a floater.    
<br/>We  have  everything  in  Fiji,  the  minerals  are  available  here  but  we  have  to  get  the  binder  from 
<br/>overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, just a quick question to the honourable Minister, in  
<br/>Programme  2-3(8)  is  Pearl  Oyster  Research  and  Development  Programme  ($378,000).    I  am  just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1497 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wondering, when pearl started in Fiji, it was one of the well-known pearls in the world.  Justin Hunter 
<br/>is well known around the world and therefore a lot of research and development into pearl oyster has 
<br/>been done, in my view, and that is why we have the Fiji pearl high up there in the world.  I know too, 
<br/>honourable Minister, that we are trying to help our locals that those farms.  I just have a query.  Is 
<br/>there a special area that the research is in or you are just trying to help those local small scale pearl 
<br/>farmers to develop? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, we have small subsistence pearl farms, but the problem 
<br/>has  been  the  hurricanes  which  has  been  affecting  the  pearl  industry  for  the  last  few  years.    The 
<br/>objective of the programme is to support the development of pearl farming through the identification 
<br/>of  new  sites,  technical  training,  advisory  support  and  expert  community-based  specifications 
<br/>collection.  The focus is on research and culture oyster projects.  Right now, these are the two main 
<br/>commodities;  black  pearls  and  oyster.    We  are  concentrating  on  black  pearls  and  we  have  sites 
<br/>identified and specifications collection have already started in Vanua Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  again  honourable  Minister  for  your 
<br/>responses.  Just are few issues in relation to research. I think for research in the fisheries sector, the 
<br/>key is the Naduruloulou Freshwater Research.  The other one that we have seen for brackish water 
<br/>has been Galoa Research Station.  What  I have noticed in  this facility that it really needs a bit of 
<br/>upgrading, but I noticed in this Budget that we only have money for maintenance and operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one that I am wondering why it has not been covered here is Caboni.  I think Caboni 
<br/>is the one that is excellent.  In order for Caboni to be able to expand, it requires an infusion of capital 
<br/>to make sure they get more seawater into that facility and it is the one that stands out.  The other 
<br/>research facility or hatchery that we really need to get going is the one that services Vanua Levu, 
<br/>which is Dreketi.  I am  just wondering, honourable Minister, do you also have plans to vamp up 
<br/>Galoa, to get Dreketi fully functional and to ensure also that Caboni, in partnership with Taiwan can 
<br/>be expanded so it can meet its full potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  now  we  are  trying  to  improve  those  two  hatcheries;  
<br/>Naduruloulou and Galoa.  We want to extend the Galoa one into a research centre but not a production 
<br/>centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-6(8)  on  the  On-going 
<br/>Construction of Multi Species Hatchery – Ra as elaborated by the honourable Minister in Caboni.  
<br/>Honourable Minister, what would be the timeline, when can this construction be completed in Caboni 
<br/></span><span>in Ra? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, the Caboni is almost completed now.  I think the last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>phase is going on with quarters to be constructed.  We are on the last phase for Caboni now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you  honourable  Minister.    As  you  said  the current  phase  in 
<br/>Caboni is almost coming to an end.  I was trying to mention that the next phase that they need to go 
<br/>is to get more seawater into that facility, which means they need to dig under the road and get more 
<br/>seawater in, so that they can expand.  I can understand that that it is probably not covered in this one 
<br/></span><span>- $860,000.  That infusion of water is not covered under this $860,000.  Would that be an additional 
<br/></span><span>programme in the future? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I will come back to you on that. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Head 31 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 32 – Ministry of Forestry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  2-2(8)  on  Reducing  Emissions  from 
<br/>Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD Plus) - $832,000.  Can the honourable Minister just 
<br/>explain exactly what that will cover and what it will deliver? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We still waiting for our royalty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, REDD+ is a world bank component.  That 
<br/>allocation was mainly for readiness phase and emission reduction, Reduction Programme.  In 2023-
<br/>2024 financial year, the Ministry will focus on the full implementation of the Emission Reduction 
<br/>Programme of $1.2 million with the completion of readiness phase.  This allocation will fund the 
<br/>implementation of Emission Reduction Programme covering 20 Districts and nine Provinces.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, the breakdown of $832,000 are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Safeguard FTRM - $12,000;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span> </span><span>Management and Emission Monitoring - $170,000;

<br/>7)</span><span> </span><span>CA Repairing and Rehabilitation - $50,000;  
<br/>8)</span><span> </span><span>CA Livelihood - $60,000;  
<br/>9)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forests Protection - $50,000; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total of $832,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-3(5), honourable Minister, there are two 
<br/>items there. The second one is Forestry Warden Support with $50,000 allocation.  I just want to ask 
<br/>as to how many Forestry Wardens are there?  Who looks after the security at Colo-i-Suva Forest 
<br/>Park?  There has been a lot of muggings that is happening in there, are they part of the Forest Wardens 
<br/></span><span>to look after the Forest Park in Colo-i-Suva and they provide the security as well? It is a two-part 
<br/></span><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, can I request honourable Naupoto to repeat the question, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Honourable Minister, Sir, I was asking about the Forest Warden. How 
<br/>many Forest Wardens are there?  Because I see there is $50,000 for their support (Forest Warden 
<br/>Support).  Who looks after the security at Colo-i-Suva Forest Park, are they the Forest Wardens you 
<br/></span><span>are there or is there a special security arrangement?  If you do not have the statistics there, honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister, you can give it to me later.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, we have 17 Forest Wardens in Colo-i-Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Total in Fiji the Forest Wardens?

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Honourable Member, it is only for Colo-i-Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Aright.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-7(10)  -  Commercial  Maritime  Pine 
<br/>Subsidy ($1,400,000), at the moment, one of the most matured Pine Plantation in Fiji is on Lakeba.  
<br/>I am just wondering whether these includes the harvesting and value adding of products out of the 
<br/>Lakeba Pine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, while still on Maritime Pine, Mr. Chairman, Cicia, 
<br/>Gau and Kadavu.  We know that Gau and Kadavu has already started. If the honourable Minister can 
<br/>provide  an  update  on  Cicia  because  I  know  that  in  Cicia.  there  was  some  dispute  about  it  being 
<br/>declared an organic island.  That was one of the delays on this programme in Cicia.  So, I just wanted 
<br/>the clarification from the honourable Minister on how far this has progressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, we have a subsidy for Maritime Pine Harvesting that will 
<br/>be starting early, I think after this Budget announcement, which includes all maritime islands such 
<br/>as Kadavu, Cicia, Lakeba and Gau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Minister on Programme 2-8(8) - Upgrade 
<br/>of Forest Parks ($170,000),  I know of the Colo-i-Suva Forest Park, can you just enlighten us on the 
<br/>other forest parks that are designated forests.   I know Colo-i-Suva is one, what are the other ones? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Chairman, the answer to the question is we have the particulars of 
<br/>the breakdown of the forest parks.  We have forest park reserves, including Bouma in Taveuni.  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman, can I come back with the information later on? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 32 – Ministry of Forestry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 32 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 33 – Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  2-1(8)  –  Groundwater  Assessment  and 
<br/>Development  –  Large  Islands  ($2,500,000).    Can  the  honourable  Minister  highlight  which  larger 
<br/>islands will be included in that allocation?  How many households and communities will benefit from 
<br/>that allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Small islands or large islands? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Large islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  larger  islands  are  mainly  Viti  Levu,  Vanua 
<br/>Levu and Taveuni.  So these are groundwater assessment and developments in all those three islands, 
<br/>that deal largely with red zone areas, which are not accessible to the supply root of Water Authority 
<br/>of Fiji (WAF) or where there is specific requirement that comes from a particular community.  In the 
<br/>last  Budget,  $2 million was  allocated  and  in  this  year’s  Budget,  there  is  an  increase  of  $500,000

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>simply because we found that now we are working on backlog on a lot of requests from areas that 
<br/>are inaccessible to WAF services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Minister for the large islands, would you already have a 
<br/>list of actual sites for assessments and the ones for development?  I know for some, you will be doing 
<br/>assessments and developments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, in Viti Levu, there are nine and in Vanua Levu 
<br/>there are four for assessment.  The ones that are ready are 13 in Viti Levu and five in Vanua Levu.  I 
<br/>can provide you with the list of all these. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And for the small islands? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- And small islands as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, my apologies, I had raised my hand earlier.  
<br/>I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister on Programme 2-1(9) – Purchase of Research Vessel.  
<br/>The amount written there is $560,000.  Am not sure what type of vessel is this, perhaps this is an 
<br/>initial money to be used to build the vessel?  Research vessels are quite costly   We had  </span><span>Bulikula</span><span>
<br/>which was later from the Marine Department which was later transferred to the Navy and renamed 
<br/></span><span>HMFS Latui</span><span>.  It is quite a substantial vessel.  It does not cost $560,000.  I just want the clarification 
<br/>may be this is just the initial process to build the whole vessel? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, the allocation of $560,000 is for the purchase 
<br/>of a research vessel that is probably not as huge as what you would have as a research vessel, probably 
<br/>the size as the ones the Police presently have.  It is simply to facilitate geological research and to 
<br/>allow our staff to do coastal assessments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 3-1(7) – Schedule A Rentals ($174,858), I 
<br/>just need a clarification from the honourable Minister.  I understand that all Schedule ‘A’ land have 
<br/>been transferred to iTLTB, so can the honourable Minister give some clarification of the rental which 
<br/>is $174,858? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, this is the allocation that caters for the payment 
<br/>of premium fees and charges, that secures the Schedule A and B lands which are still leased by the 
<br/>State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  understand.    That  land  is  leased  by  the  Lands 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Department? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Yes, the Lands Department.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- You are still leasing those lands from iTLTB? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  3-2(8)  –  Upgrade  of  Geodetic  Datum 
<br/>($175,033).  I remembered you made a Ministerial Statement earlier on our progress into WGS 84 
<br/>which is the World Geodetic System.  Can the honourable Minister just enlighten us on the progress 
<br/>of that transition with the new one - WGS 84?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1501 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, I think with the eight core stations that had been 
<br/>built, the project pretty much has been fulfilled.  So, it is now just making sure that maintenance is 
<br/>provided for.  The hardware updates are also performed at real time.  There is quite a number of 
<br/>upgrading that needs to be done so that our inflow is commensurate with the inflow that we output 
<br/>to our stakeholders, but it is just a running cost on how we complete the entire project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-Honourable Minister, just some clarification, again, under the Geospatial 
<br/>Information Management in Activity 2.  We are still not able to successfully use the GPS in our cars 
<br/>because of the difference in the systems that we are having, but we are actually using the Fiji Map 
<br/>Grid System and the systems used by Google.  How far are we of getting that right because I know 
<br/>there were some metres off in terms of the actual.… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- 20 Metres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Yes, something like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, from the briefing from my staff, it is probably 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not going to be as soon as.  I think it is going to be work in progress in this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- But it is being done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  in  that  same  SEG  on  the  Survey  of  the  Mahogany 
<br/>Plantations,  I know this is a really tough job that the staff of the Ministry do - they camp out in the 
<br/>middle of nowhere doing these things but, of course, it is very important for the landowners where 
<br/>the mahogany plantations are because no one really knows the boundaries of their land which then 
<br/>affects the income that they have.  I know that fund is here, can you just give us generally, I know it 
<br/>is a big are that needs to be done, roughly how many more years does the Ministry look to complete 
<br/>the whole survey of these mahogany plantations?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, the total area that is to be surveyed is 58,860 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hectares which are held by 105 landowning units.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The total area that has been surveyed is 53.6039 hectares which is equivalent to 72 percent 
<br/></span><span>completion.  The total leased surveyed is 20 leases equivalent to 6 percent completion.  So, there is 
<br/>a number of parcels of plantations, not all of which have been surveyed in complete because as you 
<br/>have identified, that is just impossible, in terrain-wise and weather-wise to get there in time and get 
<br/>the job done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But we work on a 10-year programme that has been started by the previous Government, so 
<br/>every year once we get the money from the Ministry of Finance, we try and push the mark as much 
<br/>as we can to ensure that we deliver this to the landowners when the lots are ready to be harvested.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 3-3(7) - Formulation of Valuation Act, I 
<br/>know it is something that the Ministry has been looking forward to, the beginnings of this, so given 
<br/>that $10,000, I assume that that does not mean the completion, it is just the initial start, is it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R.VOSAROGO.- I think it is the initial consultation as well as in-house, as well 
<br/>as stakeholders consultation, in which we have completed the in-house part of it.  Once we do the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultation with the stakeholders, then now with the setup of the Fiji Law Reform Commission, that 
<br/>becomes a founding document of what we would then pass off to…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Is there any target for the completion date? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R.VOSAROGO.- What we want to do, honourable Member, is to pass what are 
<br/>our findings are from our stakeholders meeting and our in-house consultation to Fiji Law Reform by 
<br/>the end of August.  I think that was the target. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, first on Programme 3-4(7), let me acknowledge the 
<br/>work undertaken on the State Land Use Master Plan and, of course, the Review of State Land and 
<br/>Land Use Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, my question is on Programme 3-4(8) - Maintenance of Existing Subdivision and 
<br/>Development  of  State  Land.  Can  the  honourable  Minister  elaborate  on  the  two  programmes, 
<br/>particularly for the Development of State Land, whether this a new one and where specifically?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  with  the  maintenance  of  existing 
<br/>subdivision in the North, we are looking the construction of the Vitadra Informal Settlement Access 
<br/>Road and upgrading of Baubale Residential Access Roads.  In the Central, we are looking at 36 lots 
<br/>subdivision - drainage maintenance in Naitata in Navua.  Those are the ones that come under the 
<br/>Maintenance Scheme.  In the Western upgrade, the access road to Nacobi and upgrade access road 
<br/>and drainage systems at Rakiraki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the development, the project focus of the completion of the pending work is in relation 
<br/>to  the  settlement  at  Field  40  in  Lautoka.    There  is  just  one  aspect  of  that  which  has  remained 
<br/>outstanding for quite a while now and so that required a payment of $107,000 which, from last year, 
<br/>we are going to shift into the next financial year, and we can make that payment.  Those are the two.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Motion by honourable Maharaj.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 33-3-4(8) - Development of State Land ($390,415), I request an increase of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>additional $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- I second the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, before  I talk on my  motion,  I  would like to 
<br/>thank the honourable Minister for mentioning that he is finally going to make the Vitadra and Baubale 
<br/>Roads.  Vitadra was done three-quarter way, a quarter is still left - until Mr. Jai Narayan’s place so, 
<br/>please, ensure that this time it is fully done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R.VOSAROGO.- The one that was constructed is repaired again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regard to this $1 million, Mr. Chairman,  there is 51 hectares of free land sitting between 
<br/>Bulileka and Basoga in Bulileka, Labasa.  Slowly squatter settlements are creeping in, most likely 
<br/>one or two hectares is now occupied by squatter settlement but because it is an empty and vacant

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1503 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>land, I think it would be good if money can be allocated to develop that land because once squatter 
<br/>settlement does creeps in, it becomes very difficult to develop a particular place.  It is quite central 
<br/>within three kilometers radius of Labasa town and if you are able to develop that piece of land, there 
<br/>will be high demand as a lot of land is needed and people are looking for developed land and that is 
<br/>why I am requesting if $1 million can be allocated to develop these 51 hectares of State land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-Now, I will put this motion to vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  3-5(10)  -  Land  Bank  Investment 
<br/>($120,000), in relation to land use, I am glad to see that budget is still being given for the Land Bank, 
<br/>but I do notice there has been a reduction of $80,000 for that.  From what that has happened so far, I 
<br/>think  the  Government  is  still  committed  to  Land  Bank,  so  I  am  glad  to  see  that.    I  just  want  an 
<br/>explanation for the reduction in the Budget for SEG-10? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, I think this is the work programme that we have 
<br/>carved out for this financial year.  It is not necessarily meaning that we are downsizing the importance 
<br/>of having that investment.  I think it is the work programme that we have put for this year that is 
<br/>going to cost us less than what the budget was for last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- …the whole work plan for the year in this budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Minister, the land on which the Water Authority of Fiji 
<br/>(WAF) and Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) assets are, I am just wondering whether they have finally 
<br/>been managed to be transferred across to those statutory bodies or not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, at the moment, there is still talks 
<br/>ongoing or how we manage that because now we have the Public Works Department (PWD) back, 
<br/>but we will get it sorted this year.  From the Ministry’s side, we want to hand it over, it should no 
<br/>longer be in on our asset inventory. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 33 – Ministry of Lands and Mineral

<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, on Programmes 2-1(7), just a clarification on the 
<br/>new  Film  Tax Rebate.    Can the honourable Minister clarify if this is  for new  claims that will be 
<br/>coming in or this is for the claims that have already been made? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, 40 is for the whole staff – that is the $200

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million  I  was  talking  about  during  my  speech  and  five  is  actually  for  the  provision  for  the  new 
<br/>productions coming up.  What you have to understand is that a production may happen this year, but 
<br/>the payment can happen 18 months after.  That is why five is low but that will wrap it up as we go 
<br/>along. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Chairman  through  you,  are  we  going  to  follow  the  same 
<br/>policies  that  were  in  place  or  are  you  going  to  develop  a  new  policy  because  the  old  policy  was 
<br/>heavily criticised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Basically, right now, the rebates have been reduced.  At one 
<br/>stage, it was high at 75 percent I think, and it has now come back to 20 percent on a cap of four.  The 
<br/>problem was, prior it was $18 million, so it was too generous. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously,  from  my  overall  standpoint,  it  is  probably  not  as  attractive  as  to  honourable 
<br/>Koya’s point, even though it is not as attractive as it was before, but there is a lot of still interest in 
<br/>Fiji because it is a very viable location for films.  For us, we want to just manage and see how this 
<br/>$200 million noose around our neck and then try and build the industry with the opportunities that is 
<br/>there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- In a nutshell, you really lowered the rebates going out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Now, we will go to a motion by honourable Koya.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I move a motion on Head 34: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That it be increased by $300,000 in Programme 2-1(7) with respect to the Ministerial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade Delegations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You may elaborate on your motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Sir,  if  I  may  elaborate  a  little  bit,  I  do  understand  how  critical  a 
<br/>component as this and how important it is that our Minister for Trade be present at and be a part of 
<br/></span><span>quite a number of things that are on Fiji’s plate. I think it is important that everyone understands that 
<br/></span><span>he has IPAC to deal with, WTO to deal with, he has UNTAC,  he has the regional agreements to deal 
<br/>with, he has the EU to deal with and Fiji, Mr. Chairman,  has a front seat at all of these obligations 
<br/>that we have and it puts us in front with respect to literally everything around the world, one of the 
<br/>most important places being WTO.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bearing that in mind, Sir, I think the Ministerial presence is actually required here, he should 
<br/>probably be one the most travelled Ministers at the moment because of the status that we have around 
<br/>the  world.  I  am  sure  the  honourable  Minister  will  not  argue  with  me  but  I  am  not  sure  if  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister for Finance will agree with that, but that is the reason for it, Sir.  It is not all just 
<br/></span><span>the Minister, it is the very important team that needs to be with him at all times, Sir, because of the 
<br/>additional things that need to be attended to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  the  motion  on  Head  34  as  submitted  by 
<br/>honourable Koya is proposed to be increased from $100,000 to $300,000 that is for Programme 2-
<br/>1(7).

<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  We  have  another  motion  here  by  honourable  Ketan  Lal.    You  may 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduce your motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Head 34-2-1(8) - Standardised Roadside Stalls be increased by another $400,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  was  something  successful  under  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government and thank you for continuing the initiative. The roadside stalls if you go to Nadi and 
<br/>along King’s Highway, you see our citizens are using this to their best level. I think we need to further 
<br/>install or construct  some along  the Vanua Levu Hibiscus Highway from  Savusavu to  Labasa and 
<br/>maybe some in Taveuni as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Now, I will put it to the vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  I  have  a  motion  here  by  honourable  Premila 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kumar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 34-3-1(7) be increased by $500,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You may elaborate on your motion, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, this $500,000 that I am requesting, if that money could 
<br/></span><span>be given to trading standards.  Currently, the amount allocated for trading standards is only $100,000 
<br/>so by giving extra $500,000 will be strengthening standards development in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  for  Fiji,  we  are  focusing  on  standards,  particularly  looking  at  our  export 
<br/>markets  but  not  imports  that  we  are  making  into  to  the  country.  There  is  a  dire  need  to  develop 
<br/>standards for all other products that are entering Fiji so that our consumers are protected and we get 
<br/>value for money.  So, it is for that reason I am proposing an increase by $500,000. Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Chairman., 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I intend to put this motion to vote.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Head  34  be  increased  by  $300,000  in  Programme  6-1(10)  with  respect  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Export Strategy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, you may elaborate on your motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, this particular component of the Ministry is very, very 
<br/>important because it has offered a lot of assistance to our small time exporters.  They apply for this 
<br/>particular grant sometimes to obtain a freezer truck or freezing machine or whatever it is that they 
<br/>actually require to get their exports done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of the fact that we need to be diversifying and getting more exports out.  I think this 
<br/>particular provision, although I agree with the fact that it has been doubled from the last Budget, I 
<br/>still think that it probably needs a little bit more because we will get a whole lot more people wanting 
<br/>to get more exports out and we will require assistance in terms of getting that particular machinery 
<br/>that they require.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  had  examples  of  people  that  are  even  manufacturing  doors  here  and  sent  out 
<br/>offshore.  In fact, I also recall that a particular member of a political party on the other side whom 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  knows  quite  well  who  was  also  a  recipient  of  this  particular 
<br/>National Export Strategy Grant. So, it is a very important component, Sir, I think that extra dollars 
<br/>into that particular provision would help. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Head  34-6-1(10)  -  Young  Entrepreneurship  Scheme  ($100,000)  be  increased  to 
<br/></span><span>$500,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You may elaborate on your motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  a  very  successful  scheme  was  developed  by  the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government.  During COVID-19, we have learnt a lot, our young people opened their own 
<br/></span><span>businesses and I think we need to support them.  Such entrepreneur scheme with the support from 
<br/></span><span>the Government will continue to harness that calibre of becoming better business people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, that is the motion on the floor, thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will vote on the the motion.

<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,    on  Programme  6-1(10)  -  Trade  Enhancement 
<br/>Programme ($300,000), I request the honourable Minister to illuminate us on this allocation as  to 
<br/>what this exactly entails. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, this is one of the five programmes that we 
<br/>are running at the moment which we have inherited from the previous Government.  This one is a bit 
<br/>more targeted and it is a maximum assistance of $500 and essentially looking at microbusinesses.  
<br/>The rest are, sort of, a bit more bigger-sized businesses.  It is very good for any micro-enterprise such 
<br/>as sewing, creative arts, floriculture - those kind of businesses.  It is quite a helpful programme and 
<br/>as I have said, it targets those who are just aspiring to start up a small business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, it is a full grant. Apology, Mr. Chairman, most of the other programmes is actually a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>one-third two-thirds contribution. This one is just an outright grant and is monitored as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, can the  honourable Minister explain the last item on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme 10-1(7) - Fijian Vaccine Pass System ($50,000)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  programme  was  something  that 
<br/>happened during COVID-19.  At one stage, if you all recall, there was an intent to actually introduce 
<br/>COVID Passport.  That project has since been decommissioned.  There was some equipment that we 
<br/>are still storing and that $50,000 is just to actually try and keep all the equipment together safely, 
<br/>while we redeploy them to other Ministries for use.  The actual equipment is a lot more valuable than 
<br/>the $50,000, but we want to make sure that we hand that over to other Ministries and I think some of 
<br/>it will be very useful for the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration, such as scanners, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, just a clarification on Programme 10-1(7) – Ease of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Doing Business, does online search of companies actually fall under this particular SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, I see $9 million allocated for this one, please, do 
<br/>check because people have been complaining that online search is not working for a couple of months 
<br/></span><span>now.  They actually have to come to the office.  Although it is provided online, it is not functional. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, we have had some issues a couple of weeks 
<br/>ago.  Currently, it is fully operational.  Honourable Lal had actually mentioned something as well 
<br/>and I am going to write him a formal response with some of the facts we have, which probably is not 
<br/>aligned with what he is thinking.  That is alright, but be assured that we are trying to also introduce 
<br/>some escalation procedures because it is very important for users when there is an issue with the 
<br/>system, that a trigger is sent to some of the key people including myself.  That was never happening 
<br/>in the past, so I have introduced that to try and make sure that the service standards are improved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Chairman,  through  you,  thank  you  very  much,  honourable 
<br/>Minister, and because $9 million is allocated, may be a Ministerial Statement in the next sitting would 
<br/>be good to actually elaborate what all is going to be covered under this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, we are happy to do that, no problem.

<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  10-2(7)  –  Cyber  Emergency  Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Team Plan and Cyber Security ($180,000).  Can the honourable Minister elaborate on this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Cyber  Security  Response  is  a  very 
<br/>fundamental part of the monitoring over cyber security.  Under the Budapest Convention, having this 
<br/>emergency response team is actually very important.  So, the money is set aside to actually make 
<br/>sure we resource that up well and have it in place as soon as possible, given the lot of threats that we 
<br/>are experiencing at the moment round the globe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, Fiji Police has got a Cyber Security Unit.  Is there a 
<br/>thought of shifting this to them or are you going to have the dual responsibility of cyber security 
<br/>because in our sub-committee, there is that recommendation from them that this be shifted across to 
<br/>them.  Is that a thought or is it going to remain as the two?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-That is certainly an active discussion with the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Home Affairs and myself.  At the moment, legally, it sits under Communications, that 
<br/>is why we have put the money in.  Ultimately, we will do what is right for the country, so whether it 
<br/>sits  with  us  or  with  the  Minister  for  Home  Affairs,  that  will  be  discussed  in  Cabinet.    In  certain 
<br/>countries they have their cyber security shift to the Ministry of Communications, some have them sit 
<br/>in one of the Disciplined Forces but we will sort that out once we wrap it altogether. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 34 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 35 – Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just want to ask the honourable Minister on 
<br/>Programme 1-1(7) – Manual Harvesting Support which is designated here for $1 million.  I just want 
<br/>to ask the honourable Minister, is this manual harvesting support being injected here because of his 
<br/>intentions to withdraw machinery assistance, like cane harvesters from the industry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, this grant is being specifically for the cane farmers who 
<br/></span><span>have cane on the hilly land.  We want to support them with the manual labour so the additional grant 
<br/></span><span>will be given to cane cutters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, during his response, the honourable Minister said that … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Which SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  can you keep quiet, let me speak, please.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He said that they will increase the cane payment to $90, so now I am coming to the point.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just want to know where is that allocation in this programme?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, in fact, if you see there is an allocation of $1 million in 
<br/>SEG 10.  The idea is this, we have quota incentives for the farmers that $85 is a guaranteed price.  If 
<br/>a farmer supplies green  cane to  the mill, he gets another $5 per tonne extra.  The idea is  to  give 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1509 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>incentives to cane farmers to supply green cane.  We have a big problem in the industry with burnt 
<br/>cane and quality of sugar does not come right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other incentive is that, if a farmer has produced 500 tonnes of cane in the last season, and 
<br/>if he produces another 250 tonnes, that we give him $5 extra on the 250 tonne in that year.  So, it 
<br/>tops up to $90.  We want to get the farmers to work hard as well, we do not want them to just simply 
<br/>give them $90.  I will tell you another problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What has happened, the farmers had discussed with me.  If we raise the price to $90 or $95, 
<br/>then the cane cutters will demand more money.  They will expect more money as well, then the cane 
<br/>lorry operators will be demanding more money.  So, whilst we agree on $85 there as guaranteed, we 
<br/>will  be  giving  them  $5  on  burnt  cane  and  $5  additional  for  planting  of  cane,  which  will  then  be 
<br/>separate like a bonus.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-    Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Head  35-1-1(10)  –  New  Farmers  and  Lease 
<br/>Premium Assistance ($2,000,000). To the Minister, we all understand that sugar was Fiji’s backbone 
<br/>decades ago, and we all know the reasons why the industries is what it is today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- So, there is a generation gap that exists whether it is agriculture or 
<br/>sugar.    So,  under  this  New  Farmers  and  Lease  Premium  Assistance,  and  looking  at  how  our 
<br/>generation  does  not  really  want  to  get  into  sugarcane  farming,  honourable  Minister,  if  you  can 
<br/>highlight  on  any  initiatives  or  strategies.    First,  please,  clarify  this  the  New  Farmers  and  Lease 
<br/>Assistance  Programme  and  if  there  are  new  strategies  to  get  the  young  generation  for  sugarcane 
<br/>cultivation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Again, there are a lot of farmers who are interested to come back to the 
<br/>farm but their problem is finance, of paying the premium or the lease. So, this allocation that we have 
<br/>done that there will be a 50:50.  If it is a $20,000 premium, our Ministry will pay $10,000 and the 
<br/>balance of $10,000 to be paid by the farmer in a five-year period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just as I mentioned, like Ratu Josaia, who is interested to do farming and he has got a big 
<br/>piece  of  land  in  Ra.    Now,  obviously  he  needs  financial  assistance  there  so  we  will  be  targeting 
<br/>farmers who are genuinely interested. There are some farmers who are hobby farmers. So, we will 
<br/>try to give incentives to the farmers who are generally interested and we will assist them through this 
<br/></span><span>scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Head 35-1-1(5) - National Training Productivity 
<br/>Centre Levy ($5,229), I just want a clarification, is this levy only for the Ministry staff because certain 
<br/>amount of it is also going to ACCF, or this levy also covers the farmers and the canecutters? I believe 
<br/>farmers do not  pay levies on behalf of the canecutters and ACCF is  doing a wonderful  job,  so if 
<br/>farmers and canecutters can be covered through such levies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this is a legislated expense calculated on 1 percent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gross salary of the staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  So,  any  accidents  happening  in  the  farm  with  regards  to  either 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farmers or the canecutters, they can claim ACCF?

<br/>Scheme has been allocated $500,000.  Something I would like to add on before I ask the honourable 
<br/>Minister, personally, I came back to Fiji after studying on a scholarship and through a government 
<br/>grant assistance, I was able to start up my farm. So, I know the value and importance of what these 
<br/>grants hold.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  a  clarification  from  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  of  how  gender  inclusive  this 
<br/>programme  is  and  what  are  the  partnerships  with  other  Ministries,  like  Ministry  of  Women  (the 
<br/>Minister has spoken about), Ministry of Agriculture, et cetera?  If you could, please, highlight more 
<br/>on the gender inclusion and more of what the focus of the Sugar Individual, Small Grants Scheme is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Are you talking about the Sugar Individual Small Grants Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes, $500,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.-This is a new allocation, honourable Member. The programme has been 
<br/>re-introduced with an allocation of $500,000 which aims to enhance support to farmers by way of 
<br/>livelihood support that will assist the farmers to diversify and not to live only on sugarcane income.  
<br/>This will assist farmers with the following issues:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stray animals, the Government will provide fencing materials; and 
<br/>irrigation  issues, farmers will be supplied with  water-pumps to ensure their farms are 
<br/>irrigated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from this, other livelihood options will be looked into so that farmers do not rely on 
<br/>sugar.  The Ministry will also help and support farmers diversify into other areas where they can earn 
<br/>additional income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I just want to add on to that, yes, diversification 
<br/>is very important because you cannot just rely on one crop. So, is this just for those who are already 
<br/>sugarcane farmers?  Do you need to own a sugarcane farm, own the lease to qualify for this or a new 
<br/>person who is interested in farming?  The reason is because I have had many cases after people saw 
<br/>that I am a farmer, they like say, “we need to be farmers in order to access this grant. We need to 
<br/></span><span>own land to access this grant.” So, if someone who has interest in farming but does not own land and 
<br/></span><span>has not planted sugarcane before, do they qualify for such grants? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I think we are currently concentrating in the sugar 
<br/>industry. My idea is to increase the yield.  Now, as far as the other support, I think the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Agriculture might be able to help on that side but here, the farmer must have a sugarcane 
<br/>farm to qualify for this grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I just want to ask a question because I see it is not included in 
<br/>Programme 1-1,  this is concerning railway lines. The honourable Minister is well aware of this - the 
<br/>need for the upgrade of railway lines, particularly there are 56 kilometres from Nubu to Labasa Mill 
<br/>and, of course, the areas in Batinakama, Vunimoli, Waiqele, Wailevu and Tabia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am told that the honourable Minister of Finance is also aware of this request from farmers 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1511 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because  cartage  is  important  and,  of  course,  minimising  the  cost  as  well  for  the  farmers,  their 
<br/>preference is railway system. It is not there. What assurance can you give the farmers, honourable 
<br/>Minister?  When are you going to do this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Thank you, honourable Member, you are a cane farmer, I understand 
<br/>your plight, however,  there was a study done for the railway system to be basically upgraded.  I think 
<br/>that was done I think about four years or five years back and now that we have come in, we are going 
<br/>to use the same company to give us a new quotation and prices as to what the cost of the upgrade.  
<br/>Once that is finalised, then of course we will come to the Minister for Finance for funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is actually a major issue within the sugar industry because 
<br/>in the last so many years, basically no investment has been made and, in fact, the incentives provided 
<br/>to farmers, lorry drivers and others, actually moved away from rail but now it is very clear that the 
<br/>farmers realise that the best and cost effective means of transporting cane was rail.  I think it would 
<br/>require a huge investment.  We have had good discussions with the honourable Minister for Sugar, 
<br/>the stakeholders and once the study is completed, we would have an idea of the true cost and see how 
<br/>we can start in certain areas where the cost is a major factor to ease that. So, that is what will have to 
<br/>be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just to add on, there is also a problem of railway in 
<br/>Sigatoka.  So, we are looking at that side as well but if you see in the allocation, we have got cage 
<br/>bins, which means that we are serious to go back on rail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- No, Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is unfair probably to the others, but I am 
<br/>asking Vanualevu specifically because I am told that you, the Minister and the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister are from Vanua Levu, so there is a lot of expectation on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- No problem, no one will be left behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(7),  I can see there is an allocation of 
<br/>Sugar Cane Growers Council Election.  Is there any timeframe for this and under which electoral 
<br/>system we are going to hold this Council Election? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Cabinet  paper  will  be  submitted  next  week.    Of 
<br/>course, we have been discussing with the growers as well.  Previously, there used to be 35 to 40 
<br/>Councillors.  Just to get the cost down, we will still maintain eight Councillors - one per district and 
<br/></span><span>the election will be just like what used to happen before.  Growers can stand if they qualify, if they 
<br/></span><span>have their cane contract with them and whoever gets the highest vote ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Motion by honourable Pillay.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Chairman, through you on Programme 1- 1(10) - Fertilizer Subsidy, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is $20 million allocated and last year the Fertilizer Subsidy was $25,340, 847.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move a motion that the amount should be increased by $5,340,847. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Chairman, as we all know that fertilizer is very costly and the cost 
<br/>of production, harvesting and cartages have all gone up.  As the honourable Minister for Sugar has 
<br/>alluded, they do not want to pay at one time, so that the harvesting cost will go up, but it has already 
<br/>gone up from $20 a tonne to $25 a tonne, $30 a tonne; the cartage rate has gone up.  The machinery

<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I move that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Head 35-1-1(10) - Sugar Cane Development and Farmers Assistance be increase by another 
<br/>$1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, thank you honourable Minister for Multi-
<br/>Ethnic Affairs and Sugar.  You elaborated very well today, thank you very much, but I think we need 
<br/>to  continue  supporting  more  for  our  farmers  and  that  is  why  I  requested  for  another  $1  million 
<br/>increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  seeking  clarification  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister.  Anything to do with health and hygiene, I will be keeping my finger on it.  This is to do 
<br/>with Head 35-1-1( 4) - Sanitary Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier this morning, I moved that there be an increase of this particular service in the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Health.  It is a big Ministry, mainly dominated with quite a big number of females.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here in the Ministry of Sugar, they hold a budgetary allocation which is almost half of what 
<br/>was accepted for the Ministry of Health.  Just a clarification from the honourable Minister on the 
<br/>correlation of this figure and maybe, help the honourable Minister of Finance in improvement later 
<br/>on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, this sanitary service allocation is the same with last year 
<br/></span><span>and basically it is about allocation of fees and charges paid to Rentokil to ensure personal hygiene in 
<br/></span><span>the office is maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question.  The Sugar Industry 
<br/>dominates mainly male and I would like to seek clarification, again, from the honourable Minister 
<br/>not to rely on old figures, but be realistic in your budgeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Noted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Chairman, I would just like to correct the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>of Finance when he said “ that no investment has been made”.  I would like to remind him that the 
<br/>former  Prime  Minister  and  the  former  Minister  for  Sugar,  Josaia  Voreqe  Bainimarama,  kept  this 
<br/>industry alive and through the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- …At a loss, big loss, look at the loss, come on man…

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I was talking about railway, you did not get it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You said ‘no investment’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Before the motion, can I ask a question to the honourable Minister?  It is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>related to the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You love doing this, fires the question and then another supplementary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question and then the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You take all the chances that is available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Can  the  honourable  Minister  explain  or  provide  clarification  for 
<br/>Programme 2-1(4) - Security Services ($70,000).  I understand that this is a new Ministry (Multi-
<br/>Ethnic Affairs) but  we are allocating $70,000 directly as  a start  off.   What  is  the purpose of that 
<br/>allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, the allocation of Security Services at the Bali Towers, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the office that we occupy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- So $70,000 in a whole year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Yes. It is a big building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Just a follow-up question, so the honourable Minister for Sugar and Multi-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ethnic does not have the separate office? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- No, no, it is in the same building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my motion, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Maharaj, may you introduce your motion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That we decrease the Ministry’s Budget by $2,150,200. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Why? Come on, think of the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Hold on, I will explain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, the rationale behind asking for the removal of the full budget for the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Multi-Ethnic Affairs is that, if we actually look at SEGs 1 to 8, 50 percent is Operational and 50 
<br/>percent is on R.  The two values that are sitting under R is Language, Culture and Arts which is also 
<br/>with Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, and the other one is Preparatory Works for Gas Crematorium that 
<br/>can be conducted by CIU which is based at PSC.

<div><span>Cost ...

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Who is providing the motion? We have written records here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Having said that, Sir, if these two Programmes can be carried out 
<br/>by other Departments, why are we actually wasting taxpayers’ money of $1 million just to pay for 
<br/>the staff and Operational Cost?  Maybe we can actually save this money, do some better preparation, 
<br/>do some strategies and perhaps, also develop the mission and vision of the Ministry itself and later 
<br/>on maybe next year, you can actually come up with this Ministry. At the moment, as we see it, Mr. 
<br/>Chairman, this is a waste of money.  That is why we are asking to remove this Ministry completely.  
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, honourable Maharaj has filed this motion to do 
<br/>away with Head 35 and they want to take away all that is under Programme 2-1 to the amount of 
<br/>$2,150,200.  This is to do with the operation of the whole Ministry. I will put it to the vote, honourable 
<br/>Members, this is to do with Head 35 to be decreased or totally taken away that is Programme 2-1-1 
<br/>to 8, it is to do with the whole Multi-Ethnic Affairs operation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.

<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, just seeking clarification from the honourable Minister on 
<br/>Sanitary Services of $4,000.  For only one Minister, that Sanitary Services allocation of $4,000 that 
<br/>is too much.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, we have staff there who also use the washroom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, just a follow-up question.  On the Ministry of Sugar, we also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have the allocation on Sanitary Services there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- No, there are two levels of office.  So, there are staff on both levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- My apologies, I thought the $4,000 was only for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-Honourable Members, you have engaged in the running commentary and 
<br/>I am sitting and listening to you both exchanging ideas of the worth of sanitary that is worthy for one 
<br/></span><span>or for 10 and the worth of it is $4,000 plus dollars.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, again, the day has been quite long and I understand how tired you are 
<br/>but, please, let us keep the discussion at the senile level, otherwise we will drift away with the way 
<br/>we have just finished with your exchanges.  Let us keep it at that, honourable Members.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-1(7) -  Language, Culture and Arts, if 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Minister can provide some update in terms of how this money will be utilised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, this new allocation with a budget of $500,000, this will 
<br/>help  preserve and protect our traditional practices, customs, language and artistic expressions that 
<br/>are passed down from one generation to another.  It ensures that the culture, tradition and identity are 
<br/>safeguarded and valued, contributing to the richness or the diversity of our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Chairman,  just  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister, I mean, I had raised the same topic earlier and I was told by the honourable Minister  of 
<br/>Finance that in this financial year, they were going back to the drawing board, they are going to plan 
<br/>what  Ministry will actually  do. Based on all that, the Multi-Cultural  Centre from  iTaukei  Affairs 
<br/>probably will move to Ministry of Multi-Ethnic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My concern is, when we just very broadly say that this money will be used to preserve culture, 
<br/>I am sure before you come to the drawing board with a $500,000 billed to the Minister of Finance 
<br/>that this is what I want so I will be using it, there must have been some work done in the office to 
<br/>say which ethnic group you  are looking at, what is the focus that you have at the moment, considering 
<br/>that you are also having multi-cultural centres.  So how do you intend to do that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Before the honourable Minister replies, I would like to contribute as well 
<br/>to this very important topic and this is not new.  It has already been undertaken by the Ministry of 
<br/>Fijian  Affairs  and  I  was  even  working  with  the  Ministry.  We  had  one  of  your  former  the  late 
<br/>Bainivalu,  who studied in  India used to  be with  FijiFirst,  he used to  take classes for us about  30 
<br/>officers from the NLTB to go and do training in Hindi - the basic Hindi, how you converse with the 
<br/>Indian farmers, not so much using the Fijian-Hindi.  It is the basic Hindi which he learnt and was 
<br/>qualified in India. That is the very thing, I hope, you are trying to revive again here. But they will 
<br/>need someone like that to be undertaking that and the training was done at the Natabua Teachers 
<br/>College.  We spent  every week day there, just to  learn the basic Hindi,  especially  conversational 
<br/>Hindi. The one that has respect in it. When you say “up” – </span><span>konchi hai</span><span> .  I will give the floor to the 
<br/>honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, under Multi-Ethnic comes Solomons, Banabans, Kioans, 
<br/>Indians, apart from iTaukei. So, obviously, we would like to interact with them and promote their 
<br/>culture as well and that is the allocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 35. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 35 agreed to  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now as it is almost 6.00 p.m.  We are kind 
<br/>of drifting away as well in the exchanges that I have been hearing, but I hope you will bear with it 
<br/>honourable Members. This is one time but just to have to do our sacrifice for our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will now adjourn Parliament and we will resume after one hour. Dinner will be served in

<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, just one clarification on Programme 1-2.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have gone past that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, just the clarification from the honourable Minister.  
<br/>I will not be moving any motion, it is just the clarification.  This is with regards to the dump site at 
<br/>Sigatoka,  which  is  sitting  at  a  proposed  heritage  site.    If  there  is  any  programme  or  proposal  to 
<br/>actually move that site from the proposed heritage site, because it is affecting the sand dunes, and if 
<br/>there is any proposal to move it to some other ground? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, Sigatoka Rubbish Dump is also one 
<br/>of the dumping sites that we are trying to relocate.  That is something that we are seriously looking 
<br/>into.  There had been discussions on the issue.  I just want to inform the honourable Member that 
<br/>discussions are ongoing and, hopefully, we will relocate that in future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 37 agreed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 38- Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, query to the honourable Minister.  In comparison to the 
<br/>Department of Tourism budget last year, if you take out the $30 million Marketing Grant for Tourism 
<br/>Fiji and the Operating Grant of $7 million, you will be left with about $7 million with respect to the 
<br/>running of the Ministry of Tourism, as opposed to it being run on a $520,000 budget previously last 
<br/>year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a very rudimentary way of doing it, I know, but in rough, that is the guidance that we 
<br/>actually get in the figures that you have given.  If you take that $37 million out from the $44 million 
<br/>that has been given to tourism, that leaves you with about $7 million to take care of all the tourism 
<br/></span><span>activities that are being undertaken.  As opposed to $520,000, which was to take care of all tourism 
<br/></span><span>activities as a Tourism Department within the MCTTT on the last budget.  Can you explain the big 
<br/>difference in it?  What are we looking forward to in terms of the extra budgetary requirement that 
<br/>has been given? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, this is totally starting almost from scratch to resource 
<br/>the  Ministry.    We  are  rebuilding,  we  know  that  we  wanted  that  more,  but  with  pressure  on  the 
<br/>finances, we are happy to start off this way.  We are comfortable with what we have in the allocations 
<br/>here,  honourable  Member.    Of  course,  you  combine  it  now  with  Civil  Aviation  budget,  they  are 
<br/></span><span>both…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I have not included that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, I hear what you are saying, but we are alright with what we 
<br/>have here.  For instance, we inherited about 10 staff members, we are now up to 15.  Ideally, we 
<br/>would like to have more than 30 staff in there, but with the way we are budgeting and with the tight

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financials that we have, we are  okay with this for this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, might I understand that $6.5 million is being utilised for 
<br/>extra staff?  Are there any other extra activities being undertaken by the Ministry in comparison to 
<br/>last year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- No, not really.  The main one that we have is the Vanua Levu project 
<br/>where we get $5 million to set up the Vanua Levu Project Phase 1.  That would be the main item for 
<br/>us for the next 12 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Chairman,  once  again,  the  same  question  in  comparison  to  last  year’s  budget,  the 
<br/>Department of Civil Aviation then, there is a surplus of about $900,000, if you take out the Operating 
<br/>Grant for Civil Aviation and the Domestic Air Services Subsidy, you are getting of $900,000 or more.  
<br/>Again, same question, what are the extra activities being undertaken or is it for new staff, or more 
<br/>staff? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Civil Aviation needs about 75 staff members and there sitting were 
<br/>about 50, so we have to recruit about 20 odd new staff.  As you know it is part of ICAO rating every 
<br/>year  that  we  must  be  fully  staffed.    The  allocation  is  there  now  to  hire  and  make  up  to  the  full 
<br/>complement of the Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-1(6) – Domestic Air Services Subsidy 
<br/>of $1.9 million,  I would just like to get clarification, mostly this is for maritime zones.  One of the 
<br/>scenarios that mostly people from the North face, if there is a death in the family and the last moment 
<br/>booking with Fiji Link, we all know how much do we actually have to pay.  So, in such a scenario 
<br/>when there is a death in the family, provided if some kind of evidence is provided, if it is an immediate 
<br/>family  or  the  first  cousin,  if  there  can  be  any  subsidy  provided  in  near  future?    If  that  can  be 
<br/>considered?  It is both from Suva to Labasa and Labasa to Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Are you suggesting a special charter for someone? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Not  a  special  charter.  For  example,  my  father  passes  away  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labasa and the funeral is tomorrow, the last moment booking is mostly $300 to $400 one way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- To subsidise the airfare on Fiji Link? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, depending on the situation, especially if there is a death in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We can put that across on compassionate grounds, but right now, 
<br/>this subsidy is for Cicia, Kadavu, Koro, Lakeba, Rotuma, Vanuabalavu and Gau.  We will also be 
<br/>adding  Ono-i-Lau  over  the  next  year.    But  I  hear  what  you  are  saying,  the  subsidy  to  apply  on 
<br/>emergencies and compassionate grounds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister.  This is a general question to both of his portfolios.  I just looked that he has got tourism 
<br/>grant.  It there any possibility that the grant be given to the Fiji Sevens Team under that grant because 
<br/>they do quite a lot of marketing for Fiji when they go out and play around the arena in the international 
<br/>sevens rugby. It is just a suggestion 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, quite a number of suggestions have been made 
<br/>to us in that area but if you notice, they wear the Fiji Airways Number on their chest. That is already 
<br/>a tourism related name and indeed most of our marketing, quite a bit of marketing relies on the input 
<br/>from Fiji Airways.  The answer right now is no, because we need to recover where we left off during 
<br/>COVID-19. We know during COVID-19 we went down to $22 million, we brought it back to $30 
<br/>million  from  marketing  because  we  are  now  going  into  China,  Japan  and  Korea  and  we  are  also 
<br/>looking at three points in USA - Seattle, Dallas and Chicago.  So, unfortunately, we cannot do that 
<br/>right now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 38 - Ministry of Tourism and Civil 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 38 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 40 - Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just a clarification in relation to Programme 2-2(9) 
<br/>- Upgrade of Radar at Nausori.  Given that we are close to the cyclone season, would it be safe to say 
<br/>honourable Minister that by the time we get to the cyclone season that all three radars will be fully 
<br/>functional; Labasa, Nadi and hopefully the one at Nausori after this $2.36 million upgrade? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- On the upgrade of the radar in Nausori, we have allocated $2.3 
<br/>million, it is a rollover project and in terms of the timing we should significantly progress that this 
<br/>year but I can get back to you on the completion of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hopefully it will be ready before the cyclone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  2-2(4)  -  Maintenance  of 
<br/>Hydrological Equipment. It is important, Mr. Chairman, Sir, but question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>is,  what  plans  that  are  there  in  the  Department  of  Meteorological  Services  and  of  course  in  the 
<br/>Ministry about further extending this programme particularly how it links up to our Disaster Risk 
<br/>Reduction Policy and the Sendai Framework because early warning systems are so important.  Let 
<br/>us not only concentrate on maintenance but we need to install more. So, my question is, what are the 
<br/>plans in the Ministry to address this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Thank  you  honourable  Member,  yes  that  is  an  important 
<br/>question in terms of maintenance of meteorological equipment. At the moment that is what that is 
<br/>there for maintenance, but we are also engaging with development partners in terms of enhancing 
<br/>and as you have mentioned, to further improve on the equipment and bringing it up to-date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  Programme  2-3(9)  -  Supply  and  Installation  of 
<br/>Water Level and Rainfall Equipment, once again related to that hydrological question.   I think as we 
<br/>all come to realise the biggest problem in this country is floods and the importance of having all these 
<br/></span><span>equipment up and running at locations and also to make sure that they are also sending information.  
<br/></span><span>Sometimes we put them up because sometimes we put them up and then they do not send information 
<br/>and people have to go there and physically check. So, I am just wondering in terms of all that you 
<br/>plan to have in place before we get around to cyclone season, with this investment, will they all be 
<br/>in place, and will they all be sending information to Centre (Nadi) so that the information can be 
<br/>quickly collated and analysed.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1519 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In terms of that particular SEG, that involves the location in 
<br/>various sites, in terms of water level and rainfall stations and the 273 there is basically to maintain 
<br/>those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Maintenance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So no new ones, just maintenance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, still on Activity 3 on Weather Forecasting.  I just want 
<br/>to make a general comment here, honourable Minister.  You do not have to look at your book, it is 
<br/>the translation from the very technical weather forecast that comes from Nadi and then changing it 
<br/>into layman’s language that goes out to the public. It is one area that is not handled properly is the 
<br/>translation of the technical weather forecast that comes from Nadi.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some people understand the technical jargon that comes but when it is sent out to the people, 
<br/>it has to be interpreted into the vernacular.  I have listened to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> translation, and given that 
<br/>I can understand the technical information, the translation is so bad.  It is an area that I think that we 
<br/>can improve on.  I am not too sure whether you do it from Nadi or you leave it to whoever is on duty 
<br/>at the radio station to come and do the translation then go out.  It is important because those are the 
<br/>people  that  need  it  most.    I  hear  it  all  the  time  because  I  can  translate  that  technical  weather 
<br/>information, when it goes down to the people, even the directions are all wrong. It is just that concern, 
<br/>I think it is an area we can all do well with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you honourable Naupoto, we will take that on board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just on the question by honourable Usamate.  Let me just clarify on the issue of Supply and 
<br/>Installation of Water Level and Rainfall Equipment, that is under “R”.  Some of them will be purchase 
<br/>of  equipment  and  other  associated  costs  for  installation  of  water  level  and  rainfall  equipment  at 
<br/>Saliadrau, Wainimakutu, Namoli, Nadrala, Nakoro and Sigatoka Catchment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>   HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just one final question.  I have looked at the 
<br/>previous programme and Activity 2 and looking at Programme 2-3 as well. Some of these stations 
<br/>are  located  in  agriculture  estates  throughout  Fiji  because  agriculture  is  a  big  user  of  the 
<br/>meteorological data as well. I am just interested in who is responsible for its maintenance, whether 
<br/></span><span>its Meteorological Service or the Ministry of Agriculture.  I do not see it here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The ones which we have here in our list are the ones which 
<br/>Meteorological Service is responsible for.  You are correct, we have a list and we can provide that 
<br/>too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Sir, just an addition to what I said. I just want to give you an example.  
<br/>Now if it comes from Nadi that there is a low pressure. You will hear on the radio they will say, “</span><span>e 
<br/>dua na uwa ni draki malumalumu</span><span>.” When you say, “</span><span>e dua na uwa ni draki malumalumu”</span><span> they think 
<br/></span><span>nothing about it, but really </span><span>ya na uwa ni draki ca.  </span><span>That is worse.  It is low pressure.   But because 
<br/></span><span>the word “low” pressure then </span><span>draki ni uwa malumalumu</span><span>, okay nothing to worry about, but that is bad 
<br/>weather. </span><span>Ya na uwa ni draki ca</span><span>.  Just to give you an example. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I will note that and liaise closely with the Ministry of </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>Affairs on the proper expression in the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>language rather than like expression. We hear on the

<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 3-2(7) - Establishment the Public Works 
<br/>Department. Sir, this is a decision that has been made by Government and we notice the reasons for 
<br/>it that are outlined on Page 263.  Maybe two to three things that I would like to know, Sir. What 
<br/>exactly will be this $5 million used for? What will be achieved say by the end of the year or by the 
<br/>mid of next year out of this or will this also include outsourcing for the purchase and use of materials?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, Programme 3-2(7) on the Establishment of Public Works 
<br/>Department. For that SEG, we are looking at through the Programme to re-establish PWD, that is, 
<br/>the purchasing of plants and equipment including graders, excavators, trucks and bulldozers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, there will also be staff which will be included in that. I know that they 
<br/>have been concern about duplication. The PWD as it is, we are now consulting closely with FRA to 
<br/>complement each other.  Where there are gaps, we will come in, mainly in the rural roads where 
<br/>some areas have been neglected, not only there but also in some of the access roads and roads in 
<br/>some of the institutions. Basically, areas which have been classified or known as non-FRA roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Supplementary question, roads is covered under Roads,  Agriculture, 
<br/>Rural  and  Maritime  Development.  When  everything  was  under  FRA,  FRA  was  like  the  central 
<br/>repository of everything to do with roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am not talking to you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this central repository and looking at the overall road asset of Fiji now be within the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry, are you going to develop that or is PWD purely operational? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In terms of strategic infrastructure policy, that is what we are 
<br/>looking into as a Ministry from the policy side, but in terms of cascading down to the operational 
<br/>level, that is what I am explaining. The FRA have their own (I suppose) portfolio which they are 
<br/>currently looking at which we can look at after this and the PWD has its own.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment it is in transition.  As s I had already explained, FRA is at the moment also 
<br/></span><span>being  audited both  technical  and financial.  In that transition  we will identify and also  look  at the 
<br/></span><span>strategic planning on what exactly we need to cover. That will be completed in the next two months 
<br/>and realigning it to the core role and then from there, it will be clear towards the end of this financial 
<br/>year what the new setup will look like.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Definitely, there would not be any duplication. We are looking also at the processes within, 
<br/>in terms of the contracting, monitoring and all that so that what happened in the past does not happen 
<br/>again. Also, we try to cover all our financial liabilities, get over that stage then we move forward in 
<br/>terms of not only formulating the new strategic infrastructure or road plan and cascading that down 
<br/></span><span>to the strategic plan and dividing it that way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chair, this is to help honourable Tuiwailevu.  On Programme 
<br/>3-3(9) - Purchase of Equipment for New Power House at Nabouwalu Government Station.  Seeking 
<br/>clarification from the honourable Minister on this project whether it is to complement the current 
<br/>powerplant or expansion of power supply for the township of Bua.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Purchase of Equipment for New Power House at Nabouwalu. 
<br/>This is to cater for the purchase of new equipment including the RGS Control Board, covering labour 
<br/>materials and also the new 500 kVA transformer.  Unfortunately, the generator, as you may know, 
<br/>there was a lightening incident which damaged the generator. So, this will cover for the replacement 
<br/>of that and the equipment to bring back into normal operation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A MAHARAJ.- Mr. Chairman, just a general comment with regards to Programme 
<br/>4-1(10)  -  ,  House  wiring  for  Completed  Grid  Extension  Projects  and  Solar  Home  Systems 
<br/>Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In general, if the honourable Minister can provide us with a listing of how many houses are 
<br/>going to be wired. I do not want to ask this in future heads that we are going to debate on.  So, for 
<br/>grid extension, solar home system programmes, water projects and road projects, the norm during 
<br/>the Budget session that we get the list from the Ministry on how projects are going to be taken in the 
<br/>next financial year. Can the honourable Minister provide us with that listing, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You are querying about  SEG 10 - Grid Extension. So, SEG 
<br/>10 on Housewiring for Completed Grid Extension Projects.  This allocation is to cater for the house 
<br/>wiring and connections of the grid extension projects around the country, a total of 5,572 households 
<br/>will be assisted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, this is just in line to what honourable Maharaj asked.  I 
<br/>am concerned about Programme 4-1(8) - Grid Extension Project of about $4 million. I just wanted to 
<br/>get clarification from the honourable Minister where this grid extension will be conducted?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, this is payment to EFL for the Grid Extension 
<br/>Project,  a  roll  over  payment  from  the  current  financial  year,  111  projects  with  a  total  of  1,539 
<br/>households located in the four divisions.  I have not got the exact locations, but I can provide that 
<br/>later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, just a question to the honourable Minister.  This 
<br/>is on SEG 10, again on the Grid Extension. Honourable Minister, can you just confirm if you have 
<br/>included the Wailevu West (Cakaudrove), all the villages from Natua  right to Valeni in Laucala (I 
<br/>forgot the name of the village) may be the honourable Assistant Minister for Education can help me 
<br/>on that. The issue there is the grid currently goes right up to Uluivalili Secondary School, all the 
<br/>villages down the coast have missed out on this and there are a lot of concern and complaints coming 
<br/></span><span>from them.  So, it just trying to pull the grid down to those villages (I think about four or five of them 
<br/></span><span>down the coast); are they included in this programme, honourable Minister?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I am sorry, I do not have the list number now but I can provide 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I wish to state that I may indeed pleased to see the 
<br/>amount of renewal energy projects that are appearing in the various Heads and Programmes. As I 
<br/>stated in my contribution to the debate, this is a good potential area for investment because it will 
<br/></span><span>bring a lot of savings for us in the long-term and of course good for our commitments to the Paris 
<br/></span><span>Agreement as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  a  quick  question  on  Programme  4-1(7)  -  Local  Funding  –  Climate  Change  Resilient 
<br/>Renewable Energy Development  Project – 1.55 MW Solar Project in Taveuni. If I am correct this is 
<br/>the one in Mua and will it be connected to the main grid as well or is this operating on its own? I am 
<br/>not sure whether this is probably the right programme where I raise this question as well, the progress

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank you, honourable Minister on behalf 
<br/>of the people of Kadavu Koro for the rehabilitation of the Hydro System. Just one question, do you 
<br/>still intend to fix the Hydro at Buca in Vanua Levu?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Which one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is not there, I am just asking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Okay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There is a whole hydro in Buca Village that was done by the Turkish 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but there were plans for rehabilitating that also. Is that still in the pipeline? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, definitely the repairing of some of the old solar projects 
<br/>will be looked into. If you look at SEG 4, there is a maintenance of our Home Solar Systems there 
<br/>of $400,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- This one here is hydro? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sorry, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is an old hydro in Buca, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, we can also look into it.  If you make a motion to increase 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the budget, we will include it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, just another question to the honourable Minister.  
<br/>I forgot to include this to my earlier question.  The grid is, I think it is up to the junction that goes up 
<br/>to Saqani, and the one that goes right down to Naweni.  It has been like that for many years. Is there 
<br/>a plan now to get the grid to Kasavu, and the one that goes up to Nasinu Village and all those villages 
<br/>up the road? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Unfortunately, I do not have the specific details, but I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide it with the ones honourable Maharaj requested.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 10, it is not a question, just a suggestion for 
<br/>the Solar Home Systems Programme if the Ministry can.  See when you put in batteries, when you 
<br/>make batteries, the carbon footprint to make these batteries are extremely high.  Just a suggestion, 
<br/>when  you  look  at  the  batteries,  they  do  have  a  lifetime.  So,  if  the  Ministry  can  also  look  at  the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1523 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recycling and reusing of these batteries and the disposal mechanisms because the last thing we need 
<br/>is  to  implement  solar  which  is  good  but  Fiji  should  not  be  a  dumping  ground  for  these  batteries 
<br/>because it contains a lot of acid and chemicals.  Again, our future generations are going to suffer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It is currently part of the discussions with the private sector 
<br/>and also international development partners regarding the recycling and disposing renewable energy 
<br/>batteries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, that is on Programme 6-1(6) - : Shipping Services 
<br/>Subsidy for the outer islands.  I move a motion if we can increase the allocation. I think there has 
<br/>been a reduction on the allocation, it is going to affect shipping for the maritime zone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Chairman, I move the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- It just the reduction on the Shipping Services Subsidy. This is 
<br/>the Shipping Franchise Programme, I noted a $200,000 reduction on that.  The concern is, it is it 
<br/>going to affect the shipping movement under that programme.  Most of these outer islands depend 
<br/>entirely on this franchise programme. I think even with that small amount, it is going to affect the 
<br/>shipping programme. Most of these islands are only surviving on one shipping service a month. I do 
<br/>not know how will they cope with this.  Maybe some will only be able to make it like one in every 
<br/>two months, but I am not sure about that.  This will affect the people of Lau, Kadavu, Lomaiviti and 
<br/>all those who are depending on the franchise scheme for their shipping services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the motion submitted by honourable Tuinaceva 
<br/>is in regards to Head 40 to be increased by another $300,000 and it is in Programme 6-1(6).  This is 
<br/>to do with Shipping Services Subsidy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 7-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  7-1(5)  –  Apprenticeship  Scheme 
<br/>($50,000). I assume this is for the apprentice on the GSS boats, if I am not mistaken?  But I will also 
<br/>be interested to know that since you are extending PWD, you will have tradesmen there, what do you 
<br/></span><span>think of extending apprenticeship to PWD? It is a good place, I know, for training trades people for 
<br/></span><span>this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You might as well declare your interest as a former Head of TVET. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, he definitely has a long institutional knowledge  
<br/>and also sharing his know-how with me and I acknowledge that.  That is an area as we go through 
<br/>the change management process, an area we would like to strengthen, given also the challenges we 
<br/>are currently facing in the skills gaps in terms of the trade skills, as a lot of our experienced trades 
<br/></span><span>people moved to Australia and New Zealand, we need a new cadre to build up, at least to serve our 
<br/></span><span>nation for the next 10 years.  If they want to move then it is up to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So the Apprenticeship Scheme will be extended.  At the moment with the current budget, we 
<br/>will start on a small scale and as the new structure becomes more certain then we will look into that 
<br/>in terms of long term planning and policy.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Minister Programme 7-1(8) - Construction of  
<br/>Retaining Wall at the Government Wharf - Phase 2 with $2.5 million.  Before I actually get the query, 
<br/>this is the one that is sinking at the front of the office of GSS? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Will this be finished in this financial year, because it says Phase 2? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, the explanation there is the redesign and construction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I am assuming that we should finish it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It says Phase 2 so there are no more phases? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, from what I have seen, that will be the final one, but I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can confirm later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister 
<br/>on Programme 7-1(4).  On that SEG, I understand, as I understand it is to deal with Government 
<br/>Shipping Services.  I just wanted to suggest, if you look at it, there is also Shipping Services Subsidy 
<br/>of about $3,210,000 million, Maintenance and Operation at $1 million, then other headings within 
<br/>that SEG.  I have always wondered why the Government Shipping Services does not follow what the 
<br/>commercial shipping services in Fiji are doing?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There seems to be a disconnection with the design of the vessel that is used by the commercial 
<br/>shipping entity, which they operate under strict commercial conditions to be able to remain viable 
<br/>and the Government seems to differ in the way they purchase vessels, which is basically, if you think 
<br/>of  it,  if  the  commercial  companies  are  running  specific  type  of  vessels,  then  they  have  proven 
<br/>themselves that this is viable. It is a normal commercial activity.  I just thought that the honourable 
<br/>Minister  could  look  at  it.    You  have  shipping  companies  in  Fiji  that  are  operating  commercially 
<br/>viable.   It is just a suggestion, because looking at the expenses and then you have a shipping subsidy 
<br/>again, maybe you should consider that looking into the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We take note of that, but the two are serving different clients.  
<br/>The Government Shipping Services is also serving a lot of the ministries, which they pay the GSS.  I 
<br/>do  not  have  the  figures  for  the  revenue  but,  yes,  it  will  be  interesting  to  look  at  the  revenue  and 
<br/>expenditure and compare it to the commercial operations.  The commercial operations prices also is 
<br/></span><span>on the high side, given, I think there is lack of competition right now given the limited market.  But, 
<br/></span><span>we will look at it and the figures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 40. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 40 agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 41- Water Authority of Fiji    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(0).  We note there is an increase in capital 
<br/>grant  of  about  $7  million,  so  just  a  clarification  from  the  honourable  Minister.    Some  areas  in 
<br/>Sigatoka, with metred water in Barara, and then three kilometres away from Barara is Nadave and 
<br/>Bilalevu,  Nabaka  and  Tuvu  and  there  are  100  households.    Similar  situation  is  in  Natadola  with 
<br/>metered  water,  there  is  a  direct  pipe  from  Cuvu  to  Natadola  InterContinental  Resort(honourable 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Gavoka will know this), and it passes through the community of Muka, Naidiri and parts of Malomalo 
<br/>where there are 60 households and two villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another situation is in Waibogi, that is, off Queen’s Road, close to Malaqere.  There is metred 
<br/>water in one household and there are only 30 houses in that area.  With the $7 million extra, I just 
<br/>wanted to find out from the honourable Minister if these areas can be finished?  Areas of Nadave, 
<br/>Bilalevu, Nabaka, Runitogo, Muka and Naidiri and parts of Malomalo.  For Muka and Naidiri, the 
<br/>main pipe goes through Muka and Naidiri and to Natadola, so it will be easy to connect there, hence 
<br/>for  Waibogi  also.  During  dry  spell,  these  areas  are  hit  very  hard  and  carting  water  to  these  nine 
<br/>settlements is a challenge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- If you look at the overall Water Authority of Fiji budget, there 
<br/>is  a  substantial  increase,  as  you  can  see  there  $191.3  million  to  $250.8  million  with  operating 
<br/>expenditure $118.1 and capital expenditure is $132.7 million.  There is a general note here for the 
<br/>specific areas and I will advise because there is a rural programme as you can see on page 277 of the 
<br/>Budget paper.  Some of the areas which will be covered are there and of course some of those areas 
<br/>where the network will be extended will also be covered, which is I think what you are talking about. 
<br/>But I will get back in terms of the specific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Thank you, honourable Minister.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 41 – Water Authority of Fiji.

<div><span>Head 43 - Fiji Roads Authority 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, in relation to the operating grants, honourable Minister 
<br/>I have read through the list of the bridges that you intend to complete. There is one bridge that is 
<br/>missing in this list that I can see of incomplete bridges and that is the bridge of Naseyani, further up 
<br/>the road from Fiji Water. So, I hope it is not an oversight.  The other bridges that are listed here, most 
<br/>of them have not been completed but that would be the other one unless it is a mistake.  It is half-
<br/>complete bridge. So, I thought I would bring that to your attention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Noted, thank you.

<div><span>Head 50 - Miscellaneous Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- SEG 7 from Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.  There are a number of things 
<br/>there that have been stopped – the outsourcing of general practitioners, dental practitioners scheme, 
<br/>medical laboratories.  I just want to clarify whether it has been taken out of here or put somewhere 
<br/>else or is it completely taken away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is still under Head 50, the outsourcing of some of these 
<br/>activities,  for  example,  PPP  started  during  COVID-19,  it  continued.  We  are  in  the  process  of 
<br/>reviewing, we have made some changes as to the eligibility but some of the outsourcing of the tests, 
<br/>medical laboratories are still continuing until such time that the Ministry of Health is able to fully 
<br/>equip and ensure that hospitals and Sub-Divisional Medical Hospitals are well equipped and they are 
<br/>able to provide all the services 24 hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Sir, a supplementary question, eventually this subsidized service for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the private sector would be taken away and substituted in the government facilities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As I said this will all be reviewed.  We have the Public Private 
<br/>Partnership with Ba Hospital and Lautoka Hospital.  Aspen is an issue that we are dealing with on 
<br/>top of that, all these other private providers and the model will have to be reviewed because some of 
<br/>it seems to be taking on a life of its own and we feel that the expenditure trend is just on the rise.  
<br/>That is one of the reasons why we have put out a criterion in terms of those who are access it, but 
<br/>that will come under full review in the current financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  SEG  7  No.  26    -  Review  of  Fiji  Roads 
<br/>Authority and Other Major Programmes.  I am just wondering if FRA is still involved in this Load 
<br/>Management Programme to protect our road services.  I hardly see the enforcement going on the road 
<br/>to check on this extra loading.  Is that kind of programme included in this programme as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I will ask the honourable Minister to answer that question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  That  is  currently  being  undertaken  by  LTA  and  the  LTA 
<br/>budget is also increased to increase the number of enforcement officers.  Not only for that but also 
<br/>you have raised the number of road accidents, et cetera and we are very pleased with the number of 
<br/>enforcement,  the  budget,  the  road  safety  education  has  increased  and  the  services  will  be  further 
<br/>enhanced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 8 No. 9 - Special Funds for Maintenance which 
<br/>is  $5  million.  If  I  can  get  some  breakdown  of  how  that  money  will  be  used  and  it  will  be  used 
<br/>particularly for maintaining what?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is a good question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  This  is  a  kind  of  new  initiative  that  will  deal  with  the 
<br/>maintenance of Government assets.  One of the things that is quite evident throughout the country is 
<br/></span><span>the big deterioration in the Government assets including public buildings, quarters, hospitals, health 
<br/></span><span>centres, schools and other assets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This funding will be coordinated through the new Strategic Planning Office and apart from 
<br/>those that have been allocated within the different Ministries, that will also be coordinated together 
<br/>with this funding so that we are able to fill the gaps which certain Ministries and Departments may 
<br/>not be able to fill and that is why it is under Head 50, and we will be coordinating that.  Because what

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1527 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we found is, I think as the as the honourable Minister said, the Public Works Department as an entity 
<br/>will also have a good role in terms of overseeing some of these routine maintenance and sometimes 
<br/>it does not require a lot of money.  For example, we went to Dreketi Health Centre. We went to the 
<br/>market. When we asked them why the doctor’s office was full of dust, there was no tiles and the 
<br/>place where the patients used to come and wait was all dilapidated.  So they were saying that a new 
<br/>hospital or health centre would be build  and that will take two or three years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, honourable Minister when you had explained that earlier 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD. - Can you let me finish? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, that’s the only clarification I needed which you have clarified and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Let us move on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chair, I was just explaining …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I understood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-…in a small amount of money… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN. - Almost finish again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …we were able to do that in about a month.  Some of these 
<br/>maintenances will be coordinated through the Strategic Planning Office. In fact, it was done through 
<br/>the Strategic Planning Office. You should appreciate that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. - Mr. Chairman, I over understood what he has said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is your problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Sir, on SEG Nos. 2 and 3 -  we are vehicle leasing which is $36 million 
<br/>but at the top on No. 2 we have purchased of vehicle of $2 million.  Can I just ask what vehicles are 
<br/>we buying?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If I tell the whole story about vehicle leasing then …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Which vehicles are we buying? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.–  That  allocation  is  for  vehicle  leasing.  There  are  some 
<br/>departments which own vehicles because it is not based on leasing so that is why that is that provision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I just have a few questions on SEG 10 No. 1.  There 
<br/></span><span>is  an  allocation  there  for  Northern  Division  Projects.    We  have  the  Northern  Development 
<br/></span><span>Programme  allocation.    Can  the  honourable  Minister  clarify  what  else  is  this  Northern  Division 
<br/>Projects, allocated a sum of $1,955,827.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  need  confirmation  as  well  on  No.  9,  the  Ongoing  Contingency  Funds  for  Disaster  Risk 
<br/>because $1 million usually goes every year to the Prime Minister’s Trust and then we have a separate

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocation, as sort of emergency funding which usually is parked under Head 50 as well.  But I am 
<br/>not sure whether there is another separate allocation or not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally  on  No.  11,  the  Nadi  River  Flood  Alleviation  Project.    Is  this  part  of  the  JICA 
<br/>Programme or is this just the continuation of the Nadi River Basin Flood Management where we 
<br/>were to do retention dams for the tributaries and rivers that feed into the main Nadi River? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is part of that programme. You talking about No. 11, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>right? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Yes, that is part of that project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Numbers 9 and 11.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No. 9 - Ongoing Contingency Funds for Disaster Risk, that is fine, that is part of the Nadi 
<br/>River Basin River Project. In fact, the JICA Programme did not happen. There is a new feasibility 
<br/>study, in fact, a lot of work has already been done by ADB and we are in the process of making sure 
<br/>that that project gets underway but that is where the allocation is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No. 1 - Northern Division Projects? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  The  FDB  subsidy  on  interest  on  agriculture  loans  and  the 
<br/>economic  rehabilitation,  the  Northern  Division  Projects.    That  is  part  of  the  continuation  of  the 
<br/>scheme where Government continues to subside loans to Fijian citizens in identified focus sectors 
<br/>under various schemes. They include agriculture loans including forestry and fishing, micro credit 
<br/>and agri finance under Social Banking Scheme, some to manufacturing, mining and quarrying, SME 
<br/>micro-loans  in  professional  and  business  services,  SME  micro-loans  in  transport  and  storage  and 
<br/>SME micro-loans in wholesale, retail, hotels and restaurants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2021-2022 Budget, interest rates subsidy for agriculture loans by the Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank actually increased from 6 percent to 8 percent and still is 8 percent and increase in the loan 
<br/>limit for the subsidy from $50,000 to $100,000. The Northern Development Projects is an additional 
<br/>allocation for those categories of enterprises especially in the Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B SERUIRATU.-  I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, through you, my question on No. 9, is 
<br/></span><span>the    $1  million  allocation  the  one  that  goes  into  the  Prime  Minister’s  Trust  because  I  do  not  see 
<br/>anything in Head 18-4-1 under NDMO on the contingency of funds.  We are going into the El Nino 
<br/>cycle.  What have we got to prepare for a disaster if it does come, apart from that,  the $1 million that 
<br/>usually goes into the Prime Minister’s Trust?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You mean to say ongoing Contingency Funds on No. 9 - $1 
<br/>million for Disaster Risk.  That is a separate allocation for the projects that come under the Prime 
<br/>Minister’s Small Grants Scheme as well. But there would be specific Disaster Risk Projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  They  are  two  totally  different  activities  altogether.  I  mean  the 
<br/>small grant does not handle disaster but there is a trust in which the allocation goes yearly and it is 
<br/>usually $1 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, that is the allocation.

<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1529 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  So,  what  else  have  you  got  to  prepare  us,  this  is  one  of  the 
<br/>questions that you used to ask.  What else is there to prepare us for the next one apart from this $1 
<br/>million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Leader of the Opposition, there are allocations in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all the other ministries too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- There is no money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, there are allocations in the other ministries, you know 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- On SEG 10 No. 4 - Fijian Scholarship Scheme. If you look at the notes 
<br/>on  the  right,  the  last  one  there  is  Apprenticeship  $330,000.  Is  this  a  summation  of  the  little 
<br/>apprenticeship amounts that are contained in the rest of the Budget or is it an additional fund? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So what is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Is this a summation of the little apprenticeship budgets within the rest 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Budget or is it something in addition to those ones? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- These are actual scholarships.  So all the allocations under the 
<br/>Scholarship Scheme are scholarships, whether it is apprenticeship, whether it is going into a specific 
<br/>skill programme, they are all scholarships.  The allowance and the tuition fee will depend on the 
<br/>institutions and the specific course that the students would do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The next one is No. 25 - Jobs for Nature ($4 million). I would just like 
<br/>to  ask where  we can get people to  go and ask  for access  to  this particular programme.  Is there  a 
<br/>particular Ministry or is it the Ministry of Finance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is aWorld Bank Funded project but within the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No. 37 - Fijian Drua Support, reduction of $2 million.  Is that going to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have an impact on the Drua or is it in keeping with their plans? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Government is a majority.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No, I am just asking.  It will not damage the Drua chance of winning 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Super thing next year?. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The last one, No. 41 – one of the things that we are promoting very 
<br/></span><span>strongly is moving away from fossil fuel based energy to renewal energy and moving transport away 
<br/>from fossil fuel to electricity, hopefully renewable energy. We are pushing for electric vehicles, but 
<br/>this electric vehicle subsidy is being taken away for $500,000.  Just wondering, is that going to hurt 
<br/>that drive towards moving transportation out of fossil fuel towards electric usage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not really, I mean we are kind of reviewing all these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="92">Page 92</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investments and programmes. What we found that while the stated objectives are there, targets are 
<br/>there, when you actually get down to doing it, there are a lot of complications. While the focus is on 
<br/>mitigation, the focus is on renewal energy, if you look at the international funding agencies such as 
<br/>World  Bank,  ADB,  DFAT,  the  whole  debate  really  is  about  whether  we  should  go  for  more 
<br/>adaptation or mitigation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The developed countries, the international partners, there seems to be a lot of preference for 
<br/>mitigation projects but less on adaptation and the mix of adaptation and mitigation funding is a debate 
<br/>that is going on.  So some of these small projects like pilot projects, they are fine but they are not 
<br/>sustainable. So renewable energy in a way that is sustainable would be the best way to go, whether 
<br/>it is solar, whether it is hydro that is an area where Government would focus.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electric vehicles, public private partnership, there are funding available and we are building 
<br/>capacity within the Climate Change Division which is now fortunately under the Prime Minister’s 
<br/>Office.  It  gives  a  much  bigger  international  focus  and  our  ability  to  source  additional  funding 
<br/>specifically for those kind of projects would be in my view is quite or would be greatly enhanced.  
<br/>That is what we will be exploring in this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Deputy Prime, there are two commitments that Fiji has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>made: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span> </span><span>100 percent electricity renewable energy by the year 2030; and 
<br/>2)</span><span> </span><span>Zero carbon by the year 2050. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That means for the zero carbon, the big challenge will be converting travel, cars, vessels to 
<br/>convert  from  using  fossil  fuels  towards  electricity.  So,  change  electricity  to  renewable  energy  by 
<br/>2030 and then move all the transport to use that renewable energy.  All of these little projects move 
<br/>us towards that target of 2050, getting into green on our transportation. I understand what you are 
<br/>saying. That is the context of which I was asking those questions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I think you are right but I think if we can get there, Fiji is 
<br/>actually in a much better position because of the hydro project that was conceived in the early 1980s 
<br/>and thankfully we have that.  More than 50 percent of our energy sources already come from renewal 
<br/>energy and we in the international scheme of things, Fiji is much better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to focus a little bit more on looking at possibilities of more hydropower schemes 
<br/></span><span>while  we  are  pursuing  in  solar,  electric  vehicles,  this  would  be  part  of  the  overall  objective  of 
<br/></span><span>achieving  what  you  were  saying.  I  agree  with  you,  but  I  think  we  have  to  make  a  choice, 
<br/>decarbonisation is the goal, but we have to make a choice, there has to be a priority. We cannot do 
<br/>everything together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Just to add a short note to that, that we are currently doing a 
<br/>feasibility study in terms of e-vehicles and the infrastructure with KOICA through the national energy 
<br/>policy, attached is the matrix for the actions to be taken to achieve what you are describing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask about No. 22.  What is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the meaning of Non-Commercial Obligation for Energy Fiji Limited? SEG 10 – No. 22.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  That  is  for  the  rural  electrification  programme  which  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provided as a contribution by the Government where EFL is not able to undertake those projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- For grid extension is provided in Head 40, we have just gone through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1531 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it, it is $4 million. That is the grid extension that Government pays to EFL to extent the grid. That is 
<br/>covered in Head 40. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  This  is  additional  non-commercial  obligation  for  Fiji  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Energy  Fiji Limited to provide subsidies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- A supplementary question, Mr. Chairman, so where does electricity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subsidy that we give to the households below $30,000 come in? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is within the social welfare.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is the one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That includes that as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 50. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 50 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  please  take  note  that  Heads  51  and  52  are 
<br/>Standing  Appropriations  or  below  the  line  Appropriation.  Head  51  lists  all  the  pensions  that  are 
<br/>payable. These are  a charge on the Government  finances. Head 52 are the charges on account  of 
<br/>public debt. These numerous pages lists all the information on interest and loans, neither Head is 
<br/>voted upon because they must be paid and are therefore already catered for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the Estimates. We shall now proceed to 
<br/>considering the Schedules and Clauses of the 2023-2024 Appropriation Bill 2023 (Bill No. 3 of 2023) 
<br/>as required by Standing Order 101.  I advise the honourable Members that as we have not amended 
<br/>the Estimates, Standing Order 101 prevents any amendments being moved and made at this stage. 
<br/>Standing 101(3) also prevents any debate on these questions.
