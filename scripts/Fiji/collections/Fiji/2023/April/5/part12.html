<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Strategic Planning, National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development and Statistics; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation;

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023 National Economic Summit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to provide a statement on the upcoming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Economic Summit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government,  led  by  our  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Sitiveni 
<br/>Rabuka  believes  in  genuine  dialogue,  effective  consultation,  participatory  governance  and  collective 
<br/>decision making. We are Government that is here, not to rule but to serve our people and to serve each 
<br/>and every one with humility and fairness. We are here to work together with our people and collectively
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>879 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tackle our challenges and devise solutions that benefit all of us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this philosophy of inclusiveness in decision making lies at the heart of the 
<br/>Coalition Government’s style of leadership and governance. Since coming into Government, we have 
<br/>introduced a number of inclusive decision-making structures, including the formation of the Fiscal 
<br/>Review Committee to advise us on taxation policies, expenditure allocations and other broad fiscal 
<br/>policy  issues.  We  have  also  established  a  Cabinet  Sub-Committee  on  Budget  and  an  Economic 
<br/>Strategy  Committee  chaired  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  to  oversee  the  formulation  of  the 
<br/>National Budget and coordinate our economic policy agenda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  times  are  over  when  one  or  two  single  person(s)  will  dictate  the 
<br/>Budget  process  and  change  economic  policies  overnight  as  we  saw  happen  in  the  previous 
<br/>government. We are back in a democracy and the dictatorial style of leadership which we experienced 
<br/>for the last 16 years is over and it is never going to come back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes, yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  January  as  soon  as  we  came  in 
<br/>Government, Cabinet approved the 2023 National Economic Summit (NES) to be held on 20th and 
<br/>21st  April,  2023  after  a  period  of  almost  a  decade.  The  theme  for  the  2023  National  Economic 
<br/>Summit is, “Reshaping our Future through Genuine Dialogue and Collaboration”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the aim of the Summit is to bring our people together and create a collective 
<br/>national vision, with adequate sector policies and most importantly an implementation framework 
<br/>for the Government’s plan to chart a path towards economic success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Summit  has  adopted  a  consultative  and  collaborative  approach  towards  addressing 
<br/>sustainable  development  issues  at  national  levels,  by  engaging  various  Government  ministries, 
<br/>various segments of society including the public sector and our honourable Opposition Members.  I 
<br/>can inform everyone that I have sent personal letters to all honourable Members of the Opposition 
<br/>and I hope that they will participate in the National Economic Summit.  We are also including the 
<br/>private  sector  in  a  big  way,  industry  groups,  civil  society  organisations,  academia,  trade  unions, 
<br/>women and religious groups, development partners and members of the general public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Fiji moves into an era of change, engaging with all segments of society 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is essential to achieve the Government’s overarching objectives of the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inclusive economic security;  
<br/>social justice; 
<br/>conscientious governance; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>political stability; 
<br/>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indigenous people’s participation in development; and 
<br/>environmental sustainability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main objectives of the 2023 National Economic Summit are to:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>set  an  economic  policy  agenda  for  an  accelerated  economic  growth,  underpinned  by 
<br/>sustainable and inclusive development;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>deliberate an actionable framework for transformative and effective economic governance;  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>build consensus on the imperatives for transforming Fiji’s immense human capital into a 
<br/>nationally  productive  and  innovative  capacity  that  creates  a  secure  collective  future  of 
<br/>prosperity for all;  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>identify pragmatic initiatives to elicit economic leadership at the sectoral level, adopting a 
<br/>bottom-up  approach  to  sectoral  competitiveness  that  contributes  to  national  economic 
<br/>growth and development; and  
<br/>articulate the framework within which economic priorities for Fiji are set out over the next 
<br/>four years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Economic Summit will be held over two days and participants will be divided, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, into Thematic Working Groups to encourage an integrated approach to addressing development 
<br/>challenges. The twelve (12) Thematic Working Groups are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Macroeconomic management; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Key growth sectors – includes tourism, manufacturing and commerce. micro, small and 
<br/>medium  enterprises,  financial  services,  Business  Process  Outsourcing  (BPO)  and  the 
<br/>construction industry; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Governance and reforms – includes law and order, reform of state institutions and foreign 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>affairs and external trade; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Human  development  –  includes  health,  education  and  training,  housing  and  urban 
<br/>development, youth and protection of children, culture and heritage, sports development, 
<br/>poverty alleviation, employment and labour market, women in economic development; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Rural and outer island development; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Land based activities – includes sugar, non-sugar crops &amp; livestock, forestry, land resource 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development &amp; management and mineral water and ground water resources; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Marine based activities and resources; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Technology - includes information &amp; communication technology; 
<br/>(9)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(10)</span><span> </span><span>Water  resource  and  waste  management  -  includes  waste  and  wastewater  and  waste 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Indigenous people’s participation in development; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>management; 
<br/>(11)</span><span> </span><span>Transport; and 
<br/>(12)</span><span> </span><span>Energy and electricity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, each thematic working group will have a chairperson and the role of the 
<br/>chairperson will be to facilitate the discussions of the thematic working group.  The chairperson is to 
<br/>also provide necessary leadership and networking for their thematic areas.  The chairperson will also 
<br/>ensure  that  sufficient  time  is  allowed  for  complex  or  contentious  issues  and  encourage  active 
<br/>engagement and effective communication by all members.  These thematic groups will encourage 
<br/>open,  frank  and  thorough  dialogue  discussions  and  every  member’s  opinion  will  be  sought, 
<br/>acknowledged and respected and we will ensure that discussions are in line with the vision, policies 
<br/>and strategies of the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  cross-cutting  issues  like  climate  change,  environment,  disaster  mitigation  and 
<br/>management  and  gender  is  being  integrated  and  mainstreamed  into  the  different  thematic  areas.  
<br/>Mainstreaming cross-cutting issues are critical and requires institutional commitment.  The Ministry 
<br/>of Finance is playing the lead role in organising the Summit and facilitating papers, discussions and 
<br/>outcomes of the Summit, which will feed into the upcoming 2023-2024 Budget, and potentially, a 
<br/>new National Development Plan in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  part  of  this  work,  the  Ministry  is  currently  developing  the  baseline  strategy  papers  on 
<br/>various thematic areas which will form the basis of discussions during the Summit.  In addition to 
<br/>the  thematic  working  groups  discussions,  there  will  five  plenary  sessions  held  over  the  two-day 
<br/>Summit with the following themes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The state of the economy and future of fiscal policy;  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>881 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Responsible, responsive and resilient leadership;  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Universal coverage and basic health care; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Research and innovation - pathways for economic prosperity; and 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Transparency and accountability priorities for effective governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Among  others,  the  key  discussions  around  the  thematic  working  groups  will  be  around 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>addressing the following issues: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>How to improve macro-economic management and financial and fiscal stability; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>How to transition away from a largely public sector-led growth in the past model to a more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>private sector driven economy; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>What are the measures that are needed to diversify the Fijian economy and create more jobs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and income for our people; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>How can we be improving our health care facilities which are, as we all know, in a poor 
<br/>and dilapidated state, an insufficient programme for maintenance and upkeep, poor hygiene 
<br/>and sanitation facilities are well known; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>How can we address the challenges in our water sector.  We have had a lot of debate and 
<br/>discussion on this.  The task for the Coalition Government is to address these challenges, 
<br/>which is exacerbated by aging water infrastructure, a growing population, rural to urban 
<br/>drift and the impacts of climate change on our raw water sources.  The Summit is expected 
<br/>to set out strategies and address some of these issues; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>How can we make growth and development more inclusive and what are the measures and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>incentives to be provided to increase indigenous participation in development; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>How can we grow our agriculture sector, expand our rural economy and support MSMEs; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>How do we improve ease of doing business (I know the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>Kamikamica is working very hard on this and we should have more discussions) on how 
<br/>to remove the bureaucracies and lengthy approval processes to support the private sector, 
<br/>and  other  important  questions  of  national  importance  and  other  important  questions  of 
<br/>national importance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  outcomes  of  the  Summit  will  be  fed  into  a  communique  which  will 
<br/>contain economic measures, strategies on various thematic areas and sectors and that is  expected to 
<br/>chart a path towards economic recovery and prosperity.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can inform Parliament that the preparations are going very well.  The main 
<br/>venue of the 2023 National Economic Summit will be the Grand Pacific Hotel, and of the 12 thematic 
<br/>working  groups,  eight will  be based at  GPH and four  at  Albert Park.   I  want  to  thank Suva City 
<br/>Council for making this available.   Around 500 delegates and participants are expected to attend the 
<br/>2023 National Economic Summit.  In fact, we are extremely  oversubscribed and we are trying to 
<br/>accommodate as many people as we can.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the logistics side, the 12 thematic working groups have been finalised and invitations are 
<br/>being sent out and we are awaiting confirmations. As I said before, invitations have also been sent to 
<br/>all the Members of Parliament, including as I said the Opposition Members, all the Ministers who 
<br/>would be participating, other political parties, diplomatic missions, international and regional bodies, 
<br/></span><span>civil society organisations, trade unions, academia, women and religious groups and many important 
<br/></span><span>players in our private sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the Economic Summit as I said, we will have a great opportunity to 
<br/>meet, discuss and understand the views and ideas of so many different people.  We have said that it 
<br/>is  important  for  any  government  to  understand  that  a  lot  of  wisdom,  ideas  reside  outside  of 
<br/>government as well.  This Summit is an attempt to create a very genuine forum so that we can

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>genuinely dialogue, collaborate and work out how we can take this country to greater heights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics 
<br/>for his Ministerial Statement this morning on the NFP-led and NFP dominated National Economic 
<br/>Summit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know what you are trying to do.  It will not work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We look forward to the … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It will never work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  …  outcome  of  the  Summit,  because  in  his  eight  years  as  an 
<br/>Opposition and government-in-waiting, we keep hearing this from the honourable Member when we 
<br/>were in government.  This is a Government that has run out of ideas, this is a Government that has 
<br/>no money, this is a Government that has no plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  We  look  forward  to  his  plan,  but  definitely  the  economy  is 
<br/>important for all Fijians and I, as a former Minister for National Security, I always stressed in this 
<br/>august Parliament that we need economic security for national security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  need  national  security  for  economic  security  because  it  is  national  security  that 
<br/>stabilises, that creates that environment for growth and stability. So, we look forward to the ideas and 
<br/>the plans that the honourable Minister has and, of course, the Members of Government through this 
<br/>Summit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I like the statement  by the honourable Minister  stating  that they are a  Government  that is 
<br/>genuine and they are talking about dialogue, but in his statement yesterday, Mr. Speaker, this is what 
<br/>he mentioned and I quote: “… to understand some of the pain that you need to go through when you 
<br/>sit in Opposition.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Where is the love? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you want dialogue, we hear every word uttered 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from the other side.  That is a very vengeful statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well in response to what he said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We have been accused of two-men rule. We have been accused of 
<br/>dictatorship but we see a change now in the current Government as well and we are worried that, that 
<br/>will be a one-man rule and the silent 28, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>883 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Is that the way forward?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Good try, good try! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  But  I  stated  in  my  initial  response  to  His  Excellency  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>President’s Address, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are here to help.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I received the letter first from the Permanent Secretary for Finance dated 14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/>and then I just received this week a letter dated 9</span><span>th</span><span> March from the honourable Minister.  I am sure 
<br/>this letter must have been backdated because I received the letter from the Permanent Secretary well 
<br/>in advance when we were still in Bahrain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me go to the dialogue.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the dialogue that we undertook and I can 
<br/>go into the details.  Let me just read it for the benefit of this and this is what guided our policies - the 
<br/>voice of the people and, of course, the environment keeps changing. We looked at indicators and we 
<br/>have to make re-adjustments along the way.   Mr. Speaker, let me read it out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Everything you are saying we can hear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The honourable Tuisawau loves doing this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable L.D. Tabuya interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There are many reasons for the poor performance of Fiji’s economy over recent decades.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
