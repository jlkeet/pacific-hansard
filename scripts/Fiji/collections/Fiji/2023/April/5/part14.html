<div><span>“The  bus  operators  then  ask,  ‘how  are  we  going  to  pay  for  these  new  buses?’    The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>government says, ‘let me talk to FCCC.’”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the government had no idea on how they were going to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>charge for </span><span>Walesi</span><span>.  I will come back to this point later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is, how did </span><span>Walesi</span><span> get conceived?  To be fair, the thinking was 
<br/>honourable.  The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialised agency of the United 
<br/>Nations that focuses on information and communications technologies started pushing the transition 
<br/>from analogue to digital technology.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a member of ITU since 1971, Fiji became a signatory to an international Treaty known as 
<br/>GE06  in  2006.    This  Treaty  was  adopted  by  119-member  countries  and  aimed  to  encourage  the 
<br/>transition from analogue to digital broadcasting.  Since then, 40 countries including Australia, New 
<br/>Zealand, Unites States of America, United Kingdom and closer to home, Samoa, have adopted this 
<br/>switchover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in light of that global transition, the FijiFirst Government recognised that 
<br/>perhaps there was a need for a better coverage in digital television.  In 2012, the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>engaged  the  ITU  to  come  up  with  a  roadmap  for  transition  from  analogue  to  digital  terrestrial 
<br/>television broadcasting.  This roadmap was designed to ensure that Fiji deploys infrastructure that 
<br/>meets best practices and that the people of Fiji could enjoy the same quality of television in those 
<br/>more developed countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  2</span><span>nd</span><span>  January,  2013,  the  roadmap  was  officially  launched  in  partnership  with  ITU.  The 
<br/>roadmap identified the most efficient manner for Fiji to undertake the transition which involved the 
<br/>establishment  of  infrastructure  that  would  be  used  by  all  broadcasters  both  existing  in  radio  and 
<br/>television. This common infrastructure, they decided was to be known as </span><span>Walesi</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  using  a  common  infrastructure,  the  theory  was  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  Fiji  aimed  to 
<br/>significantly  reduce  capital  and  operational  cost  for  all  broadcasters  while  ensuring  that  they  no 
<br/>longer needed to upgrade their own individual infrastructure.  This is where the good theory and the 
<br/>intent, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ended.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As usual and true to form, when the ITU produced the report, it made two recommendations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which were very clear at least to me as the new Minister from my viewpoint. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The need to have a business case to justify the significant investment that government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was making to ensure that the investment was justified; and 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>That there was extensive consultation with all stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  no  business  case  was  ever  tabled  in  Cabinet,  nor  was  there  proper 
<br/>consultation on </span><span>Walesi</span><span> with the stakeholders.  I am told by the stakeholders that they were basically 
<br/>forced  on  to  </span><span>Walesi,</span><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  or  they  ran  the  risk  of  losing  their  licenses  like  those  bus 
<br/>operators I was talking to earlier.  So, from the very beginning, the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> setup was all wrong.

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst government and its economic manager, I am disappointed he is 
<br/>not here today to answer for this, decided to spend money with no business case.  Imagine this, if 
<br/>you or I were a CFO or a Finance Manager of a company that went to its Board to setup a business 
<br/>project with no idea of what the total cost of the project was or how you would recover the money 
<br/>you  are  going  to  spend,  we  would  be  laughed  out  of  the  board  room  or  we  would  be  fired,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, as the case may be.  With the support of the silent 26, they allowed the Mr. Aiyaz Sayed-
<br/>Khaiyum, the former Minister for everything including communications to spend the $125 million 
<br/>with no business case and no proper consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Flabbergasted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, flabbergasted! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolute hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Whilst I have put on hold the continued migration of </span><span>Walesi</span><span>
<br/>to the radio operators, the fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the FCCC is right now trying to work out the 
<br/>pricing for the television operators and the radio stations demonstrates clearly my point.  This is the 
<br/>height of economic mismanagement.  When you invest, Sir, and you do not know how you are going 
<br/>to recover the cost of your investment - $125 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms consultation like I said, Sir, it was limited and virtually non-existent and it is actually 
<br/>true to FijiFirst government fashion - My way or the highway.  I also suspect, Sir, the usual modus 
<br/>operandi of the previous Government came into this. There was a desire to continue to control the 
<br/>media. It was not enough to have MIDA and thank God this Government is getting rid of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  The  FijiFirst  Government  also  wanted  to  control  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>distribution network.  Total and absolute abuse of power... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is the platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- ... and media control.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a piece of advise maybe to the other side of Parliament but to all 
<br/>of  us,  for  someone  who  has  spent  33  years  in  the  private  sector,  when  governments  try  and  get 
<br/>involved in areas that are best left to the private sector, it ends in disaster.  Telecommunication, Sir, 
<br/>is a very complex business, assets get obsolete very quickly and it is capital intensive. Because of 
<br/>Government overreach, $125 million of taxpayer’s money is wasted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the picture gets darker from here.  Out of the $125 million spent so far, 
<br/></span><span>about $42.5 million came from the Telecommunications Development Trust Fund, a trust funded by 
<br/>telecommunication service providers and $83 million came through budgetary channels.  Why is this 
<br/>disclosure important?  It is important because it shows a deeper concern on how the money was being 
<br/>spent and how it was being disclosed in this august Chamber.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just give you one example.  As per the information provided to me by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>891 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry in 2016 to 2017, there was $23.7 million spent from the Trust Account.  In the Budget 
<br/>for that year, there is only disclosure of $2 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What does this mean, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- This suggests that the FijiFirst government did not disclose 
<br/>to the people of Fiji how much it was spending on </span><span>Walesi</span><span> out of the Trust Account and can be 
<br/>deemed as misleading the people of Fiji, in my view. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I agree, Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable J. Usamate interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Wait, wait, wait!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that these are very serious allegations and this side of Parliament is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not taking it lightly. So what is this side of Parliament doing about </span><span>Walesi</span><span>? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, with Cabinet approval, an investigation ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- ... is being undertaken into this excessive abuse of funds. It 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will establish how the funds were spent, whether due process was followed, Mr. Speaker… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>See, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they laughed.  They lighten what is a serious issue for this country and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are saying they are the government-in-waiting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable A.A. Maharaj interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I give up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The selection of vendors, Sir, and how procurement was made will be looked at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-  I will report back to this august Parliament once this audit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investigation is carried out. No stone will be left unturned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Make sure.

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The Board of </span><span>Walesi </span><span>is in the process of being changed, Mr 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir.  I  have  discussed  this  with  the  current  Chairman  on  my  trip  to  Auckland  who  has 
<br/>graciously offered to work with the new Board and its Chairman to ensure a smooth transition and 
<br/>handover. I would like to thank Mr. Robert Khan for his support in this regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The new Board, Sir, …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- … will be tasked to finding out how we can get out of this 
<br/>mess  created  by  the  FijiFirst  Government  and  they  will  have  the  full  support  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Communications which I lead and the Government of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the other side of Parliament, as I mentioned before, keeps on harping about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>legacy - I hope that they will accept the mess of </span><span>Walesi</span><span> as part of their legacy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- On the achievement of the 100-day objectives, Sir, I know 
<br/>they keep on telling us about the 100-day objectives.  Its debacles like this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, absolute 
<br/>debacles this, like </span><span>Walesi</span><span> that is causing a lot of distractions for us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst has left a litany of messes that this Government will have to fix whilst trying to 
<br/>run business as usual. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will hear the other side of Parliament trying to convince 
<br/>us that there are some positive things about </span><span>Walesi, </span><span>maybe the app for the Seven’s or something like 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By spending $125 million, Sir, in the process, this is not acceptable</span><span>.  </span><span>Sir, since I am still in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time, address three other points: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The reason why the there are three Deputy Prime Ministers. It is very simple, Sir, I have 
<br/>just  talked  about  one  mess  that  the  FijiFirst  government  has  created.    It  needs  a  lot  of 
<br/>bandwidth to try and make sure that things are fixed and I am sure they will agree with me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>They keep on saying one-man rule.   The  team on the other side knows, there is one person 
<br/>leading the  country.   That document  that the honourable Leader of the  Opposition was 
<br/>holding, that was generated by one person.  They did not  have a summit of 500 people to 
<br/>discuss a document of that nature. I just thought I would share that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just 
<br/>to enlighten my colleagues on the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I truly hope that the people of Fiji (watching here today) will understand some of the real 
<br/>challenges the People’s Government is facing.  We have to clean up the mess left by the 
<br/>FijiFirst government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two  projects  that  we  have  discussed  yesterday  and  today,  talk  about  the wastage  that  the 
<br/>former government  has  created  - $125 million  for  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  and up  to  $400 million  in  terms  of tax 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>893 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rebates.  Ultimately, Sir, this Government and the Peoples Coalition will redefine the legacy of the 
<br/>people on the other side.  I would like to offer my view on the  legacy.  It is a legacy of  government 
<br/>overreach, it is a legacy of excessive control, it is a legacy of financial mismanagement, it is a legacy 
<br/>of wastage and potentially, Sir, a legacy which involves misleading Parliament and misleading the 
<br/>people of Fiji and potentially abuse of office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to talk on </span><span>Walesi 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>today. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliver their response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am flabbergasted with all that hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Absolutely, we have heard nothing but a bunch of drivel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- In the earlier statement, we had the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>who revealed that he had finally seen the light of all the drivel that he has been putting across from 
<br/>this side, he has finally realised it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Today, when the FijiFirst government put up something that will make 
<br/>an  immediate impact on all the lives of the people of this country and they were watching you on 
<br/></span><span>Walesi.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  All  the investments, the $125 million  is not just about  the tangible 
<br/>benefits, it is all the intangible benefits that ultimate lead to tangible benefits.  Let us see what did 
<br/></span><span>Walesi</span><span> do?  Sir, 100 percent digital television accessibility, the terrestrial network, the scoping for 
<br/>the IOS sites, develop and build, testing of the sites, commissioning (did I get the wrong one, sorry). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think you poltergeist something, I got the better of this one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hang on, it is coming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cost of the digital switchover, free to air education programme, free Wi-Fi services in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FNU campuses, all the school children in these campuses benefit from this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Services, community and village installations, free  </span><span>Walesi</span><span> boxes to 
<br/>every family that earns $30,000 or less, telecentres in all schools, communities, information that they 
<br/>never had before, they finally got it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Information is something that builds people, when you do not know 
<br/>what  is  happening,  you  grovel  around  in  darkness.    </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  made  that  dramatic  change  to  all  the 
<br/>people  in  this  country  all  over;  Government  installations,  residential  installations,  school 
<br/>installations, commercial installations all of these things have been done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Commissioning of 27 sites, Nakobalevu as the first site, remaining 27 
<br/>sites were developed; not  only that. </span><span>Walesi</span><span> is not only terrestrial, also satellite.  </span><span>Walesi</span><span> paid for that 
<br/>satellite. We  wanted to  make sure that the people of this country have access  to  information and 
<br/>knowledge  because  it  is  something  that  frees  people.    The  honourable  Minister  there  went  and 
<br/>chastised and made accusations of corruption.  If you have the proof, put it on the table.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Let those who have done wrong, do not go and stand and talk about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something you do not know is true – put it on the table.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Stop preaching rubbish all over the world!  If you have any proof of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what you are doing, put it on the table.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Serving people is not wastage!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Giving information to people is not wastage!  It is doing the best for 
<br/>the people in this country.  If you have anything, put it on the table. We will make sure if someone, 
<br/>what is all this pointing, put it on the table.  So I say, all of this is absolute drivel.  The benefits are 
<br/>profound, the benefits will be generational, it is not just for the people of today, we are moving this 
<br/>country from the old age into the digital age.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We need to drag.  When you want to make a transformational shift, 
<br/>you  must  invest  in  that  transformational  shift.    They  do  not  come  from  some  willy-nilly  type  of 
<br/>developments, you must invest and make a change.  The people who watched the  </span><span>Drua</span><span> play last 
<br/>week, they are thankful for </span><span>Walesi</span><span>.  You will not be able to quantify in terms of dollars and cents the 
<br/>pleasure that they got from watching those matches.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  When  they  watch  the  Fiji  7s,  you  will  not  be  able  to  quantify  the 
<br/></span><span>pleasure that they get from that.  When you watch the </span><span>Fijiana</span><span> win two games in a row, watching on 
<br/></span><span>Walesi</span><span>, you will not be able to quantify that.  People now sitting in buses can watch </span><span>Walesi</span><span> anywhere.  
<br/>That </span><span>Walesi</span><span> has been something that is being phenomenal.  The challenge for you is to try to come 
<br/>up with your own projects.  Stop whinging, stop complaining, get on with the job!  Take the legacy 
<br/>of what we put there and build on it.  Stop complaining!  For some honourable Ministers, if you are 
<br/>a Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs, why do you want to become the Minister for Waterways or why

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R.  DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address this august Chamber on the state of 
<br/>the Ministry, its key achievements to-date and future plans for easier access of members of the public 
<br/>to  the  Ministry’s  services  and  development  assistance  programmes  through  digitisation, 
<br/>collaboration with key Government agencies planning and resource mobilisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament.  I rise to enlighten this august Parliament 
<br/>on  the  role  of  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management,  its 
<br/>achievements  in  reducing  development  gaps  and  how  the  Coalition  Government  sees  its  role  in 
<br/>national development as well as our future intentions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management has two broad functions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Planning and implementation of development assistance programmes; and  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Co-ordinating disaster preparedness, response, rehabilitation and recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ty  Statement  today  will  focus  on  progressive  and  inclusive  rural 
<br/>development whilst the Ministry’s role in the disaster management space, I will cover in a Ministerial 
<br/>Statement  at  a  future  sitting.    According  to  </span><span>2021  World  Social  Report  -  “Reconsidering  Rural 
<br/>Development</span><span>”, about 67 percent of the population of low income countries and 60 percent of the 
<br/>lower middle income countries live in rural areas.  Moreover, about 80 percent of those living below 
<br/>the  international  poverty  line  reside  in  the  rural  areas  and  about  one-fifth  of  rural  people  live  in 
<br/>extreme poverty and have less access to education, health and other essential services.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2017  Fiji  National  Census  estimated  that  about  44.7  percent  of  the 
<br/>national population (an equivalent of 386,632 persons), dwelt in the rural and maritime areas of Fiji.  
<br/>There was a general decline in the overall population in the rural areas while comparing the 2007 to 
<br/>2017 population census data.  The survey noted that out of the total rural population, majority are 
<br/>living in the Western Division – 40 percent and the least in the Eastern Division of about 9 percent.  
<br/>The rural population growth was generally negative for the Eastern, Northern and Western Divisions, 
<br/>with  the  only  increase  noted  in  the  Central  Division.    There  was  a  significant  decline  in  the 
<br/>economically active age group from 15 to 59 years, but increase was noted in the elderly age group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2019 to 2020, Household Income and Expenditure Survey indicated that 
<br/>despite relative abundance of rich natural resources and key exports based in the rural areas, such as 
<br/>tourism, sugar and agriculture, poverty rates in the rural areas was 36.5 percent, which was above the 
<br/>national poverty rate at 24.1 percent and more than doubled in terms of the urban poverty rate at 14 
<br/></span><span>percent.  Our fellow citizens who live in the rural areas continue to face multiple and inter-related 
<br/></span><span>challenges that prevent them from fully enjoying all the human rights and development aspirations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2019 to 2020, 38 percent of people in the rural areas compared to 23 percent of those in 
<br/>urban areas were classed as multi-dimensionally poor, living on low incomes and unable to afford 
<br/>basic essentials.  I am sure most of them would not have been able to afford the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> that we were 
<br/>talking about.

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is free.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- According to the 2017 Census Report, significant portions of the rural 
<br/>population across all Divisions lack basic services.  The statistics reflect that only 35 percent of rural 
<br/>households are connected to metered tap water supply and 10 percent are still reliant on  high-risk 
<br/>water sources  for drinking.  About 30 percent  of rural  households depend on  high-risk  sanitation 
<br/>facilities and around 5 percent of rural households have no reliable source of electricity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, more than ever, it is critical that we ensure that all rural and 
<br/>maritime communities have sustainable  living  as  a key priority.  This  Coalition Government  will 
<br/>work to ensure, in collaboration with all stakeholders and donor partners, that this is achievable.  The 
<br/>rural  poor  face  different  challenges  in  different  part  of  the  country.    In  the  Eastern  and  Northern 
<br/>Divisions, skilled jobs are limited, lowering returns to education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rural poor in the Western and Central Divisions have better access to public services due 
<br/>to being located on Viti Levu, but are still in predominantly agricultural and low wage jobs.  The lack 
<br/>of private sector investment and formal employment creation in rural areas continues to prevent rural 
<br/>Fijians from accessing reliable employment opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Extending  infrastructure  development  and  transport  services  to  rural  and  maritime  areas, 
<br/>particularly in the Northern and Eastern Divisions require extensive investments due to higher costs 
<br/>associated with limited availability of materials locally, costly transportation and limited number of 
<br/>private contractors.  The expansion of the communications network and the increasing ability of rural 
<br/>and remote communities to utilise mobile banking and payment mechanisms is critical for ensuring 
<br/>no one is left behind as part of digital transformation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past decades, important progress has been made but development 
<br/>gains are fragile and are undermined by the devastating impacts of climate change and disaster.  Our 
<br/>country is highly exposed to natural hazards such as tropical cyclones, floods, coastal erosion, storm 
<br/>surges, drought, earthquakes and tsunami.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The economic and social costs of these events to infrastructure, tourism facilities, markets 
<br/>and agricultural goods in Fiji are extremely high.  I do not intend to specify details of costs of some 
<br/>of  these  but  it  is  common  knowledge  that  some  affected  from  previous  disasters  have  not  fully 
<br/>recovered  from  the  damages  that  were  caused  to  them  and  their  livelihoods.    Nevertheless,  my 
<br/>Ministry will try to address whatever we can with the resources that we have, working in partnership 
<br/>with development partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to shed some light on the Ministry’s development priorities 
<br/>for rural and maritime development.  There are eight priorities in the National Development Plan that 
<br/>are aligned to the global 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.  These are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving community access and rural roads; 
<br/></span><span>Improving communication and infrastructure; 
<br/></span><span>Improving transportation; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Access to clean and safe water; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Access to safe and adequate shelter and sanitation facilities; 
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Wealth Creation; 
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Establishment of Rural Growth Centres; and 
<br/>(8)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Incubation of Rural Development Models.

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>897 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I wish to highlight that the Coalition Government is holding 
<br/>a National Economic Summit this month and we envisage that the outcomes of the Summit will have 
<br/>an impact on any revision that will need to take place in terms of our National Development Plan.  
<br/>At  this  stage  however,  it  is  imperative  that  the  work  to  be  done  by  the  Ministry  towards  these 
<br/>priorities is highlighted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last five years, the Ministry has implemented over 1,000 projects with a total value of 
<br/>$15.3  million.    These  projects  were  funded  under  the  existing  Self-Help  Programme  (SHP), 
<br/>Community Access Roads, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF) and High-Risk Water and Sanitation 
<br/>Programmes.  Also included are 99 Rural Housing Assistance Projects with a value of close of $1 
<br/>million  that  were  implemented  in  one  financial  year  (2017-2018)  just  before  the  transfer  of  the 
<br/>programme to the Ministry of Housing and Community Development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  our  efforts  to  accelerate  holistic  rural  development,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government has recognised how fitting and practical it is to bring back for the people of Fiji the 
<br/>Rural Housing and Rural and Outer Island Development Programmes to the Ministry.  The budgetary 
<br/>allocation currently provided to the Ministry and the work we do, will be complemented by these 
<br/>two programmes to ensure greater impact to the communities, and at the same time enable planning 
<br/>for better intervention, coordination and implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  vision  is  to  ensure  inclusive  development  for  productive, 
<br/>sustainable and resilient rural  communities.  The Ministry aims to strengthen its partnerships and 
<br/>work towards creating an enabling environment and resilience for our rural communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has already embarked on a consultative approach to better collaborate with its 
<br/>key agencies within Government for the design of the revamped Rural Housing Assistance (RHA) 
<br/>and Rural and Outer Island Development (ROI) Programmes.  The Ministry will be tabling to Cabinet 
<br/>the outcomes of the consultations and recommended approaches for implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Both these programmes will ensure collaboration with key stakeholders that heavily engage 
<br/>in  rural  development,  particularly  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and 
<br/>Forestry, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Communication and Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.  
<br/>We will ensure that this is an inclusive and consultative approach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this ROI programme will also be based on statistical evidence to ensure we 
<br/>target those sectors that are in real need of intervention, in particular our subsistence farmers.  It will 
<br/>also be based on certain rural development principles to ensure that the usual rhetoric of “no one is 
<br/>left behind” is put to action immediately and the impact must be visible in the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Coalition  Government  will  empower  our  rural  dwelling  population, 
<br/>incentivise them, guide them to ensure that they can sustain themselves and reduce the dependency 
<br/>culture that has been the practise of the previous administration.  Our focus is very clear, we will be 
<br/>increasing  income  potential  through  aggressive  sustainable  income  generating  activities  and  the 
<br/>improvement of market access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the theory of change towards rural development needs a holistic approach 
<br/></span><span>to ensure we reduce rural poverty rates, decrease income inequality, improve rural living standards, 
<br/>improve economic opportunities and increase access to basic infrastructure.   All these elements Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, play a significant role in addressing the rural to urban drift issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  be  formulating  a  Rural  Development  Policy,  under  its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partnership agreement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Governance for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resilience Project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  be  formulating  a  Rural  Development  Policy,  under  its 
<br/>partnership agreement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Governance for 
<br/>Resilience Project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  development  of  the  policy  is  crucial  to  national  governance  given  our  Ministry’s 
<br/>significant role in coordinating rural development and disaster management at both the national and 
<br/>sub-national  levels.    The  formulation  of  this  policy  is  also  important  to  guide  and  set  the  model, 
<br/>concepts  and  strategies  for  rural  and  maritime  development  in  Fiji.    The  policy  in  particular  is 
<br/>intended to document how the Integrated Rural Development Framework in Fiji can be strengthened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is the intention of the Ministry to have thorough consultation of this policy at the national 
<br/>and sub-national level.  Similarly, the outcome of the National Economic Summit in terms of the 
<br/>thematic  areas  on  Rural  and  Outer  Island  Development  will  certainly  provide  guidance  to  the 
<br/>Ministry on the broad principles of the policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  would  like  to  note  that  the  Ministry  is  committed  to  improving  its  administrative 
<br/>services through digitisation of its business processes.  The Ministry is working on a digitisation plan 
<br/>to  guide  the  implementation  of  changes  in  this  important  area.    We  are  determined  to  make  the 
<br/>changes to enable easier access to services as well as streamline processes for faster decision-making.  
<br/>We will ensure that governance mechanisms are in place to maintain integrity in our service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  refer  again  to  the  </span><span>2021  World  Social  Report  “Reconsidering  Rural 
<br/>Development”</span><span> which noted that on a global level, the standard of living for approximately 3.4 billion 
<br/>people residing in rural areas can be raised without them having to migrate to cities.  This is due to 
<br/>new approaches made possible through improved access and internet connectivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic generally threatened progress in development for the world’s 
<br/>rural population, the pandemic proved that new technologies can enable rural populations to flourish.  
<br/>The  rise  of  new  digital  technologies  provides  an  opportunity  to  bridge  the  rural-urban  divide  by 
<br/>providing rural populations with access to digital finance, precision tools for better crop yields as 
<br/>well as jobs that can be done remotely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Opportunities  exist  to  build  a  greener,  more  inclusive  and  resilient  future.    The 
<br/>experience  of  the  pandemic  has  shown,  for  example,  that  where  high-quality  internet 
<br/>connectivity  is  coupled  with  flexible  working  arrangements,  many  jobs  that  were 
<br/>traditionally considered to be urban can be performed in rural areas too”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst Fiji may be a very small dot on the global scene, we can still pursue 
<br/>progress and development by contextualising learnings from larger and more advanced economies 
<br/>when  designing  our  national  development  programmes,  and  this  is  what  we  intend  to  do.    It  is 
<br/>common  knowledge  that  in  Fiji,  the  agricultural  sector  features  predominantly  in  our  rural  and 
<br/></span><span>maritime area.  Furthermore, there is huge potential to increase production in this sector if we improve 
<br/></span><span>access to mechanisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the rural areas, there is also a need to increase connectivity if there is to be improvements 
<br/>in  the  use  of  technology  and  exposure  to  modern  agriculture  practises  to  enhance  the  quality  of 
<br/>produce and commodities for both domestic consumption and export.  The support for packaging and 
<br/>value adding facilities is another area being considered to ensure reduction in wastage and efficiency

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>899 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been reported that progress in agriculture and rural economy can have a preceding role 
<br/>in the overall socio-economic transformation of a country, and this was experienced in both the early 
<br/>and newly industrialised countries.  This was the case in countries such as England and France in 
<br/>Europe, Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Provinces of China and later China in Asia. Furthermore, 
<br/>the experience of the Green Revolution has showed how agricultural productivity growth can have 
<br/>an autonomous and catalytic role in spurring national development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst there is an inclination towards strengthening the agriculture sector under the revamped 
<br/>ROI programme, the Ministry is also wary of challenges that we now face such as the capacity of 
<br/>rural areas to operationalise development.  In addition to climate and natural disaster hazards, human 
<br/>capital  availability is  a possible threat  to  effective implementation  of the  Ministry’s development 
<br/>programmes.    This  is  due  to  the  continuous  rural  to  urban  drift  and  recent  rural  to  overseas  drift 
<br/>arising from the Pacific Access Labour Mobility (PALM) Schemes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  continues  to  consider  rural  development  models  including 
<br/>Saemaul  Undong  from  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Sufficiency  Economy  from  Thailand,  Bumiputera 
<br/>from Malaysia and Ruhunu Sahara in Sri Lanka as it develops the Rural Development Policy.  It will 
<br/>also consider in-situ urbanisation which is a model of rural development in which improvements in 
<br/>the standard of living in existing rural communities take place without migration or conversion into 
<br/>urban areas.  The “place-based” model has been implemented in China, Japan and Sri Lanka, and has 
<br/>proved effective in fostering long-term economic growth and spatial equity between rural and urban 
<br/>areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  plans  to  also  consider  other  non-agriculture  sectors  as 
<br/>improvement  in  agricultural  productivity  alone  will  not  be  the  only  solution  for  successful  rural 
<br/>transformation.  There  has  to  be  strong  linkages  between  different  sectors  so  that  gains  from 
<br/>agriculture can be transferred into demand for labour, inputs and services in non-farm activities.  As 
<br/>rural economies thrive, this could also encourage investment, entrepreneurship and job growth in the 
<br/>non-farm economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  obviously,  other  factors  are  critical  for  improving  both  agriculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>productivity and the development of a strong rural non-farm economy.  These include; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The stability of prices of agricultural products in global markets; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Sufficient investment in agricultural research; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Farmers access to technology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are factors that contribute to higher agriculture productivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, inclusive rural financing also helps by expanding the options for households 
<br/>and firms to adopt more advanced technologies, to invest in education and capacity building and to 
<br/>scale-up their productive activities, thereby improving productivity in both rural farms and non-farm 
<br/>sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, new digital technologies could offer new opportunities to accelerate rural 
<br/>economic transformation by helping to make agricultural production more efficient and profitable. 
<br/>Rural business ventures and start-ups based on digital technologies make it possible for goods and 
<br/>services to be sourced and sold directly in rural communities helping to build the local economy and 
<br/>narrowing  the  rural-urban  divide.    Whilst  these  may  be  some  things  that  we  aspire  to  as  ideal 
<br/>scenarios for rural and maritime development, these are areas where Government can pursue

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>partnerships and engagements with the private sector and development partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also planning to ease access to its services by digitizing some 
<br/>of its business processes.  It plans to make available online forms that are required for processing of 
<br/>applications to reduce processing time of applications and decision-making.  The Ministry is also 
<br/>embedding risk informed development as it attempts to mainstream Disaster Risk Reduction in its 
<br/>development programmes.  The world is now facing a number of development challenges or global 
<br/>risks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the beginning of the decade, when we are returning to the “new normal” following the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic, we had to face the brunt of the outbreak of the Ukraine war.  This brought 
<br/>another set  of crises in  food and energy.   In addition, we have observed the return of older risks 
<br/>namely,  inflation,  cost  of  living  crises,  trade  wars,  capital  outflows  from  emerging  markets, 
<br/>widespread social unrest, geopolitical confrontation and the spectre of nuclear warfare, and of course 
<br/>the growing pressure of climate change impacts and ambitions for transition to a 1.5 degrees celsius 
<br/>world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having mentioned all these, the achievement of sustainable development, 
<br/>including the Sustainable Development Goals will require the re-setting of rural development for the 
<br/>21st century.  This will require resetting of rural development for the twenty-first century.  This will 
<br/>require  re-settings  strategic  principles,  having  cross-cutting  programmes  and  developing, 
<br/>implementing, monitoring and improving sector-based policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, we are very much looking forward to the upcoming National 
<br/>Economic Summit discussions on the thematic area of Rural Development.  This is a forum that will 
<br/>enable stakeholders to provide their views and contribute to better designing our rural development 
<br/>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  give  the  floor  to  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  or  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>designate with a response.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>Ministerial Statement.  I wish him well and, of course, the plans that he has as well because we have 
<br/>a significant number of our people still living in the rural areas, as he has alluded to according to the 
<br/>2017 Census figure of more than 44 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also listened to his Statement about the National Poverty Level, I have heard it from two 
<br/>members of Government in recent statements, initially from the honourable Esrom Immanuel and, 
<br/>of  course,  this  morning  with  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management stating that the national poverty level is at 24.1 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Ah!  His seen the light now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- But perhaps you need to consult the Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Statistics because he does not agree with that figure - the national poverty figure of 24.1 
<br/></span><span>percent despite the report from World Bank, he said that that was cooked up within the government. 
<br/></span><span>So, he does not agree with that figure.  I asked him the other day but he did not respond.  I am waiting 
<br/>for it to come from his own mouth, but his going to talk about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again Rural Development is so important because we need to create 
<br/>the environment for our rural people because they deserve the best as well.  I know Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>that for us, that was always the statement from the then Prime Minister, let us leave no one behind.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Everyone in  Fiji  deserves the best  of what  the government  can 
<br/>offer within the resources that it has and I only hope that the government through the Minister and 
<br/>his Ministry will continue with that.  We will continue to have disasters, climate change and then the 
<br/>other external factors that will sort of provide that distraction, but again Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that 
<br/>they will continue, and of course, ensuring as well to create that better environment for our rural 
<br/>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we admit the fact that we did not do everything and we cannot 
<br/>complete everything.  The funding, therefore, is very important.  You can have all the plans, all the 
<br/>strategies but without the money you would not be able to fulfil those programmes.  He has talked 
<br/>about  a  few programmes that have returned to  the Ministry on Rural  Housing and  I  wish to  also 
<br/>commend  Government  on  the  initiative  to  shift  Rural  and  Outer  Island  Allocation  back  to  the 
<br/>Ministry because the Ministry knows that in the previous discussions, we have made suggestions 
<br/>particularly to the Ministry of Agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why not have the Ministry of Rural Development deal with the subsistence farmers and then 
<br/>once they become subsistence market  oriented and they can then be graduated to  the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture to deal with the semi-commercial and the fully commercial farmers as well.  We thank 
<br/>the Government for that initiative. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I urge the honourable Minister, this 
<br/>was our guiding document. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will not go into the list of people who contributed to this, under the working groups.  Maybe, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will just read out one, because they will say, “oh, that was a one-man document”; no it was not.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  The  challenge,  will  you  even  ever  purchase  one  Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vessel to add on to the fleet? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- There is a lot to cover in rural Fiji, of course, we will assist the 
<br/>honourable Minister and we will also ensure that our rural people are given the best.  There is so 
<br/>much to cover and five minutes is insufficient, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I thank you for this opportunity 
<br/>and I wish the honourable Minister all the best in the consultations that will be undertaken soon.
