<h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery as 
<br/>well as those watching the live proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for taking an 
<br/>interest in your Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming another group of PL100 students from 
<br/>the University of the South Pacific. Welcome to Parliament and I hope that you will enjoy and also 
<br/>learn something from today’s proceedings.  You are most welcome to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tabling of Written Responses  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  inform  honourable  Members  that  the  Secretariat  has  received 
<br/>written  responses  from  the  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration  to  Written 
<br/>Questions 9/2023, 10/2023 and 29/2023 asked by the honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua.  Honourable 
<br/>Members, the responses have been conveyed to the honourable Qereqeretabua and copies will be 
<br/>made available on the Parliament website. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to add that I thank you so much for the quickness in response to written 
<br/></span><span>questions, honourable Prime Minister and your team.  That is so reassuring, Sir.  Usually written 
<br/>questions takes a while before the responses are received and even acknowledged in Parliament as 
<br/>we see, but the quick responses so far just trigger the Speaker and the Secretariat to acknowledge it 
<br/>with great appreciation how quick the responses have been.

<div><span>Visitation-Medical Team 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, a medical team from the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services have set up on Level 2 to undertake medical check-up for honourable Members.  
<br/>Please do so, it is free and it is available. You honourable Members are very busy and health to some 
<br/>of us becomes secondary, but Parliament would like to see that we have these free check-ups when 
<br/>Parliament sits, so just make yourself available and present yourself to the medical officers on the 
<br/>top floor.
