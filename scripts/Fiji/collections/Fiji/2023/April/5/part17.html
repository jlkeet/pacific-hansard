<div><span>REVIEW OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORT  
<br/>ON COVID-19 COMPLIANCE AUDITS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 
<br/>Compliance Audits - Management of Unemployment Benefits, Management of Concessional 
<br/>Loan Packages to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) which was tabled on 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>September, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament.  Sir, as the 
<br/>Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and mover of the  motion, I take this 
<br/>opportunity to speak on the motion for debate on the Review of the Auditor-General’s Report on 
<br/>COVID-19  Compliance  Audit  on  the  Management  of  Unemployment  Benefits  as  well  as  the 
<br/>Management of Concessional Loan Package to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Review  Report  was  prepared  and  tabled  in  Parliament  by  the  previous  Standing 
<br/>Committee  on  Public  Account  in  the  last  term  of  Parliament.    In  this  regard,  I  thank  the  former 
<br/>Chairperson and Members of the previous Public Accounts Committee for this detailed Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Review  Report  follows  the  Report  of  the  Auditor-General  on  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Compliance Audit that was carried out and discussed yesterday and focused on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Management  of  Unemployment  Benefits  for  COVID-19  which  was  facilitated  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Economy and administered by the Fiji National Provident Fund in 2020; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Management  of  Concessional  Loan  Package  to  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(MSMEs). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  audit  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  functions  of  the  Auditor-General’s 
<br/>specified in the Audit Act of 1969 and Section 152 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, 
<br/>particularly  section 6(a) of the Audit Act of 1969 which provided powers to the Auditor-General to 
<br/>conduct compliance audits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Auditor-General carried out compliance audits on both 
<br/>programmes to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence and form a conclusion on whether in 
<br/>all material aspects, the processes and internal controls surrounding the programmes were adequate 
<br/>and effective in ensuring that only eligible people and MSME businesses benefit from the initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  in  addition,  the  audit  on  MSME  Loan  Package  covered  both  the  design  and 
<br/>implementation of the programme, including the review of the framework or policies and guidelines 
<br/></span><span>and the loan applications, assessments and approval process for concessional loans registered by the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Commerce, Tourism, Trade and Transport as at 23</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  very  brief  on  the  Committee’s  findings.    Firstly,  on  the 
<br/>Management of Unemployment Benefits.  There were significant findings identified during the time 
<br/>of the audit and this includes:

<div><span>        Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023

<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(7)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(8)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(9)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SOPs  were not designed  by the  Ministry of  Economy for disbursement  of assistance, 
<br/>process for unemployment  in the informal sector and  COVID-19 lockdown areas; 
<br/>Applicants who were still employed received Government subsidy; 
<br/>Double payment of FNPF and Government subsidy to eligible applicants;   
<br/>Government subsidy incorrectly calculated and paid out;  
<br/>Extra Government subsidy paid to approved applicants; 
<br/>Government subsidy paid to ineligible applicants; 
<br/>FNPF not providing system closure report for each payment phase;   
<br/>Incomplete informal sector approved applications still received payment; and 
<br/>Some approved applicants from the informal sector in the COVID-19 lockdown areas 
<br/>assisted by the Ministry of Economy also benefited from FNPF, Government Subsidy 
<br/>COVID-19 Formal Sectors Financial Assistance Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Sir,  on  the  Management  of  Concessional  Loan  Package  to  Micro,  Small  and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises, a sum of $15.2 million was allocated by Government and paid to FRCS for the 
<br/>purposes of Concessional Loan Packages during the financial year ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2020.  As of 8</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>October, 2020, a total of $13.4 million had been disbursed by FRCS to 2,220 MSME enterprises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  the  following  governance  issues  from  the  audit  findings  on  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management of Concessional Loan Package to MSMEs: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Assignment  of  roles  and  responsibilities  between  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  the 
<br/>Ministry of Commerce, Tourism, Trade and Transport was not clearly demarcated at the 
<br/>beginning of the programme;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>There  was  no  documentation  to  support  that  risk  assessment  was  performed  for 
<br/>programme implementation to identify  risks and internal controls to mitigate such risks 
<br/>in a systematic manner; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The  assessors  turnaround  time  of  seven  days  as  stipulated  in  the  Memorandum  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agreement was not met; 
<br/>It was not mandatory for assessors to declare any potential conflict of interest during the 
<br/>assessment of loan applications;   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The minimum assessment qualification scores as per the assessment forms, that is, 60 
<br/>percent  for  micro  business  and  80  percent  for  small  and  medium  businesses  was  not 
<br/>aligned with approved assessment qualification scores of 50 percent as per the COVID-
<br/>19 Concessional Loan Package Guide;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>The assessors scored did not have a bearing  on the loan amount approved for its business, 
<br/>therefore,  loan  applications  assessed that  were  eligible or did  not meet the 50  percent 
<br/>qualification score threshold were still approved; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>There were instances when loan amounts that were approved by the business assistance 
<br/>Fiji panel was different from the amount assessed and recommended by the assessors; and 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>There were instances when application forms were not signed-off by the receiving and 
<br/>verifying  officers  which  indicates  that  the  vetting  processes  was  not  strictly  followed 
<br/>hence contributed to the delay in the assessment process as the application submitted  were 
<br/>incomplete. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the lessons learnt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Committee recommended the 
<br/></span><span>following as at the date of the report. It was pleasing to note and heard from yesterday’s debate that 
<br/>responsible  ministries  and  departments  have  not  only  taken  steps  to  set  up  their  SOPs  but  also 
<br/>reviewing for improvements to the current ones.  The recommendations are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The  ministries  mentioned  here  or  any  ministry  in  the  future,  while  implementing  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programme or a new one to take heed of the lessons learnt and develop proper SOPs for  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>927 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future use; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee notes the challenges faced by the Ministry of Economy in implementing 
<br/>this programme during the COVID-19 period and recommends  that regular consultations 
<br/>with  the  stakeholders  and  review  the  Management  of  Unemployment  Benefits  and 
<br/>Management of Concessional Loan Packages issued to MSMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The  Committee  commends  the  Ministry  of  Economy  for  using  alternative  modes  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>payment for easier distribution of unemployment benefits to the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)  The Committee commends the concessional loan packages issued to micro small and 
<br/>medium  enterprises  towards  their  sustainability  during  COVID-19  pandemic  and 
<br/>further  recommends  to  continue  with  such  initiatives  in  the  future  should  an 
<br/>unprecedented event occur.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  in  conclusion  commended  the  COVID-19  Responses 
<br/>provided by the Government and the progress made by the responsible ministries and departments in 
<br/>addressing audit issues that were identified.  However, as I mentioned in the first review report for 
<br/>COVID-19 responses that was debated yesterday, for accountability and transparency purposes of 
<br/>public funds, the Public Accounts Committee will always examine all government programmes and 
<br/>expenditures to ensure that it complies with all relevant policies, procedures and legislations that are 
<br/>in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words as the Member moving the motion.  I thank you for this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Chairperson. The honourable Members the floor is 
<br/>now open for debate on the motion and before I offer the floor, I would like to inform you honourable 
<br/>Members that six honourable Members have registered their interest to speak on the motion and since 
<br/>this is a Government’s motion, the batting will be led off by the Opposition and then it will alternate 
<br/>that way until we complete the six.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Members are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Naupoto 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J.N. Nand; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Committee for the work 
<br/>that they are doing and coming up with the report that we are debating today.  I just like to use this 
<br/>opportunity Mr. Speaker, Sir, to share a little bit of something that happened during the COVID-19 
<br/>crisis that I think we can learn from given that we are asking ourselves now - what happens, what 
<br/>will we do and when the next one hits? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  pandemic  hit,  I  think  we  were  lucky  because  the  Ministry  of  Health  was  just 
<br/>towards the tail-end of their trying to contain the measles outbreak and I think the health officials 
<br/>will  know  that  the  way  you  deal  with  measles  outbreak  was  similar  to  the  way  you  deal  with 
<br/>containing coronavirus.  They were into isolation for those that found that had measles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>928 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  crisis  hit,  the  RFMF  very  quickly  offered  assistance  and  tagged  into  what  the 
<br/>Ministry of Health was already doing in doing contact tracing.  They taught us how to do contact 
<br/>tracing in isolation.  Very early we were told Mr. Speaker, Sir, by WHO that there was a lesson learnt 
<br/>from the </span><span>Ebola</span><span> crisis in Africa that when the frontline workers were going out to help the people that 
<br/>had </span><span>Ebola,</span><span> when they contracted the disease and came back to be treated, they found out that the 
<br/>facilities  were  full  from  the  patients  that  already  had  </span><span>Ebola</span><span>  and  that  made  them  reluctant  to  go 
<br/>forward and help the people who needed help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The RFMF took that up and we offered what was our court room for court martials.  Given 
<br/>that we have a level 2 hospital at QEB to buil0d a facility to look after our frontline workers, to give 
<br/>them assurance that if they get sick upfront, they know that they will always come back and these 
<br/>facilities are ready for them. So, now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a fully functioning and well equipped 
<br/>ICU facility at QEB.  I am not too sure whether the honourable Minister for Health has been to the 
<br/>facility, it is there for the nation and if the capacity for CWM ICU is full, there is always that facility 
<br/>available there that people can use. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, in a crisis you start off by reacting to what is happening and through that reaction you 
<br/>will learn some lessons and that will allow you to put plan in anticipation of what could be coming 
<br/>next, I know Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Health is listening, there is one room there also that 
<br/>has the machine for dialysis there is a little bit of work to be done and again I hope the Minister for 
<br/>Health can go and visit.  It will be good for the Ministry of Health to help complete that setup and 
<br/>again there is a reserve for our dialysis unit when patients needs dialysis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  given  I  was  very  much  involved  in  the  work  to  thank  the 
<br/>frontline  workers  who  worked  tirelessly  throughout  and  stayed  away  from  their  families  in  that 
<br/>pandemic time.  I thank their families also for enduring the time that they were away, they would 
<br/>look to, to look after them whilst they go and look after others.  Again, I thank the Committee and I 
<br/>support the motion that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion.  Small and Medium-
<br/>Sized  Enterprises,  they  are  a  key  role  in  job  creation  providing  two-thirds  of  all  formal  jobs  in 
<br/>developing countries and 80 percent in low income countries but in any crisis situation, they create 
<br/>jobs,  cash  flows.  They  understand  the  needs  of  the  time  and  can  easily  tailor  their  products  and 
<br/>services for the time.  We were told by the ILO and the government at that time that 120,000 jobs 
<br/>were lost in the formal and informal sectors mainly around the tourism sector.  Something like 30 
<br/>percent of women employed in lower income bracket in the sector lost their jobs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  loss  of  employment  during  the  pandemic  had  a  mega  impact  on  our  small  economy.  
<br/>Many of the breadwinners were supporting multiple families in their extended networks.  I met a 
<br/>parent who lost her income looking after 10 children only one was hers.  From maritime and interior 
<br/>areas  many  children  were  being  billeted  and  these  affording  families  were  hosting  them  to  be 
<br/>educated or to be employed. Shock of loss of jobs and the way it was done caused a lot of confusion, 
<br/>pain, depression and shame to many who were used to being the providers. For their dignity they 
<br/>needed quick support and alternative livelihood Mr. Speaker, Sir, but they could not access loans 
<br/>from  the  bank.  Many  struggled  to  pay  their  bills,  mortgage,  medical  and  needed  the  support  this 
<br/></span><span>package could have provided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Was this  support responsive at  that time?  Not entirely.   There were many requirements  - 
<br/>business  registration,  tax  ID,  business  plan,  cash  flow  projections  when  families  just  needed  an 
<br/>income to survive.  At a time like that when we needed to just enable and support those in need to 
<br/>find sources of income, they had to relearn how to do business. For example, a chef who lost his job 
<br/>ended up losing his home had five children. His wife remembered her sewing skills learned from her 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>929 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grandmother and she started doing patchwork but had to borrow a machine from neighbours  who 
<br/>was charging her rental.  An input of $1,400 worth of a commercial machine, she started making 
<br/>$500 a week selling her pieces to diaspora through social media pages and until then, she could find 
<br/>that $1,400 support through a Civil Society Organisation, the family had to scavenge to survive.  We 
<br/>discovered that those working in the hotel industry needed support in restarting food gardens, we 
<br/>heard yesterday about agriculture support and how it was done and the issues that were around it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  realise  when  we  were  on  the  ground  trying  to  support  people  and  I  was  working  for 
<br/>FRIEND, we were on the ground and we understood, many families who were working in the tourism 
<br/>sector on shift work were no longer gardening.  Some of the families in the Denarau area said they 
<br/>have not gardened for 20 to 30 years and they needed to re-learn some of these techniques and needed, 
<br/>other than seeds, some training, awareness and some support and mentorship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People  also  needed  mental  health  support  at  that  time  and  to  apply  for  this  support,  they 
<br/>needed  financial  literacy  around  cash  flows  which  was  a  requirement  for  this  application.    They 
<br/>required business planning et cetera, they could not just apply for the support.  At that time, if you 
<br/>remember the  reports  we saw increase in  scavenging,  increase in  sex work, we saw bartering for 
<br/>families to just be able to survive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A civil society organised listening exercise led by FRIEND and Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre,  
<br/>no eyes were dry in the room listening to the struggles of the people.  A mother shared how she could 
<br/>not afford to purchase medication for her child.  Another mother shared she lost her child because 
<br/>she could not afford medication and had to carry her child to the morgue herself as medical staff were 
<br/>stretched.  It was a very painful time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many civil society organisations came together to step in to provide medication, support to 
<br/>frontliners, provide food resources and livelihood support.  Sir, FRIEND provided hotlines for people 
<br/>to call for food, health support including patients with Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), St. Giles 
<br/>patients and NCDs needing COVID-19 care.  Whole of the country rose to support their nation come 
<br/>out of the crisis, never ever acknowledged by the previous government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank God for the many concerned citizens and diaspora who supported their families out of 
<br/>the crisis, helping their relatives start small enterprises and I acknowledge and thank the many donor 
<br/>partners including  the governments  of New Zealand, Australia, United  Kingdom, Ireland and the 
<br/>United States of America who worked with Civil Society Organisations to help provide quick and 
<br/>easy support to the people in need on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I visited a mother in Malolo Village in Nadi.  She learnt how to bake on </span><span>YouTube</span><span> after her 
<br/>husband lost his job in the hotel sector and she started selling cakes from a very small microwave 
<br/>oven, so she needed an oven.  With the micro support system, when she got an oven, she could make 
<br/>$200 a week easily by learning on </span><span>YouTube.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In crisis like that, our very talented population needed business support, finances, training, 
<br/>unregulated enabling environment that could have come about if the administration had taken time 
<br/>to listen to the people and their need.  There are many lessons learnt and recommendations in this 
<br/></span><span>Report that needs to be taken on board for or any government to be responsive to the needs of the 
<br/></span><span>common people, needs of micro enterprises who were not in the space for unending paperwork in a 
<br/>crisis like a pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Support to micro enterprises meant food on the table, bills, dignity at a time when there was 
<br/>a shock at economic level and a core of human level as frustration and depression set in.  It was a 
<br/>difficult time when people who were always in a high-level status, economic status found themselves

<div><span>       Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completely helpless.  There was an urgency and there was an urgent need for this service but it had 
<br/>to be relevant for the time.  There has been many lessons that has come out of the crisis and many of 
<br/>the recommendations from the Report makes a lot of sense and I support the recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Review of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audit in regards to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Management of Unemployment Benefits; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Management of Concessional Loan Package to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  requested  for  written  responses  from  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy, Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport (MCTTT) on the audit issues that 
<br/>were raised and after reviewing the responses received, it was agreed that two ministries to have a 
<br/>face-to-face public hearing session with the Committee.  Therefore on 17</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2022, the Ministry 
<br/>of Economy appeared before the Committee and presented the responses on the questions that were 
<br/>posed to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends that whilst the Ministry was implementing their 
<br/>programme take heed of the lessons learnt and develop proper Standard Operating Procedures  for 
<br/>future use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  highlight  the  work  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  at  a  time  when 
<br/>COVID-19 restrictions was in place and I would like to commend the work done by the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary of Economy,  Mr. Shiri Gounder and his team.  The Ministry of Economy designed the 
<br/>programme  and  developed  the  implementation  plan  for  the  MSME  Concessional  Loan  Package 
<br/>which was documented in a Cabinet Paper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  also  carried  out  consultations  with  the  Ministry  of  Commerce 
<br/>Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport,  Ministry  of  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations, 
<br/>Reserve Bank of Fiji, Fiji Institute of Accountants, Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation, Fiji 
<br/>Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, Women in Business, Fiji Revenue and Customs Service and the 
<br/>Office of the Solicitor General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following numerous consultations with all the stakeholders, the Ministry of 
<br/>Economy  designed  the  Concessional  Loan  Package  Programme  and  advised  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government that the COVID-19 crisis had significantly affected the MSME businesses and as such, 
<br/>many  were  struggling  with  cash  flows  as  revenue  levels  had  declined  due  to  weak  demand  and 
<br/>therefore many are finding it difficult to continue doing business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government through a Cabinet decision dated 4</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2022 
<br/>agreed  to  the  Concessional  Loan  Package  Funding  to  be  provided  to  Micro,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/>Enterprises (MSMEs) and resolved that the Memorandum of Agreement to be circulated to the Fiji 
<br/>Institute of Accountants, Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation, Fiji Chamber of Commerce &amp; 
<br/>Industry, Women in Business for assessment, verification and approval of MSME loan application 
<br/>and the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services for the disbursement and collection of loans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Ministry of Economy, the FijiFirst government for the first 
<br/>time had engaged the private sector professional bodies with the likes of Fiji Institute of Accountants, 
<br/>Fiji  Commerce  and  Employers  Federation,  Fiji  Chamber  of  Commerce  &amp;  Industry,  Women  in 
<br/>Business in such a manner and scale to carry out verification, assessment and recommend approval 
<br/>or otherwise for MSME loan application.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>931 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the arrangement was formalised with the signing of agreements with these 
<br/>agencies.  While the Ministry of Economy  was involved in  the initial planning  and design  of the 
<br/>programme,  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Tourism,  Trade  and  Transport  was  tasked  to  provide 
<br/>secretariat support and business advisory for applicants and be the lead ministry in the roll-out of the 
<br/>programme which involved receiving and sorting applications, maintaining records and storage of 
<br/>all loan application forms received and disseminating them to the respective organisations engaged 
<br/>to carry out assessment of the loan applications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  that,  MCTTT’s  role  was  also  to  advise  the  FRCS  of  the  approved  loan 
<br/>applications  for  the  disbursement  of  funds.    Sir,  MCTTT  has  also  developed  the  COVID-19 
<br/>Concessional Loan Package Guide which was approved by the Permanent Secretary of MCTTT on 
<br/>15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2020 to act as a guideline to support the implementation of the programme.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the Guide describes the process used for processing, assessment, disbursement and collection of 
<br/>funds under the Micro, Small, Medium Enterprises and COVID-19 Concessional Loan Package. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the Office of the Auditor-General noted that the Guide was not effectively used 
<br/>during  the  processing  of  the  loan  applications  as  discussed  the  Report.    Moreover,  there  was  no 
<br/>Memorandum of Agreement between the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport to 
<br/>clearly  demarcate  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  Ministry  in  rolling  out  the  programme. 
<br/>Absence  of  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  party  can  cause  accountability  issues  in  terms  of 
<br/>delivering the outcomes of the programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  executives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Ministry  of  Commerce, 
<br/>Trade, Tourism and Transport just provided clarification on technical issues raised by the Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General.  Most importantly, we acknowledge the two ministries effort in addressing the 
<br/>gap that were identified during the audit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these remarks, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the 
<br/>staff of the Ministry of Economy and all other ministries involved for their tremendous work and we 
<br/>all appreciate the commitment in providing the service during trying times.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully 
<br/>support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise just to provide contributions on the 
<br/>debate on the Review of the Auditor-General’s Report regarding the COVID-19 Compliance Audit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Joseph Nand has kind of stolen my thunder by talking to some of my points 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which I thank him for, which I means that I will be short. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, just a couple of things, again just reflecting on the Report, it is clear that we need to just 
<br/>have a think about what this Report can teach us or what they are telling us. I think the honourable 
<br/>Sashi  Kiran  who  has  left  room  was  probably  very  polite  in  her  contribution  today  because  as  is 
<br/>typical, the other side has always praised themselves for the work they have done in this space.   But 
<br/>if we listen clearly to what the honourable Sashi Kiran said, what she said was there quite a number 
<br/>of  people  who  were  not  assisted  properly  during  the  pandemic  and  it  was  left  to  the  NGOs  like 
<br/>FRIEND to actually assist.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, I will be brief because the honourable Nand has already stolen 
<br/>my thunder and also thank those that I thought I would thank.  But I think it is important, Sir, when 
<br/>we are in service and sometimes perhaps, we step back and realise that sometimes when we self-
<br/>praise, things are not perfect.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Sashi Kiran, actually what she said outside last night when we were having 
<br/>supper was a lot more damaging then what she kindly mentioned today.  There was actually a lot 
<br/>collaboration  happening  behind  the  scenes  without  the  knowledge  of  the  FijiFirst  government  in 
<br/>order to ensure that our people got the assistance they need.  So, perhaps it is a learning for us all as 
<br/>we are in public service and I hope that rather than indulgence in self-praise, we can self-reflect, learn 
<br/>and move the country forward together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also thank the Public Accounts Committee for the 
<br/>Review  Report.  As  mentioned  by  the  Chairperson,  the  Review  Report  specifically  looked  at  two 
<br/>issues: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)  Unemployment Benefits; and 
<br/>(2)  Concessional Loan Package to MSMEs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during COVID-19 it was crucial for the government to focus on saving lives 
<br/>and livelihood, unemployed people needed food on their table and as the government then, our effort 
<br/>was to minimise the economic impact as well.  Uncertainties were too many and MSMEs needed 
<br/>assistance to continue operations.  They were facing a high risk of folding up.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>agree  with  your observation  that the Office of the Auditor-General  stepped in  too  soon when the 
<br/>assistance was still been rolled out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  us  talk about  the situation. During  COVID-19, it was  not  normal,  it was  an abnormal 
<br/>situation. People were falling sick because of COVID, the quarantine periods were longer. isolation 
<br/>periods were longer and no one knew what, when COVID-19 would end. It was a deadly virus, life 
<br/>was at stake, civil servants were in fear and so many times just because one person had COVID-19, 
<br/>the whole building had to be quarantined, people were sent home - it was a very unusual situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can share one incident that I will never forget.  The incident is related to the opening of 
<br/>Nausori  Market.  There  were  so  many  COVID  cases  in  Nausori  market  that  it  had  to  be  closed, 
<br/>quarantined and then the staff who were looking after the market had to go through so many tests 
<br/>and so many of them were down. So this Saturday we had to open the market and there was literally 
<br/>no one available to really go and open the market because most of the staff were in quarantine and 
<br/>isolation.  We had to then use staff from Nasinu Town Council to go and assist and open the market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, you can imagine, it was a do or die situation and at that time the government could not 
<br/>force anyone; not a single staff to say that you have got to be here, we have to do this and this. It was 
<br/>impossible and not like the way zoom has developed.  Initial days, even the electronic devises were 
<br/>not that many and the people were not used to using zoom for communication, et cetera. So, it was a 
<br/>very difficult situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Despite the difficulty, every effort was made to assist the 
<br/>people during that period.  I recall the Ministry of Housing setting up Veilomani Food Bank and 
<br/>through this food bank we were assisting people living in informal settlements and again, Fijians are 
<br/>resilient. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We help one another. We help our neighbours. We help one another during crisis.  It is not 
<br/>just the Government, NGOs, religious groups and people living abroad, they all came on board; that 
<br/></span><span>is how we survived the situation.  One institution cannot because it is a pandemic.  Once in a hundred 
<br/></span><span>years we faced this.  No one had a blueprint, no one had a plan that if something like this will happen, 
<br/>this is how we are going to react.  But we have learned from this pandemic and there are lot of lessons 
<br/>we have learned and through this lesson, we are better prepared for the next time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Fiji’s always prone to natural disasters. We do come out 
<br/>and help our people whether it is individuals or even MSMEs and the lessons learnt from this COVID 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>933 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crisis, we can use that in developing better SOPs and structures so that in a crisis situation, no one 
<br/>has to really run around.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also tend to forget that during COVID-19 there were 
<br/>so  many  restrictions,  lockdowns  which  meant  that  one  could  not  do  the  normal  things.    I  heard 
<br/>honourable Sashi Kiran talk about why there was a need for paperwork?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Paperwork was required and then there were people to help to do all these work. For example, 
<br/>one could just go to any Legal Aid Office and this office is everywhere in Fiji.  One could go to the 
<br/>BDM Office or they can go to their District Office and there were people who could assist them in 
<br/>filling the initial form and submitting it.  But then on one hand she says that the paperwork should 
<br/>not  have  been  there,  but  on  the  other  hand  she  is  saying  that  more  training  should  have  been 
<br/>organised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With restrictions you cannot organise training.  I hope we all can understand the crisis and if 
<br/>you can reflect, when you heard the first case in your neighbourhood how we all panicked, I mean 
<br/>that was the crisis.  Do not expect normal things in a crisis situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, reading the verbatim, it is pretty clear that the institutions had developed 
<br/>SOPs, recovery of overpayment of FNPF. Sir, FNPF is recovering the overpayment of money that 
<br/>was disbursed and it would be interesting to see the final of the Auditor-General and then we can 
<br/>discuss the report further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during COVID-19, World Bank came on board and they helped the Ministry 
<br/>of  Economy  to  adopt  a  cash  transfer  operations  manual  for  the  Unemployment  Cash  Assistance 
<br/>Programme. So all these manuals are going to help further in any other crisis situation the country 
<br/>may encounter.  Once again, I want to thank the Committee for the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  had  some  very  good  contributions 
<br/>already.  The Report is in two parts – one, which was managed by the then Ministry of Economy 
<br/>(now  Ministry  of  Finance)  and  the  other  one  by  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and 
<br/>Transport at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just on the Ministry of Economy (now Ministry of Finance), I have been in the 
<br/>job for three months, I can tell you one thing about the Ministry.  We have a very competent, very 
<br/>determined and a very loyal Permanent Secretary.  When I talk about loyalty, Mr. Speaker, I talk 
<br/>about loyalty to the work. What I have  also found out, Mr. Speaker, in three months was that majority 
<br/>of the staff, I can  say with confidence within the Ministry are very hardworking staff, competent and 
<br/>again I can see their loyalty to the work.  That is how, Mr. Speaker, civil servants ought to be, loyalty 
<br/>must not be to individuals and that I think, Mr. Speaker.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You just realised?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am trying to tell you something. I am sure you are not that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dumb, honourable Usamate not to understand what I am saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that is why this Government is determined to stop any politicisation of the civil 
<br/></span><span>service of the kind that happened under the FijFirst government. We are told by people everyday 
<br/></span><span>now, how that was done. So I want  to  thank the Permanent  Secretary and all the staff who were 
<br/>involved in managing the COVID-19 crisis and if there is going to be any crisis of that nature or 
<br/>similar  to  that  nature,  I  am  confident  that  there  are  people  who  can  do  the  work  and  handle  the 
<br/>situation very well. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  I just wanted to  say one more thing and this is  very important.   Honourable 
<br/>Premila Kumar talked about it.  No audit, Mr. Speaker, is really a premature audit.  In fact, good 
<br/>audit officers around the world, I know where this whole idea of auditing started in UK many years 
<br/>ago.  They still practice this idea of auditing while the expenditure is being undertaken.  I know and 
<br/>understand that COVID was a very, very abnormal situation, I fully agree with that and not everything 
<br/>can be done in the way that you could do it in a normal time. However,  Mr. Speaker, sometimes the 
<br/>biggest  abuse  of  funds  happened  in  an  abnormal  situation.  We  have  seen  that  happening  in  this 
<br/>country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  were  dealing  with  the  Auditor-General’s  Report  after  2006  </span><span>coup  </span><span>when  we  got  into 
<br/>Parliament in 2014, we had this big pile of Auditor-General’s Report which was never made public 
<br/>and a lot of things happened during that period, Mr. Speaker.  So the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>is  a  very,  very  important  one  and  every  institution,  every  civil  servant  and  every  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary’s responsibility is to ensure that they co-operate and work with the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General and not, even if they have doubts about certain situations about what the Auditor-General 
<br/>does, that should never be a situation because the people who are responsible for managing the funds, 
<br/>they  will  have  an  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Public  Accounts  Committee,  they  have  an 
<br/>opportunity to respond to but the work of the Auditor-General should never be hindered by anyone 
<br/>including the Permanent Secretaries or Ministers.  I think this audit is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other point that I want to make and I think has been very well made by the Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister Kamikamica and I think honourable Premila Kumar also alluded to that.  This is what we 
<br/>are saying, Mr. Speaker, in fact the crisis was so unusual, it was so damaging that you can never 
<br/>expect a government alone to handle it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, even if it is a small crisis, for example if there is a flood in a particular 
<br/>area, cyclone and we have always seen this.  I have experienced this over the last 20 and 30 years as 
<br/>a student at the University of the South Pacific where we used to get into groups. I remember </span><span>TC 
<br/>Kina</span><span>, we were distributing food, water and governments at that time were very supportive. There 
<br/>was never any hindrance, there was never any criticism about the way in which NGOs, organisations 
<br/>and individuals were helping. I know, Mr. Speaker, during </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you are moving into the Western Division, you look at the number of people who were 
<br/>travelling  from  Suva  helping  people.    The  same  happened  during  COVID-19,  Mr.  Speaker,  why 
<br/>people  were  apprehensive,  why  people  were  afraid  of  getting  COVID-19,  there  was  equally  a 
<br/>determined approached by individuals, organisations to help people.  Even those who were having 
<br/>difficulty in overseas (our family and friends), millions of dollars were sent to Fiji and many of them 
<br/>are still sending. I know, Mr. Speaker, in supermarkets around the country, at least in Labasa in one 
<br/>supermarket thousands of families are still receiving support from their families outside of Fiji. If 
<br/>you look at the volume of remittances that are coming, it reflects the support that we got.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point that was raised by honourable Kamikamica and honourable Sashi Kiran supported 
<br/>slightly by honourable Premila Kumar is that the NGOs were on the ground. Unfortunately, there 
<br/>were unnecessary, undue criticism of some of the NGOs by the then Government and that was very 
<br/>unfortunately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, about unusual situations, </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and 
<br/>linking it to the Audit Report.  That is the point that I was trying to  make that audit in a unusual 
<br/>situation is very important. We had this support scheme for building houses after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>. In fact, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, I raised that in this Parliament.  There was a massive abuse of funds in terms of the 
<br/>support  that  needed  to  go  to  the  people  who  were  supposed  to  receive  that.    Three  hardware 
<br/>companies made a killing. Some of them didn’t reach the people who deserved that and those that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Auditor-General’s Report on COVID-19 Compliance Audits  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>935 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>got it, got it at a very high price because the system that was developed was designed for that kind of 
<br/>misuse and abuse... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we had an audit team at that time on the ground looking at how the 
<br/>hardware companies, what was happening, what volume of funds was getting there, where the people 
<br/>were getting the corrugated iron, nail, timber, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would have helped more people, 
<br/>we would have saved millions of dollars.  Just because we did not do an audit while it was happening, 
<br/>we did not discover that.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know the honourable Minister at that time then found out and two hardware companies were 
<br/>actually penalised by small amounts, a few million dollars but they actually made millions of dollars.  
<br/>It was a much bigger scandal than some of the ones that we talked about before like the agriculture 
<br/>scandal  in  the  late  1990s  where  people  were  talking  about.    But  that  played  into  insignificance 
<br/>compared to the scandal that happened in the last several years and including during </span><span>Tropical Cyclone 
<br/>Winston</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  conclude  by  saying  that  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has  now 
<br/>refined a very good Standard Operating Procedure, they are also looking at some of the systems that 
<br/>were there, it has been refined and I am sure that the payment systems and the way in which we can 
<br/>help people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One final point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which was pointed out by the Audit Report is also trying 
<br/>to understand or identify those who need the support, especially those in the informal sector.  So it is 
<br/>not always easy and I do not blame the government for that when they did that because it is not easy 
<br/>to identify who actually in the informal sector, the information is not there so some of the things that 
<br/>happened there, that is understandable.  That would happen under any government, or any process 
<br/>that you put in place to identify people that you want to help in the informal sector.  The Ministry is 
<br/>looking at that and hopefully there would be a much better understanding and data that we can use if 
<br/>there is an emergency or if there is a situation where it requires Government to provide help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accounts to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  all  the  Members  who  have 
<br/>contributed to the debate and most importantly the Committee noted the responses and actions taken 
<br/>by the responsible ministries and departments in addressing the audit issues that were highlighted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though there were some negative instances in the report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were 
<br/>some favourable commentaries as we move to prepare for such crisis such as the COVID-19 in the 
<br/>future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>RFMF has a hospital that could be used apart from the RFMF personnel who are used 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a lot in the crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>There is also a need for more help and consideration of flexibility for micro-businesses 
<br/></span><span>as they are the ones who are adversely affected most, especially those tied with NGOs 
<br/></span><span>such as  FRIEND, Council of Social Services, food banks, churches and the late Mr. 
<br/>Allen Lockington (RIP) et cetera, who stepped in to help during this kind of crisis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>To acknowledge the help of agencies including the World Bank in assisting the SOPs 
<br/>and  manuals  of  the  ministries.    However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  reiterate  what  I  have 
<br/>stated on Tuesday that the Public Accounts Committee looks forward to Government 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministries  and  Departments  to  learn  from  the  experiences  faced  during  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic and continue to improve the internal controls and governance systems and 
<br/>processes to be adopted when such crisis happens in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those final comments Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote to note the content of the report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  at  this  juncture  I  wish  to  inform  this  august 
<br/>Parliament that Parliament has now completed the debate on all Committee Reports that were re-
<br/>instated from the previous Parliamentary term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- </span><span>Vinaka! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There were a total of 21 reports.  I congratulate all honourable Members 
<br/>for your due diligence in discharging your oversight and representative roles, and I also keenly look 
<br/>forward to your continued enthusiasm during this first session of the Parliamentary term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been informed that the honourable Assistant Minister Jovesa Vocea is awaiting to cast 
<br/>his vote on what we are prepared to do and since he is quite busy there in India and he needs to attend 
<br/>another meeting or the closing ceremony immediately as well.  Based on that, as well as another 
<br/>message from the Government and the Opposition, I have been given to understand that the general 
<br/>feeling is to continue with the Questions and when it is all finished then Parliament can adjourn to 
<br/>have dinner.  The Government has also informed that they will not ask any supplementary questions 
<br/>therefore they request for only two supplementary questions for the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that is something that the Government has freely 
<br/>offered and I made my position known yesterday, the supplementary questions would be three and 
<br/>will  remain  at  that  even  though  the  Government  has  decided  that  they  will  not  be  offering  any 
<br/>supplementary questions.  So, that will be the position that we take whilst we continue. 
<br/></span></div>
