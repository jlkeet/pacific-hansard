<div><span>Formalisation of Informal Settlements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 65/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament 
<br/>on how Government is dealing with the formalisation of the 47 informal settlements that the 
<br/>previous government had begun processing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first I must thank the honourable Member for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the question.  Please, allow me to give some background on the question that has been posed to me

<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, upgrading is a mainstream government response to deal with the rise in the 
<br/>number of informal settlements due to urban drift or urbanisation.  However, prior to upgrading an 
<br/>informal  settlement,  consent  in  the  form  of  development  lease  is  often  sought  to  ensure  that 
<br/>Government rightfully enters into the land boundary and carries out development works.  It is also 
<br/>important to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the upgrading of informal settlements (I think I have also 
<br/>mentioned this in one of my earlier statements) contribute directly to Sustainable Development Goal 
<br/>11. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to Fiji Informal Settlement Situation Analysis Report that was 
<br/>published in 2016, it indicated that the official figure of informal settlements in Fiji was 250 with 
<br/>lesser number of large settlements but a greater number of small settlements.  In 2019, the Ministry 
<br/>in collaboration with UN Habitat and assistance from iTLTB and Ministry of Lands identified a total 
<br/>of more than 300 informal settlements.  This indicate the growth in urban areas being accommodated 
<br/>through informal settlements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important to note that informal settlement upgrade projects date 
<br/>back  to  2006.    It  was  formerly  known  as  Squatter  Settlement  Upgrading  Programme  and  later 
<br/>complemented by Town Wide Upgrading Programme in 2014.  Under the programme, there were 10 
<br/>development leases that were acquired prior to 2015. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2017, the Ministry of Housing further acquired 80 development leases, 
<br/>an additional 17 in 2018.  In 2020, one development lease was acquired, and in 2022, an additional 
<br/>2  which  resulted  in  a  total  of  48  development  leases.  Out  of  these  48  development  leases,  44 
<br/>settlements are located on </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land and four on State land.  The informal settlements are spread 
<br/>throughout Fiji with 13 settlements located in the Central Division, 14 in Northern Division and 21 
<br/>settlements in the Western Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, four out of the 48 development leases had surpassed its lease validity period 
<br/>of five years.  These were for Qauia in Lami which expired in 2020, Tomuka in Lautoka, Nakodi in  
<br/>Labasa and Varavu in Ba expired in 2022.  The Ministry is currently liaising with the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands  and  iTLTB  to  have  their  lease  renewed  in  order  to  proceed  into  preparation  works.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  20  development  leases  had  been  renewed  for  another  five  years  until  2027.    The 
<br/>remaining 24 development leases are still valid.  I wish to highlight that since the acquisition of the 
<br/>48  development  leases,  only  three  –  Cuvu  in  Nadroga,  Ledrusasa  in  Nadi  and  Waidamudamu 
<br/>Informal Settlement in Nausori have adjust their upgrades completed in 2022 (more than eight years 
<br/>after it was acquired). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  quite  unfortunate  that  upgrades  for  the  remaining  45  informal 
<br/>settlements that were acquired has still not proceeded to construction works over the last 8 years.  
<br/>This  is  due  to  no  proper  planning  carried  out  when  these  development  leases  were  acquired.  
<br/>However,  the  Ministry  has  progressively  planned  and  prepared  these  elements  for  upgrade.    The 
<br/>preparation  work  like  topographic  surveys,  scheme  plans,  Environmental  Impact  Assessments, 
<br/>geotech survey and engineering plans are part of the process.  At the completion of this preparation 
<br/></span><span>stage, construction work commences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  the  three  that  have  been  completed,  three  have  kindly 
<br/>commence construction in the current financial year.  These are the Sakoca Squatter Settlement in 
<br/>Nasinu which comprise about 174 households, Tavele in Nadi consist of 68 families our households 
<br/>and Field 4 in Lautoka comprising of 77 households altogether and estimated project cost is around 
<br/>$15.2. million. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  that  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  10  more  settlements  that  are  currently  in 
<br/>preparation phase - Tore, Lovu Seaside, Nabare and Delaisaweni Informal Settlements in Lautoka, 
<br/>Valeyaquyaya in Ba, Vunika in Labasa, Caubati and Wakanisila in Nasinu, Sasawira in Nausori and 
<br/>Nadonumai in Lami are earmarked to complete their engineering plans by end of this year  before 
<br/>they can progress into construction phase.  The total estimated cost is around $80 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The settlements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are earmarked to be completed over the next four years 
<br/>and  subject  to  budget  allocation.    It  is  very  interesting  to  note  that  the  remaining  32  informal 
<br/>settlements are in preliminary phase and most probably because they are in preliminary phases, they 
<br/>are most probably going to begin preparation works by the end of 2025 to the beginning of 2026. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  also  important  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  note  that  we  all  should  support  this  programme 
<br/>because it contributes to alleviating poverty, addressing climate change impacts and reduce inequality 
<br/>across  all  diversity  residing  in  informal  settlements.    Hence,  the  Ministry  will  continue  to  renew 
<br/>policies  and  implement  strategies  in  collaboration  with  our  stakeholders  to  improve  on  the 
<br/>implementation of the programme to ensure that it is effective and achieves the SDG Goal that Fiji 
<br/>is aligned to, while also providing security and long tenureship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have just mentioned earlier Mr. Speaker, Sir, like at the moment, we just completed only 
<br/>three out of the 48.  If there were proper planning done in the past eight years, minus one and half 
<br/>years  of  COVID-19,  we  could  have  done  better,  we  could  have  done  more  and  we  could  have 
<br/>upgraded more settlements.  That is what the Ministry is currently intending to do, so in the next four 
<br/>years, we are planning to at least complete the 13 settlements that were already identified.  It is a 
<br/>challenge for the Ministry and for the country, as I have already said, there are more than 300 informal 
<br/>settlements around the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very important that when these informal settlements were identified, there was no clear 
<br/>directive policy on which one should be prioritised and which one to be prioritised later.  As I have 
<br/>said,  there  are  more  small  settlements  in  most  of  these  are  informal  settlements  than  bigger 
<br/>settlements.  I was asked by the honourable Usamate on Qauia, unfortunately the development lease 
<br/>for Qauia has expired. We are currently liaising with the Ministry of Lands and iTLTB to try and at 
<br/>least give an extension to that development lease at Qauia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I allow supplementary question to be raised, I seek your indulgence 
<br/>again honourable Members if we could go straight to Question No. 6 with the approval of Parliament 
<br/>so we can get honourable Jovesa Vocea  to ask his question and then we will get back to this one. 
<br/>You still on the supplementary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Incentives for Rural Communities 
<br/>(Question No. 70/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and 
<br/>Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s  plans  to 
<br/></span><span>incentivise  rural  communities  and  use  mediums  such  Co-operatives  for  encouraging 
<br/></span><span>entrepreneurship? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you honourable Jovesa Vocea for the question.  In 
<br/>terms of how we are planning to incentives or encourage more co-operatives in the rural community, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just by way of background, the co-operatives have been operating in Fiji for some 
<br/>time, since 1940s and is one of the most enduring forms of business globally.  There are currently 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>939 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about 484 co-operatives operating in all four Divisions across Fiji and are involved in 14 different 
<br/>sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  co-operatives  operate  predominantly  in  wholesale  retail,  administrative  and  support 
<br/>services,  agriculture,  food  and  industry,  bank  real  estate  activities  and  transport.    I  was  just 
<br/>mentioning to the honourable Gavoka that we probably need to do a bit more in terms of tourism 
<br/>especially in the backpackers space where he was making some valuable comments today. Out of the 
<br/>484 co-operatives, 161, are in the Western Division, 138 in the Central Division, 129 in the Northern 
<br/>Division and 56 in the Eastern Division.  In summary, Sir, the co-operatives in Fiji hold about $132 
<br/>million worth of assets, revenue turnover about $18.1 million and cumulatively a net profit of around 
<br/>$2.5 million in the last financial year.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I did not quite appreciate this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we have more than 25,000 Fiji citizens 
<br/>who  are  members  of  co-operatives  and  these  numbers  are  continuing  to  grow.    Just  for  the 
<br/>information of Parliament since the Coalition Government forming, the request for the formation of 
<br/>co-operatives has increased significantly. let us say.  With over 65 co-operatives to groups, clusters 
<br/>from villages and communities and more than at least 20 have registered so far.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The mode of encouragement, Sir, that we are using, surprisingly just a word by mouth and 
<br/>talking a lot more in engaging across the Ministry, particularly focusing on some of the ministries 
<br/>that are very close to our people particularly the Ministry of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Affairs.  Not because the Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition and I are from Tailevu, but some of the initial interest has come from the Province 
<br/>of Tailevu and we are trying to encourage other provinces to have a look and start registering.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interestingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not informed the Cabinet so I held off on my Trade 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mission update some so once that is done than I will do more detailed update. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that I sort of rediscovered (if you like to use the word probably) is how 
<br/>successful the New Zealand has been in terms of agriculture through the co-operative model.  Two 
<br/>models in particular that are of note is obviously the Qera success story around a milk production 
<br/>and Zespri which is to do with kiwifruit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For a small island for New Zealand to be supplying about 30 percent of the supply of Kiwi 
<br/>fruit into the global market, it means that there is so much promise and potential in the co-operative 
<br/>model if they are set up well, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in terms of how we are trying to incentivise or encourage, obviously at the moment, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we are finding that just by communicating a lot more, interacting a lot more with the 
<br/>government agencies, interacting as well with the private sector which has come in in a big way to 
<br/>support some of the MSMEs initiatives that are currently in place. You would have noticed one of 
<br/>them is launch by the Bank of the South Pacific of cohort programme where they train at least 25 
<br/>entrepreneurs  every  couple  of  months.  These  are  then  encouraged  to  continue  to  setup  their 
<br/>businesses. Some are in co-operatives, some are working as individuals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I think to answer the honourable Vocea’s questions directly, I think if we just continue to 
<br/></span><span>focus on more collaboration. We do not need to put advertisements in the paper. I think the awareness 
<br/></span><span>and the keenness on the ground to form co-operatives is quite clear. Like I said, 65 awareness sessions 
<br/>in three months is not a bad outcome with 20 registrations so far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thought  I  just  share  one  positive  story  and  from  the  co-operative  module,  that  is  Wai 
<br/>Farmers’ Co-operative Limited in Ra.  The Co-operative comprises of 42 farmers in the Mataqali 
<br/>Wai in Burenitu Village in Ra and were assisted with a brand new tractor.  The Co-operative made a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>940 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cash contribution of more than $18,000 through one of the programmes, the Ministry contributed 
<br/>close to 56,000. The farmers who collectively owned 600 acres of land have been able to modernise 
<br/>their farms to increase farm yields and supplier farm produce on a weekly basis through their buyers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the co-operative members who currently owns one of the sugarcane farms and cassava 
<br/>was able to plant and harvest five times more cassava  and three times more from the used of the 
<br/>tractor.  Additional income, his greatly assisted his family and he is now able to plant more and reap 
<br/>the reward of his hard work.  So, like I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by continuing to target assistance to 
<br/>those that required assistance by collaborating more with the Ministry, we are keen to engage more 
<br/>with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs to 
<br/>see what can be done in the co-operatives. I think there are some significant potentials, Sir, to really 
<br/>activate the rural economy which is probably one of the areas where, I think, both sides of the House 
<br/>agrees that we need to activate a lot more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for your answer.  Just quickly, we do 
<br/>have quite a few success stories within the co-operative sector and we are talking about Lawaki, the 
<br/>Northland farmers, Lovia and Wai Farmers.  My supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, will you be 
<br/>engaging with these particular co-operatives, seeing as they have been flying our flag and have been 
<br/>really successful, to  assist  in  your quest  to encourage more in  other rural  and maritime areas?  It 
<br/>would be most definitely a good tool to use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, I hope you will seriously go and have a look at the Wai Farmers’ Co-operative 
<br/>because they wanted some trucks and they now want to get into the trucking industry and they are a 
<br/>shining example of what hard work can do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you honourable Koya for that question. I think one 
<br/>of the things that the team on the ground has always told me and it is common sense, is using success 
<br/>models breeds further success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To answer your question, yes, some co-operative farmers will continue  to be used as models 
<br/>for other farms or points of reference in terms of trying to encourage more of our people to get into 
<br/>co-operatives.  I know with some of the recent trips that have been happening, they have been taking 
<br/>along  the  success  stories  to  go  and  share  their  experiences  with  other  interested  farmers  or 
<br/>entrepreneurs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the other things  too  I thought I would mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  that,  we have 
<br/>noticed a lot of co-operatives, for want of a better word, a lot of the members have moved on and 
<br/>their co-operative is inactive.  Some of those co-operatives actually own some very good assets.  So 
<br/>one of the focus that we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to try and relook at those co-operatives, try and 
<br/>regenerate them and because they already have an asset base, use that asset base to try and develop 
<br/>some economy.  That is another opportunity too that we are exploring.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, co-operatives going back to the 1940s and interestingly enough, some of our 
<br/>eldershave actually  acquired assets, like the Kadavu Co-operatives have own some land in Vunisea.  
<br/>So, we are trying to see whether we can reactivate it.  We already have some large companies that 
<br/></span><span>are wanting to use that space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that I cannot ask three questions 
<br/>anymore but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, speaking of three, only three people showed up at the Fiscal Review 
<br/>Committee in Nausori.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Show some respect to the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>941 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I am talking to the Speaker.  Calm down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  question  I  have  for  the  honourable  Minister,  is  that  what  are  the 
<br/>commitments to enhance gender equality and social inclusion when incentivising rural communities 
<br/>for entrepreneurship? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure Parliament that, that 
<br/>is  an  absolute  focus  in  terms  of  how  we  are  conducting  ourselves  in  the  propagation  of  MSME 
<br/>opportunities  and as well  with  co-operatives.   Interestingly,  I  am  actually talking  to  quite a large 
<br/>financing organisation that is predominantly women.  They have 10,000 members and we are trying 
<br/>to see how we can partner up with them because they are already on the ground, they actually have 
<br/>small businesses and we can see how we can turn it into large businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Sharma, you have my assurance that it is part of the focus, it is a key KPI for the 
<br/>team in terms of how we conduct our business and hopefully, when we have some statistics we can 
<br/>report back in terms of the gender mix.  I think it is fair to say that a lot of the entrepreneurial activities 
<br/>at the moment seems to be happening with our women which is pleasing to see.  We will certainly 
<br/>continue to encourage that momentum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his  replies  to 
<br/>questions and the work that he is doing in co-operatives.  I can see that there is a continuation of the 
<br/>work. I have to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to forgive me my question is dumb because I have 
<br/>been referred to as ‘dumb’ in this Parliament this afternoon.  So, please forgive me if that happens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the island of Lakeba, Deputy Prime Minister, there is only one village co-operative left 
<br/>and that is on my village of Nasaqalau.  I must say that one of the things I found very useful is when 
<br/>the Commissioners or Ministers do their visits, in the last year people have come from Co-operatives 
<br/>to join those meeting in the </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> session, so I thought it was excellent way to get that message 
<br/>across.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will get back to the question.  In our co-operatives in Nasaqalau, we found that they had 
<br/>assets, but two things seem to be inhibiting them - not having the ability to look outside what they 
<br/>were  used  to  doing  and,  secondly,  the  cost  of  transportation  to  Suva.    So,  I  am  wondering  if 
<br/>incentivising, you are looking at anything to try to address that issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think you are talking about the successful co-operatives, some those might help expand that, 
<br/>but the other thing about the cost of transportation to Suva, would there be a possibility of looking at 
<br/>that as a way of incentivising co-operatives that are quite far away from the centre?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, honourable Usamate, for that question.  I think 
<br/>we are trying to target it at two levels . I think what is happening at the moment and you are probably 
<br/>not aware, there is a bit of collaboration with all the Ministries, to try and bring the market to the 
<br/>doorstep of co-operatives as opposed to them sending them to the main centre.  I think if we do that, 
<br/>that would be transformational and be successful.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other way of subsidising transportation, as you know Government has limited resources, 
<br/></span><span>and I will not go into the reason as to why it has limited resources.  We have talked about two of 
<br/>them in the last two days.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think what we have to do is just re-look at the model.  There has been a lot of good work 
<br/>that has gone in over the years but perhaps, bringing the market, particularly, the remote islands. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, creating the industry that is high yielding enough so that it can absorb the cost, something like 
<br/>virgin oil, some of these other produce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are certainly looking at that seriously in terms of how we can try and activate the rural 
<br/>economy.  There  are some initial  collaboration initiatives happening  that hopefully, will bring the 
<br/>buyers closer to the point of where production is happening in the islands and if that happens, that 
<br/>will  alleviate  the  issues  that  you  correctly  have  mentioned  because  as  we  all  know,  the  cost  of 
<br/>transportation out in the islands is just as astronomical.  Certainly, we will continue to look at it and 
<br/>for me, I am trying to just look at it a bit differently and try and push the buyer out to the island so 
<br/>that they absorb that cost in the process as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Now,  we  will  go  back  to  the  first  Oral  Question  and  we  are  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supplementary questions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.-  My supplementary question is, while the Government  is  dealing with  the 
<br/>formalisation of informal settlements, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament if there will be 
<br/>any relocation or displacement of current tenants?  Are there any plans to ensure that current tenants 
<br/>are not relocated or displaced?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the question.  One thing that 
<br/>should be clear is that this kind of subdivision we are doing something that is  called in-situ capital 
<br/>projects. I think I have already mentioned this because the occupier is already residing on the land 
<br/>and  what  is  normally  done  is,  we  try  and  do  our  way  around  the  area  that  you  are  covered  by 
<br/>development lease and in this case, the project.  From the subdivisions that have happened to date, 
<br/>there is no relocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What actually happens is that, if there is a Scheme Plan that needs to be done, it is a duty of 
<br/>whoever  is  drafting  the  Scheme  Plan  to  ensure  that  he  draws  the  Scheme  Plan  based  on  the 
<br/>arrangements that are there on the ground.  I think in a few areas, like in Qauia, because those areas 
<br/>are prone to flooding, they are exceptional cases where there will be central locations that will be 
<br/>required.  So, if there are issues for relocation, it is the duty of the Ministry to identify the land to 
<br/>relocate them before we can actually go in and do the formalisation of that particular settlement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just an issue there, he mentioned tenants and honourable Minister in your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reply, you mentioned settlers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- My apologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tenants.  These are the tenants 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are residing on these informal settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Interesting! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.-  Thank you, honourable Minister for the update.  You mentioned 
<br/>something  on  development  phase.    My  supplementary  question  is,  how  do  you  address  the  basic 
<br/>necessities  in  those  locations  in  terms  of  water,  electricity  and  perhaps,  the  roads  that  will  be 
<br/>constructed while awaiting because you mentioned that the development will await the budgetary 
<br/></span><span>allocation?  That is quite a long wait and a big task for your Ministry. How do you address those 
<br/></span><span>basic necessities while awaiting the full development of those locations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- One of the features of these informal settlements is that some of 
<br/>them have access to some of the basic utilities and when it comes to engineering plan a good example 
<br/>would be sewerage.  Those that have been easily connected to the main sewer line can be easily done 
<br/>but  for  some  settlements  that  do  not  have  proper  or  easy  connection  to  the  sewer  line,  there  is  a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provision  for  settlements  to  have  a  common  sewer  while  at  the  same  time,  they  also  provide 
<br/>connections for future connections to those sewer lines that they have to create, if there is an extension 
<br/>by WAF to cover those areas that are about to be developed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-    I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his  response  to  the  various 
<br/>questions that was asked.   It is quite interesting listening to you giving your update.  This is precisely 
<br/>where FijiFirst had ended, so your update was basically the work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My supplementary question is, what new things have you done in the last three months in 
<br/>acquiring the development lease, particularly Cunningham Stage 1 to Stage 4 which was in discussion 
<br/>stage?  Where you able to conclude that discussion?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- That is a very good question and thank you, honourable Member, 
<br/>for asking.  I had said that we are reviewing the process - the actions we need to take because there 
<br/>were some consultations done for those settlements but they were never completed.  So, this is some 
<br/>of  the  things  that  the  Ministry  is  currently  doing  to  ensure  that  we  also  cover  those  areas  also 
<br/>mentioned by the honourable Member and also identify some more new areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue here is that, there is a mix between bigger settlements and those in small settlements.  
<br/>So, we are trying to get in some kind of good mix so that we will be able to cover a lot of areas in 
<br/>ensuring that we are able to formalise some of the settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, we are in the process of reviewing.  We are trying to focus on whatever has 
<br/>been done and have them  cleared.  We cannot be acquiring new leases when we have leases that are 
<br/>there and needed to be attended to because if we keep on acquiring and do not attend to those, then 
<br/>we would keep on be extending some of those development leases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noticed that before, iTLTB used to give 10 years but now, they are limiting it to five 
<br/>years and they will only do that if you have not been attending to the upgrades.  These are some of 
<br/>the issues that we need to consider before we acquire more development leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to School Support Payment  
<br/>(Question No. 66/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable  Deputy  Prime Minister and  Minister for  Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  update  Parliament  on  the one-off  $200  per 
<br/>child back to school support payment to all students from Early Childhood Education (ECE) 
<br/>to Year 12? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PRO. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question. Just by way of background, Mr. Speaker, within two weeks of the Coalition Government 
<br/>under the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, we recognised that families were struggling 
<br/>and going through a tough time and to help ease that financial burden on Fijian families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Finance rolled out the Back to School Support in January to assist parents 
<br/>and guardians purchase school items like school bags, shoes, stationery, books, lunch boxes and other 
<br/>supplies for the children for the school year 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>944 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the support for students in ECE, primary and secondary, up to Year 13, 
<br/>support was provided per student basis for families earning less than $50,000 in combined annual 
<br/>household income.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Finance, Mr. Speaker, worked very closely with the Ministry of Education 
<br/>and I want to thank the honourable Minister for Education and his staff, for coming out, even though 
<br/>(principals and head teachers, I want to thank all of them) it was a holiday but they all came back to 
<br/>the  schools  to  ensure  that  the  application  forms  were  available.    It  was  also  available  online  and 
<br/>parents  and guardians were required to  fill  those forms  and submit them.  There was ample time 
<br/>given, Mr. Speaker, a time of two weeks to lodge their application and the whole process of applying 
<br/>was very successful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  total  of  224,825  applications  were  received  from  the  parents  and  guardians  from  every 
<br/>corner of Fiji,  and the  Ministry of Finance paid $44.5 million  to  222,682 eligible students.    This 
<br/>timely support was critical in ensuring that our children were well prepared and equipped for the new 
<br/>school year with few hassles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also generated a lot of economic activity and the feedback we got from 
<br/>the business community throughout the country was that, because of the timeliness and the point at 
<br/>which the payments were made, parents and guardians mostly used it for the purposes that it was 
<br/>given. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, in order to make it more convenient, more than 98 percent of the payments 
<br/>were made through mobile digital wallets (M-PAiSa and MyCash).  We also partnered with Post Fiji 
<br/>Limited to roll out assistance for those students in the interior and maritime islands.  So, we send the 
<br/>money through Telegraphic Money Orders (TMOs) and all those students who were eligible in the 
<br/>maritime islands and in the interior areas were also able to access the funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to give a background of the areas in terms of assistance, 50,671 students were from Suva; 
<br/>40,251  students  were  from  Lautoka/Yasawa  Zone;  39,902  students  from  Nausori;  23,410  from 
<br/>Macuata/Bua Zone; 16,231 from Cakaudrove; 16, 091 students from Ba/Tavua Area; 15,042 from 
<br/>Nadroga/Navosa Area; 11,571 from the Eastern Division; and 9,540 students were from Ra. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  once  again,  I  want  to  thank  all  the  dedicated  staff  from  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Finance, including the Permanent Secretary, who led the whole process and also the staff from the 
<br/>Ministry of Education (as I have said before).  I want to thank, again, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Education for facilitating and thank all those head teachers, principals and school management who 
<br/>came in and ensured that all our students were able to apply on time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>his  answer  and  thank  him  for  increasing  the  payment  by  $20  that  was  given  by  FijiFirst  for  the 
<br/>students to go back to school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming back to the policy, I believe the honourable Minister was part of the team that used 
<br/>sit on this side and always comment  on the fact  that when we talk about Tuition Fee Free,  they 
<br/></span><span>always  say it was not    free because lunch was not  provided to  the students.   Can the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister inform Parliament if there is plan to provide lunch for the students when they go to their 
<br/>schools? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as usual, they sometimes ask good questions 
<br/>but they muddle it up with all kinds of stupid statements about what happened before and where it 
<br/>happened.

<div><span>945 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just tell honourable Maharaj that I 
<br/>remembered  everything  I  said  in  this  Parliament  before.    What  I  said  was  and  what  they  were 
<br/>bragging and some of them quite dishonestly were bragging, including him that FijiFirst was the first 
<br/>government ever  to provide scholarships and free education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I kept telling them that I am product of fee free education scheme in the 1970s and 1980s.  I 
<br/>studied on full government scholarship, but sometimes I think the way they talk that the sun started 
<br/>shining in this country since FijiFirst came into power  and somehow they have this weird sense of 
<br/>propaganda planted into their mind that it is only when FijiFirst … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, today I have been  called dumb.   The honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member here has been called stupid.  The question is very simple, please, answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I did not say stupid to anyone, all I said was that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there were stupid comments and I am entitled to say that if the comments are stupid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  simple  answer  to  honourable  Maharaj  is,  that  is  a  good  question.    In  many  countries 
<br/>where parents have difficulty providing appropriate lunch for their children.  That is something that 
<br/>we need to discuss and consider in certain areas for certain categories of income households and I 
<br/>am open to the idea.  That is something that we should look at in consultation with the Ministry of 
<br/>Social Welfare and the Ministry that looks after the children.  The question was quite sensible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And I appreciate that.  The comment was stupid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Back to School Support was provided to students and 
<br/>parents  at  the  beginning  of  Term  1  and  money  that  was  given  to  them  was  utilised.    Can  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister inform Parliament if similar support will be provided in Term 2 
<br/>and Term 3? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member has spent a lot of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time in the Ministry of Education and he knows that the beginning of the school year is one time.  
<br/>Beginning of school terms are different, three times.  I do not know what he means, but let me just 
<br/>say in relation to that question and perhaps wrap it up with others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talk about some of these supports, none of them talked about that  in the last session and 
<br/></span><span>this session.  They ever said how good and how timely the support that the Government provided to 
<br/>their students for back to school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know some of the programmes they rolled out.  One of the things that we have learnt from 
<br/>them  is  sometimes,  they  come  up  with  good  policies,  no  doubt,  but  the  implementation  and  the 
<br/>execution of their policies was a disaster. We remember the Wheat Bix and the Milk Programme, all

<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these failed because they just did not know how to implement and execute it. So, that is the point I 
<br/>want  to  make  in  relation  to  the  earlier  comment  by  honourable  Maharaj  and  the  comment  that 
<br/>honourable Hem Chand has made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The programme was for the beginning of school year because that is when the parents faced 
<br/>most difficulties. Once the school starts in Term 1 and Term 2, I think that is manageable but these 
<br/>are things that we can discuss and talk about.

<div><span>Equal Distribution of Lease Money 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 67/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts inform 
<br/>Parliament whether the Government will continue with the equal distribution of lease money 
<br/>that was implemented by the previous Government?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, be informed that the honourable Minister for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei Affairs has already given notice that he will be providing the answer in the </span><span>vosa vaka Viti</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. The issue of 
<br/>equal  distribution  of  lease  money  has  been  an  issue  for  the  iTaukei,  especially  for  the  </span><span>Vanua</span><span>
<br/>leadership since 2015. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTaukei land is owned communally. In some provinces, it is owned by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mataqali,</span><span> some </span><span>i Tokatoka</span><span> and some are owned by the </span><span>Yavusa.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, Mr. Speaker, allow me to speak in the vernacular, just to explain the system in which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the equal distribution of lease money has been carried out from 2015 to date.

<div><span>[Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a question.  Honourable Minister, thank you for your answer.  From 
<br/>what I understand from your speech is that the equal distribution will continue, until the Board 
<br/>will decide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have a question, you did mention about the challengers with the equal distribution of lease 
<br/>money. You mention about individualism in itaukei life. I do not understand you will answer 
<br/>to those concern.  My concern is that leaders need money to lead, my concern is that leaders 
<br/>will need money to lead.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>949 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question, in order to adress those issues, and that there will be no segregation due to lease 
<br/>distribution, are there programs  by the Ministry  to  address the issue and  awareness  to the 
<br/>people to know their roles. To assist leaders in investment, their wealth, that they are happy 
<br/>with it and are served properly, this is to avoid selfishness. That is my question.]  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- </span><span>Au vakavinavinaka vakalevu ena taro.  Ena gauna oqo, na veika beka ga e

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> [Thank  you,  for  the  question.  The  main  concern  of  traditional  leaders  nowadays  is  when 
<br/>traditional obligations are vested on them. Before, the people use to work with leaders, the 
<br/>distribution of lease money easily assist with traditional obligations like funerals and chruch 
<br/>obligations. Now that the lease is being distributed equally, it is hard for them to carry out 
<br/>traditional obligations, especially those that have shared do not reside in villages. They reside 
<br/>at their workplaces or leave abroad. Today, it is those that reside in the village that carry out 
<br/>the vanua obligations.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>reply.  I am glad to see that the matter is still under review, I disagree with some of the issues that he 
<br/>has raised, linking the difficulty of filling chiefly positions with not being able to get a higher portion 
<br/>of the lease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I come from the island of Lakeba, my village – Nasaqalau, we do not receive any lease money.  
<br/>We are the only village, </span><span>mesa vakadaberi kina na neitou Liuliu ni Yavusa</span><span> (to have installed our tribal 
<br/>leader), so I beg to differ on that particular point.  But what I would like to ask, the current way in 
<br/>which this distribution has been done is making a huge change on the lives of children and the young.  
<br/>So, I would suggest that if we are going to carry out that review and ask for the opinions of iTaukei, 
<br/>please, ask every single one.  Ask the young, ask the parents of the young, some of whom when they 
<br/>reach the age of 18 years old, they had enough money to pay for their education or buy a house.  So, 
<br/>if you are going to make that survey, is that something that you are going to do, or is it just going to 
<br/>be talking to a selected few?  I request the honourable Minister just to give some advice on that? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> [Thank you.  The Ministry will try to look at the broader issues about the itaukei. They are 
<br/>happy that lease money are shared equally. We will also need to look at the issues faced by 
<br/>those that serve the vanua. That will be proposed by TLTB to the Board, for them to see some 
<br/>alternatives,  or  the  leaders  and  people  to  propose  some  alternatives.  And  for  future 
<br/></span><span>generations to be aware of. These are some issues that will need great emphasis.]

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, prior to the piloting of the equal rent distribution policy, 
<br/>one major issue that arose that was that the Turaga ni Mataqali or Turaga i Taukei would not share 
<br/>the lease money with the members of the landowning unit.  </span><span>Na i tuvatuva cava beka e tiko me na

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[I know that some use those money in a corrupt way. The issues is with those people and try 
<br/>to address the issues with with them. There are to be taught on the proper ways of utilising 
<br/>lease contributions and its main purpose is to serve the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would just like to get some clarification from the 
<br/>honourable Minister as a tenant, at the moment, we have a pool of lease money that is distributed 
<br/>equally to everyone – landowners.  If he is going forward to actually increase the amount that is given 
<br/>to the chiefs, my simple question would be, whether there is a going to be a decrease from ordinary 
<br/>iTaukei people who are receiving the money, or there is going to be an increase in the lease to cater 
<br/>for that increase that is going to be given to the chiefs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Perhaps,  if  I  may  reply  to  that,  honourable  Member.    The  honourable 
<br/>Minister has stated that he wants to review the process.  Honourable Tuinaceva has touched a bit on 
<br/>that, so they are reviewing the process.

<div><span>Update on the 16</span><span>th</span><span> Session of CCNASWP 
<br/>(Question No. 68/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on the 
<br/>16th Session of the Codex Committee North America and South West Pacific (CCNASWP) 
<br/>which met from 30</span><span>th </span><span>January, 2023 to 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member and I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By way of background the Codex Alimentarius or Food Code, is a collection of standards, 
<br/>guidelines and codes of practice adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The Commission 
<br/>is an intergovernmental body, whose aim is to implement the joint Food and Agriculture Organization 
<br/>of  the  United  Nations  (FAO)  and  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  Food  Standards 
<br/>Programme.  The principal objective is to protect the health of consumers and to facilitate the trade 
<br/>of food by setting international standards and other tax which can be recommended to Government 
<br/>for acceptance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Codex  is  important  as  it  is  recognised  in  the  World  Trade  Organization 
<br/>(WTO)  Agreements  as  the  international  reference  point  for  safety,  quality  and  fair  trade  in  food.  
<br/>Codex Standards may also be used as benchmarks in WTO dispute settlement processes.  The WTO 
<br/>members that wish to apply stricter food safety measures then those set by Codex, may be required 
<br/>to justify these measures scientifically. Sir, WTO member countries are also required to harmonise 
<br/></span><span>their national food safety measures with Codex standards.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>951 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  move  to  the  Codex  Committee  North  America  and  South  West 
<br/>Pacific (CCNASWP) proper as per the question posed by the honourable Member.   Fiji  took  the 
<br/>leadership role as the Regional Coordinator for CCNASWP in November 2020 during the Codex 
<br/>Commission’s 43</span><span>rd</span><span> Session.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Regional Coordinator Fiji recommended to the Commission for the development of global 
<br/>standards for products of interest to the region and those products that have an international market 
<br/>potential  in  the  future.    Two  such  projects  Fiji  leverage  through  its  leadership  role  were  kava</span><span>
<br/>(Yaqona</span><span>) when mix with water and noni juice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji hosted the 16</span><span>th</span><span> Session of CCNASWP from 30</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023 to 3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>February, 2023 at the Sheraton Fiji Golf and Beach Club in Denarau Island in Nadi.  The Ministry 
<br/>was allocated $89,350 for hosting this event, and I would like to thank the Fiji Government for the 
<br/>tremendous support.  The event was co-funded by FAO and WHO, WFP, PHAMA Plus and other 
<br/>line Ministries, including the Ministry of Health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was the first international event hosted by this Government since taking 
<br/>leadership of this country.  At this juncture, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for 
<br/>his support and the Deputy Prime Minister for opening the meeting.  I would also like to thank the 
<br/>Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence for their support in making 
<br/>this event a success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Permanent  Secretary for  Agriculture Chaired the weeklong  session.   The session was 
<br/>attended in person by delegates from 12 member countries in North America and the South West 
<br/>Pacific, six member countries from other regions, one member organisation from outside the region 
<br/>and two Observer organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  Chairperson  of  the  Codex  Alimentarius 
<br/>Commission, Mr. Steve Wearne, also attended the session in person.  Other high-level delegates that 
<br/>attended  the  session  included  those  from  the  FAO  and  the  United  Nations  FAO  Sub-Regional 
<br/>Coordinator for the Pacific and the WHO Representative to the South Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the outcomes of the session.  The two main agenda of particular 
<br/>interest to the region that were discussed and brought to closure were the regional standards for </span><span>kava</span><span>
<br/>when mixed with water, as I have already stated, and the regional standard for noni fermented juice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to have a standard adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, 
<br/>there are eight steps to go through.  The regional standard for </span><span>kava</span><span> when mixed with water was at 
<br/>step 5 for the last 10 years, and to arrive to this step 5 was quite a journey.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the 16</span><span>th</span><span> session of CCNASWP, Fiji in collaboration with Vanuatu presented the SOP 
<br/>for the determination of </span><span>kavalactones</span><span> and flavokavain in fresh and dried </span><span>kava</span><span> products.  This was 
<br/>finally adopted by CCNASWP as the regional standard for </span><span>kava</span><span>.  Mr. Speaker, CCNASWP 16 agreed 
<br/>to submit the developed SOP to the Codex Commission on Methods of Analysis and Sampling 42 
<br/>by 1</span><span>st</span><span> May,2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This SOP will ensure that Steps 6 and Step 7 are omitted and the process is accelerated and 
<br/>that  the  regional  </span><span>kava</span><span>  standard  is  adopted  at  Step  8  in  the  upcoming  Commission  meeting  in 
<br/>November 2023.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  adoption  of  the  standard  at  Step  8,  Fiji’s  chances  will  increase  to  tap  into  other 
<br/>potential markets, away from traditional markets, as Codex Standards are acceptable globally and 
<br/>there will be no barriers to trade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the regional standard for Noni fermented juice, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was sitting at Step 4, 
<br/>even before the regional standard for </span><span>kava</span><span> when mixed with water was initiated.  In the CCNASWP 
<br/>16, the Committee adopted it to Step 5 and further agreed to make submission of the draft standard 
<br/>to CAC 46 for adoption at Step 8. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, the Regional Coordinators Office is  working  closely with  Samoa and Tonga to 
<br/>have  a  written  submission  to  the  Codex  Committee  on  contaminants  in  foods  and  the  Executive 
<br/>Committee  of  Codex    Alimentarius  before  1</span><span>st</span><span>  May,  2023.    The  submission  will  include  the  high 
<br/>performance liquid chromatography method to identify </span><span>scopoletin</span><span> and </span><span>dithiodiglycolic</span><span>  acid due to 
<br/>advantages in accessibility of analytical equipment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I apologise for the technical terms, Mr. Speaker, I hope I have not sworn at anyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We thought you are in a different planet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  High  sensitivity    compared  to  the  thin  layer  chromatography 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>method and capability to produce quantitative data.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, CCNASWP 16 also discussed proposals on new Codex work on breadfruit 
<br/>flour, garlic nut and fish products as possible topics for regional development.  Member States also 
<br/>agreed on the need for technical support in food safety actions to aid and complement Codex actions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  CCNASWP  16  applauded  Fiji  for  its  excellent  work  and  unanimously 
<br/>decided to renominate Fiji as Regional Coordinator for the NASWP region for the second term of 
<br/>three years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  was  the  first  member  in  the  world  to  kickstart  the  Codex  16</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>Anniversary Celebrations as part of Standard.  The Codex Committee Secretariat after every event 
<br/>conducts an evaluation exercise and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am proud to say that this event was rated as 
<br/>one of the highly successful events hosted by any CCNASWP member country.  And remarks from 
<br/>the top officials of the Codex Committee Secretariat who travelled from Rome says it all, that Fiji 
<br/>raised the bar to the next level.

<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  as  the  Regional  Coordinator  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>representative of 14 countries will attend the CC Executive Committee in Geneva in June 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, first let me thank and congratulate the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for pursuing the work on Codex.  Again, it gives us hope, huge potentials, particularly for 
<br/></span><span>our rural farmers.  My question to the honourable Minister is, I have noted that CCNASWP is now 
<br/>shifting to North America and South-West Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You would recall, honourable Minister, when we started Codex, our Ambassadors in Brussels 
<br/>were very much in  the lead, particularly  Roy Mickey Jnr of Vanuatu,  we were focusing on ACP

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>countries.  This is a new market segment.  I just wanted to know how are we now with the initial 
<br/>focus which was on ACP countries, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T. K. RAYALU.- During the CCNASWP Meeting, there was no mention of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ACP region, but we will try and find out and come back to you on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Codex definitely in  a developing standards for 
<br/>food safety and addressing pesticide residues and antimicrobial resistance, the Codex Food Safety 
<br/>Standard aims to help overcome some of these trade barriers that we experience. My question to the 
<br/>honourable Minister is that a working group has been developed to establish the ground work call 
<br/>the National Codex Committee in Fiji.  He has enlightened us on the budget of the event but has a 
<br/>budget been allocated to the National Codex Committee or how will they be financed to reach their 
<br/>outcomes?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- The Codex Committee is a normal programme for the Ministry 
<br/>in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, so it is a normal operating activity 
<br/>for the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  I just ask another question and thank you for this opportunity, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. It is just on the work on the </span><span>Kava </span><span>Standards and we were supposed to have a </span><span>Kava</span><span> law 
<br/>as well in order to support that.  How are we on that, honourable Minister?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps,  you need to warn those who consume a lot of </span><span>kava</span><span> too about the danger of </span><span>civicivi. </span><span>
<br/>You talked about the lactone because that is the harmful substance in the grog that can damage the 
<br/>liver.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-.    Mr.  Speaker,  there  was  a  </span><span>Kava</span><span>  Bill  developed  but  I  cannot 
<br/>ascertain whether the </span><span>Kava</span><span> Bill has reached Parliament yet or not, but I will find out and inform the 
<br/>honourable Member.

<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  inform 
<br/>Parliament  on  what  guideline  was  used  in  the  recent  appointments  of  Chairpersons  of 
<br/>respective Government Statutory Boards? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question on 
<br/>what guidelines was used in the recent appoints of Chairpersons of respective Government Statutory 
<br/>Boards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members know that there are standing rules and laws that direct 
<br/></span><span>the appointment of Board of Directors on Government companies and statutory bodies and they play 
<br/></span><span>a crucial role as they provide oversight and strategic directions to ensure improved performances in 
<br/>service deliveries of those bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The selection of the Board of Directors, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Government companies and 
<br/>statutory bodies is subject to the relevant laws, including the Public Enterprise Acts 2019, as well the

<div><span>Under the Public Enterprises Act 2019, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the appointment of Boards, such as 
<br/>Tourism Fiji, Civil Aviation of Fiji, the Land Transport Authority, Water Authority of Fiji is done 
<br/>by the Minister for Public Enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current legislation concentrates the power of appointment to a single Minister rather than 
<br/>to  the  respective  line  Ministries  and  Ministers,  who  have  the  expertise  and  also  the  overall 
<br/>responsibility for the performance of those Boards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The responsibility of appointing Boards, we believe, should be aligned to the assignment of 
<br/>portfolios for each Ministerial appointment.  I have also heard from the honourable Cabinet Ministers 
<br/>in Cabinet where I now lead and we intend to address this matter in the coming months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the current appointment processes and appointing authority, under the 
<br/>Public  Enterprises  Act  2019,  entities  are  divided  into  two  categories  -  Schedule  1  are  entities 
<br/>designated as public enterprises under the Public Enterprises Act 2019; and Schedule 3  lists statutory 
<br/>bodies where operational  oversight  rests with  the line Minister but  the Board is  appointed by the 
<br/>Minister for Public Enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the powers given to the Minister for Public Enterprise under the Public Enterprises 
<br/>Act as amended in 2019, I believe, it is appropriate to consult with the respective line Minister to the 
<br/>appointment under Schedule 3 and this process has been followed by the Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Appointments in 2023, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to now talk about the guideline that was 
<br/>used in the recent appointment of Chairpersons of respective Government statutory Boards.  This 
<br/>guideline is being implemented right across the board in all the Ministries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure the appointment of Board and Directors follow a transparent process, Government 
<br/>has  implemented  a  guideline  for  Merit  Based  Selection  and  Appointment  Processes  Board  of 
<br/>Directors Guideline.  This Guideline was shared with all Ministries on 27</span><span>th</span><span> of February, 2023 s as  a 
<br/>benchmark in their respective board appointment processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Guideline incorporate a transparent Board appointment and re appointment process. The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>requirements include but are not limited to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>All Boards should meet the minimum number of directors at all times as stipulated in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relevant legislation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>When a vacancy arises on the Board of the Government company or statutory body or a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>current member term is about to expire, the appointing agency shall identify. 
<br/></span><span>i.</span><span> </span><span>Skills, knowledge and expertise currently represented on the Board; and 
<br/></span><span>ii.</span><span> </span><span>Skills, knowledge and expertise required to fill the skills gap on the Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Advertising for Expressions of Interest can take place and consultation with the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister and the relevant Minister and Permanent Secretary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The  Minister  in  consultation  with  the  Prime  Minister  subject  to  Coalition  Government 
<br/>Agreement may recommend nominees for consideration by the appointing authority.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>955 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Guideline  promotes  diversity  and  encourages  more  female 
<br/>participation  to  promote  gender  equality  on  the  Boards  of  Government  companies  and  statutory 
<br/>bodies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  continues  to  encourage  female  participation  to  promote  gender  equality  in 
<br/>Boards and has set the target to achieve a 30 percent women participation on Boards of Government 
<br/>companies and statutory bodies in the near future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr, Speaker, Sir, in line with the Merit Base Guideline, the Government, through the Ministry 
<br/>of Public Enterprises, had advertised for Expressions of Interest earlier this year in January 2023, 
<br/>inviting  qualified  and  reputable  individuals  to  serve  on  Boards  of  Government  companies  and 
<br/>statutory bodies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over 2,000 Expressions of Interest were received from talented, dedicated 
<br/>individuals,  with  a  diverse  mix  of  skills  and  experience  from  various  sectors.    This  confirms  the 
<br/>confidence and the willingness of the people to work with the Government, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  recent  appointments  on  Board  of  Directors  in  Government  companies  and  statutory 
<br/>bodies also includes successful applications from the Expressions of Interest received based on the 
<br/>prerequisites provided in the Guidelines and the relevant guiding legislations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These appointments will be uploaded on to the Fiji Government Digital Directory once the 
<br/>directors  have  provided  their  consent  to  serve  and  declared  any  conflict  of  interest  under  the 
<br/>Companies Act 2015 and formally appointed.  Some appointments will be done sooner, while others 
<br/>will require consultation with relevant line Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  preliminary  due  diligence  and  necessary  credibility  checks  are  being 
<br/>conducted on the proposed directors prior to appointment to ensure that they meet the requirements 
<br/>outlined  in  the  applicable  Government  companies  and  statutory  bodies  guiding  legislation  and 
<br/>Constitution of the company or body.  These include, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Public Enterprises Act 
<br/>2019, as I have mentioned, Articles of Association, Shareholders Agreement, Entities and specific 
<br/>Acts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me assure my fellow citizens and the honourable Members 
<br/>of the Opposition that some of the recent appointments of Chairpersons were based on merit and their 
<br/>ability  to  provide  strategic  leadership  and  contribute  towards  the  enhancement  of  the  entities 
<br/>performance which will translate into improved shareholders return and efficient service delivery to 
<br/>all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  also  update  Parliament  on  a  number  of  key  initiatives  that  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry plans to implement in the coming months, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Ministry is looking into relevant training for current and new directors.  It is important that 
<br/>we continue upskilling our directors to equip them with the tools to navigate the business  
<br/></span><span>environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry and relevant entities are also carrying out appropriate Board inductions for 
<br/>newly appointed directors to ensure that these directors are well-versed with their respective 
<br/>entities and the responsibilities expected of them during their tenure. 
<br/>Is also a priority for the Ministry to design and implement a comprehensive framework for 
<br/>director performance evaluation. In fact, the director has to work together in harmony and 
<br/>to give their best whenever they are making key decisions for the entities.

<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry is also working to review the 2009 Policy and Renumeration and the Benefits 
<br/>for  Directors  of  Government  Commercial  Companies  and  Commercial  Statutory 
<br/>Authorities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  outdated and requires considerable changes to  ensure we 
<br/>attract the best available personnel to be our directors.  The Ministry is also looking at the possibility 
<br/>of expanding the policy to become a uniformed policy for all Government Boards across the different 
<br/>Ministries.  The  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  intends  to  re-establish  the  Higher  Salaries 
<br/>Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, honourable Prime Minister, for your response to the 
<br/>question.    At  the  very  end  of  your  response,  you  did  mention  about  the  review  of  the  Director’s 
<br/>renumeration package and likewise, the reviving of the High Salaries Commission. My question is, 
<br/>is there consideration for that to be included in the selection of the Executive Management as well, 
<br/>not only Directors but Executive Management as well? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Sir,  some  Board  Members  were  appointed  prior  to  the  closure  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>applications, can the honourable Prime Minister explain that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Honourable Member, that was the transitionary measure at the time 
<br/>the Government came in. We had to fill those posts quickly, for example, the Fiji Development Bank 
<br/>had to be filled very quickly before we brought the motion on the guarantee of the loan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  he  had  mentioned  the  appointments  which  were  made  when  the  Expression  of 
<br/>Interest (EIO) was still in progress was requisite to the transitionary measure.  So in making those 
<br/>transitionary appointments, I am sure the emphasise would have been on fit and proper people, and 
<br/>not  necessarily  failed  candidates  or  other  people  like  that,  that  are  just  associated  with  the  Party 
<br/>because that seems to have been the impression that has been created.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I just want to clarify. Is there an emphasise on fit and proper Directors or it has sometimes 
<br/>been seen as the people that were not successful in the Election or related to a Party become appointed 
<br/>by virtue of their association?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I took responsibility for the selection.  I selected on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>merit and we can also disappoint, if they do not live up to the expectations we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Purchase of New Fiji Airways Aircraft 
<br/>(Question No. 71/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable  Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister for  Finance and Strategic 
<br/></span><span>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  confirm  as  to  how  many  new  aircraft  Fiji 
<br/>Airways is actually planning to purchase over the immediate future and what are the plans 
<br/>with regards to new routes? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>957 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Koya for that question.  I can 
<br/>confirm,  Sir,  that  Fiji  Airways  will  be  acquiring  two  more  Airbus  A350  900  XWB  aircrafts  in 
<br/>July/August, 2023 to meet its growth in travel demand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  new  A350  new  generation  aircraft  are  considered  to  be  the  most 
<br/>advanced, wide-body aircraft in the world. They generate fuel savings of around 15  percent to 20 
<br/>percent with the full load of 360 passengers and can carry about 30 tonnes of freight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airways and land the Apex Five Star Major Airline rating in November 2022 and partly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>based on the excellent service that the Airline provides to passengers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, after this addition, the group’s fleet which comprise of the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Four Airbus A350s; 
<br/>Four Airbus A330s; 
<br/>Five Boeing Max 8s; and 
<br/>One Boeing 737NG.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for the company’s domestic and regional services, the fleet as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Three ATR42 and ATR 72 
<br/>Four Twin Otter DHC-6 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, by August this year, Fiji Airways will have a total of 21 aircrafts and the addition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of these two new A350s will make Fiji Airways fleet one of the youngest in the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  new  destinations,  the  two  new  Airbus  A350s  will  substitute  the  A330  flights 
<br/>currently operating on San Francisco, Vancouver, Singapore and Hong Kong.  The Airbus A330s 
<br/>released from these destinations will be used to introduce additional flights to Sydney, Melbourne, 
<br/>Brisbane  and  Auckland  to  increase  capacity  and  match  customer  demand  and  offer  more  freight 
<br/>space.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. You have mentioned 
<br/>about these domestic flights, plus the kind of fleet that intend to bring.  You mentioned about the 
<br/>ATR 42? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sorry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- You have mentioned about the fleet that is going to service our 
<br/>domestic  destinations.    Just  keep  within  the  question  and  qualify  me  to  ask  this  supplementary 
<br/>question.  When are you going to get this ATR 42 over to Savusavu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation mentioned, I think, yesterday, he revealed that there is a 
<br/>major World Bank project that is still under negotiation.  We hope to sign the agreement for that 
<br/></span><span>project around June and that, Sir, includes the upgrade of Labasa and Savusavu Airports.  There are 
<br/></span><span>other components of the project but the important ones are the upgrade of the Savusavu Airport and 
<br/>Labasa Airport and hopefully, ATRs, at least not 72s but ATR 42s would be able to land there.  Thank 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, can you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just reveal the funding arrangements that we have - source of funding?

<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the exact details but I can tell 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition, unlike the previous Government, this Government is going 
<br/>to  present  to  Parliament  Fiji  Airways’    Financial  and  Annual  Reports  and  I  am  sure  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, including our colleagues on the other side, will have the opportunity as part 
<br/>of the Public Accounts Committee to scrutinise those financial reports and annual reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is that the last question?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I love the second bite.  A very quick question, honourable Minister, with 
<br/>respect to the last peak season that we have just gone through and the routes that we have which 
<br/>touched into USA, meaning Los Angeles and San Francisco.  The load factor that we had in the last 
<br/>season, bearing in mind that we have just gone through COVID-19, do you have any idea what the 
<br/>load factor is? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is an important question.  I do 
<br/>not have the exact details of the load factor but I think what has happened after COVID-19 is Fiji as 
<br/>a transit route has become more prominent.  A lot of our passengers from Canada and the US are 
<br/>passing  through  Fiji  and  going  back  to  these  destinations  through  Fiji,  so  I  think  that  led  to  the 
<br/>increase in the number of tourists and also the load factor would be determined by that as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members I only have one question and that is we came across 
<br/>Fiji Airways parked in Abu Dhabi somewhere.  I do not know what it is doing there, work up there, 
<br/>a charter or something.  Anyway, we will go on to the last Oral Question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Code of Conduct for Tourism Providers 
<br/>(Question No. 72/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>update Parliament on the Code of Conduct for Tourism Providers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, following Cabinet’s endorsement in March this 
<br/>year,  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  has  begun  reaching  out  to  partners  for  the 
<br/>implementation of the Code of Conduct.  As the leader of Pacific tourism, we want to defy status 
<br/>quo, we want to position ourselves as the tourism destination of choice, we want to position ourselves 
<br/>as a high value and low impact tourism destination.  That requires us to live up to the standards that 
<br/>are expected of us.  We have a strong brand and while we need to deliver, we do not forget our people 
<br/>and our environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji as a member of the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), has been encouraged to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>adopt international recognised standards and best practices aligning it to 2030 SDGs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, about the Code of Conduct, for the benefit of the people of Fiji, I will share 
<br/></span><span>a little on what the Code of Conduct for tourism operators is.  The Code of Conduct encourages ethics 
<br/></span><span>and  conduct  that  all  guide  the  tourism  industry  operators,  especially  when  engaging  with  clients, 
<br/>other businesses and host communities.  It gives recognition of the need of the Fiji Tourism Industry 
<br/>to be responsible and conscious of the conduct of the vulnerable and disadvantaged group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism in Fiji as a sustainable tourism destination aligns with the global demand for ethical 
<br/>travel where visitors seek meaningful engagement of the destination that are socially responsible for 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tourism activities.  Tourists want value for money, as we do.  This means higher standards across the 
<br/>sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Code of Conduct guides dealings in protecting staff and visitors during 
<br/>emergencies, maintain integrity and professionalism in how we market ourselves, ensuring cultural 
<br/>and traditional protocols are observed in host communities and being conscious of the impacts on the 
<br/>environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while this policy is not legally mandated to address every issue we face, it  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>does set a benchmark for what we can deliver as an industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has worked with and consulted several stakeholders including 
<br/>key licencing authorities, the Fiji Police Force, academic institutions, tourism operators - large and 
<br/>small, and Government stakeholders.  Earlier this year, we have consulted several communities who 
<br/>are indirectly linked to the industry such as Navala in Ba, Abaca, Biausevu, Nakabuta, Lomawai, 
<br/>Sawani Village, Colo -i- Suva and Nabalasere in Ra.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  implementation,  we  are  now  securing  funding  in  the  next 
<br/>financial year to visit communities and tourism operators to advocate the Code of Conduct.  We are 
<br/>also securing support of development partners such as UNWTO, who can provide training on the 
<br/>various areas of Code of Conduct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Australian Volunteer 
<br/>International and the volunteer hub for their support.  This is what it looks like.  The Code of Conduct 
<br/>is quite well presented and very comprehensive and readable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, probably the only question.  Just quickly, honourable 
<br/>Minister, is there any compulsion that comes out of this Code of Ethics?  I know you have spoken 
<br/>about the guidelines that you have received from the UNWTO with respect to this particular code.  
<br/>Is it a document that this is a national guideline on a voluntarily basis or is there a compulsion on it 
<br/>in terms of all the operators?  Because I am the only one standing so if I could just get a quick answer 
<br/>from him regarding the education that will happen now with respect to all our operators.  How will 
<br/>you go about that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no compulsion on people to observe this.  
<br/>It is not legally binding for people to practice what is in here.  It just that driving factor of customer 
<br/>satisfaction and of exceeding expectation.  You cannot be a business in Fiji that would be known that 
<br/>it does not subscribe to those Code of Conduct. It would be very, very detrimental to you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  I  could  just  look  at  our  experience,  I  was  part  of  a  global  chain  -  Shangri  La,  we  did 
<br/>something like this and it was known as the Shangri La Way.  So wherever you stay in Shangri La 
<br/>anywhere  in  the  world,  the  Code  of  Conduct  was  consistent.    And  I  am  sure  Sheraton  and 
<br/>Intercontinental has it, and all the global big boys have their Code of Conduct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is happening here is that the Code of Conduct will also be observed by other operators 
<br/></span><span>in this country.  They will benefit from the Code of Conduct of the big chains.  Like I said, you cannot 
<br/></span><span>afford not to be part of this.  Fiji will be known, when people book Fiji, they will always be in a 
<br/>country where cancellation policy will be this.  If you are hurt, this will happen to you.  It is all in 
<br/>this and it gives a sense  of comfort  to  visitors to  come to  a country  where a Code of Conduct  is 
<br/>observed by the majority of the players.

<div><span>       Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Thank you for that explanation.   I was going to ask the question 
<br/>on compliance and I think you have answered that.  Since you have already explained that, this will 
<br/>depend on the individual operators. How does this come to the Ministry level, if the complaint comes 
<br/>up from the various players.  They  have their own Code of Conduct, they have their own standard 
<br/>but then there are still breaches in their respective areas of operations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- If you break the law, then you can be liable in Court.  If you break a 
<br/>contract,  every  contract  is  observed  and  honoured  by  any  operator  with  another  operator  from 
<br/>overseas.  I can tell you, as an operator in Fiji, you do not want to be on the wrong side of your 
<br/>producers.  We strive very hard in the industry not to upset because words go around very quickly.  
<br/>There is a Trip Advisor (that is one of the most frightening websites in the world today) for tourism 
<br/>operators.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If people say something about a hotel, you are virtually dead.  It is not so much as the legal 
<br/>aspect of it, its just expectation that you promised to deliver something and people hold you to it.  In 
<br/>this  day  and  age,  whether  the  visitor  is  from  Moscow  or  Helsinki,  you  are  held  to  what  you  are 
<br/>expected to provide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you honourable Minister for a very clear explanation.  Just a last 
<br/>one,  I  know  you  mentioned  the  UNWTO.    With  the  UNWTO,  there  is  a  global  code  of  ethics 
<br/>specifically for tourism.  Was that the actual foundation of what we had before us today and I would 
<br/>love to receive a copy of what you have? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  I  would  presume  honourable  Koya  that  the  UNWTO  have 
<br/>contributed to this, but I go back to what I said about the big chains.  When I see this, I see Shangri-
<br/>La in this, I see Sheraton in this, I see the big boys having a big influence in this one.  The comfort 
<br/>of the big chain is that whether you stay in the Hilton in Denarau or Hilton in Beijing or wherever 
<br/>you know, their standards that are consistent.  That is the kind of stuff that we want everyone in Fiji 
<br/>to observe.  I think it was more driven by our people in Fiji, of course UNWTO is always there to 
<br/>back us up with what they have.
