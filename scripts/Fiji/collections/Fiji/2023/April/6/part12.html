<h3>MEDIA INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (REPEAL) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>MEDIA INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (REPEAL) BILL 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 
<br/>3</span><span>rd</span><span>  April, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 1/2023) be debated, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, be reminded that pursuant to the resolution 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Parliament, the debate on this Bill will be limited to one hour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  of  the  Media 
<br/>Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023, which was tabled in Parliament on Monday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span>  April, 
<br/>2023.   The Bill seeks to repeal the Media Industry Development Act 2010 which I will refer to as 
<br/>the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I touch on the speaking  notes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may  I be guided by the words of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wisdom from Isaiah 10:1-2, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Woe  to  those  who  make  unjust  laws,  to  those  who  issue  oppressive  decrees,  to 
<br/>deprive  the  poor  of  their  rights  and  withhold  justice  from  the  oppressed  of  my  people, 
<br/>making widows their prey and robbing the fatherless.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>965 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this verse highlights the importance of just laws and the protection of rights 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of all individuals, including journalists in media organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had mentioned on Monday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023, the Act was promulgated 
<br/>as a Decree in 2010. It regulates, amongst other things, the ownership, registration and content of the 
<br/>media organisations in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  media  content  regulation  framework  includes  the  creation  of  a  Media  Industry 
<br/>Development Authority, the Media Tribunal and other elements.  This makes up bulk of the Act and 
<br/>it  is  these  aspects  that  are  considered  controversial.  These  elements  have  been  considered  as 
<br/>hindering the growth and development of a strong and independent news media in Fiji and a breach 
<br/>of  the  Constitutional  Right  to  Freedom  of  Expression  as  outlined  in  Section  17  of  the  2013 
<br/>Constitution of Republic of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of the Act hindering the growth and development of a robust 
<br/>media industry in Fiji, the following observations was made by the Multinational Observer Group 
<br/>(MOG) in its final report on Fiji’s 2022 General Elections, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  MOG  spoke  to  a  range  of  media  organisations  and  said  that  they  are 
<br/>committed to reporting news as they saw it. However, the advice that there was a culture 
<br/>of self-censorship especially among young journalists. Most media sources advised that 
<br/>the potential for and severity of the penalties under the Act was a cause of significant 
<br/>concern.    The  MOG  heard  from  a  range  of  media  organisations  that  uncertainty  and 
<br/>confusion  about  the  implication  of  the  legal  framework  impacted  their  willingness  to 
<br/>report on some issues.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  MOG  also  observed  there  were  reports  from  stakeholders  of  a  more  restricted  media 
<br/>environment were consistent with Fiji’s recent decline in the Reporters without Borders World Press 
<br/>Freedom Index.  Fiji was ranked 57 out of 180 countries for press freedoms in 2018 but fell to 102 
<br/>in 2022.  It is the lowest ranking since 2014 and making Fiji the lowest ranked Pacific country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is precisely these issues that the Bill seeks to rectify by the repealing the 
<br/>Act.  The media industry, and by extension, the dissemination of vital and relevant information to 
<br/>the public must be carried out in an environment where there is no fear of the unknown.  Even if the 
<br/>information being disseminated is contrary to policies and aspirations of the Government of the day, 
<br/>media rights must be observed.  It serves for nothing but the detriment of the people and the country 
<br/>where the media laws are unnecessarily restrictive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act  does  not  and has  not  served any practical  purpose other than to 
<br/>unnecessarily  limit  media  organisations  in  their  operations  and  freedom  of  expression  that  is  a 
<br/>hallmark  of  a  democratic  country.    While  the  Act  established  the  Media  Industry  Development 
<br/>Authority, the existence of this body in recent times has been in name only.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Media  Industry  Development  Authority  does  not  have  any  staffing 
<br/>neither is it performing the totality of its functions as mandated by the Act. This was also stated by 
<br/></span><span>the MOG in its report where it observed that the Fijian Elections Office had taken over some roles it 
<br/></span><span>had previously shared with the Media Industry Development Authority such as media accreditation 
<br/>and has taken on a monitoring role such as requesting that the media issue retractions or corrections 
<br/>using the newly created offence on publication of false statements as provided for under the Electoral 
<br/>Act 2014.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since establishment and for the first 8 years of its existence, 
<br/>the  Media  Industry  Development  Authority  failed  to  provide  an  annual  report  as  required  under 
<br/>section 15 of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It was only in 2019 that a consolidated report for the periods 2010 to 
<br/>2018, that is, eight years was tabled. Since then, in clear breach of the requirement of section 15, no 
<br/>other annual report have been tabled.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Media Tribunal was also established under the Act to hear complaints 
<br/>referred  to  it  from  the  Media  Industry  Development  Authority.    However,  the  Media  Tribunal  is 
<br/>virtually defunct  as its members were never appointed.  The Act  also  provides provisions for the 
<br/>regulation of the content.  Under the Act, publications must not include material, which is against 
<br/>public order, national interest or creates discord.  With no definitions for what exactly may constitute 
<br/>public order and national interest, this provision has been seen as a thinly guised attempt to suppress 
<br/>the media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Act was first promulgated in 2010, it was done so in a rushed and 
<br/>hurried manner.   As  reported in  the Fiji  Media  Industry Development Act  2010:  An  Analysis by 
<br/>Dialogue Fiji, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Media organisations and journalists were summoned to the Suva Holiday Inn in 
<br/>April 2010 and given only two-and-a-half hours to read the 50-page draft, before being 
<br/>asked for comments and submissions. The then Attorney-General Sayed-Khaiyum told 
<br/>the  assembled  media  that  the  proposed  Decree  was  not  a  debate.    Suspicions  that  the 
<br/>Decree was fait accompli were vindicated when the promulgated version turned out to be 
<br/>almost identical to the draft, save for a few minor adjustments.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  prior  to  this  Bill  being  tabled  in  Parliament,  we  had  also  conducted  the 
<br/>public consultations for  the review of the Act  on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> March, 2023.  Apart from  members of the 
<br/>media industry, the public consultation was attended by representatives from the UN Agencies, civil 
<br/>societies, the RFMF, FCCC, Consumer Council of Fiji and members of the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I recall correctly, the Leader of the Opposition, in his contributions before 
<br/>this august Parliament on Monday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023, had mentioned how we had prepared a different 
<br/>draft  Bill  and  following  the  consultations,  had  bowed  to  the  pressure  of  media  organisations  and 
<br/>introduced the Bill that is currently before this august Parliament.  This may come as a surprise to 
<br/>him but essentially, that is how democracy works - you listen to the views of the people and where 
<br/>necessary and within reason, make the necessary policy and/or legislative changes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be prudent to consider the Act not only from the viewpoint of the 
<br/>Coalition Government or the FijiFirst Government, but in consideration of an instance where a more 
<br/>aggressive or unsympathetic government were to assume leadership.  If this were to be the case, what 
<br/>guarantee is there that a much stronger stance would not be adopted in implementing the Act?  In 
<br/></span><span>contemplation of this, it is imperative that the Act be repealed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  repeal  of  the  Act,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  media  has  the 
<br/>unfettered  right  to  report  on  anything  and  everything  without  verifying  the  veracity  of  their 
<br/>information.  Moving forward, the media industry will regulate itself with the setting up of a Fiji 
<br/>Media Council.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>967 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Like a true democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  repealing of the Act  does  not  mean that the 
<br/>ordinary person will not be able to raise their grievances on unscrupulous or uninformed reporting or 
<br/>publication by media organisation.  Redress is available through the existing legislation such as the 
<br/>Defamation Act 1971, Online Safety Act 2018 and the Crimes Act 2009, amongst others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  predecessor,  Mr.  Aiyaz  Sayed-Khaiyum,  during  his  term  as 
<br/>Attorney-General,  had  instituted  committal  proceedings  against  Fiji  Times  Limited  regarding  the 
<br/>publication of an article.  The matter was appealed to the Supreme Court, however, it does not negate 
<br/>the fact that even with the Act in place, and there are other avenues within which grievances regarding 
<br/>media organisations were addressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, consultations were held with the Ministry of Communications, members of 
<br/>the media industry and the Office of the Solicitor-General.  I would like to briefly outline some of 
<br/>the salient features of the Bill: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provide for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament, the 
<br/>new legislation will come into force on the date or dates appointed by the Minister by notice in 
<br/>the Gazette. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Clause 2 of the Bill sets out the definition of the terms used throughout the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Clause 3 of the Bill provides for any action, arbitration, proceedings or cause of action pending 
<br/>against or in favour of the authority to continue against or in favour of the Ministry responsible 
<br/>for the administration of the new legislation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Clause 5 of the Bill provides for the consequential amendment to the following laws to cater for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the repeal of the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral Act 2014; 
<br/>Television and Online Streaming Act 1992; and 
<br/>Financial Management (Responsible Authority) Regulations 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the book of Proverbs 18:21, it is written, “the tongue has the power of 
<br/>life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit.”   This verse emphasises the importance of 
<br/></span><span>responsible speech, but  it also  recognises the power of speech as a means  of communication and 
<br/></span><span>expression. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the </span><span>Bible</span><span> encourages us to speak for justice and righteousness.  In Proverbs 31:8 
<br/>– 9, it states, and I quote: “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all 
<br/>who are destitute.  Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.”  This verse 
<br/>highlights  the  importance  of  speaking  up  for  those  who  are  marginalised  and  oppressed  and 
<br/>advocating for their rights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the </span><span>Bible</span><span> also highlights importance of being open to criticism and correction.  
<br/>Proverbs 27:17 states, and I quote: “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.”  This 
<br/>verse  emphasises  the  importance  of  constructive  criticism  and  dialogue  as  a  means  of  improving 
<br/>oneness  and  society.    These  biblical  references  remind  us  of  the  importance  of  free  speech, 
<br/>responsible  communication  and  the  role  of  the  media  in  promoting  justice.    While  there  may  be 
<br/>limitations  to  free  speech,  it  is  essential  to  ensure  that  any  restrictions  are  balanced  with  the 
<br/>responsibility to speak up the truth, justice and common good.  Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I

<div><span>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commend this Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>before I offer the floor, I would like to inform you that I have a list of six speakers that have registered 
<br/>their interest to participate in the debate and this has been submitted by both Whips and lead of the 
<br/>batting would be: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. V. Naupoto; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. F.S. Koya; and 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on 
<br/>Bill No. 1 of 2023.  The Coalition Government made more than 101 promises to be fulfilled by the 
<br/>first 100 days in their collective manifestos in election campaigns.  We have counted 90 promises 
<br/>yet to be fulfilled, they failed to deliver an overwhelming 90 percent of their promises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that explains the rushed manner in which they are trying to repeal an 
<br/>essential Act that protects vulnerable Fijians, particularly our children, students, youth who are seated 
<br/>there from being misrepresented, subject to abuse and subject to trial by the media. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few years ago, I believe it was 2020, a horrifying story broke out about 
<br/>naked images of young girls being stored on a dropbox folder as a revenge porn.  One of the local 
<br/>newspapers actually used one of the nude pictures of an underaged girl from the dropbox folder on 
<br/>their front page and blurred the image to hide the face.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The media all over the world always pushes the boundaries on unethical conduct to get views 
<br/>and sales, and to remove the Media Industry Development Authority (MIDA) is to leave the media 
<br/>unregulated  and  thus  remove  protection  of  vulnerable  Fijians  from  being  featured  on  media  with 
<br/>often misleading and fake content.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You were protecting yourself, shame on you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Can you imagine if MIDA was not there to ensure the media blurred 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>images which by the way is still unethical? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Media Industry Development Act 2010 provides 
<br/></span><span>the regulatory framework for the media industry to ensure that such services in Fiji are maintained at 
<br/></span><span>a high standard and ultimately, serve consumers who are the ultimate end users of the media industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to further insult the intelligence of Fijians, the Coalition Government has 
<br/>held consultations with media organisations on whether to repeal MIDA.  That is like going to the 
<br/>supermarket owners and asking them, what should be done about price control or like going to prison 
<br/>and asking the inmates if bars and gates should be removed.  Obviously, they will choose to remove 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>969 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anything that is regulating them.  I understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Government is reluctant to 
<br/>hold more consultations after the Fiscal Review Committee’s failure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  absolute  media  freedom  in  any  jurisdiction is  rare  and  even  impossible.  
<br/>Often, there is a compromise between absolute media freedom and absolute control by the media by 
<br/>the Government.  Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has 
<br/>the right to freedom of expression and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any 
<br/>media of the same.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the same declaration under Article 29(2) places limitation in the exercise of these rights 
<br/>and freedom.  Everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law, solely for 
<br/>the  purpose  of  securing  due  recognition  and  respect  for  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  others  and  of 
<br/>meeting  the  just  requirements  of  morality,  public  order  and  the  general  welfare  of  a  democratic 
<br/>society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to Article 29(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
<br/>governments can choose to place limitation on media freedom through regulation to ensure greater 
<br/>media  accountability  and  to  maintain  peace  and  stability  in  a  multiracial  country  like  ours.    By 
<br/>repealing the Media Industry Act, the rights of media consumers are not protected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Where  will  aggrieved  Fijians  or  media  organisations  go  with  their 
<br/>complaints if their rights are violated?  Both media organisation and consumers, as well as businesses, 
<br/>should have full access to fair legal remedies for any such decisions that violate their rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of countries that have established national regulating 
<br/>authorities, for example, New Zealand, Australia and EU where an independent authority handles 
<br/>disputes between consumers and businesses against media organisations.  In the past, we had a self-
<br/>regulated Fiji Media Council made up of media representatives to handle complaints and hold the 
<br/>media accountable.  Unfortunately, the Media Council was not independent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Act  has  many  relevant  sections  to  ensure  high  media  standards  are 
<br/>maintained. For example, there are Schedules 1 to 4 on the Media Code of Ethics and Practice, the 
<br/>General Code of Practice for Advertisements, the Code of Advertising to Children and the Television 
<br/>Programme Classification Code.  Repealing the Act means all the standards are thrown out of the 
<br/>window.  The Advertising Codes are very important and it should be there all the time.  The Act also 
<br/>limits for an ownership of media in Fiji to just 10 percent of shares. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, foreign ownership is regulated in many countries.  Foreign ownership is 
<br/>regulated  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand.    In  fact,  Mr.  Rupert  Murdoch  gave  up  his  Australian 
<br/>citizenship to build his media empire in USA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  why  do  countries  regulate  foreign  ownership?    This  is  to  protect  their 
<br/>country from foreign interest.  We all know how powerful media organisations are, and we cannot 
<br/></span><span>leave the issue of foreign ownership to the market.  One may argue that regulating for an ownership 
<br/></span><span>creates obstacle for foreign investors.  I believe protecting the nations from foreign interest is far 
<br/>more important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, repealing the Act is not a solution when media organisations 
<br/>have moved from tradition platforms to social media platforms.  I suggest that we keep the Act and 
<br/>amend sections to strike a balance between absolute media freedom and absolute control of the media 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the Government. As it is, the Media Industry Development Act has been amended six times and 
<br/>certain sections of the law can be improved further rather than repealing the Act, which will give no 
<br/>protection to consumers of media.  I do not support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  I  offer  the  floor  to  the  next  speaker,  I  would  like  to  inform  this 
<br/>august Parliament that the Opposition, through their Whip, have submitted another four names.  This 
<br/>is all covered under the one hour so we will take it one at a time, and if we have enough time, then 
<br/>we will probably take some more on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Bill that has been 
<br/>introduced to Parliament this morning by the honourable Attorney-General.  Before I say my bit on 
<br/>the  Bill,  perhaps  I  could  (she  has  gone),  the  point  that  she  raised  about  publishing  of  offensive 
<br/>material is not only just covered under the MIDA Act, it is also covered under the Crimes Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are alternatives that authorities are able to act on, to protect the vulnerable, particularly 
<br/>the children who are subject to this in our society.  That, by no means, justifies the maintenance of 
<br/>this Media Industry Development Act 2010 which they all know was brought without consultation 
<br/>and that qualifies this side of Parliament to remove it under Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  today  is  a  day  of  celebration  for  all  the 
<br/>citizens of Fiji.  It is the day, with the power of the people’s last election in December 2022, we bring 
<br/>to an end the dark era of media censorship in this country and welcome back to Fiji its fourth estate, 
<br/>media freedom and their watchdog role in the political affairs of our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my early days, flirting with politics under the banner of the one Fiji Party 
<br/>banner, we had our office in Lami, the property of Laisa Digitaki.  Everyone knows what happened 
<br/>to that property.  The news media of the world reported on what happened to that property in Lami.  
<br/>It was attacked, ransacked, the set up was damaged and people assaulted.  That property was the base 
<br/>of those who spoke out against the events of December 2006 and why that event, the takeover of 
<br/>Government was wrong in law, wrong in principle and wrong to humanity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  then,  media  freedom  in  Fiji  has  taken  a  downward  turn,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  towards 
<br/>darkness  and  oblivion.  Government  began  favoring  </span><span>The</span><span> </span><span>Fiji  Sun</span><span>  and  the  Fijian  Broadcasting 
<br/>Corporation and Government jobs.  Senior journalists were forced out of their jobs and media houses 
<br/>began publishing very lightly on things that matters which may, in fact, tarnish the Government’s 
<br/>image. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we return Fiji to the light, not the light that honourable Usumate 
<br/>keeps harping about, I mean, real light, freedom of the media kind of light, the light that has brought 
<br/>media personnel to this Parliament today.  Look at them, they are all sitting there, they are waiting 
<br/>for the decision on this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes, yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- They want it repealed and they want their freedom to report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back, freely given back to them.  We are going to give it to them today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Media Industry Development Authority (MIDA) did not advance media 
<br/>freedom, it curtailed it.  It did not permit them to publish anything that is against national interest 
<br/>under section 24.  What is flabbergasting is that who decides what is in the national interest or not is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>971 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>no one.  The government of the day can decide what is of national interest, in fact, everything that 
<br/>has happened here in the last two weeks is of national interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We could have easily decided something that they had printed and say, “That is in the national 
<br/>interest and you should not print it, it is embargoed and if you do it, we will fine you up to $100,000.”  
<br/>We are removing the Bill that is censoring them from printing anything that is in the Government’s 
<br/>interest.  With their own watchdog, Mr. Speaker, at the helm of MIDA who did nothing ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Who, who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- ... to develop the industry.  He kept all the media outlets in 
<br/>check, not to insult the Government of the day in anything that they print or say. He is no longer and 
<br/>the law that gave him power and authority to watch the fourth estate will be gone by the end of today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  information  is  power.    The  return  of  the  fourth  estate  will  ensure  that 
<br/>Government is kept in check in its role and to observe the separation of power, its doctrines and its 
<br/>intents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on this day, 6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023, power will return to the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- With the repeal of the Media Industry Development Act 2010 
<br/>and with the media able to report freely and without fear, to inform the people of Fiji, power today 
<br/>will finally return to those who owned it - the people of Fiji.  Let the media do their job in empowering 
<br/>the  people  of  Fiji  by  bringing  them  information without  fear  and  favour.    I  support  the  Bill,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of this motion. One of the reasons 
<br/>that the honourable Attorney-General mentioned as a justification for the removal of the Bill was 
<br/>because there was no Annual Report submitted. Will he also repeal the Bill of the other ministries 
<br/>that have not submitted their annual reports? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- That is what he said!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that this debate that we are having as a result 
<br/>of  Government’s  decision  to  repeal  this  Act  is  not  based  on  what  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister mentioned the other day when he said, “when we went out to campaign, they said ‘MIDA 
<br/></span><span>tuba.’</span><span>” I bet when that was said, they have not even read the Act.  I hope also it is not based ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- ... on the fact that they have been saying all along, “oh, you used to 
<br/>do that before”. By saying that, it is an admission of the fact that they also doing it, the yardstick for 
<br/>good governance   is never because you did it before, it is doing what is right because it is the right 
<br/>thing to do.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- That is a yardstick for good governance. You simply do what is right 
<br/>because that is the right thing to do, not because you did it before, not because someone else did it 
<br/>before. So, therefore, by repealing this Act, I hope the issue is on regulating versus self-regulation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The world is moving towards regulating the media.  Mark Zuckerberg when he was asked in 
<br/>Congress, he said, “regulating the internet is inevitable, it will come.”  That is the way we are moving. 
<br/>The media is not just any other business because the media has this ability to influence the public 
<br/>and too much influence from the media is bad for democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What do you know? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Too much influence from the media damages democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, it is the diversity of opinion which is the corner stone of 
<br/>a healthy democracy. We can look at the media now and we ask ourselves, “do we have diversity of 
<br/>opinion?” I would say, no – everything is about them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  when  we  regulate,  put  some  sort  of  regulation  in  the  media,  we  balance  the 
<br/>freedom  of  expression  against  vilification,  and  we  balance  it  against  abuse  and  defamation.  You 
<br/>remove  this  media,  you  repeal  it  today  and  God  forbid  tomorrow  in  the  newspaper  it  says, 
<br/>“Honourable Naupoto’s daughter was raped.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Where do I go to, Mr. Speaker?  Very easy to find out because I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>only one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MIDA protects, it forces the media not to do those things.  By the time you go to court 
<br/>to get some justification, it is too late because it has already been done.  In the consultation, I have 
<br/>read the draft that was made, at least, took cover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- At least, we have a draft. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Now they have nothing, they pull and they have nothing.  They said, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Looks them in the eye and tell them, ‘by pulling MIDA I have you covered.’”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Nonsense! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- If something that vilifies you in the media tomorrow, we have you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>covered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Address the Chair.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>973 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  this is a grave mistake grave for democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- This is a grave mistake for a democracy and I oppose , Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to say it is an honour to rise today 
<br/>to repeal the Media Industry Development Act 2010.  With great pride I say, “This is a new day in 
<br/>Fiji”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I will say it again, “this is a new day in Fiji”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You ask me why, Mr. Speaker, I will give you two simple 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answers.  Today, we repeal two Acts of Parliament that have no place in any democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  The  Media  Industry  Development  Act  2010  and  I  will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>always call Bill 17 because it is not worthy to be called an Act in our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just thought to answer some of the noise that was coming from the other 
<br/>side.  Firstly, I would like to address a point that the honourable Usamate raised when he spoke about 
<br/>this particular Bill to repeal on Monday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023.  He said that that side of Parliament was not 
<br/>using Standing Order 51 that often.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- No I did not.  That is a lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order.  The honourable Member.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, you give me the Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is misleading Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What number?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is Standing Order 60.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, is it Standing Orders 68 or 62? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hold on, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is not there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Standing  Order  60  is  about  relevance  because  he  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talking about something that has no relevance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You spoke it about in the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- When I spoke in Parliament .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You spoke about the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- When I spoke in Parliament, I was saying that you used to say this, so 
<br/>when you are doing what you said you will not do it, you are being hypocrite.  I did not say that we 
<br/>did not use Standing Order 51.  He is misrepresenting, he is bringing up something that is totally 
<br/>immaterial to what we are talking about here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.SPEAKER.- Thank you.  You may continue, honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome if I can get a copy of the </span><span>Daily 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hansard</span><span> but the point I was trying to make is, we need to be careful what we say in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome if I can get a copy of the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>, but the point I was 
<br/>trying to make is, we need to be careful what we say in Parliament.  It needs to be factual.  The data 
<br/>that we have received says that 91 percent of the legislative Acts that went through this Parliament 
<br/>was under Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame, I say! Shame!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the point about lying, I urge the honourable Usamate to prove me wrong that there was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not 91 percent of the Bills that were passed under the Standing Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third point I would like to make before I make a very brief contribution 
<br/>is that, I feel that the other side of Parliament sometimes are living on another plant - maybe Mars or 
<br/>Jupiter.    The reason I say this respectfully, Sir, is because 58 percent of Fiji heard the three parties, 
<br/>the People’s Coalition say, “Bill No. 17 is out, MIDA is going out.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Talk about the Bill, you have only one hour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  And  what  happened?    They  are  still  in  self-denial.    So  I 
<br/>respectfully urge my friends on the other side of Parliament, please come back to earth and listen to 
<br/>the people of Fiji.  If you do that, you have learnt a very big lesson.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to conclude, I thought rather than opine about the Bill’s merits, if I may 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be permitted just to read this letter from the Fijian Media Association.  It says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The repeal of the MIDA Act  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MIDA Act is the worst thing to have happened to the freedom of the media in 
<br/>Fiji.  The origins of the MIDA Act began after 2006 </span><span>coup</span><span> that brought a reign of terror, 
<br/>violence, intimidation, censorship and fear to the country’s media industry.  Journalists 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>975 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were beaten, detained and threatened and their media businesses burned, offices trashed 
<br/>and houses firebombed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The media workers who were attacked in some way included Pita Ligaiula, Dionisia 
<br/>Turagabeci, Anish Chand, Merana Kitione, Leone Cabenatabua, Maika Bolatiki, Netani 
<br/>Rika, Sophie Foster, Imraz Iqbal, Samisoni Pareti, Apisolame Coka, Maikeli Radua, the 
<br/>late Sitiveni Moce …among many others.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government advertising was taken away from media organisations the government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>did not like and senior journalists and editors were forced out of their jobs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  public  emergency  regulation  in  2009  enforced  unprecedented  and  dictatorial 
<br/>censorship, and government officers entered newsrooms to force journalists to only report 
<br/>what the government wanted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The censorship then morphed into the 2010 Media decree and then the MIDA Act 
<br/>which has caused so much uncertainty, stress, mental anguish, and threatened the survival 
<br/>and livelihoods of many media businesses.  Some of Fiji’s best journalists left the industry 
<br/>as a result and the media still carry the mental scars today from that very disturbing period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Neither the previous government nor a single member of the public has ever used 
<br/>the  MIDA  Tribunal  to  complain  about  the  media,  and  there  has  been  no  media 
<br/>development  under  MIDA.    It  was  a  useless,  but  dangerous  and  vindictive  piece  of 
<br/>legislation for the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  repeal  of  the  MIDA  Act  has  long  been  a  unifying  demand  of  all  media 
<br/>organisations  in  Fiji.    No  government,  including  this  People’s  Coalition  government 
<br/>should ever be given such power over the media.  We need to return to the media freedom 
<br/>that Fiji enjoyed and was renowned for prior to 2006.  The MIDA experiment is over and 
<br/>the draconian legislation now belongs in the dustbins of history.”     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MIDA Bill is gone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  can  see  some  very  passionate  debate  today  with 
<br/>respect to this particular Bill.  I welcome the audience who are here from the media with respect to 
<br/>this.  I think we need to put some things in perspective. The current law that sits there which is MIDA, 
<br/>there is no insincere or reason why it was actually put into place.  There is nothing sinister about it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Misleading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Read it, have you read it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- If you are talking about us being on a planet, there is a particular planet 
<br/></span><span>that shall remain nameless because I might be accused of saying something offensive, maybe that is 
<br/></span><span>where you came from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, you really need to look at why it is there, what it actually means 
<br/>and whether other jurisdictions around the world have the same.  Developed countries around the 
<br/>world, such as Australia, Canada et cetera all have them and in today’s atmosphere of their being the 
<br/>advent of social media et cetera, there has to be some kind of check and balance.  Our Act really is

<div><span>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just regulatory in terms of what it should be in aligning itself with our inspiration, aspiration and 
<br/>where we want to be in comparison to the rest of the world.  We are still a developing country. This 
<br/>is an argument, and you will be testament to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You are acting like a dictatorship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Yes, that’s what he was.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Control yourself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You would be testament to this, Sir.  This is not an argument that started 
<br/>today, this is an argument with respect to the media that started from the 1970s.  If you go and refer 
<br/>yourself to the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>, </span><span>The</span><span> </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>, the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> and the National Federation Party then 
<br/>had views on it, you can have the freedom but there are limitations.  In this day and age, you need to 
<br/>have limitations because there are so many different ways to do things via the media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the points that needs to be said is that, by removing all of it, you are 
<br/>taking out a schedule which means that we have protection for children.  Is that not most paramount?  
<br/>Look at Schedule 3.  Is that not most paramount?  This is specific. We are in an area which is actually 
<br/>dangerous, we are also looking at cross media ownership around the world that actually all of the 
<br/>laws around the world govern that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have to be very clear minded about doing this.  The honourable Attorney-General said, 
<br/>“Oh, this is democracy, we went with the draft media ownership Bill supposedly to the media outlets, 
<br/>but we took it away completely because that is democracy.”  Well, if he had any commonsense, he 
<br/>would not have taken this in the first place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You never had consultations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You would have listened to them and then made  a decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We have never, when we were in government, said to the media that it 
<br/>was not going to be reviewed and we have evidence to that effect.  The amendments that were being 
<br/>sought, we were told that the invitations were given but they never turned up for those amendments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- They never believed you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-   Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is evidence.  I do not want to name names but 
<br/>there is evidence that they were told with respect to getting all of this done.  The point here is, be 
<br/></span><span>careful, be protective of our women and our children.  Do not moan and groan, you are the Minister 
<br/></span><span>responsible for women and children, and you, Sir, are a lawyer, you ought to know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I should not be asking myself anything. Do not cross the line.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  a  very dangerous thing that  we are doing.   As a matter of  fact, the

<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Big problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- There is no oppression.  As a matter of fact, today, as we stand here and 
<br/>speak, Mr. Speaker, guess what?  There is interference, there is oppression. We do not get a single 
<br/>minute of airtime, which is fine; we do not. We were not whinging, moaning, complaining and crying  
<br/>- we get on with the job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable L.D. Tabuya interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I do not lie,  honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, and I am about to finish that this is merely to accommodate their 100-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>day promise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I was planning to give a long speech but given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the time constraint, I will try and be brief. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me say that today for this is a defining moment for absolute freedom of media 
<br/>in our nation since the </span><span>coup</span><span> in 2006 when the then military commander overthrew a democratically 
<br/>elected government.   We know, Mr. Speaker, and honourable Kamikamica pointed out  under the 
<br/>Emergency  Regulations,  after  the  abrogation  of  the  1997  Constitution  and  then  in  2010  the 
<br/>Promulgation of the Media Decree led the foundation for dictatorship in this country for a very, very 
<br/>long time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I was actually quite amused at the contribution from the other side with respect 
<br/>to  the  issue  of  media  freedom.    In  fact,  all  of  those  who  spoke  from  the  other  side,  including 
<br/>honourable Naupoto and honourable Usamate sitting there, they were all beneficiaries of dictatorship 
<br/>in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, honourable Koya was saying that there was no sinister motive in bringing that 
<br/>Decree. In fact, Mr. Speaker, in a dictatorship, dictators do that as a first thing and they did that. They 
<br/>muzzled the media, created fear in the media fraternity and that law, Mr. Speaker, has remained. I 
<br/>sat in the Opposition for eight years along with you, Sir, and we were terrorised by media that became 
<br/></span><span>the propaganda arm of the government including the State broadcaster, at the expense of the taxpayers 
<br/></span><span>of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  media  organisations  that  stood  up,  Sir,  to  provide  some  semblance  of  freedom  and 
<br/>coverage to the Opposition and those who had opposing views to the government or those who tried 
<br/>to criticise government policies, were hounded by the government through exclusive advertisement 
<br/>to pro-government propagandists, media organisations, journalists and editors.  I know Mr. Speaker,

<div><span>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in some pro-media organisations there was editorial interference. Journalists were told not to cover 
<br/>stories of so and so politician from the opposition side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, honourable Koya is complaining that he is not getting coverage, it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there doing because the media until today….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- English 101, I did not complain, I said he accept it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Standing Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Be relevant, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- It is a new order you have cited.  Honourable Koya, what order is 101. Is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that some unit you did at USP?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, it was  under Standing Order 60  and  I was  referring to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>English as in English 101, he understands what I said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please when you rise on a Point of Order, quote the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Koya is a lawyer, he understands 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>English and I know what he said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why the media is still in that mode where they are afraid, because they are afraid, 
<br/>they fear government. So, that legacy that he is now experiencing was left by them.  What we are 
<br/>doing, Mr. Speaker, once we repeal this Bill, once we give the freedom to the media, it is actually 
<br/>quite insulting for them to say that suddenly tomorrow once we repeal this Bill... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And then? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … the media is going to run stories about rape,  honourable 
<br/>Naupoto.  I mean these are people who are responsible citizens. They too have children, daughters, 
<br/>families.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- They do not want names. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They don’t put names.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, relevancy - I did not say that they are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>going to print it tomorrow. I was giving an example of what if it happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What if it happened? He is a Professor, he should know better.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I want to just remind the honourable Members from the other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>side that …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Times up! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Sit down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You wait. It is quite insulting, Mr. Speaker, for them to bring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out this… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Always being insulted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …stupid  examples  to  say  that  the  media  will  not  be 
<br/>responsible.  The Media Council that used to be there before, they brought this draconian law, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, worked very well.  It was run by responsible citizens in this country.  We have seen that 
<br/>and here is a bunch that benefited from these draconian laws, he is saying that suddenly the media is 
<br/>going to do all these unnecessary things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- They are honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Not a bunch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable bunch.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, one of the first motions after 
<br/>2014 election that I moved in this Parliament was about getting the Media Decree or the Media Act 
<br/>repealed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me say that what did not happen on 15</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2015 when I moved that motion 
<br/>will  surely  happen  today.    As  I  have  said,  the  concerns  that  have  been  raised  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Members from the other side, and honourable Minister for Lands pointed that out very clearly that 
<br/>there are other laws - defamation laws and Crimes Act, they cover all those issues that they raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is clear, Mr. Speaker, from what we have seen over the last, at least, eight years that the 
<br/></span><span>MIDA Decree was like a noose around the neck of the media industry, journalists, editors, reporters 
<br/>and everyone and that will be gone after we repeal the Act today.  I urge the honourable Members 
<br/>because sometimes, I think, they cannot even understand their own interest today, because they have 
<br/>been so used to being in government and so used to muzzling the media that they cannot even see 
<br/>that the repealing of this Act will be beneficial for them, will be good for democracy and will be good 
<br/>for our people in this country.  That is what they do not understand, and it is quite sad that when they

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lose all sense of what the democracy is all about, this is what they do.  But very soon, they will realise 
<br/>that  what  we  are  doing  today  will  be  good  for  everyone,  good  for  the  Opposition  and  good  for 
<br/>democracy.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now call upon the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today is the day of restoration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Amen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Look at the gallery, look at the members of the media.  I did share 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that in my maiden speech.  It is the intention of this Government to repeal those laws that were not 
<br/>consulted through the people of Fiji.  That is plainly said by the Government team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- And in the process you removed protections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- The victory belongs to the people of Fiji, it does not belong to FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nor to the Coalition Government.  This is the day they have been waiting for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Salvation arises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Much  has  been  said,  complaining.    I  am  really  embarrassed  as  a 
<br/>member of this Parliament, I am not going to use a term that was used by predecessor.  I am going 
<br/>with  very simple  words.   I  want  the people of Fiji  to  understand that.   I  am  shocked,  </span><span>au madua.  
<br/>Tinikaono na yabaki eratou vakayagataka kina na lawa oqo me kau laivi na nodra dodonu na tamata. 
<br/></span><span>(They have been using this law for 16 years to supress people’s rights) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What is that?  Translate, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- </span><span>Matata vinaka. </span><span>(It is clear)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister mentioned one of those, the late, a school mate of 
<br/>mine who lived in Kilikali, Sitiveni Moce who worked for </span><span>Fiji Sun.  </span><span>He lost his life just because he 
<br/>was a journalist.  That is shame.  Shame on you!  I appeal to your conscience, especially to the new 
<br/>Members  of  FijiFirst,  do  the  right  thing  -  abstain  or  support  the  Bill.    I  commend  this  Bill,  Mr.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTAUKEI LAND TRUST (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to resolution of Parliament on Monday 3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>April, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  (Bill  No.  2/2023),  be  debated, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise on a Point of Order - Standing Order 61, 
<br/>“Member must not refer to judicial proceedings”.  May I bring to your attention and, of course, to 
<br/>the attention of this august Parliament as well that Bill No. 17 of 2021 or Act 22 of 2021 is the subject 
<br/>of pending litigation before the High Court in </span><span>Niko Nawaikula vs The Government of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji, Attorney-General of the Republic of Fiji and the iTaukei Trust Board</span><span> (Civil Action No. HBM 
<br/>063/2021). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hearing was conducted on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2021 and decision is on 
<br/>notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Niko Nawaikula, the applicant filed a notice of 
<br/>motion  for  constitutional  redress  on  13</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  2021.    In  support  of  the  motion,  he  filed  an 
<br/>affidavit on 13</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021 and in further support of the motion, he filed an affidavit deposed 
<br/>by the honourable Leader of Government on 14</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the applicant wants the court to declare that the iTaukei Lands 
<br/>Trust Budget (Amendment) Act 2021 of the substantive iTaukei Trust Act 1940, TLTA 1940 is null 
<br/>and void.  The applicant has asked the court for the following orders; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ground 1 that section 12(1)(a) is in breach of the </span><span>itaukei </span><span>landowners indigenous and 
<br/></span><span>human  rights  under  Article  6  of  the  International  Labour  Convention  or  ILO 
<br/>Convention 169.  Because of drafting error, there was no Ground 2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ground 3 was the enactment of section 12(1)(a) was done without prior consultation 
<br/>and without the consent of the iTaukei landowners contrary to and in breach of section 
<br/>12 of the TLTA 1940, the Common Law and the Convention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ground 4 was the enactment of section 12(1)(a) was in breach of Section 28(1) of the 
<br/></span><span>Constitution of the Republic of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ground 5, that the enactment of section 12(1)(a) was a breach of Section 29(1) and (2) 
<br/>of the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ground  6,  that  the  voting  procedure  utilized  in  Parliament  during  the  enactment  of 
<br/>Section 12(1)(a) breached Section 69(1) of the Constitution and Standing Orders 53 and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>983 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>54  of  the  Standing  Orders  of  the  Parliament  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  and  is  therefore 
<br/>unlawful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The applicant Mr. Speaker, Sir, has also asked for the court to declare the enactment of the 
<br/>iTaukei Land Trust Budget (Amendment) Act 2021 is null and void in its entirety and of no legal 
<br/>effect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  of  these  matters  need  to  be  determined  by  the  independent  judiciary  and  again  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Government  in  Parliament  supported  the  application  by  swearing  an 
<br/>affidavit in the proceedings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  iTLTB  is  a  party  to  this  action  and  iTLTB  was  consulted.    Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>attempting to pre-empt amp the decision of the High Court is not only irregular but in fact setting a 
<br/>dangerous precedent which undermines the separation of powers and can lead to corruption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have stated Standing Order 61 of the Parliament Standing Order states 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Member must not refer to judicial proceedings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When speaking, a member must not refer to any matter in relation to which a judicial decision 
<br/>is pending.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 44(13) also states, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A question must not refer to any matter in relation to which a judicial decision is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pending or is otherwise before a court of law”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me assure Government that this is not an attempt from the Opposition to 
<br/>be a hindrance to their legislative agenda, however, this is a matter of principle.  Parliament must set 
<br/>the  example.    Last  week,  in  our  End  of  Week  Statement,  the  honourable  Naupoto  spoke  on 
<br/>institutional integrity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  on  this  side  of  the  Parliament  totally  believe  that  as  responsible 
<br/>legislators, as responsible parliamentarians, it is our responsibility to lead by example and this is if 
<br/>we are to  set  the direction for our  country, for our people in  the new direction that the Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government is taking us through.  I would urge, it is my humble plea to you Mr. Speaker, Sir, and of 
<br/></span><span>course to the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Attorney-General that this is a matter that needs 
<br/>us to respect the rule of law, to show leadership and to do the right thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Naupoto  spoke  very  well  on  this,  talking  about  the  yardstick  for  good 
<br/>governance and he stated Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the key yardsticks for good governance is just to 
<br/>do the right thing.  That also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is leadership; making sure that we do the right things.  
<br/>Management  is  about  doing  things  right  and  I  hope,  again  it  is  my  humble  plea,  let  me  assure 
<br/>Government again, this is not trying to put up an obstacle but this is a matter of principle and this 
<br/></span><span>august Parliament must stand on the high  moral  ground and ensure that  we lead by example  and 
<br/></span><span>respect the rule of law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, as you are ware the Parliament resolved on Monday, 
<br/>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 that this Bill be debated, voted upon and be passed today and pursuant to the resolution 
<br/>of  the  Parliament  and  in  the  absence  of  the  full  details,  I  need  to  be  given  supporting  evidence,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Leader of the Opposition so that I also may make a decision and seek the advice of the 
<br/>Solicitor-General’s Office as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the absence of that,  as we have mentioned, Parliament will continue  with  this business 
<br/>accordingly but as this juncture, I invite the honourable Attorney-General to have share his views on 
<br/>the point that you have raised.  I will go according to what we have decided in this Parliament and I 
<br/>have  already  quoted  from  the  House  of  Commons  in  1600  where  the  Speaker,  even  though  the 
<br/>intervention of King Charles, stood his ground on the decision of you honourable Members in this 
<br/>Parliament and we have already decided on that on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Thank you for intervention, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  As I have said, it is 
<br/>very shameful.  It is a very fundamental aspect of constitutional law there is a separation of powers.  
<br/>That is what the other side have been saying and I am going to quote you the relevant provision that 
<br/>does not impede the power of this august Parliament.  Section 46(1) of the Constitution states, and I 
<br/>quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  authority  and  power  to  make  laws  for  the  State  is  vested  in  Parliament 
<br/>consisting of the members of Parliament and the President and is exercised through the 
<br/>enactment of Bills (which we are deliberating today) passed by Parliament and assented 
<br/>to by the President.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Standing  Order  61  refers  to  when  you  make  your  deliberation,  you  cannot  refer  to  a 
<br/>particular law that is before pending. It does not impede the power of Parliament to make laws. That 
<br/>is very basic.  I am shocked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I think you need to know that this Bill will go through because it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>destined to go through. Give us the opportunity to deliberate on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it says clearly in our deliberations, we cannot because we will pre-judging 
<br/>what the court will say. It does not impede this part to deliberate on Bills. It is not retrospective, those 
<br/>matters will be decided on the laws at that time. Today it will be repealed.  Just like the “No Jab, No 
<br/>Job” Policy - it has no retrospective effect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Thank you.  Look, you always have a legal recourse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I am a lawyer, you are not.  I am the Attorney-General, you are not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame on you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Do you work.  You should have raised it on Monday.  Too 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>slow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I?

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>985 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame on you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue, honourable Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  The  iTaukei  Land  Trust  (Amendment)  Bill  2023  was  tabled  in 
<br/>Parliament on Monday 3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 as Bill No. 2 of 2023.  It is my pleasant task, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>to speak on the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill seeks to amend the iTaukei Land Trust Act 1940 which I will refer to as the Act to 
<br/>remove the amendments brought about by the iTaukei Land Trust (Budget Amendment) Act 2021 
<br/>which I will refer to as Act No. 22 of 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that provides for the administration of iTaukei Land wherein section 4 of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Act.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you just hold on for a bit, honourable Attorney-General? You have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduced the motion and is there a seconder to complete the process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I second it again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, please be reminded that pursuant to the resolution of 
<br/>Parliament the debate on the Bill will be limited to one hour.  I now call upon the Attorney-General 
<br/>to now speak on his motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I continue from where I left off?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill seeks to amend the iTaukei Land Trust Act 1940 which I referred to as the Act to 
<br/>remove the amendment  brought about by the iTaukei Land Trust (Budget Amendment) Act 2021 
<br/>which is now commonly referred as Act No. 22 of 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Act provides for the administration of iTaukei Land wherein section 4 of the Act, the 
<br/>control of all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land vest in the iTaukei Land Trust Board (iTLTB) and all such lands shall be 
<br/>administered by iTLTB in the benefit of the iTaukei landowners or the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people.  The effect of 
<br/>this provision is that legal ownership remains with the  Landowning Units ((LOUs) but control of 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land is transferred to and vested in iTLTB. Essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what it means the 
<br/>legal owner of an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land is the iTLTB.  When you want to lease land, you have to open through 
<br/>the door, that door is called iTLTB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, section 12 of the Act was amended by Act No. 22 of 2021 to remove the requirement 
<br/>of obtaining consent from iTLTB. For any mortgage, charge, pledge, caveat or for any such lease to 
<br/>be dealt with by any court of law or under the process of any court of law.  Moreover, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Act No. 22 of 2021 also amends section 12 of the Act, to provide that consent of iTLTB can only be 
<br/>refused whether it is a breach of any lease condition or where such application to deal with the land 
<br/>is not in accordance with any law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are the pertinent features of the Bill?  In relation to the Bill, there are three clauses: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title and commencement.  If passed by Parliament, 
<br/>the new legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister by notice in 
<br/>the Gazette. So, it is forward looking, it is not retrospective. 
<br/></span><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 12 of the Act to remove the amendments made by Act 
<br/></span><span>No. 22 of 2021; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>986 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause  3  of  the  Bill  amends  the  Act  by  inserting  a  new  section  12(a)  to  provide  the 
<br/>transitional provision and give clarity to any application for any mortgage, charge, pledge, 
<br/>caveat or for any such lease to be dealt with by any court of law that were made from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>August, 2021 which was when Act No. 22 of 2021 came into force.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 3 of the Bill provides that for any mortgage resisted from 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2021 until when the new legislation comes into force, it is deemed to have acquired the 
<br/>required consent under section 12 of the Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, for any application for any mortgage received from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2021 and before the 
<br/>commencement when this new legislation will come into force, and is still yet to be processed, must 
<br/>acquire the required consent under section 12 of the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, furthermore for any charge, pledge, caveat or lease to be dealt with by any court 
<br/>of law, another process of any court of law under section 12 on or after 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2021 and before 
<br/>the commencement of the iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Act 2023 is exempted from the required 
<br/>consent in accordance with section 12.  This is also the case where applications are received and are 
<br/>yet to be processed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the consultation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had mentioned on Monday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/>that proper consultation with landowning units and relevant stakeholders were not conducted in a 
<br/>proper manner in 2021.  Act No. 22 of 2021 was rushed through during the parliamentary process.  
<br/>Moreover,  I  had  also  referred  to  section  11  of  the  iTaukei  Affairs  Act  1944  in  relation  to  the 
<br/>requirement  of  iTaukei  Affairs  Board  to  be  consulted  on  any  Bills  affecting  iTaukei  Affairs  or 
<br/>affecting the rights and interest of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can confirm that the consultation on the Bill was held with the Ministry 
<br/>of iTaukei Affairs, the iTaukei Affairs Board, the Office of the Solicitor-General, the iTaukei Land 
<br/>Trust Board and the </span><span>vanua</span><span> through the 14 Provincial Councils. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would 
<br/>also clarify to the august Parliament that the Association of Banks in Fiji was also consulted on the 
<br/>Bill and the Association is supportive of the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to enlighten this august Parliament in making reference to the 
<br/>International Labour Convention (ILO).  The Labour Organisation Convention or Indigenous and 
<br/>Tribal  People  1989  (ILO  Convention  169)  which  is  a  major  binding  international  Convention 
<br/>concerning indigenous and tribal people and a forerunner of the United Nations Declaration on the 
<br/></span><span>Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP). Fiji ratified the ILO Convention on the 3</span><span>rd</span><span> March, 1998.  
<br/></span><span>Under  Article  6  of  the  ILO  Convention  169,  in  relation  to  the  consideration  of  the  legislative  or 
<br/>administrative measures which may affect indigenous people directly, the Government is required to 
<br/>few obligations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To consult the people concerned through appropriate procedures and in particular through 
<br/>their representative institutions.   
<br/>Establish means by which the people can freely participate at all levels of decision making, 
<br/>in  elective  institutions,  administrative  and  other  bodies  responsible  for  policies  and 
<br/></span><span>programmes which concerns them. 
<br/></span><span>Establish means for the full development of these people’s own institutions and initiatives 
<br/>and the appropriate cases, provide the resources necessary for their purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Consultations  shall  be  undertaken  in  good  faith  and  in  a  form  appropriate  to  the 
<br/>circumstances  with  the  objective  of  achieving  agreement  or  consent  to  the  proposed 
<br/></span><span>measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>987 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, basically we have complied with Article 6 of 169.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section  28  of  the  Constitution  of  Republic  of  Fiji  recognises  the  rights  and  ownership  of 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land as follows, I quote: “The ownership of all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land shall remain with the customary 
<br/>owners of that land…”   Sir, ownership if </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land entails a number of ancillary or incidental 
<br/>rights.    These  ancillary  or  incidental  rights  include  the  right  to  possession,  the  right  to  control, 
<br/>inclusive of the right to manage, the right of exclusion, the right to derive income and the right of 
<br/>disposition.  These are the basic property rights as recognised under the Commonwealth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the right of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners to control should include the 
<br/>right of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners to consent to dealings with </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land on the basis of ownership 
<br/>and ownership only.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will conclude with the story of Naboth’s Vineyard in 1 King Chapter 21, which illustrates 
<br/>the importance of natural resources to indigenous landowners.  Naboth was an Israelite, who owned 
<br/>a vineyard that had been in his family for generations.  King Ahab wanted the vineyard for himself, 
<br/>but  Naboth  refused  to  sell  it  to  him,  sighting  the  laws  of  inheritance  and  God’s  commandments 
<br/>regarding the ownership of land.  However, Ahab’s wife Queen Jezebel orchestrated a plot and falsely 
<br/>accused Naboth of blasphemy, leading to his execution and pontification of his vineyard by the King. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the story serves as  a cautionary tale against the abuse  of power and the 
<br/>exploitation of natural resources and at the expense of indigenous landowners.  Just as Naboth refused 
<br/>to sell his ancestral vineyard to King Ahab, indigenous landownership in Fiji have a responsibility to 
<br/>manage  their  land  in  a  way  that  is  consistent  with  the  biblical  principle  of  stewardship  and 
<br/>conservation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, Isaiah 24:4:6 warns against exploitation and destruction of the land and 
<br/>its resources.  It describes a world where the earth dries up and withers, and the Heavens fade away 
<br/>when land is mismanaged.  This is a reminder that the consequence of mismanaging the land and its 
<br/>resources is severe and far-reaching.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, landowners in Fiji have a responsibility to use their land in a manner that is consistent 
<br/>with God’s purpose for creation.  These includes managing their land sustainably and ensuring its 
<br/>long term health and productivity, which is why it is important for </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, to be consulted and be informed on matters relating to their land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The motion is open for debate on the motion.  I have in front of me a list 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of speakers been confirmed by the honourable Whips, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration;  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.  Act No. 22 or best referred 
<br/>to  as  Bill  No.  17,  when  it  was  pushed  through  Parliament,  the  Bill,  in  my  view,  was  completely 
<br/>unnecessary for the fact that the intent of the Bill is to improve processes, particularly, of the iTLTB, 
<br/>was something that the iTLTB was already doing well anyway.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the fact that they were contentions around that the purpose of the Bill was to deny  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>988 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the landowners, and they said you ought to be consulted on a matter affecting their land.  So, that 
<br/>was what became later as the subject of the contention in the Bill, also because there was obviously 
<br/>the issue of consultation, so that became the heart of the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During its debate, I remember the Opposition at the time had objected to it.  Not only that, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, I can say that when the Bill was introduced it was introduced in a bit of a dodgy way, 
<br/>because it was tucked in as part of the Consequential Bills for the Budget of that year in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The matter of consultation became such a big issue here.  We had strongly opposed it on that 
<br/>basis.  I remember I had put out a video as part of my objection to the Bill when it was tabled.  Quite 
<br/>unfortunately, because I assumed that to be my role and my right as a Member of Parliament to bring 
<br/>to the public my concerns about the matter as it would deserve for the public to know, that others 
<br/>including me, were taken in by the police and arrested for it.  Not only once, but a number of times.  
<br/>I found this to be quite concerning.  So, we only talked about MIDA and how people are free to air 
<br/>their voices about their matters of concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  people  do  not  need  to  agree  with  Government,  that  is  why  we  have  an 
<br/>Opposition.    So,  when  the  people  oppose  the  Government  of  the  day,  I  feel  that  is  healthy  for 
<br/>democracy.    So,  to  try  and  push  it  through  an  agenda  like  this  in  such  a  way  and  something  as 
<br/>important as native land, or the land belonging to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, is surely going to attract resistance and 
<br/>perhaps, resistance by the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  just  want  to  say  that  this  is  long  time  coming,  Mr.  Speaker.    There  was  hardly  any 
<br/>consultation made on it, so I believe the people have the right to say about their land, and when this 
<br/>was enacted, it was the denial of their right.  I support the Bill that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today is a day of celebrations for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners 
<br/>and Fiji.  Sir, 6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 is a day to correct the wrong on the administration of our </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land.  
<br/>We are fortunate that Act No. 22 of 2021 is only over one year old.  If we leave Act No. 22 for long, 
<br/>it will create a mess in the administration of our </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were no consultations at all on Bill No. 17.  The consultation on Bill No.17 was only 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done after the Bill was passed in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Shame!

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly support the motion before us, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to amend the Act that we are considering today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  effectively,  it  is  repealing  the  changes  enforced  through  what  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>notoriously known as Bill No. 17.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 30</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2021, we can remember all too well the passage of the notorious Bill No. 17, 
<br/>lesser known as the iTaukei Land Trust (Budget Amendment) Act 2021 and how it was passed in 
<br/>Parliament by the then Government, of course, now in the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They, Mr. Speaker, railroaded this amendment under Standing Order 51 with no consultation 
<br/>whatsoever with the primary stakeholders, who are our iTaukei customary landowners.  How could 
<br/>we forget, Mr. Speaker, yet another dark-stained or draconian political intimidation and persecution 
<br/>of dissenting voices, such as many of ours, now sitting on this side of Parliament, when we were hold 
<br/>up by the CID Police for repeated questioning.  The honourable Prime Minister was taken in as well 
<br/>about this law when we made public our statements against it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill was tabled in Parliament and as Members of Parliament, we have the right to talk 
<br/>about that Bill, but we were hold up by the Police during COVID-19 curfew hours and repeatedly 
<br/>questioned not once, in my case four times, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, how could we ever forget those moments when it became clear to the nation 
<br/>that the Parliamentary Privilege and our views on Bill No. 17 as elected representatives of the people 
<br/>were  meaningless  to  the  Opposition  side  now,  and  all  those  who  were  enabling  that  to  happen?  
<br/>Basically, those who were drunk on power at that time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look back to the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>of the debate that occurred on Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2021, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the justification from the other side fooled no one, least of all the people of Fiji.  
<br/>The other side who was there that day all said in many different ways (I remember that very vividly) 
<br/>that  the  intention  of  the  law  change  was  to  improve  business  efficiency  by  eliminating  delays  in 
<br/>getting iTLTB consent for mortgages.  And we were just told by both the honourable for iTaukei</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Affairs and honourable Attorney-General that even the banks do not oppose this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know, Mr. Speaker, we consulted with a number of lawyers when we were debating this 
<br/>Bill at that time.  Many of them told us that, in fact, the iTaukei Land Trust Board was actually more 
<br/>efficient  than  the  Lands  Department  in  terms  of  facilitating  the  consent  for  mortgages  and  other 
<br/>things.    Yet,  yet  they  arrogantly  and  disrespectfully  crushed  any  opportunity  for  process  of 
<br/>consultation with the owners of the asset, which the iTLTB is merely a custodian of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other side, Mr. Speaker, alluded to slow iTLTB consent processes, yet the former Prime 
<br/>Minister who was the Chair of iTLTB had every opportunity since 2015 to reform iTLTB business 
<br/>processes to minimise administrative hurdles that were slow and cumbersome.  And I am sure that 
<br/>the iTLTB would be paying attention to this particular issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our position to the amendment of all of us on this side who were there, Mr. Speaker, we 
<br/>were hit with scorn, ridiculed, allegations of racial rhetoric, yet now, that we sit on this side, we are 
<br/>in a position to know that the marketing push for this law change was perhaps not as glossy as they 
<br/>made the sales. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  today,  I  have  the  utmost  joy  in  supporting  the  motion  to  repeal  the 
<br/>amendment to the Act and fully endorse the reversion to the law as it was in June 2021 before the 
<br/></span><span>FijiFirst Government tinkered with it and it sealed its fate at the 2022 false because of their arrogance 
<br/></span><span>in taking away liberties that were not theirs to take. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the 1940 iTaukei Land Trust Act was enacted, it was on the basis of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>three founding pillars: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Consultations with landowning units throughout the length and breadth of the Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>991 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Confidence.  With consultations, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, an embodiment of wisdom and 
<br/>chiefly authority, gained the confidence of the landowners of creating the idea for a Board 
<br/>to administer the land. 
<br/>Trust.    With  confidence  gained,  the  landowners  gave  their  trust  and  consent  to  the 
<br/>enactment to establish the Board which has served them to the present day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  very  aptly  spoken  by  Ratu  Sir  Lala  Sukuna,  and  I  quote,  “These  are  acts  of  trust, 
<br/>unmatched in our time”.  We ought to take a lesson from this historical process of consultation, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, to concur with landowners and assure them that their trust is not being undermined.  
<br/>This  must  be  done  at  all  times,  but  consultation  as  we  know  was  not  the  style  of  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.    The  amendments  were  rushed  through  Parliament  in  July  2021.    It  was  an  act  of 
<br/>arrogance and utmost disrespect of the worst crime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I conclude, let me say this; ever since Independence, all Governments and all political 
<br/>parties have respected the primacy of land rights of Fiji’s indigenous people.  The National Federation 
<br/>Party (NFP) and its respected leaders of the past - (the Party began in the 1960s as a party representing 
<br/>tenant farmers), we have always respected the rights of indigenous people through their land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  dialogue  and  consultation,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  had  a  history  of  stability  and 
<br/>economic prosperity through that consultation and dialogue.  We have always recognised that matters 
<br/>concerning iTaukei land are matters for the iTaukei.  We agree  that any changes to law affecting 
<br/>iTaukei land should be widely consulted on and decided upon by the iTaukei landowners.  I strongly 
<br/>support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have raised our Point of Order and I just want 
<br/>to  clarify, once again,  our position for the record of Parliament because  we believe, according to 
<br/>Standing Order 61, that we need to be on the right footing and that is why the Opposition are not 
<br/>participating in the deliberations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the record of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Well noted, honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I just slowly read Standing Order 61, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…a member must not refer to any matter in relation to which a judicial decision is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pending.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Any matter does not apply.  This is a Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Standing Order refers to,  as  I have said earlier, in case of discussion when a right is 
<br/>given to a member to speak on, you cannot refer to a matter that is pending in Court.  So, the objection 
<br/>is really misplaced and misconceived.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  has 
<br/>articulated his views clearly, crystal clear.  Once and for all, we have someone who understands the 
<br/></span><span>land tenure system and the value of the land.  It is quite shocking that our </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>brothers on the 
<br/></span><span>other side (honourable Members) cannot see that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  did  not  go  through  the  consultations  as  demanded  by  law.    The  very  people  who  were 
<br/>supposed to be consulted were not consulted and today, we are here to resolve the issue.  The issue 
<br/>of this Bill is actually regarding some problems administratively when there is a delay.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  answer  to  that  is  administrative,  create  a  system  within  the 
<br/>administration of iTLTB to fast-track the delay.  But what they have done is, they have created a 
<br/>totally new Bill and a more controversial one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am thankful to the Coalition Government, to the people of Fiji, to the people sitting out in 
<br/>the gallery.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, as a paramount chief of Fiji, you have participated in 
<br/>the deliberation of Bill No. 17 and now it is only befitting that you, in your Chair as Speaker, in this 
<br/>Easter weekend to listen to a very important Bill that is the heart, soul and spirit of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> - the 
<br/>land.  I commend this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- We opposed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, you have decided not to vote so that is your decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Get your act together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Order 51, passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji (Act No. 2 of 2023)]
