<h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery 
<br/>and  those  watching  the  live  proceedings  on  television  and  the  internet.   Thank  you  for  taking  an 
<br/>interest in your Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming another group of PL 100 students from 
<br/>the University of the South Pacific.  This is the same that we did with your colleagues who joined us 
<br/>this week, and I hope each and every one of you will enjoy and also learn from today’s proceedings. 
<br/>You are most welcome to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to welcome the Diplomatic Staff of the Australian High Commission in Suva who are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>joining us this morning – welcome to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to acknowledge those in the gallery, the former Minister Samisoni Tikoinasau and 
<br/>your good wife, and the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Tamavua, Ratu Meli Loki, and anyone else who is seated there that 
<br/>I have not mentioned their names, we welcome you also to today’s Sitting.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tabling of Written Reponses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  inform  honourable  Members  that  the  Secretariat  has  received 
<br/>written responses from the Minister for Housing and Local Government to Written Question No. 61 
<br/>of 2023, asked by the honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster 
<br/>Management.  Honourable Members, the response has been conveyed to honourable Vocea and a 
<br/>copy will be made available on the Parliament website.

<div><span>Decorum in Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  at  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  remind  you  that  the  Speaker  must 
<br/>ensure that the provisions of Standing Orders relating to proper conduct and behaviour are observed 
<br/>so as to ensure order and decorum in the Chambers and gallery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that respect, I remind honourable Members to observe proper conduct and behaviour and 
<br/>avoid the beating of the tables.  This is something new and if you are not careful, it will surely affect 
<br/>the way we protect the decorum of our noble Parliament – yelling and unnecessary disruption to a 
<br/>Member who is being given the floor, so to speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, please be reminded that your mobile phones must be on silent mode and this has 
<br/>been happening quite a few times as well. Put it on silent mode during all sessions in Parliament.  I 
<br/>hope to see an improvement during today’s proceedings and in future sittings. 
<br/></span></div>
