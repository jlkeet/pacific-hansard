<br/>(Question No. 78/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  current  role  of  the  Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  what  has  the 
<br/>Ministry achieved so far? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ketal Lal is like my little son… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I will come to that.  I attended his 21</span><span>st</span><span> Birthday and I gave him a gift. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>did not realise that he will sit on the other side of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you started this.  Before you stood, you are already 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>firing away.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K.LAL.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, Point of Order, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Standing  Order  60  -  relevance.    I  asked  a  very  simple  question  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister, however, he wants to go off track, so I request, Mr. Speaker, if you can ask him 
<br/>to answer the question that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is just getting there.  Honourable Minister, please, provide the answer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Last week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Deputy Prime Minister had alluded in 
<br/>this Parliament about the Multi-Ethnic Programme and what is going to happen in the future.  I think 
<br/>honourable Ketan Lal was daydreaming then.  If he had listened to the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister, he would have asked his question correctly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I will answer the question now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question from the honourable Member.  It has been 
<br/>three months that I have been in this role as the Minister, and I am pleased to inform Parliament on 
<br/>the developments in the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I want to thank the People’s Coalition Government for re-establishing this Ministry 
<br/>that  provided  an  equitable  opportunity  to  address  the  development  needs  of  all  diverse  cultural 
<br/>communities and its implementation towards self-help and educational assistance programme in the 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to provide a brief background on the rationale behind the 
<br/>initiatives of the prior Government in developing the programmes from 2001 to 2010.  I have gained 
<br/>inside knowledge of how this Ministry’s objectives have evolved during the decade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2001,  the  Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  facilitated  three  programmes  that  included 
<br/>Multi-Ethnic Community Development, Cultural Enhancement and Education Assistance with grants 
<br/>budgeted of $1 million to the poor and the disadvantaged. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By 2005, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was an inclusion of the fourth programme – National/District 
<br/>Advisory Councils, which provided a link between the Ministry and the community, as well towards 
<br/>identifying  and  implementing  self-help  projects  at  community  level.    The  budget  grant  increased 
<br/>from $1.5 million, and the Ministry had a total expenditure of $8 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  2007  to  2010,  the  Ministry’s  role  had  advanced  from  not  only 
<br/>providing  self-help  and  educational  assistance,  but  to  a  more  intensive  role  of  preservation  of 
<br/>different cultures in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 2007, there was a major increase in grant from $1.5 million to $1.6 million in 2006 and 
<br/>increased to $21.247 million in 2007.  The total expenditure of the Ministry in 2010, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, was approximately $26 million with grants estimated at $9 million.  However, in November, the 
<br/>former Minister for Economy and Attorney-General had announced that the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Affairs be dissolved and that the functions are integrated with other Ministries which was effective 
<br/>on 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2011.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The development of the Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, led to the transfer of the Multi-Ethnic 
<br/>Affairs  Scholarship  to  the  Public  Service  Commission  and  the  Ministry  of  Culture  managed  all 
<br/>cultural programmes while the Ministry of Provincial Development was responsible for the Rural 
<br/>Advisory Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  most  delighted,  indeed,  that  the  question  has  been  posed  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Member,  which  gives  me  the  opportunity  to  re-emphasise  the  core  existence  of  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  its  role,  and  that  is  to  revamp  and  continue  to  provide  an 
<br/>equitable  opportunity  to  address  the  development  needs  of  all  diverse  cultural  communities  and 
<br/>implementation towards self-help and educational assistance programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs’  operations  practically  came  into  effect  on  27</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>February, 2023 with the absorption of 10 staff from the Ministry of Waterways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  primary  role  of  the  Ministry  as  advisor  to  the  Government  and  also 
<br/>implementer, is to include all ethnic groups in Fiji, especially the poor and the underprivileged via 
<br/>diverse programmes.  The Ministry will provide advice to all ethnic groups on scholarships, cultural 
<br/>activities and administer funds to support strategic engagements and partnership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  currently  in  its  planning  stage, 
<br/>given that it is only a month old and as per its core role and responsibilities, we have reorganised our 
<br/>structure  and  are  preparing  for  the  budget  for  the  next  financial  year,  together  with  strategic  and 
<br/>operational plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that from my last trip to New Zealand, 
<br/>I have managed to talk to Dr. Rajendra Prasad, a very prominent person.  He was a politician in New 
<br/>Zealand and is of Indo-Fijian descent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dr. Prasad led Massey University at Albany during its establishment in 1993 and was Race 
<br/>Relations Conciliator between 1996 and 2001.  He was appointed as the first Chief Commissioner of 
<br/>the newly established Families Commission in 2008.  He actually saw me, together with a prominent 
<br/>lawyer,  Mr.  Rahde  Nand,  and  he  has  volunteered  at  no  cost  to  the  Fiji  Government,  to  help  us 
<br/>establish and write the framework for Multi-Ethnic Affairs.  He has also said that his airfares and 
<br/>accommodation will be taken by the New Zealand High Commission.  So, you can see how people 
<br/>are keen to assist us, to set up this Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  in  the  process  of  acquiring  all  the  needed  resources,  the 
<br/>Ministry is consulting other stakeholder agencies and experts to develop sound policies as per the 
<br/>mandate of this Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we expect to be in full operation by the fourth quarter 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of this year, and we look forward to serve our diverse communities. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Minister  for  enlightenment  about  the 
<br/>question.    You  have  spoken  about  some  grants  given  to  your  Ministry,  so  could  you,  please,  be 
<br/>specific on some of the projects that these grants funded and how this has enhanced participatory 
<br/>opportunities for the people of different backgrounds, especially for the beneficiaries contributing at 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>995 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the national level for inclusion, equality and prosperity of the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been very clear that we are putting up a policy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>framework of this Ministry and once this is being done, the reply will come to you. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, all that he stated in his statement were previous 
<br/>achievements of  the Ministry from 2000 to2010.  We have not seen the framework. The Ministry 
<br/>has been established since 24</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2022. What is happening in the Ministry right now, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in terms of achievement?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difference between that time and us is different.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They never consulted, we consulted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>has the Ministry implemented any initiatives to enhance culture awareness and sensitivity among the 
<br/>members, including public servants and law enforcement agencies?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, honourable Ketan Lal does not know that we 
<br/>are going to celebrate the Girmit Day and that comes under Multi-Ethnic Affairs.  What else do you 
<br/>want? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been talking about institutional integrity.  
<br/>We have been talking about wastage. Why are we wasting time?  Do you go into that Ministry with 
<br/>no concept with no idea?  Do you have to get someone from New Zealand to come and tell you what 
<br/>to do?  My question is, why are you wasting time? Why are you not delivering services?  Why the 
<br/>wastage? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir , I hope this is the final question from the  other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Now, you should realise, I have two portfolios.  The sugar industry also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is my priority.  Therefore, I am also taking on that portfolio for the last three months... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- … and this will be done from next month. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.

<div><span>New National Rehabilitation Centre 
<br/>(Question No. 79/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>996 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plans for a new National Rehabilitation Centre to replace the current Twomey Hospital in 
<br/>Tamavua? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Tuiwailevu 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, work on the new National Rehabilitation Centre in Tamavua is expected to 
<br/>start  soon.    Cabinet  has  approved  a  subsidiary  arrangement  between  the  Ministry  of  Health  and 
<br/>Medical Services and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), to establish the Fiji 
<br/>National Rehabilitation Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as arranged by the Korean Government through KOICA, they will provide 
<br/>a  Grant-in-Aid  of  not  more  than  US$10  million,  which  is  equivalent  to  FJ$22.2  million.      The 
<br/>Government  and  the  people  of  Fiji  are  grateful  to  the  people  of  Korea  through  KOICA  for  their 
<br/>generous assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the old Rehabilitation Centre, as we all know, in Tamavua has been declared 
<br/>as  non-compliant  with  OHS  requirements  and  this  is  due  to  non-maintenance  for  buildings  and 
<br/>facilities as they were built decades ago.  Therefore, part of the plan is to decommission and demolish 
<br/>the current building and prepare the land for the construction of the new rehabilitation hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the relocation plan also includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Relocation of stores to shipping containers - containers need to be purchased and converted 
<br/>to office and storage space; 
<br/>renovation of stores and adjacent areas and convert it to rehabilitation clinic; 
<br/>Nurses and doctors’ office space; 
<br/>construct wheelchair accessible washrooms for male and female; 
<br/>construct waiting area for outpatients; 
<br/>construct ramp for waiting areas to the clinic; 
<br/>construct ramp from main road to the carpark; and 
<br/>upgrade power supply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health is expected to shoulder the initial operational cost to 
<br/>demolish  the old  Rehabilitation Centre, as well as the cost  for site preparation, relocation cost  or 
<br/>moving health services from the old Rehabilitation Centre to the Tamavua Twomey Hospital, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  latter  has  been  done  in  the  previous  term  of  Parliament  through  the 
<br/></span><span>previous  Government,  in  terms  of  moving  the  patients  that  were  in  the  old  Rehabilitation  Centre 
<br/>down to the Tamavua Twomey Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  through  the  Ministry  will  also  facilitate  other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>administrative measures for the design and construction of the building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Emigration and Immigration Trends 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 80/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the recent emigration and immigration trends? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>997 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  the  opportunity  to  reply  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member’s question and I thank him for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  before  answering  the  question,  I  would  like  to  take  this  time  to  wish  a  very 
<br/>special person a Happy 90</span><span>th</span><span> Birthday. He is Father Allan Finn, I have mentioned his name in this 
<br/>Parliament seven times during my Maiden Speeches since I have been a Member of Parliament.  He 
<br/>came from Australia in 1964, baptised me and married me off and he is still well and alive.  I would 
<br/>like to wish him a very happy birthday today.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  answering  the  honourable  Member’s  question,  identifying  trends  require 
<br/>detailed studies over a long time period.  Accurate data on immigration is difficult to capture.  This 
<br/>is because data collected at exit points indicate events and not individuals because it may indicate the 
<br/>same person leaving multiple times.   But in terms of medium to long term emigration which means, 
<br/>people who leave for more than three months to those leaving permanently, more people leave Fiji 
<br/>than  those  who  are  coming  in.    In  fact,  the  size  of  our  emigrant  population  compared  to  Fiji’s 
<br/>population  sits  from  20  percent  to  30  percent.    This  means  that  if  Fiji  has  a  population  of  90</span><span>th</span><span>  a 
<br/>million, 200,000 to 300,000 are living outside of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia  remains  the  highest  destination  for  emigration  which,  in  2019  alone,  sits  over 
<br/>70,000.  Between 2000 and 2016, 51 percent of Fijians leaving for Australia went through the skills 
<br/>stream.  These figures are expected to increase because of the Pacific Labour Scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Permanent  and  long-term  migration  from  Fiji  has  continuously  increased  over  the  years  - 
<br/>massive  migration  including  permanent  departure  of  highly  qualified  and  professionally  trained 
<br/>people.    Contemporary  emigration  dynamics  have  included  increased  temporary  migration  to  a 
<br/>growing range of destinations, driven by labour opportunities.  Fiji also battles skill losses due to 
<br/>migration and waves of immigration in the 1980s to 2000 saw the loss of up to half of its skilled 
<br/>professionals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is a hub, amongst the Pacific Islands, for work, education and training, 
<br/>and a major tourist destination from around the globe.  Although modest in number, contemporary 
<br/>immigration has played a crucial role in Fiji - filling gaps in specialist positions, strengthening public 
<br/>services, including medical services, stimulating foreign investment and providing low-cost labour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  number  of  permits  issued  has  fluctuated  significantly  during  the  year  2018  and  2021 
<br/>between 10,573 and 18,468 annually.  Over the course of four years, most permits were issued for 
<br/>extension to visitors’ permit which is around 14,956.  Students were the largest category with 11,822 
<br/>permits issued between 2018 and 2021.  This was followed by long term work permits and exemption 
<br/>status effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, irregular migration encompasses illegal entering, either by evading border 
<br/>controls or using false documents, overstaying of a valid period of staying, or violating the terms of 
<br/>stay - most commonly  working when not  authorised to do so.  Human trafficking when it occurs 
<br/>across  international  borders,  is  an  extreme  form  of  irregular  migration  involving  coercion  and 
<br/>exploitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Data on denials of entry to Fiji are collected by Immigration Officials at the border and stored 
<br/>in  the  Integrated  Border  Management  System  (IBMS).    Most  denials  are  at  Nadi  International 
<br/>Airport, Fiji’s largest port of entry.  Denials can be for a range of reasons, including not meeting the 
<br/>correct entry requirements, not being considered genuine visitors, or links to a criminal activity.  In 
<br/>recent years, border officials have identified an emerging trend of motorcycle gangs connected to 
<br/>criminal activity, trying to enter Fiji from either Australia or New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of the regular migrants in Fiji are visa overstayers.  In 2018, over 11,800 people were 
<br/>estimated to be illegally in the country after overstaying their visa.  The largest groups are students 
<br/>from the Pacific Region, with about 3,000 students overstaying in 2018, mainly from the Solomon 
<br/>Islands.  Students sometimes enrolled in universities while on visitors’ permits, often overstayed as 
<br/>well.  Overstayers are detected on departing the country and are issued a notice prohibiting them 
<br/>from entering the country for a set period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investigations  by  the  Immigration  compliances  may  also  identify  overstayers  for  removal 
<br/>from the country.  Some can apply for an uplift or prohibited immigrant to re-enter, which is on the 
<br/>discretion  of  the  Permanent  Secretary.  Prohibited  immigrants  have  been  removed  or  returned 
<br/>voluntarily in the four years between 2018 and 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it has been demonstrated that remittances sent from Fijians abroad have a positive and 
<br/>significant impact on driving long term economic growth and have taken on a significant role in the 
<br/>economy.    They  specifically  aid  in  the  reduction  of  poverty  and  mitigate  the  effects  of  domestic 
<br/>economy  shocks,  like  natural  disasters.    More  Fijians  have  joined  the  cash  economy  and  formal 
<br/>banking systems as a result of remittances, which have had a variety of positive effects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impact of the country profile 2020 on social indicators like education, 
<br/>however, immigration has also brought about social problems, like family dissolution, lack of able-
<br/>bodied young men from rural areas and shifts in how families and communities interact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The emigration of skilled workers has been particularly concerning for Fiji’s small labour 
<br/>market.   Between the 1980s and 2000, there were waves in  emigration that  occurred  following a 
<br/>number of </span><span>coups</span><span>.  Important industries, like education and healthcare, were particularly hard-hit by 
<br/>the emigration of professionals and skilled workers.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are few asylum seekers entering and leaving Fiji.  Trafficking in people too through 
<br/>Fiji is a constant problem that includes the sexual exploitation of children and trafficking of children 
<br/>in Fiji for work.  In Fiji, most of the irregular migration is caused by visitors who stay longer than 
<br/>their visa allows.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Fijian immigration patterns  changed dramatically over the 
<br/>years.  Increased number of Fijians have sought permanent settlement in high income countries, and 
<br/>these higher emigration flows have been sustained.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is estimated that more Fijians have left Fiji permanently.  Australia has been the preferred 
<br/>destination country, followed by Canada, the United States and New Zealand.  Today, skilled based 
<br/>migration programmes in Australia, New Zealand and other countries continue to attract the most 
<br/>qualified professionals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, research suggests that skilled losses may be less significant than previously thought 
<br/>based solely on emigration figures because not all of these young men will actually emigrate.  The 
<br/>prospect of migration may encourage them to stay in school and receive additional training, resulting 
<br/>in a net increase in the skill levels of Fiji’s domestic labour market.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.36 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.-  Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>and to put that question into perspective, I think the dynamics of labour mobility now has changed 
<br/>internationally and locally because of the PALM Scheme and all those who are going. I think COVID 
<br/>has also played a big role - people changed jobs and they find new businesses that they would prefer 
<br/>to go to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The push and pull factors for emigration and migration in Fiji is unique in a way because the 
<br/>same  wages  that  push  people  away  from  Fiji  pulls  people  from  big  population  countries,  like 
<br/>Bangladesh and India.  For them, the wages that push us away is good enough for them and, therein, 
<br/>that labour mobility, the flow that happens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  tool  that  we  can  use  very  quickly  to  analyse  that  and,  that  is,  the  Immigration 
<br/>departure forms that we fill when we go out of the airport. I just travelled to Tonga recently and I 
<br/>think that is the same form that was there for years that you fill in.  It is really a form that collects 
<br/>data that you can very quickly analyse, so strategic planning would love to have that data as their 
<br/>planning for the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is when was that form last amended and will it be in the interest of the Ministry 
<br/>to have a look at it and factor in the dynamics of labour mobility that is happening now to capture 
<br/>that data? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Member for his question. Specifically, for 
<br/>the form, I cannot tell you as to when was the last time it was looked at, but it is definitely time for 
<br/>review. You will recognise, Mr. Speaker, that in countries like Australia, they do not have departure 
<br/>cards anymore.  A lot of that information is contained within the passports, within your travel details, 
<br/>so a lot of it is really encompassed in there and they do not fill it, but we should have a look at that 
<br/>now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other day when I talked about the systems we have at our border, the IBMS, it is very 
<br/>restrictive at  the moment  in  terms  of trying to  inbuilt  new things into it.  Obviously, as a former 
<br/>Director Immigration, the honourable Member would be aware that the system has a lot of limitations 
<br/>in terms of how we can capture new information within the IBMS where things like departure cards, 
<br/>after being reviewed, can be collected digitally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the new process under the Migration Information and Data Analysis (MIDA) System, we 
<br/>would now like to digitise arrivals into the country. Similarly, we could also do that under MIDA 
<br/>when we leave Fiji, so that is something that we would like to do, but this has to change.  As I have 
<br/>said, unfortunately, I was am not aware of the last time this form was actually checked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  arrival  card  has  actually  changed,  there  is  now  a  new  one.    I  think  after  what 
<br/>happened, someone designed the card and it became a little bit too big for the scanner.  So, that also 
<br/>needs to change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, on your other comment about immigration and emigration of people that leave and those 
<br/></span><span>who come, that is something we need to look at seriously because majority of the drift of our people 
<br/>going away or migration to overseas countries, like Australia, New Zealand and the US, more than 
<br/>51  percent  are  actually  skilled  labour.    When  we  lose,  we  actually  have  to  try  and  fill  in  the 
<br/>requirements  for  our  local  labour  market,  and  that  is  something  Government  needs  to  look  at 
<br/>seriously in light of where we are getting our migrant workers from.

<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, you will see a whole range of Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and Philipinos.  With them also 
<br/>comes certain challenges when we look at these people coming in.  There is always a hype amongst 
<br/>people when they say, “Ah, we do not want people to come. We want to use our people here”.  But 
<br/>half  of  the  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  our  people  do  not  quite  reach  the  level  of  competency,  may  be 
<br/>qualification that others would bring into the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that is something Government must seriously consider, and this is one of the 
<br/>points that the former PS Immigration had left with me because there is never enough in Fiji to look 
<br/>after our local market, particularly now that tourism is picking up, as well as construction and other 
<br/>sectors of our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The honourable Minister is laughing because he knows what  I am about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to ask him, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, you mentioned in your response something to do with motorcycles and 
<br/>motorcyclists. Please, remember, Sir, I am a 100-strong and the head of the organisation here that 
<br/>looks after all motorcyclists and not all of us are bad or actually good bunch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had told him I was going to ask him that but just get into the question. Honourable Minister, 
<br/>in terms of our passports (since all the questions is related to migration and immigration) since we 
<br/>have digitised, how many airports, including our own at Nadi International, are we able to just swipe 
<br/>and walk through? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I stand to be corrected but the short answer is, zero.  I am sorry, 
<br/>no offence to bikers, honourable Member, I am sure they make our highways look beautiful, thank 
<br/>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Just a supplementary question to the honourable Minister; I am 
<br/>very interested in the IBMS. What actually is the problem, honourable Minister, is its compatibility 
<br/>with what the other stakeholders are using or is it the age of technology or is it the capacity within 
<br/>Immigration itself? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question.  
<br/>There is a whole range of challenges for IBMS. One of the biggest challenge is that, there are certain 
<br/>functions of immigration that the current system when it was taken aboard, we were not able to use 
<br/>IBMS for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, I think there are four functions of Immigration that it cannot do.  It is actually inbuilt, 
<br/>but we cannot use it. The reason is that the supplier, a company from Sri Lanka when they gave it to 
<br/>us, every time we want it, it requires us to pay this astronomical fee which really should have been 
<br/>part of it at the beginning. So, this has been very, very prohibitive for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The system also, whilst there are those that are inbuilt and we cannot use, there are many 
<br/>others where the system can actually talk to others. Sir, IBMS is really limited and is actually quite 
<br/>restrictive.  We are getting it from MIDA now, which is now going to allow us and we are getting it 
<br/></span><span>for free, and as I have said the other day, that will allow us to talk better to all the other stakeholders 
<br/></span><span>that needed immigration information - that they could use data from there.  That is what I have been 
<br/>told that has really been the major restriction.  So, that is why the shift - apart from the cost, there are 
<br/>certain things that IBMS cannot do, that MIDAS will now give us the full complement of the kind 
<br/>information we need to process.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the National Housing Policy  
<br/>(Question No. 82/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on the review of the National Housing Policy and explain new areas that the revised Policy 
<br/>will cover? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question posed by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, housing is  fundamentally a basic need that is  enshrined in  Section 35 of the 
<br/>2013 Fijian Constitution which guarantees the right for all Fijians to accessible and adequate housing.  
<br/>It  is  a  significant  and  interlinked  instrument  of  socio-economic  policy  that  shapes  and  influences 
<br/>both, the living condition and welfare of the population and development of the national economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2011, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji adopted its first National Housing Policy, as a formative policy 
<br/>document to cohesively address the fragmented approach to housing demand and supply that existed 
<br/>at that time for the housing sector in Fiji.  This resulted from identifying the need to have a more 
<br/>enabling approach to assist all stakeholders in the housing sector to collectively perform.  The Policy 
<br/>had an Implementation Plan for a period of 10 years before its next review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019, the review of the National Housing Policy commenced, proposing 
<br/>to  establish  an  enhanced  and  streamlined  regulatory  and  policy  framework  with  appropriate 
<br/>institutional  structures.    To  assist  the  Ministry  with  the  review  of  the  Policy,  the  Housing  Sector 
<br/>Policy Advisor, Mr. Keith Hornby, was engaged and funded through the New Zealand Ministry of 
<br/>Foreign Affairs and Trade from 2019 until 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had completed the preliminary analysis phase of the policy 
<br/>review that highlighted the scope and extent of the implementation of the 2011 National Housing 
<br/>Policy and the need for a revised Housing Strategy that responds to the current dynamics of housing 
<br/>supply and demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New areas of strategic focus and areas of legislative review and reform, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under this preliminary assessment, some key issues and challenges that were identified were: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>access to development and service land; 
<br/>housing affordability; 
<br/>access to finance and insurance; 
<br/>dwelling quality adequacy; 
<br/>outdated legislative and policy frameworks; and  
<br/>non-existence of a monitoring mechanism to assess the housing sector performance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  following  the  completion  of  the  preliminary  analysis,  the  Ministry  was 
<br/></span><span>prepared to pursue with the consultations that was planned into two phases, the first being the relevant 
<br/></span><span>stakeholders that would initiate a draft National Housing Policy to be used in the second phase which 
<br/>is a wider public consultation.  Since 2021, the review of the National Housing Policy was on hold 
<br/>until all the restrictions were lifted, while we adapted to the new norm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will be resuming works on the review of the Policy and will 
<br/></span><span>engage a consultant through an Expression of Interest (EOI) to complete what was left out.  We are

<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also exploring options of getting some assistance from the New Zealand Government to try and assist 
<br/>us  in  this  area.    We  are  meeting  the  New  Zealand  Embassy  Official  in  the  next  two  weeks  and 
<br/>hopefully, we will get some positive feedback on how they can assist the Ministry in moving this 
<br/>Policy forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the key challenges identified in the preliminary analysis, the 
<br/>Ministry will be exploring further options through consultations with stakeholders that will develop 
<br/>the revised policy framework.  There are areas that have been identified to be explored to be part of 
<br/>the revised policy and these are some of the key areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  understand  the  demand  for  housing  both,  current  and  emerging  trends.    It  is  very 
<br/>important  because  we  will  be  able  to  provide  an  understanding  of  the  changes  in  the 
<br/>medium to long term demand, particularly in the urban areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land  use  and  infrastructure  planning,  that  is,  to  have  a  better  engagement  with  land 
<br/>management agencies, such as Department of Town &amp; Country Planning and other service 
<br/>providers, such as roads, health, education, et cetera, to ensure adequacy of zone and service 
<br/>land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review or reform the current legislation, most probably the review of the Housing Act to 
<br/>update the legislative framework in the housing sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review the existing Government subsidies, grants and physical incentives, most probably 
<br/>to identify the effectiveness of the current mix of housing interventions by Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scaling up of finance insurance products for the housing sector, basically to support existing 
<br/>efforts  to  scale  up  bundled  insurance  product  with  housing  components  and  encourage 
<br/>micro-finance for housing improvement and construction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increasing  climate-resilient  housing  stock  by  identifying  options  and  opportunities  to 
<br/>strengthen and improve the resilience of national housing stock in both, rural and urban 
<br/>areas,  and  introducing  a  regulatory  framework  to  strengthen  the  monitoring  and 
<br/>enforcement of minimum housing standards across Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of building and construction legislation by exploring the existing building codes or 
<br/>legislation, and capacity for a wider construction sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Research and monitoring framework for the housing sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry intends to finalise the review of the Policy, following the two 
<br/>phases  of  consultations  and  further  appointment  of  the  Advisory  Committee  comprising  of  key 
<br/>stakeholders, who will guide the Ministry in formulating the final policy document. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his  very  detailed  up-to-date 
<br/>information on the new Housing Policy that is being made by the Ministry.  Currently, there is no 
<br/></span><span>specific dedicated programmes to improve the collection and reporting of housing-related data, such 
<br/></span><span>as adequacy, demand, supply, pricing, benchmark on rent and prices, and other analysis.  I know that 
<br/>the  Bureau  of  Statistics  is  able  to  provide  information  up  to  a  certain  level.  My  supplementary 
<br/>question is, how will the new Housing Policy address this gap? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Member,  for  a  very  good  question. 
<br/>Something that is actually a challenge for the Ministry is to actually review and identify the profile 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1003 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of  what  is  happening  in  the  housing  sector  because  if  you  look  at  this  sector,  we  not  only  have 
<br/>statutory bodies that provide housing services to the people of Fiji, there are also other developers 
<br/>out there.  Our private developers also assist in the provision of housing, as well as affordable housing 
<br/>in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is something that the Ministry will consider looking into because it is a big challenge 
<br/>in  trying  to  actually  collate  information  from  respective  agencies.    It  is  something  that  I  also 
<br/>encourage at the beginning when I took over, that is, trying to have some kind of dashboard to be 
<br/>able to collect information from agencies because once we get those information, we will be able to 
<br/>do a profiling of all the activities that happen within the housing sector in our country.  It is something 
<br/>that we are going to review and, hopefully, that we are also going to engage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, even if you look at the Bureau of Statistics, no information is provided because 
<br/>we have to look at both, formal as well as informal housing sector.  That is something that we are 
<br/>gearing towards - getting a system in place to be able to gather as much information as possible to 
<br/>help us in moving our housing sector forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  ask  this 
<br/>supplementary question.  I congratulate the honourable Minister and the Ministry for the work that 
<br/>they are doing and all those who might also have been working on this National Housing Policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  things  that  we  have  noticed,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  past  few  years  is  the 
<br/>escalating land prices all around Fiji.  There have been a number of things that Government had done 
<br/>in  the  past,  in  particular,  some  of  the  foreigners  who  buy  land  in  the  urban  areas.    There  are 
<br/>restrictions on that - to try to make sure that the land prices are controlled, and we have tried to stop 
<br/>people from just buying land for speculation, so the price is going up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a Minister over the past few years, we have noticed 
<br/>that even civil servants have struggled to get housing.  Government has tried to address it in the past 
<br/>by trying to address their pay.  We have seen the Singapore experience where they build up and over 
<br/>time, the kind of shanty towns they had all over Singapore has disappeared.  I am wondering, as part 
<br/>of this National Housing Policy and the developments that we have done in strata titling and given 
<br/>the price of land, is building up going to be the focus of this Housing Policy, given the situation that 
<br/>we currently face?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the question. For housing, if 
<br/>you look at the valuation of land or property, it revolves around what is happening around that area.  
<br/>I am not a valuer but that is something that normally happens when you want to determine valuation 
<br/>for a property, or should you try and consider developments that are happening around your area, 
<br/>that is also going to determine the kind of valuation or price you are going to expect for that particular 
<br/>property can offer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue that was also  brought  up by the honourable Member,  especially the shortage of 
<br/>having good land for better housing, one of the ideas that came up is for us to try and build vertically, 
<br/>instead of constructing houses horizontally or in single units or double terrace.  The idea is good but 
<br/></span><span>one thing that we must consider is that, it is something that is going to be provided in a small area of 
<br/></span><span>land.  You can maximize the number of units that you can get from a parcel of land but at the same 
<br/>time, you must also be mindful that as you go up, the price of construction increases.  So, the higher 
<br/>you go, the higher the construction cost, and that is also a reflection on the kind of cost that it is going 
<br/>to offer or sell to the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, the Ministry is also considering various models.  It is also going to have PPP, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it is something that IFCs also plays a lead role in – in the provision of that. Those are some of the 
<br/>models that we are trying to see, whether we will be able to come up with the best model that we are 
<br/>going to provide, which gives us the right mix and the right pricing structure so that at the end of the 
<br/>day, the price of a strata unit or price of the dwelling or flat is affordable to the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think something that we must also understand is the importance of understanding the various 
<br/>pricing models, that is, if you want to build more available houses.  At the same time, if you look at 
<br/>the economy of scale, I think if you are going to build more apartments, you can also reduce the price 
<br/>because it is going to spread out the cost, so that is something that IFC is also considering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  want  to  get  in  good  contractors,  then  you  must  also  have  more  construction  of 
<br/>apartments which should be able to, at least, bring the cost of the units down to some extent.  At the 
<br/>same time, we are also looking at some of the mechanics, like the provision of Government subsidy 
<br/>or grant that is also going to assist in making these flats more affordable to the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I thank the honourable Minister for his responses.  My question to 
<br/>the honourable Minister is concerning affordability and standards, and one of the key factors in this 
<br/>is building codes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, you talked about the old laws and I know because we do not have the 
<br/>DRR Policy and this is an issue that comes up, particularly post-disasters.  What is the progress in 
<br/>that area in terms of the wider consultations as well?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member.  I think in my presentation, I 
<br/>had mentioned some of the key areas that we have identified as part of the new National Housing 
<br/>Policy and one of those is  the revision of the building legislation.  That is something that we are 
<br/>going to do when we start the process but it is something that we are going to seriously consider, to 
<br/>ensure that we all have one standard across Fiji. That is something that we want to strengthen and 
<br/>also want to ensure that the building code is reviewed and also applied by all the developers or all 
<br/>building contractors who are going to build houses in the country.  So, that is something that we are 
<br/>seriously considering and it is part of our review of the National Housing Policy.

<div><span>Ongoing Partnerships – Fiji as Tourism Destination 
<br/>(Question No. 83/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation update Parliament on some of the ongoing partnerships in place to promote Fiji as a 
<br/>tourism destination? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vanawalu for the question.   
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, partnership is key for prosperity.  For a sector such as tourism that connects 
<br/>to almost every other sector in our economy - construction, agriculture, health, fisheries, culture and 
<br/>others,  we  need  strong  and  sustainable  partnership  to  ensure  that  we  meet  our  current  and  future 
<br/></span><span>needs.  Sir, I will share a few of the ongoing and new partnerships and policy and in marketing and 
<br/></span><span>promotion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier in this august Parliament, the Ministry of 
<br/>Tourism and Civil Aviation is currently developing the National Sustainable Tourism Framework 
<br/>with technical support from the International Finance Cooperation (IFC), who have been tremendous 
<br/>partners.  Through this partnership, we have established a Committee with the private sector who

<div><span>would drive its development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry,  through  the  consultation  phase,  has  partnered  with  agencies  to  lead  critical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>areas of discussion.  These are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s Agri-Tourism Group, to look at linkages with agriculture; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Mareqeti Viti, to align planning with conservation; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Academic such as the University of the South Pacific and Massey University, on planning 
<br/>with resilience; and  
<br/>we will continue our partnership with IFC on developing tourism standards and undertaking 
<br/>more tourism-related licensing and business reforms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have mentioned in this august Parliament our 10 year partnership with the 
<br/>World Bank Group on the development of Vanua Levu as a tourism destination.  Under this, we will 
<br/>be working closely with key Government agencies and utilities, such the Water Authority of Fiji and 
<br/>Fiji Roads Authority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also spoke about community-based tourism and how we are working with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agencies such as MSME Fiji and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  recently  met  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP) 
<br/>Resident  Representative  and  her  Team  to  see  how  we  can  work  together  on  strengthening 
<br/>community-based tourism more systematically.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the Ministry’s most recent partnerships is with the National Trust of 
<br/>Fiji where we sign a Memorandum of Understanding.  We are rich in history from the Momi Battery 
<br/>Historical Park to Fiji’s UNESCO World Heritage Site of Levuka, Heritage Tourism is something 
<br/>we want to pursue and promote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  bilaterally,  we  are  working  with  the  Government  of  Indonesia  on 
<br/>operationalising  an MOU on Tourism.    We  are  also  looking to  sign  one with  the Government  of 
<br/>Japan, to see how we can draw international best practices to our tourism planning and promotion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  partnership  and  marketing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Tourism  Fiji  recently  launched  our  new 
<br/>brand, ‘Fiji where happiness comes naturally’. I would like to emphasise that this is a new brand for 
<br/>Fiji where happiness comes naturally, which I believe is spot-on in terms of communicating what we 
<br/></span><span>are famous or special for, which is happiness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is already performing well in our markets.  I am told that website traffic and users is higher, 
<br/>so more people are searching.  Tourism Fiji continues to work with key campaign partners who take 
<br/>our brand and our story to key markets.  These includes; partners such Hello World, My Fiji, Costco 
<br/>Expedia,  Pacific  Travel  House,  Flight  Centre  and  Thomas  Cook.  Some  of  these  trade  partners 
<br/>reported their strongest months for Fiji in their history.  Sir, these are generally travel agents who 
<br/>create package bills with accommodation to car rentals, and promote and sell them in key markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tourism Fiji is also leveraging sports tourism.  They have partnered with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fijian Drua to reach rugby fans across Australia and New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aligned to the brand, the Tourism Fiji has also launched significant marketing partnerships 
<br/>with  the global retailer  -  Rip  Curl and Credit Card Giant, Mastercard.  Both  campaigns  involved 
<br/>tapping into the significant medium and the presence of these brands to continue to grow the desire 
<br/>for Fiji as a tourism destination of choice.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, there are other events that Tourism Fiji has formed partnerships 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with to promote tourism.  These include:

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Key events such as SPARTAN; 
<br/>the relaunch of direct flights to Hong Kong and Narita with Fiji Airways; 
<br/>the recent Tourism Investment Summit in partnership with Investment Fiji, supported by 
<br/>HFC Bank, Telecomm Fiji and IFC; and  
<br/>partnership with Pacific Recycling Foundation which aims to increase recycling across our 
<br/>tourism properties and promote sustainability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir, I was going to give way to .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Carry on, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the explanation on 
<br/>some of the thoughts that you had last week and this week about new destinations, et cetera, that we 
<br/>may  be  looking  at,  aside  from  the  traditional  ones  and  the  ones  that  we  have  had  within  North 
<br/>America.  With the new destinations, and then I see that you are talking about ongoing partnerships 
<br/>in place to promote Fiji as a destination, what are the guidelines that we actually follow when Tourism 
<br/>Fiji goes ahead and seeks partners in a particular destination?  How do we actually appoint them as 
<br/>an agent for promoting Fiji as a destination? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  we  spoke  about  the  plans  to  expand  into  the  USA.  
<br/>Currently, on the West Coast of Continental America, including Canada, we fly into Vancouver, San 
<br/>Francisco and Los Angeles.  With the arrival of the two A350s, we are thinking of Seattle, Dallas or 
<br/>Houston and even Chicago, that is, in the United States.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  core  of  the  messaging  for  the  American  market,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  the  mid-American 
<br/>market.  Up to this point, most American travellers are the high-end stuff - more the adventure, the 
<br/>dive to Taveuni, Savusavu and Vanua Levu, in particular.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we are now reaching is the Mid-American market - the families, the couples. The line 
<br/>is this, Fiji is only three-and-a-half hours away from direct flight from Hawaii, yet it is cheaper and 
<br/>more authentic.  So, the market that goes through Hawaii, we are converting some of that - a small 
<br/></span><span>percentage, but it will accrue to Fiji in a big way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know how many Americans go to Hawaii every year, a percentage of that can make a big 
<br/>difference on the American numbers to Fiji, and it is working very well, Mr. Speaker.  As we speak, 
<br/>the load factor from San Francisco and Los Angeles are quite high, and we believe that going further 
<br/>into the Mid-West and even East Coast will bring us the numbers that we want.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  partnership,  there  are  a  number  of  huge  conglomerates  in  there  -  Costco  in 
<br/>particular, is very big.  As honourable Koya may know, Costco is huge supermarket and very big 
<br/>travel section. They are now part of us in California and we expect that to spread across the United 
<br/>States.  That is one, there are more work that are coming online to be outlets for selling Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SMEs play a critical and pivotal role in the 
<br/>implementation and realisation of partnership that happens which we have heard from the honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Can  he  update  Parliament  on  the  plans  for  current  or  new  SMEs  in  the 
<br/>tourism sector to enter and re-enter the market?

<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1007 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, honourable Member. A new area, Mr. Speaker, that we 
<br/>are seriously looking into is a version of Airbnb.  Airbnb is now a huge segment and phenomenal 
<br/>now in travel. We want to bring that into our villages.  It is community tourism, but we would like 
<br/>to work with our villagers, with the provincial administration and the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) 
<br/>to set up a structure that can allow that kind of accommodation into our villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We believe it is a great feat that people can come, we give them a part of the village where 
<br/>accommodation is of that standard, but then they become part of the village and the experience that 
<br/>they get out of it. That is an indication of an area that we are considering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Airbnb perspective, honourable Minister, as 
<br/>you and I both know, it is an area that can grow into a phenomenal part of tourism.  The question is, 
<br/>with the current licensing that exists with respect to hotel licences and I know there is a dire need to 
<br/>change hotel licensing, will you be looking at making sure that all our communities are safe in terms 
<br/>of legislation surrounding that particular area?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be catastrophic for us in terms of insurance coverage, et cetera, that needs to be done 
<br/>and these are tourists.  You know as well as I do that at the moment, at a drop of a hat, we could be 
<br/>liable for million dollars.  My point is, will you be ensuring that there are some legislation that come 
<br/>through  Parliament  so  that  we  actually  cover  that  area  specifically  for  Airbnbs  and  our  own 
<br/>communities around the country?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  that  is  a  good  point  from  the  honourable  Member.  
<br/>Indeed, we are heading in that direction.  I mentioned the GCC, in that, we have to have bylaws in 
<br/>our villages that bring in discipline where this type of legislation can work.  You are going to have 
<br/>visitors in your community, not our </span><span>tavale</span><span> or someone from the other community, these are people 
<br/>from abroad and they need to be protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to empower our provincial administration, district  administration,  turaga ni  koro 
<br/>(village headmen) and villagers to put in place these types of accommodation, with the regulations 
<br/>that can help protect or support the operation.  It is very sensitive.  I know they will enjoy living in 
<br/>our villages - living in our midst, it is a cultural experience, but what is being highlighted today is 
<br/>also something that we need to be mindful of.  We will do all that before we get into this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Yasawas, we already went to talk to some of the villagers, but it has to come from the 
<br/>provincial council and there has to be a buy-in from everyone at the village level.  These are visitors.  
<br/>They are with us, we look after them, we know that we are friendly, we will look after them but there 
<br/>are certain elements that need to be observed and certain discipline has to come into the equation.

<div><span>Collaboration Between Institute Louis Malarde and Fiji CDC 
<br/>(Question No. 85/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/>the collaboration between the Institute Louis Malarde and the Fiji Centre for Disease Control? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Bainivalu 
<br/>for her question.  Cabinet has approved an agreement with the Government of French Polynesia to 
<br/>strengthen Arthropod-borne Viruses (Arbovirus) diagnostics, surveillance and research capabilities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>

<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>within the Fiji Centre for Disease Control (Fiji CDC).  Arbovirus is an acronym for Arthropod-borne 
<br/>viruses, so it is a virus transmitted by arthropods which are insects, for example, mosquitoes that 
<br/>spread diseases such as dengue, </span><span>zika</span><span> and </span><span>chikungunya</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project known as the Fiji SHARE Project stands for the Surveillance of Human Arbovirus 
<br/>at Risk of causing Epidemics in the Pacific is an ongoing programme and the Project will be jointly 
<br/>implemented by the  Fiji  CDC and the  Institute  of Louis  Malarde (ILM), which is  a research and 
<br/>public health institute under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health of French Polynesia.  This 
<br/>Project is focused on the progressive transfer of technical expertise and the research experiences from 
<br/>the ILM to the Fiji National Public Health Laboratory at the Fiji CDC.  So, ILM and our CDC have 
<br/>collaborated for more than 10 years and this support will further strengthen the role of the Fiji CDC 
<br/>in the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure when honourable Members from the Opposition were in Government, they would 
<br/>be aware that Fiji CDC now have some capabilities in terms of testing.  It was not there before but is 
<br/>there now. It is there to build up capabilities in terms of any surge in new outbreaks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for your response.  Just a quick 
<br/>question based on the COVID-19 experience, the thought of decentralisation, because we had serious 
<br/>issues when the Fiji CDC was compromised.  I would like to hear from the honourable Minister if 
<br/>that is under consideration as well, particularly, planning better for the next one.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  a very important question.  In 
<br/>terms of decentralisation, we fully agree with that.  Again, in terms of decentralising the capabilities 
<br/>of the Fiji CDC, it was commissioned earlier on in Nadi as part of the Border Protection Unit.  There 
<br/>is also a laboratory and you are more than welcome to visit.  The reason why it is strategically placed 
<br/>there is because of the airport.  Also, in Vanua Levu, we will soon go there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have just been to Labasa and commissioned aTy-5 Laboratory that will deal with research 
<br/>capabilities and how to combat typhoid, especially in the North Division.  So, in terms of that, we 
<br/>are looking at expanding the capabilities of those laboratories to cater for the role of decentralisation.  
<br/>Similar  set  up  in  Nadi  as  in  Labasa,  so  at  the  moment,  it  is  being  used  by  the  Ty-5  project  and 
<br/>hopefully, later on, we can expand it to the role of Fiji CDC in decentralising its services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  A  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable  Minister.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, CDC  holds  a lot of sophisticated medical  equipment  which  are not  cheap and quite 
<br/>expensive.  My supplementary question is, the local expertise in the sustenance of the maintenance 
<br/>of these machines that are operated in our laboratory, would you consider expanding our Biomedical 
<br/>Engineers in terms of capacity building to handle things if there is a problem with our machines? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Ravunawa,  for  your 
<br/>supplementary question.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, in terms of increasing the capabilities and the capacity 
<br/>within our Biomedical Department, it is an ongoing issue as well. We are trying to increase capacity 
<br/>in terms of their training and know-how in terms of the various sophisticated machines that we do 
<br/>have here in Fiji, especially in the CDC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the next financial year, we are pushing for more positions in the Biomedical Unit, and not 
<br/>only that, in terms of training capacity as well. There is an ongoing project called the Oxygen Project 
<br/>under Cure Kids and that project has oxygen officers in the four Divisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, in trying to expand the capacity of our Biomedical Engineers, we are trying 
<br/>to absorb those officers into the Ministry once the funding with our donor partners has finished. We
