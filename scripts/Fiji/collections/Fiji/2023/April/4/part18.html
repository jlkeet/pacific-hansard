<div><span>2022-2023 Budgeted Infrastructure Projects  
<br/>(Question No. 52/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services 
<br/>inform Parliament whether the infrastructure projects that were budgeted for the 2022-2023 
<br/>financial year will be completed, and what is the progress? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr  Speaker  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question.  The Ministry, together with our statutory agencies such as Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) and 
<br/>Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) was given a total of $535.7 million to carry out comprehensive capital 
<br/>works.  Some key areas include road networks ($362.9 million), water sector infrastructure primarily 
<br/>to  improve  Fiji’s  long-term  standing  water  supply  and  wastewater  management  needs  ($115.1 
<br/>million), Grid Extension and Housewiring Projects for a total of 178 schemes ($19.3 million).  The 
<br/>Ministry, together with our statutory authorities, received budgets in the different sectors to enable 
<br/>the development of infrastructure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for roads projects for this financial year, FRA was allocated $60 million for 
<br/>road corridor maintenance, streetlights maintenance and structure maintenance; $50 million for the 
<br/>renewal of some roads and services; $31.4 million for renewal of bridges and crossings; and $998,368 
<br/>for the renewal of six jetties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FRA worked on a total of 88 projects, of which, 33 ranged from bridges and crossing 
<br/>renewals, new jetty construction to road upgrades in the three Divisions - Central/Eastern, Northern 
<br/>and Western. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the remaining 55 FRA projects, 23 have been completed, 23 ongoing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and nine have been cancelled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  financial  year  2022-2023,  the  Public  Sector  Investment  Programme  (PSIP)  had 
<br/>requested  $437.3  million  through  the  capital  grant  of  which  $162.5  million  for  Transport 
<br/>Infrastructure  Investment  Sector  Project  (TIISP)  loan  funded  projects.    However,  only  $362.  9 
<br/>million was approved.  The approved sum reduced the maintenance and renewals budget by $84.7 
<br/>million, in addition to no provision for the emergency response works.  It did not allow for the $25 
<br/>million spent on emergency works in the 2021-2022 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of the $362.9 million budgeted for FRA’s capital works, $219 million had been expanded by 
<br/>December 2022, $291 million by February 2023 and $314 million envisaged by end of March 2023, 
<br/></span><span>so around 86 percent was utilised.  The rising cost of inflation and freight is also a major factor as 
<br/></span><span>contractors have sought compensation in this regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The WAF’s capital investment allocation for the financial year 2022-2023 was $115.1 billion 
<br/>with a total number of 189 capital projects.  Projects in the Central/Eastern Division are 74, Western 
<br/>Division - 35 and Northern Division - 14 and nationwide support programmes are 40 projects.  There 
<br/>are a total of 137 projects currently in progress.
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  actual  committed  budget  to  utilisation  is  45  percent  as  at  end  of  March  2023.    It  is 
<br/>anticipated that 113 capital projects should be included in the next financial year.  I have stretched to 
<br/>WAF the utilisation Quarter 4.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  provision  of  affordable  and  sustainable  electricity  services  is  intended  to  enhance  the 
<br/>living standards of the rural people.  A total sum of $5.7 million was allocated for Housewiring of 
<br/>Grid Extension projects.  These house wiring intends to connect an additional 6,695 houses to the 
<br/>grid  which  will  benefit  a  total  of  33,475  ordinary  Fijians  throughout  the  Central,  Northern  and 
<br/>Western Divisions.  Todate, a total of 25 percent has been utilised and work is currently ongoing to 
<br/>assist more Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  an  allocation  of  $350,000  as  part  of  the  rehabilitation  works  on  diesel 
<br/>schemes for our rural communities, a total of 60 percent has been utilised.  In addition, a total of $4 
<br/>million was allocated for the installation of solar home systems.  To date, the team has prepared all 
<br/>documentations and have awarded the tender for the implementation of the projects and the contract 
<br/>is currently being finalised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  included  the  Fiji  Meteorological  Services,  given  its  importance  in  times  of  natural 
<br/>disasters.  The Fiji Meteorological Services was provided with $2 million for the upgrade of Nausori 
<br/>Radar - $1.6 million has been paid as Phase 1 for purchasing equipment.  Phase 2 will include using 
<br/>the $400,000 from the balance to purchase equipment totalling $2 million.  The balance is expected 
<br/>to be paid in the 2023-2024 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, for the installation of the Nausori Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), 
<br/>Sir, $674,000 was paid for manufacture and balance of which $272,000 has been rolled over to the 
<br/>2023-2024 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Work has started on the repair of the Nabouwalu Office and construction of Grade 6 Quarters 
<br/>totalling $300,000.  This is expected to be completed in July 2023.  On the upgrade of Udu Point 
<br/>Meteorological Station, $150,000 has been allocated and the contract has been signed and work will 
<br/>begin this week.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his update on the 
<br/>infrastructure projects at the Ministry.  Just one small question in relation to the Fiji Meteorological 
<br/>Services.    You  had  mentioned  the  upgrading  of  the  Nausori  Radar  which  is  very  critical  for  the 
<br/>cyclone season and also for the automated weather stations at Nausori.  I think you also mentioned 
<br/>Matei and Nabouwalu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one that is very important that is also in the Budget is your hydrological equipment 
<br/>and I think in your corporate plan for this year was Elevuka, Rakiraki, Qauia, Korovou, Navakasili 
<br/>and Mt. Kasi.  I think especially for flooding, this is very important.  I would just like to ask if you 
<br/>might be in a position to give us an update if those equipment have also been put in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Usamate.  I do not have specific details 
<br/>but in our meeting today to finalise the budget, we have included some equipment for hydrology and 
<br/></span><span>I cannot really specify which ones.  However, that budget has been increased to take into account the 
<br/></span><span>additional equipment.  This probably includes what you have mentioned but I will need to confirm 
<br/>the specifics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Just  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable  Minister,  for  your 
<br/>information,  Nakida  is  in  the  centre  of  Viti  Levu.    We  went  there  once,  we  took  a  walk  from 
<br/>Nawaisomo Village, it was about six and half hours walk.  We took a track, walked and stayed a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>859 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>night at Nakida and then while returning, we turned from Nakida to Wairuarua.  We crossed one river 
<br/>23 times and then it took us about three and half hours and then we took a two-hour boat ride and 
<br/>came back to Waisomo.  That cut which I am talking about honourable Minister, can you provide an 
<br/>update on phase 2 of the Nakida Road Project and Waisomo and Wairuarua project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That project is the one which is done in association with the 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and from my understanding, it is about 80 percent completed.  We should 
<br/>be commissioning that, hopefully, within the next two to three months and I will give you the update 
<br/>as soon as I can. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Just a quick question, honourable Minister, with respect to what is left 
<br/>to do and in terms of the 2022-2023 financial year, is part of the programme including a gantry system 
<br/>being put in place with respect to weigh-in-motion that needs to be done and I think it puts both the 
<br/>Ministry of Transport and both of these things into the same basket?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sorry, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- As part of the programme, will there be installations of gantry systems 
<br/>where you can use the weigh-in-motion that needs to be put in right throughout Fiji, that is helpful 
<br/>to the Ministry of Transport also with respect to how they weigh trucks, et cetera?  Is that going to 
<br/>be part of this particular session or is it something that you will be doing in the next budget process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Currently, the one on the way to Ba, it should be completed 
<br/>and commissioned shortly, so that is part of the programme which we will also look into the future 
<br/>for additional weighbridges. There have also been consultations with the Fiji Haulage Association.  
<br/>There are differences in terms of what LTA views as the gross net weight.  That is an area which we 
<br/>will need to iron out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have established a working committee to look into that as to what  would be the most 
<br/>practical because business owners have complained about the high cost.  Not only that but also in 
<br/>terms of the fine whereby instead of penalising one vehicle for not complying, they fine the whole 
<br/>fleet.  That is an area which we are working on and looking at the regulations as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 53/2023 was withdrawn) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral System for Municipal Elections 
<br/>(Question No. 54/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the electoral system to be used in the proposed Municipal Elections?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr, Speaker, Sir, on 31</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2023, Cabinet approved a working 
<br/>group for Municipal Council Elections to be set up to prepare for a detailed action plan to conduct 
<br/></span><span>the Municipal Council Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Cabinet endorsed the working group to be chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Local 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government and to include other key Permanent Secretaries, namely, Finance, Solicitor-General, 
<br/>Acting Supervisor of Elections and Chief Executive Officers for all 13 Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the working group has been tasked with various responsibilities. This  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>860 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>includes recommending the most appropriate electoral system to be used for the Municipal Council 
<br/>Elections.  At this stage, I am unable to inform this august Parliament as to which electoral system 
<br/>will be used, as I would be pre-empting the work of the working committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current electoral system as set out under the Local Government Act 1972 
<br/>is  a  block  vote  method.  In  this  method,  each  Constituency  or  Ward  elects  more  than  one 
<br/>representative, and voters can cast as many votes as they are available seats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The working group is in the process of carrying out reviews of the current legislation in place 
<br/>and  holding  consultations  with  important  stakeholders  to  identify  the  most  appropriate  electoral 
<br/>system. Once finalised, they will table their recommendations to Cabinet, and thereafter I will be able 
<br/>to provide an update in this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government will ensure that thorough awareness is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>carried on whatever electoral system is identified for the Municipal Council Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Is  there a timeframe within which this working group is to come back 
<br/>to you and we can look forward to the election being conducted, say in December, or whatever it is, 
<br/>whether a year, 12 months or two years?  Is there a timeframe that has been given to this working 
<br/>group to come back so that we actually have some firm dates with respect to the elections? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- No timeframe. We can update again probably in the June Sitting and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide a realistic timeframe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.- My  question  to  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  how  would  the 
<br/>electoral system encourage or discourage political participation and impact voter turnout at a national 
<br/>level? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- That is a new question.  I am unable to respond to that at this stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development of Community-Based Tourism 
<br/>(Question No. 55/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation  update  Parliament  on  the  works  currently  being  carried  out  on  developing 
<br/>community-based tourism? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I thank honourable Vakalalabure for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  know  that  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  (MSMEs)  are  the 
<br/>backbone of our economy.  They are essentially in every sector.  As I have said earlier in this august 
<br/>Parliament, we want to pay the same attention to community-based tourism businesses as we do with 
<br/>any other.  We want global communities to have full ownership and management of their business 
<br/></span><span>so that the economic benefits of tourism stay within their community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have already seen a considerable appetite in resource owners wanting to be part of this 
<br/>sector. This could be a community up in the highlands, who have unique traditions, or a village on 
<br/>the coast Savusavu, who wants to provide horseback riding.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these communities 
<br/>have great potential to be included in the tourism value chain and fill gaps in the market that tourists 
<br/>actually wants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>861 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  promote  diversification  and  inclusivity,  the  Department  of  Tourism  continues  to  visit 
<br/>communities in partnership with other Government agencies such as the iTaukei Affairs and MSME 
<br/>Fiji,  to  provide  technical  advice  on  tourism  development  and  identify  needs  to  provide  targetted 
<br/>assistance.  We will look to support businesses such as Bouma Waterfalls through the programmes 
<br/>such as the Integrated Human Resources Development Programme (IHRDP).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  most  recently,  the  Department  of  Tourism  and  MSME  Fiji  visited  20 
<br/>Villages  and  about  50  tourism  MSMEs  in  Nadroga,  Ba,  Tavua,  Rakiraki,    Naitasiri  and  Namosi 
<br/>Provinces.  The  Villages  include,  Biausevu,  Nakabuta,  Lomawai,  Abaca,  Natalau,  Tavua  Village, 
<br/>Colo-i-Suva, Solevu, Yaro and Sawani, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the expected outcomes of the community awareness and engagement are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Take stock of current and potential tourism products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Supporting infrastructure and services and needs of the communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Advocate responsible tourism such as child safety. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Create awareness and advocate on the code of conduct for tourism service providers 
<br/>which Cabinet recently endorsed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Identify key barriers faced by MSMEs and communities in order to provide targeted 
<br/>assistance such as training and access through finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Promote  ecotourism  to  promote  our  unique  flora  and  fauna,  cultural  diversity  and 
<br/>adventure tourism such as whale and dolphin watching, hiking, waterfall tours as the 
<br/>best form of community-based tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry endeavours to continue with this exercise in the coming months 
<br/>and years.  Our immediate need is ensuring that we have a dedicated team to support community-
<br/>based tourism work, to better address the needs of the community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since taking office,  I have already spoken to  a number of development  partners, such the 
<br/>Asian Development Bank (ADB) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to support 
<br/>the Ministry in promoting more community-based tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Can  the  honourable  Minister  inform  Parliament,  with  respect  to 
<br/>community  tourism and in terms of the tourism dollars that we actually earn, what percentage of 
<br/>those dollars earned comes from the community tourism sector?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Sir, with all the development plans that you are actually going to undertake, does 
<br/>that also means that you are going to incorporate SDG  5 which is gender equality into those particular 
<br/>programmes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, is it me or the sound system? I could not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>understand the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am sorry, my apologies. Can you hear me now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>862 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-We all go and say that tourism earns $2 billion, but what percentage of 
<br/>those  earnings  is  actually  derived  from  the  current  community  tourism?    Also,  whether  the 
<br/>development  plans  will  ensure  that  SDG5  –  gender  equality,  is  actually  incorporated  into  those 
<br/>development plans?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Are you asking how much of the tourism earnings received today 
<br/>comes from community tourism?   I really cannot give an answer right now, Mr. Speaker, I think it 
<br/>is still quite small.  If you look at the pricing situation in the country and you talk about a $2.2 billion 
<br/>receipt, it is mostly with the bigger resorts - the more established ones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community tourism is still very small, but we hope to grow that because one of the challenges 
<br/>for us is to spread tourism.  It is for the tourists to have more meaning to their visit.  As opposed to 
<br/>the old sun, sand and sea, we are trying to  encourage them to be involved and most are showing 
<br/>interest in that area.  But in terms of the relationship, in terms of the income we derive from it, I am 
<br/>afraid I cannot give you a figure right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question.  Before that, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would like to make a wish within the minute I have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they say that our success is shaped from our failures, and I would like to 
<br/>wish the Coalition Government a happy 100 days.  My question is, can the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Tourism enlighten us on the limitations of community-based tourism related to cultural sensitivity 
<br/>issues?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- If you are you talking about the limitations that we face, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, one of the challenges that we see is the management of these types of operation.  We still do not 
<br/>have  that  capacity  to  fully  run  properties  like  that  in  the  manner  that  it  can  continue  to  deliver 
<br/>consistently on standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is still quite a lot of intervention that we need to do, intervention in the sense that there 
<br/>is going to be a lot of handholding.  In my years in tourism, I see something come up, it runs hot for 
<br/>a while and then it collapses.  A lot has happened in this country in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, we are working with about 35 backpackers’ operations in the country.  Some have 
<br/>struggled and some have fallen by the wayside, but we will intervene and prop them up.  That is 
<br/>where the challenge is, the capacity to be able to manage this operation consistently at the standard 
<br/>expected by the visitors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Minister for his feedback that he has given on 
<br/>community-based tourism. I remember may be in 20 or 30 years ago, there is always a concern about 
<br/>leakage from the tourism industry.   Of course, in the community-based tourism all that money is 
<br/>coming there to stay.  The question that I was going to ask was related somewhat to what you have 
<br/>just talked about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the names you  have mentioned have had these things in  the past.  I do not  know 
<br/></span><span>whether they continued, whether it is Abaca or whether it is visit to village gardens.  As we move 
<br/></span><span>into what might I call ‘community-based tourism 2’, I am just wondering whether there has been a 
<br/>systematic way of identifying what  went  wrong  in  all of what  you have  mentioned already  – the  
<br/>management  of  handholding,  what  went  wrong  and  what  are  your  plans  to  make  sure  that 
<br/>community-based tourism 2, as I will call it, will be more effective than what happened in the past 
<br/>because we know how things happened?  So, if there is a specific approach for that to happen.

<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>863 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you,  honourable Member.  As I had indicated here, we are 
<br/>visiting a lot of these Provinces and visiting the specific properties and attractions that are there, and 
<br/>we have identified what needs to be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have highlighted in my other reply, it is the sense of consistency.   However, what is 
<br/>encouraging though is that a lot of these people may be struggling but they have been in the business 
<br/>for 20 to 30 years and that, to us, is quite encouraging that we can build on that.  The commitment to 
<br/>continue their business is there, it is a matter of intervention at this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some areas, it is the number of cyclones that came in there, and at one time there were 
<br/>quite some serious ones and, of course, COVID-19.  I can say that because of their weak structure, a 
<br/>lot of them could not survive those types of catastrophes - the disaster and the epidemic.  But the 
<br/>redeeming factor to me is that they have been there for quite some time, they have been weak, but 
<br/>we can intervene now and prop them up.  So, there is a lot of learning to be done from that.  In some 
<br/>cases, it is now the second and third generation who are showing interest and we are there to prop 
<br/>them up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is something about tourism in Fiji, it is always sad, and this is what people always say, 
<br/>“When you build a hotel in Fiji, it is the third owner who makes the profit.  The first owner builds it 
<br/>and does not make it.  The second one buys it and does not make it.  The third owner is the person 
<br/>who makes the profit.” That is about the story of tourism in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, so it is a matter of time 
<br/>and learning and if you persevere, it comes right, and I believe this will happen in community tourism, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, my sincere apology for raising this question but it is 
<br/>an excellent idea.  One of the challenges in the rural areas is transportation and, of course, the existing 
<br/>infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker knows the limitations at Matei Airport, the honourable Prime Minister knows 
<br/>the limitations at Savusavu Airport because if you load a surfing board, that is three or four passengers 
<br/>offloaded for the Taveuni flight. So, having served in the rural areas, I know the concerns that they 
<br/>have - opportunities are there, so will this be part of package as well?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, most definitely.  Perhaps, I can disclose here now that 
<br/>there is a huge initiative for Vanua Levu - to develop tourism in Vanua Levu with the World Bank 
<br/>at a value of some US$60 million.  It is a holistic one, including the upgrade of the airports to take 
<br/>full-loaded aircrafts consistently and strengthen the night flight out of Labasa.  Let me just speak on 
<br/>Vanua Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanua Levu is a high yield market because of its adventure. Those who go there are normally 
<br/>divers (adventure) and they can do that the whole day, say around the Savusavu area to Natewa, and 
<br/>then travel late in the evening to Labasa, fly out by the evening and connect to Viti Levu or Nadi.  
<br/>That is the kind of development that we are looking at in Vanua Levu, to be easy as it is in Viti Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The infrastructure will also improve.  We will also share with you about the Blue Township 
<br/></span><span>in Savusavu.  So, all these things will come together and Vanua Levu in particular, will see a huge 
<br/></span><span>improvement in tourism.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other parts of Fiji, you have to invest in the equipment that is best suited for those rough 
<br/>terrain.  There are now people in Nadi who provide that kind of equipment that can go through over 
<br/>the hills of Sabeto and into Nadarivatu. A special kind of vehicle is now available for tourists.  So, 
<br/>all in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is all beginning to come together.

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Removal of 20 Cents Per Litre Fuel Duty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 56/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament if the 20 cents per litre fuel 
<br/>duty will be removed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  I think the honourable Member is probably confused and may also be confusing everyone 
<br/>else in this country.  But, let me just contextualise the issue, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Diesel fuel used to attract 20 cents per litre while motor spirit was 46 cents.  In the COVID-
<br/>19 Response Budget in March 2021, the FijiFirst Government introduced an additional excise duty 
<br/>of 20 cents per litre on fuel.  This meant that the duty on diesel fuel became 40 cents a litre and the 
<br/>duty on motor spirit became 66 cents per litre.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The justification during COVID-19, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Government was that it will 
<br/>then help induce more revenue or reduce revenue loss because the consumers are not going to be 
<br/>paying extra price than what they were paying before. That was the logic.  So, if global fuel prices 
<br/>went down, the Government raised the tax to 20 cents per litre, saying that the original price would 
<br/>remain the same because the global price has gone down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was there for two years.  When it was introduced, we opposed it very 
<br/>strongly and the reason why we opposed it was that, if the global fuel prices are going down and the 
<br/>consumers and the people in the country were suffering, the cost of living was going up, you let that 
<br/>reduction in price be passed down to the consumers and the businesses.  That would have been the 
<br/>right logic or the right thing to do because, yes, we were in a difficult economic situation.  We were 
<br/>getting  budget  support, we  were  borrowing,  but  we  were  also  struggling  to  help  the  people.    So, 
<br/>instead of helping the people, in two years, that $112 million that should have gone into the pockets 
<br/>of the consumers went to Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Hon. R.R. Sharma interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I just explained to him, he is talking about revenue - yelling 
<br/>from there.  I am just saying that, that was the time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to put money into the pockets 
<br/>of the people.  The Government were saying all that but then, the actions they were taking was quite 
<br/>contrary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in March 2022 after all that pressure and call from the people generally and 
<br/>the businesses because when the fuel price went up, the Government put the tax, the businesses are 
<br/>alright, but they pass it on to the consumers.  So, the ordinary consumers were facing this transmission 
<br/>mechanism where businesses… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well, I am answering the question.  You do not understand it, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this is the trouble with you.  I am trying to explain the context….

<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>865 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They do not like that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I am telling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And the truth was that they are sitting on the other side now, 
<br/>talking  about  cost  of  living  where  the  people  who  supported  an  action  that  put  them  further  into 
<br/>trouble. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what happened at that time was because 
<br/>when the price went up, by the time they reduced it, they had taken $112 million but by that time 
<br/>some of the passing on remained.  In economics, we always understand that - that prices are always 
<br/>sticky-upwards.  Honourable Usamate understands that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Even after they reduced the 20 cents tax in March 2022, some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the prices would have already gone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the simple answer to the honourable Member’s question is that it was 
<br/>the FijiFirst Party which raised the 20 cents tax, then they reduced it and that is where the matter is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, can the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  inform  Parliament  if  the  20  cents  per  litre  fuel  duty  will  be 
<br/>removed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  she  is  totally  confused.    I  have  just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>explained… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … that the 20 cents additional tax was put on by the FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Party.  Then they reduced it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as I have said, motor spirit has a 46 cents tax and diesel fuel has 20 cents.  They 
<br/></span><span>are  asking now, after dumping onto  the consumers, making them suffer,  they now want  to  know 
<br/></span><span>whether we are going to reduce the tax by 20 percent… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your answer?

<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Wait for the budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Minister is confused.  The question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is very clear.    It is a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer question, very simple.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  honourable  Minister  is  trying  to  evade  the  question.    My  supplementary 
<br/>question is, before you were appointed, you are a vocal critic of the fuel tax.  Can you explain why 
<br/>you have changed your position now that you are in office?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me explain to you why the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member is totally confused and it has confused others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And I will tell you why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. LAL.- No, you are the only person who is confused on that side, the only person 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- His question is, why would you reduce 20 cents tax? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K. LAL.- Yes or no? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He does not even know that on motor spirit, the tax is 46 cents.  
<br/>He is not asking about 46 cents, he is asking about 20 cents and I am not sure whether 20 cents should 
<br/>be reduced on 46 cents or 20 cents reduced on the diesel fuel.  That is why he is confused, and I will 
<br/>let them remain confused, Mr. Speaker, thank you.

<div><span>Nature-Based Seawalls  
<br/>(Question No. 57/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on the 
<br/>nature-based seawalls project that has been agreed to between the Ministry and International 
<br/>Union for Conversation of Nature (IUCN) and the Kiwa Initiative? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  by  the 
<br/>honourable Member. The Kiwa Initiative is a multi-donor programme by the European Union, the 
<br/></span><span>Agency  for  French  Development,  Global  Affairs  Canada  and  Australia,  that  aims  to  strengthen 
<br/></span><span>climate  change  resilience  for  Pacific  Islands  ecosystems,  communities  and  economies  through 
<br/>nature-based solutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The initiative aims to combat coastal erosion and reduce the vulnerability of communities to 
<br/>the effect of coastal degradation and riverbank erosion by establishing nature-based solutions which 
<br/>includes integrated infrastructure and planted vegetation, stone blocks with mangroves and vetiver.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project will further help improve coastal livelihoods and build community resilience to natural 
<br/>disasters and climate change impacts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Waterways  signed  an  agreement  with  the  International  Union  for 
<br/>Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on 13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 as an implementing agency for the grant  of 
<br/>€326,000, equivalent to over FJ$700,000 under this Kiwa Initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The six sites identified under this initiative are Nakawaga Village, Vesi Village and Ligaulevu 
<br/>Village on Mali Island; Nasarata Village in Somosomo, Taveuni; Navola Village in Sigatoka’ and 
<br/>Navolau No. 1 Village in Rakiraki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask, we are asking someone to reduce the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fuel prices, that very someone... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!

<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-... who has failed to reduce the prices of lamb chops in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker,  Sir,  I  understand  nature-based  seawall  project  is  the  great  initiative  to  help 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vulnerable.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Listen, listen, please! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat my question due to the indifference from the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The nature-based seawall project is a great initiative, and it will definitely help our vulnerable 
<br/>communities along the coast lines.  The question for honourable Minister for Agriculture is, if he can 
<br/>precisely clarify the possible risks to and from the project and the strategy to mitigate them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T. K. NAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot understand the question.  Can you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rephrase it, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  repeat  the  question.  Can  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister precisely clarify about the nature-based seawall project, the possible risks to the project and 
<br/>from the project and the strategy to mitigate these risks?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. NAYALU.- I will try and answer the question but, first of all, can I ask a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question also?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T. K. NAYALU.- What kind of risks are your referring to, is it financial risks or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>environmental risks? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- All. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- In terms of finance, I think one of the reasons why we seek donor 
<br/>funding is to help us with the financing of projects of this nature.  The enormous work that is involved 
<br/>and these coastal degradation is not confined only to a few areas in Fiji, it touches the whole of our 
<br/>coastal areas.  So, if you are talking about the risk to our coast, the risk is enormous than the risk 
<br/>from sea level rise and the cost to mitigate these risks is also enormous.  That is why we have to seek 
<br/>donor funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>response.  One of the things that we find whenever we go for </span><span>talanoa</span><span> sessions all around Fiji, there 
<br/>is always one thing that you almost get requested for, that is seawalls.  We know that the cost of 
<br/>seawall made out of concrete is very expensive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the past few years, Waterways has been doing a similar project where they plant vetiver 
<br/>grass, they lay the rocks and they plant the </span><span>dogo</span><span> (mangrove)</span><span>.</span><span>  So, I am just trying to work out, moving 
<br/>to this mode, is it just because of the funding or is the modality that they use for the nature-based 
<br/>solution is better than the one that was being used before?  Is it the funding, plus a better product, or 
<br/>is it just the funding?  I am just trying to get to grips with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- I have a very good answer for you.  Go to Ovalau, there is a 
<br/>similar project in front of PAFCO, that was done by the Japanese.  I saw it when I was a five-year-
<br/>old student in Ovalau when my mother was posted to Ovalau as a teacher.  That nature-based seawall 
<br/>is still there today.  I am now 56 years old, so that is proof to you that the concept works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Is that the same thing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Yes,  same  kind  of  thing.    This  nature-based  solution  is  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Japanese model. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Just a supplementary to the honourable Minister, thank you for 
<br/>your response.    It is just a contribution from the community that I am interested to know, because I 
<br/>know that apart from the vetiver grass, you already have the nurseries for that, but a lot of boulders 
<br/>and  I  discussed  this  with  the  honourable  Minister  for  Lands  the  other  day  because  this  is  an 
<br/>opportunity as well for our people, particularly landowners.  So, contribution from the community, 
<br/>particularly boulders or any financial contribution from them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has answered the question himself because 
<br/>the boulders, yes, that is the contribution from the community and the labour to plant mangrove or 
<br/>vetiver grass. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Guideline for Ministry of Education Appointments 
<br/>(Question No. 58/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my question, on a lighter note, I know and 
<br/>understand that the honourable Minister, in his response, will say that as a former Assistant Minister 
<br/>for Education, I should know better, but the answer we are seeking is in the interest of the general 
<br/></span><span>public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament as to which guidelines 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>does the Ministry use to make appointments? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you like to attempt that one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- A simple answer to  that question without adding what he has 
<br/>already said, it is the OMRS Guideline as already stated yesterday, and that is something that we are 
<br/>currently reviewing now, to improve the internal processes of the appointments that have been made 
<br/>within the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very happy to see the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>today and, of course, what he delivered in terms of his assessment of 100 days.  But what I would 
<br/>like  to  tell  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  that  we  have  two  Ministers,  Minister  of  Finance  and 
<br/>Minister for Education, they need to switch their places.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, both of them try and avoid the question. It looks like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they do not know their portfolios.  Please, it is my humble request, honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, my question is related to a letter that was written by the Fiji Teachers Union (FTU) to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- She is getting there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-There was a letter  written by the Fiji Teachers Union to the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister  and  it  was  in  regards  to  the  appointment  made  by  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Education and the appointment was made not using the Guideline.  So, it is not, we are raising the 
<br/>issue, the issue was already raised in the public arena. So, my question to you is, how are you going 
<br/>to rectify that problem because you have made appointments without using the Guideline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  You  have  to  be  corrected  on  that,  honourable  Member.  All 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appointments were made according to Guidelines and according to PSC appointments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So, the FTU is lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- That is the opinion that you are carrying,  so you can …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently, three appointments were done - appointments 
<br/>of two Advisors to Minister and appointment of Deputy Secretary Primary and Secondary.  These 
<br/>positions are not on the approved structure of the Ministry. These are new positions that should first 
<br/>be  evaluated  and  then  they  can  be  advertised  and  filled.    Can  the  honourable  Minister  inform 
<br/>Parliament if the positions were evaluated and approved?  If, yes, who evaluated and approved those 
<br/>positions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, can I ask the former HR Manager what structure 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he is relating to? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I am talking about the Ministry’s structure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- What structure it that?

<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The Ministry’s organisational structure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Perhaps, just to assist the honourable Member, the structure that 
<br/>you are referring to may  have a 20 percent implementation rate, is that the one? I thought the question 
<br/>coming  from  the  honourable  Member  would  be  relating  to  whether  the  Ministry  is  going  to 
<br/>compensate one of the Officer that you have highlighted, the Deputy Secretary, on the amount that 
<br/>was owed to him because the Ministry is not engaging him since he had been cleared by the Court.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We now cross over to the eight Oral Question for today and I now call on 
<br/>the honourable Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime Development, and Disaster Management 
<br/>to ask his question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of Tax Rebates 
<br/>(Question No. 59/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the Deputy  Prime  Minister and honourable Minister for  Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  inform  Parliament  on  the  status  of  the  tax 
<br/>rebates provided to investors using Fiji as their location for film production? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. I thank him 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for participating in Parliament from India.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying that the Government fully supports film production in Fiji 
<br/>and,  obviously,  both  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises, and Communications are, obviously, working very hard on getting the investors to Fiji 
<br/>and also streamlining a lot of the processes. So, that is an important point I want to make.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the film incentives are regulated under the Income Tax Act 2015 called Film 
<br/>Making  and  Audio-Visual  Incentives  Regulation  2016.    Under  the  previous  Government,  film 
<br/>production  in  Fiji  were  eligible  for  a  75  percent  rebate  on  expenditure  incurred  in  Fiji  with  the 
<br/>minimum expenditure of $250,000 and a maximum rebate cap of $15 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this basically meant that if a production company spends $20 million in Fiji 
<br/>to produce a film, the taxpayers or the Government will provide a direct subsidy of $15 million, even 
<br/>though it was disguised as a rebate when, in fact, it was a direct subsidy.  That was a very generous 
<br/>subsidy paid to foreign filmmakers, in fact, the highest subsidy that we pay to any industry in this 
<br/>country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the coverage of qualifying Fiji Production Expenditure was restricted in the 
<br/>2019-2020 Budget to spending undertaken only in Fiji and thus, excluded director’s fees and charges 
<br/></span><span>for foreign cast members.  However, the rate was increased from 47 percent to 75 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just to be clear, when the rate was 47 percent, the qualifying expenditure for the 
<br/>rebate also included director’s fees and charges for foreign cast members which inflated the cost and 
<br/>the rebate per hour.  I am told that there were some productions where rate rebate subsidy payments 
<br/>even exceeded because if you look at the 10 percent qualifying expenditure for foreign cast members 
<br/>and director’s fees then, the rate rebate or the subsidy payments even exceeded what was spent in 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>871 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji under that criteria.  So, you could be spending $100,000 but getting more than $100,000 in rebate 
<br/>or subsidy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, over a short span of time, Government had paid out subsidies of $235.5 million, 
<br/>while we still have an outstanding balance of over $180 million to be paid out. This is, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>over $400 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following the COVID-19 crisis, the Government had announced a temporary suspension of 
<br/>outstanding film rebate payments and had made arrangement with Film Fiji for a five-year payment 
<br/>period  to  settle  the  outstanding  film  rebate  payments.    Nonetheless,  for  the  outstanding  rebate 
<br/>payment, Government has a legal obligation to settle these dues. As such, for each financial year 
<br/>from 2021-2022, $40 million has been allocated to settle that outstanding film rebates according to 
<br/>the production payment plan or schedule developed by Film Fiji in consultation with the Ministry of 
<br/>Finance.  That is the legal obligation, Mr. Speaker, that has to be paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the 2021-2022 Budget, $68.7 million has been approved and paid  out to production 
<br/>houses,  Mr.  Speaker.    In  the  2021-2022  financial  year  -  $38,567,000  million;  2022-2023  - 
<br/>$30,097,000; so total rebate paid - $68,664,000 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2021-2022 Budget, Mr. Speaker, the film tax rebate was reduced from 75 percent to 20 
<br/>percent of local expenditure with a cap of $4 million - sounds reasonable thing to have been done.  
<br/>Despite this reduction in rebate levels, Film Fiji has received three applications for the new film tax 
<br/>rebate.  These productions have been furnished with their provisional approval to shoot in Fiji.  The 
<br/>approved productions are US </span><span>Survivor</span><span> Seasons 45 and 46, including </span><span>Flight to Survive</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial that a comprehensive review is undertaken, and I know that the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises, and Communications, is doing that to ascertain the effectiveness of the film tax rebate.  
<br/>When you make this kind of incentives or policies where taxpayers funds are directly involved, this 
<br/>is like taking out tax dollar and giving out as a subsidy.  You have to have a very, very clear and 
<br/>thorough cost benefit analysis - look at the multiplier effect and how is it going to be effective.  But 
<br/>without doing that, you pay this kind of taxpayers’ funds - hard-earned dollar, Mr. Speaker, which is 
<br/>not a wise way of making policy. That is where we are and, hopefully, as I have said, we have a legal 
<br/>obligation - we have to pay whatever is due and that will be done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, honourable Minister of Finance for pointing those things out.  
<br/>I think it is not good when you only sell half the story. I have got a question, but I think you need to 
<br/>be fair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the reasons why that incentive and rebate was put in place, Mr. Speaker, so that we 
<br/>would entice the bigger productions out of Hollywood and Bollywood, et cetera, to come here.  We 
<br/>all  know  because  of  COVID-19,  everything  came  to  a  standstill  and  most  of  these  were  actually 
<br/>caused by COVID-19, the fact that we still owe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope the honourable Minister of Finance is listening.  My question is, what was the benefit 
<br/></span><span>that accrued to  Fiji  when these big  production houses came with  the actual in-country spend, the 
<br/></span><span>communities that actually benefitted, the training from Film Fiji, et cetera?  All of those.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, quite a substantial benefit was actually accrued to Fiji, so we cannot just 
<br/>say, “Oh, we still owe that much money”.  They did spend a lot of money here, so we need to know 
<br/>what was the benefit that was accrued to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, that is a good economic question.  As I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said, when you make this kind of policies, that is the first thing you try and do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that we always talk about in economics, Mr. Speaker, in policy making is 
<br/>looking at the opportunity cost. If you are looking at $400 million in subsidy, and I pointed out - I 
<br/>am  not  disputing the fact  that if  an investor comes in  and spends  some  money, there is  always  a 
<br/>multiplier effect, there is always an economy generated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, all of us agree that the subsidy was just too generous.  It was like throwing 
<br/>money at something to get some benefits of which you do not know. I mean, imagine if we had put 
<br/>that $400 million into something else, other priorities. This, Mr. Speaker, is a very good example 
<br/>of.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Just answer it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have answered your question.  I am just saying that there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was no study done by the people who made this policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, we will do it. We are going to make policies based on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is so obvious - anyone listening to what I have just said, understanding the 
<br/>original subsidy, it is just mindboggling how they would do that.  It is actually quite sickening, it is 
<br/>actually criminal negligence in policymaking, Mr. Speaker, this is an example.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, it is not an easy thing to build an industry that can become 
<br/>a very lucrative industry, especially as you are competing with other markets around the world.  So, 
<br/>in this, when we were trying to attract huge companies from Hollywood and Bollywood, there is a 
<br/>lot of investment that is done upfront.  So, the calculations are calculated if you invest this upfront, 
<br/>you create an industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU starts training people.  We develop that industry here.  We develop a 
<br/>reputation and overtime, I am sure the calculations were done, those benefits will come.  When that 
<br/>happens, we have created that industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the important thing, as we are pointing out the cost, we also need to do a good estimation 
<br/>of what those benefits are. Not only of today, but the likelihood of this industry continuing in the 
<br/>future, especially with the kind of pristine assets that we have in this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just wondering what else is in line to get a real understanding of the cost benefits because 
<br/>no Government would ever want to do something that is just a cost. This is an investment.  So that is 
<br/>sort of assessment needs to be done and I hope that you might already have the answer to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I thought my friend here was a little bit of an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economist.  I remember taking his tutorial in economic statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- Honourable Usamate loves to use the word ‘hogwash’, all he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said was really hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>873 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What he does not understand Mr. Speaker, I know what he 
<br/>saying.  He is saying, “Oh, you make an investment, it is a lot”, yes, I understand that.  But in this 
<br/>particular case, Mr. Speaker, the throwing away of enormous amounts of taxpayers’ funds and now, 
<br/>we have been landed with a liability and if we are not going to look for money to settle, we could 
<br/>actually strangle the whole industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, what they did has actually created a perverse incentive, in the sense that we are at the 
<br/>point where we could have said, “No, we are not going to pay this.  We do not want this”, because 
<br/>right now the amount of money that has been wasted is just too much.  But despite that, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>we, on this side, because we do not want to send a wrong signal to our investors, despite the blunder 
<br/>that those in Government made, we are trying to correct that but, at the same time, we want to make 
<br/>sure that we get the investors to come on board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The investors, Mr. Speaker, would understand that.  They themselves would have known that 
<br/>this was a damn good generous subsidy, why not we go there, put the director’s fees up, the staff fees 
<br/>up  and  you  spend  $100,000,  you  come  back  with  $120,000  in  your  pocket  because  this  is  the 
<br/>Government that is giving you that subsidy.”  That was what happened, Mr. Speaker, so it is no point 
<br/>in them trying lecture us about what is the benefit and how it would have been done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, that is the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is a very, very glaring and clear example of a kind of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disaster that they created, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will now move on to the first Written Question and I would like to 
<br/>thank the honourable Assistant Minister Jovesa Vocea for staying up late or early in the morning in 
<br/>India.  Thank you for being attentive to the call from here.
