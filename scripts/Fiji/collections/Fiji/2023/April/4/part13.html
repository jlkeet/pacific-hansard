<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>one report will be tabled for debate in tomorrow’s session.  I wish to thank the former Chairperson 
<br/>and honourable Members of the previous Public Accounts Committee on its detailed Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Government announced various 
<br/>measures to counter its impact and to stimulate growth in the economy. A budget of $100 million 
<br/>was committed by the then Government for COVID-19 responses, as announced and presented in 
<br/>the COVID-19 Response Budget by the then honourable Minister for Economy in Parliament for the 
<br/>year end 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  primary  objective  of  the  five  compliance  audits  that  I  am  going  to 
<br/>discuss today were carried out by the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG), were mainly to assess 
<br/>specific controlled procedures implemented by responsible Government Ministries and Departments 
<br/>on their different COVID-19 response programmes.  Audits were carried out to assess compliance to 
<br/>the controls and processes for each programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Committee reviewed and consulted the responsible agencies on the issue identified in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the following five Compliance Audits. They are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan which was looked after by 
<br/>the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. 
<br/>Facilitation  of 
<br/>the  Procurement  of  Bio-Medical  Equipment  and  Quarantine 
<br/>Accommodation  and  Stock  Management  for  COVID-19,  which  was  managed  by  the 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Management of COVID-19 Aid, which was administered by the Ministry of Economy or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now Ministry of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Administration and facilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Credit Guarantee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme, which was handled by the Reserve Bank of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Management of Agricultural Assistance Farms Response Package, Home Gardening Seed 
<br/>Packages and Improvement or Farm Genetic, which was coordinated by the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief on the Committee’s findings.  On the Implementation 
<br/>of COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan that was carried out by the previous Administration, 
<br/>significant findings were identified and highlighted and they are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  COVID-19  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  was  not  submitted  for  Cabinet 
<br/></span><span>endorsement; 
<br/></span><span>Detailed breakdown of budget approved was not provided against which actual expenditure 
<br/>could be compared; 
<br/>Expenditure was incurred mostly for operational purposes such as overtime; and 
<br/>Expenditure was not recorded using a reporting framework that enhances the monitoring 
<br/>and evaluation of the plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Procurement of Bio-Medical Equipment and Quarantine Accommodation and Stock 
<br/>Management for COVID-19, the Committee noted from the Audit findings the following governance 
<br/>issues with Ministry of Health and Medical Services: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Absence  of  approved  Standard  Operating  Procedures  (SOPs)  to  guide  the  COVID-19 
<br/>response; 
<br/>Absence  of  a  reconciliation  process  between  flight  manifests  and  the  Quarantine 
<br/>Accommodation listing; and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lack of documentary trail between stock card and evidence of items received. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The audit review of the procurement of Bio-Medical Equipment noted that all processes and 
<br/>procedures were followed in accordance with the Fiji Procurement Regulation 2010 and the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services Finance Manual.  However, Sir, as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> July 2022, it was noted 
<br/>that all the procurred bio-medical equipment were yet to be received by the Ministry.  The Ministry 
<br/>can update Parliament on the purchase done and where those Bio-Medical Equipment are. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, the Committee was informed that the Incident Management Team has done really 
<br/>well  in  terms  of  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  given  the  unprecedented  challenges  brought 
<br/>about by the pandemic.  However, there are opportunities for improvement to enhance accountability 
<br/>of funds allocated and donations received.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Management  of  COVID-19  Aid,  the  Committee  was  informed  that  the  OAG  is 
<br/>determined that there was general compliance for aid funds with international agreements, except for 
<br/>the conditions by DFAT that National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) to be  also allocated 
<br/>funds for COVID-19 responses, but this was not actioned.  Documented and updated policies and 
<br/></span><span>procedures for management of all forms of aid will further improve accountability, monitoring and 
<br/></span><span>reporting of external assistance received.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Small and Medium Enterprises Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS) with the Reserve 
<br/>Bank of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to highlight the significant findings identified during the audit, it was 
<br/>noted that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Majority of the loans that had been registered since the inception of the Scheme were not 
<br/>eligible  to  be  covered  and,  therefore,  have  not  complied  with  all  the  requirements  of 
<br/>SMECGS Guidelines 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A claim of guarantee of $36,066.57 was approved and paid to the LCI 1 on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> July, 2018, 
<br/>even though the effective interest rate of loan was 14.13 percent, exceeding the interest rate 
<br/>threshold of 10 percent. The payment represents 14 percent of the total approved claims 
<br/>payout made since the inception of the Scheme in 2012. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The average annual turnover of some of the businesses whose loans were registered for 
<br/>cover under the Scheme since its inception in 2012, had exceeded the $500,000 threshold, 
<br/>hence they did not comply with the SMCGS Guidelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of 1,223 active loans valued at $67.5 million that had been registered for guarantee 
<br/>cover from prior years were de-registered in June to July 2020 as the effective interest rate 
<br/>was above the 10 percent threshold.  These loans related to LCI 1 and LCI 2 that were 
<br/>reporting the flat rate to the RBF instead of the effective interest rate charged which was 
<br/>higher than the interest rate threshold set for the Scheme, hence were deregistered from the 
<br/>Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  was  informed  that  the  major  cause  for  the  deficiencies 
<br/></span><span>identified from the audit above were due to the absence of detailed review and verification process 
<br/></span><span>from  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  as  it  has  relied  heavily  on  the  lending  institutions  for  the  correct 
<br/>submission of the data and information.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting that the RBF has taken 
<br/>stringent actions against institutions that provided incorrect information to the Bank.

<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>821 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  on  the  Management  of  Agricultural  Assistance  Farm  Response  Package,  Home 
<br/>Gardening  Seed  Packages  and  Improvement  of  Farm  Genetic  Attributes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Agriculture  is  responsible  for  the  administration  and  delivery  of  the  COVID-19 
<br/>agricultural assistance to farmers and individuals meeting the eligibility criteria for those gardening, 
<br/>farm support and large commercial farming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture was allocated $1 million to bolster Fiji’s food security in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2019-2020 COVID-19 Response Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Home Gardening and Farm Support Assistance constitute as one of the three initiatives 
<br/>undertaken to assist in maintaining food security.  The objectives of the home gardening initiative 
<br/>were to assist the people who were affected by COVID-19 in urban and peri-urban areas through the 
<br/>provision of home gardening and farm support seed and seedling packages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was informed that the Home Gardening and Farm Support 
<br/>Assistance noted that there was no SOPs nor plan developed by the Ministry to guide the overall 
<br/>procurement,  assessment and distribution of home gardening  and farm support seed and seedling 
<br/></span><span>packages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  noted  that  the  absence  of  proper  planning  was  evident  as  the  Ministry  had  not 
<br/>performed  any  prior  assessment  to  ascertain  the  divisions  and  areas  that  needed  assistance  for 
<br/>immediate relief from the impact of COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  audit  recorded  that  there  was  a  short  delivery  of  seeds,  weak  controls  over  the 
<br/>management of seedlings and farming equipment and engagement of unauthorized vendors for the 
<br/>supply of seedlings and farming materials were also noted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommended that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That there is a need to have a proper dissemination of information within Ministries and 
<br/>Departments  on  a  regular  and  timely  basis  on  the  implementation  of  new  policies, 
<br/>especially on urgent programmes such as these.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standard  Operation  Procedure  (SOPs)  developed  by  different  Ministries  and 
<br/>Departments during the pandemic period should be fine-tuned and used as a reference, 
<br/>should there be any other similar situation or disaster arising in the future.  In fact, we 
<br/>should have one for normal and one for urgent programmes, such as COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  commended  the  COVID-19  responses 
<br/>provided by the Government during that difficult time.  However, for accountability and transparency 
<br/>purposes  of  public  funds,  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  will  always  examine  all  Government 
<br/>programmes and expenditures to ensure that it complies with all relevant policies and procedures, 
<br/>and legislations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, as a Member moving the motion, I thank you for this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>823 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.40 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think it would be remiss of me, honourable Members, not to mention a 
<br/>few more faces in the gallery - the former Minister, Asenaca Caucau, all the way from United States 
<br/>and other members who are listening now to our sitting.  I think I have ran through the list of speakers 
<br/>and now we will offer the first batting to the honourable Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I stand to give my contribution to the Motion on the 
<br/>Compliance Audit relating to COVID-19 Responses that was conducted by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General (OAG).  Basically, the five compliance audits on this particular Report that is being debated 
<br/>in this Chamber’s today are the.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan; 
<br/>Procurement  of  Bio-Medical  Equipment  and  Quarantine  Accommodation  and  Stock 
<br/>Management for COVID-19; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Management of COVID-19 Aid; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Scheme; and 
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Management of Agricultural Assistance Farm Response Package, Home Gardening Seed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Packages and Improvement of Farm Genetics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the compliance audit relating to COVID-19 Response focuses on specific 
<br/>control procedures, implemented on the different COVID-9 Response Programmes.  The mentioned 
<br/>five Audit Reports were thoroughly scrutinised by the Committee in consultation with the relevant 
<br/>Ministries and Departments, and relevant stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will actually discuss the Report in detail but before I do that, it is important to 
<br/>note  and  I  urge  honourable  Members  of  this  Parliament  to  note  that  as  per  the  Public  Accounts 
<br/>Committee back then, we figured out that this was a premature audit that was conducted by the OAG.  
<br/>I will give certain examples, after which we had thorough discussions with the OAG and they also 
<br/>agreed to the fact that that was premature.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is actually required by the OAG is to carry out a follow-up Audit Report so that we can 
<br/>get indepth findings of how the Government responded through these eight Programmes, five to be 
<br/>debated today and three to be debated tomorrow, and how the Government responded to the COVID-
<br/>19 Pandemic, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, at the height of the COVID-19 we were caught by surprise, not just Fiji, but 
<br/>the whole world, and what we went through no one had seen or experienced in the past.  The COVID-
<br/>19 Pandemic caught everyone by surprise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, on the one side, while the whole of Government approach was to curb the outbreak of 
<br/>COVID-19 in Fiji, on the other side we heard the OAG carrying out an audit at the same time while 
<br/>the Government was trying to respond to the plea of the Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, having said that, we all know and understand that we never had a pandemic like 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19  and  as  I  have  said  before,  the  audit  was  conducted.    There  were  certain  things,  for 
<br/></span><span>example, when we carry out any scrutiny, we actually see the recommendation that is provided by 
<br/>the OAG.  In this audit, one thing that we figured out from almost to all eight programmes that were 
<br/>audited by them, they were basically talking about SOPs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, if they are recommending about SOPs and as I illustrated earlier on, Mr. Speaker, we 
<br/>had never seen a pandemic of this magnitude.  Government was caught off guard, so what was more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>824 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>important at that point in time for the Government, to respond to the plea of the people or to prepare 
<br/>SOPs? That a was a question that we needed to ask at that point in time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the recommendations by the OAG was that the policies that were made by the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services as the powers were vested on the Permanent Secretary through the 
<br/>Public Order Act at that point in time, did not have Cabinet endorsement.  But what they failed to 
<br/>realise was that at 10.00 a.m. everyday, the former Prime Minister with all his Ministers were actually 
<br/>having Cabinet Meeting at the Ministry of Health and Medical Services whereby confirmed statistics 
<br/>were given as to what has transpired within the last 24 hours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having considered all those and when we actually went and further scrutinised the report, we 
<br/>realised and this was confirmed by Ministry of Economy, that Fiji received more than $450 million 
<br/>in Aid in total towards combating COVID-19 in Fiji. But when the audit was carried out, only $23 
<br/>million was actually given to the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  question  we  then  asked  as  Public  Accounts  Committee  was  to  either  go 
<br/>along with the audit that only audited an amount of $23 million, or we needed to carry out another 
<br/></span><span>audit that would actually cover more than $450 million that came as Aid to the Fijian Government.  
<br/></span><span>Most of them came as a direct support to the Budget itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, we had a thorough discussion with the OAG and we actually 
<br/>agreed to the fact that there needs to be a follow-up audit conducted at a later stage and I believe at 
<br/>that point in time, the OAG was gearing up to conduct that particular follow-up audit with relevant 
<br/>agencies and Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the Implementation of COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan, the audit 
<br/>was  undertaken  to  obtain  sufficient  appropriate  evidence  to  form  a  conclusion  on  whether  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services,  through  their  Incident  Management  Team,  had 
<br/>implemented response actions in accordance with Fiji’s COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan 
<br/>for Levels 1 and 2.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  through  responsible  lead,  has  generally 
<br/>implemented appropriate response action in accordance with the Fiji’s COVI-19 Preparedness and 
<br/>Response Plan.  Implementation of the Response Action has enabled the State of Preparedness for 
<br/>addressing the occurrence of COVID-19 in Fiji.  In light of the identified findings of the Ministry of 
<br/>Health and Medical Services, it has taken into consideration the lessons learnt and improvements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  alluded  by  the  current  Chairman,  the  communication  that  used  go  from 
<br/>Ministry of Health to other agencies at that point in time was very critical.  This is something that 
<br/>was picked up by the OAG and Public Accounts Committee concurred with that recommendation 
<br/>that there needs to be smooth flow of information from one agency to the other.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry was further planning on stimulation exercise and had conducted 
<br/>refresher  training  on  communication  and  advocacy,  to  maintain  a  high  degree  of  awareness  in 
<br/>responding to COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Procurement  of  Bio-Medical  Equipment,  Quarantine,  Accommodation  and  Stock 
<br/>Management of COVID-19, the result of the Audit  had indicated that the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services has a number of policies and procedures that were still in draft phase.  The audit 
<br/>review of the procurement of biomedical equipment noted that all processes and procedures were 
<br/>followed in accordance with the Fiji Procurement Regulation 2010.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>825 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Management of COVID-19 Aid, Mr. Speaker, the primary objective of the audit on 
<br/>this was to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to form a conclusion on whether the process 
<br/>and control that existed were effective to manage the COVID-19 aid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was highlighted that the management of COVID-19 aid was generally being administrated 
<br/>well  with  areas  of  improvements,  such  as  updating  of  the  SOPs  in  consultation  with  other 
<br/>stakeholders to capture additional operational matters and the Ministry of Economy is in the process 
<br/>of developing a tool that will capture aid-in-kind at whole of the Government level as a strategy to 
<br/>increase accountability of Government Ministries and to ensure duplicity of projects and resource 
<br/>allocation is well utilised across Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  on  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  Credit  Guaranteed  Scheme 
<br/>(MSMECGS),  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  significantly  impacted  all  businesses,  especially  the 
<br/>MSMEs.  The Scheme was established in 2012 with an aim of expanding lending to MSMEs and 
<br/>support the Government initiative to promote MSMEs development, investment and local business 
<br/>activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Government had allocated funding through its COVID-19 Response Budget with 
<br/></span><span>the view that the Scheme encourages private sector lending to MSMEs.  Government had allocated 
<br/>an additional $5 million to assist MSMEs affected by the pandemic, raising the total amount allocated 
<br/>to $9 million.  The major highlights identified that the MSMEs Scheme had been expanded during 
<br/>the COVID-19 pandemic to include micro enterprises administered by the Reserve Bank of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in April 2020, the Scheme was enhanced where the Government raised its 
<br/>guarantee to 60 percent of the principle outstanding on default MSMEs loans up to a limit of $60,000 
<br/>per business from 50 percent or $50,000 previously.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note what the OAG has picked up as an issue and made recommendations 
<br/>that are not practical, as the RBF will only be duplicating the process of commercial banks and this 
<br/>will only increase bureaucracy.  The reason why we are saying this, Mr. Speaker, is that the RBF 
<br/>gives  money  to  commercial  banks.    Now,  commercial  banks  have  their  own  criteria  before  they 
<br/>actually give out loans to a recipient and in ensuring that the recipient is in a position to pay back the 
<br/>loan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendation of the OAG was that they needed the same process to be carried out by 
<br/>RBF, which to the Public Accounts Committee at that point in time did not make sense because they 
<br/>were  not  the  ones  who  were  handing  out  the  money  to  the  recipients.    It  was  going  through  the 
<br/>commercial banks and these banks have their own checks and balances in place before the money is 
<br/>handed out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  having  said  that,  even  though  it  was  a  recommendation,  the  RBF 
<br/>strengthened its procedures and added checklist that reflects the updated guideline.  The RBF also 
<br/>revived  its  reporting  template  effective  from  1st  June,  2020  and  the  annual  turnover  is  now  the 
<br/>requirement  under  the  new  MSMECGS  reporting  template  in  line  with  the  revised  definition  of 
<br/>MSMEs.  The RBF had issued the reporting template to financial institutions to submit turnover data 
<br/></span><span>of their respective registered MSME loans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to no. 2, Mr. Speaker, again, the OAG failed to realise that if a company started 
<br/>its operation in 2012, for example, company x, and had a turnover of $50,000.  At that point in time 
<br/>in  2012,  they  were  within  the  criteria  to  get  the  loan  but  after  eight  or  10  years  when  the  OAG 
<br/>conducted this particular audit, definitely, the turnover of that company x would have grown to an 
<br/>amount, for example, $100,000.

<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot actually compare the audit recommendation of 2020 to what was that company 
<br/>earning or what the total turnover of that company was in 2012.  Looking at the turnover of that 
<br/>company in 2020, the Office of the Auditor-General actually recommended that these companies do 
<br/>not fall under the criteria to access this loan under the concession scheme.  That was the issue there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on the Agriculture Assistance Farm Package, again, there were lockdowns and 
<br/>people were not allowed to move.  One of the biggest hindrance in terms of food security was that 
<br/>people were not able to bring their produce either from Korovou or Sigatoka   to Suva and that was 
<br/>during the lockdown.  So, the Ministry for Agriculture decided to give seedlings to encourage people 
<br/>because they were staying home during lockdown to do backyard gardening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What some people failed to realise was that this initiative was for backyard gardening and not 
<br/>large-scale farming.  When they were handed a handful of seedlings, some of the commercial farmers 
<br/>said that that was not enough.  So that was because assistance in the form of seedling was given only 
<br/>for backyard gardening.  That was the misunderstanding that led  to people complaining that they 
<br/>were  not  receiving  enough  seedlings,  thinking  that  the  Government  at  that  point  in  time  was 
<br/>distributing seedlings for farming purposes, but it was designed for backyard gardening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  Parliament  and  thank  the  two 
<br/>Permanent Secretaries and their team, the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Health, Dr. James 
<br/>Fong, and the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Economy then, Mr. Shiri Gounder.  These two 
<br/>gentlemen with their team, spent most of the time in their office during COVID-19.  I can say that 
<br/>Dr. Fong never visited his family.  He was mostly sleeping on the floor of his office, and that was to 
<br/>safeguard his family and to put the safety of Fijians first.  Also, that was the case with Mr. Shiri 
<br/>Gounder and his team at the Ministry of Economy at that time.  They were down with COVID-19, 
<br/>tested positive, and yet for the love of the country and for the security of the people, they did what 
<br/>any good civil servant would have done.  So, hats off to those Permanent Secretaries and their team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I commend this Report and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am surprised to hear that a premature audit was done by the Office of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Auditor-General.  It is quite interesting and confusing as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion 
<br/>for debate this afternoon and, that is, on the Review of the Attorney-General’s Report on Compliance 
<br/>Audits  Relating  to  COVID-19  Response.    Before  that,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  previous  PAC 
<br/>Committee for scrutinising the Report, deliberating on the Report and tabling it back to Parliament 
<br/>and I also thank the new  Committee as well for tabling. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to be brief and keep my comments on the three programmes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that came under review this year on the Auditor-General’s Report, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan; 
<br/>Procurement  of  Bio-Medical  Equipment  and  Quarantine  Accommodation  and  Stock 
<br/>Management for COVID-19; and 
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Management of COVID-19 Aid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  COVID-19  outbreak  was  an  unprecedented  event  that  tested  all  our 
<br/>existing processes.  We note the OAG’s recommendations in the following years and update on our 
<br/>response  to  date.    Firstly,  there  has  been  ongoing  discussions  with  NDMO  in  facilitating  a 
<br/>collaborative  framework  through  the  National  Emergency  Response  Team  Mechanism,  to  ensure 
<br/>there is interoperability between agencies to enhance disaster response. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>827 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the facilitation of the simulation exercises and facilitating better communication 
<br/>and advocacy.  Capability as an ongoing exercise with development partners and is a key part of level 
<br/>2 of the preparedness and action plan.  The key focus is on maintaining high level of readiness within 
<br/>the Ministry and nationally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  earlier  on  in  terms  of  our 
<br/>preparedness,  preparedness,  as  I  had  mentioned,  started  with  a  programme  that  the  previous 
<br/>Government had initiated and their terms of preparedness in terms of what the Ministry of Health is 
<br/>doing - in terms of our preparedness for any overseen or any pandemic in the future or any national 
<br/>disaster that is continuous and we are trying to strengthen that as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned in the Report, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/>Emergency Response Team (ERT) has developed an expenditure matrix with 10 key objectives, and 
<br/>this is being used to manage current COVID-19 funds.  We will maintain and refine this framework 
<br/>with NDMO through an ERT to ensure better resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note in the Report that there was no Cabinet endorsement but as mentioned by the former 
<br/></span><span>PAC Chairperson that at that time, there was a need for work done first and endorsement maybe to 
<br/></span><span>come in later.  But I am proud to say that a Cabinet paper is being prepared to endorse our Border 
<br/>Health  Protection  Unit,  so  as  to  better  coordinate  quarantine  processes,  including  its  financial 
<br/>management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  equipment  projected  for  COVID-19  Response  were  received  and 
<br/>payments  remitted  to  the  awarded  vendors.    There  is  equipment  such  as  ventilators,  bedside 
<br/>monitoring equipment, air hose, hospital beds, thermal scanners, bio-safety cabinets, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  management  of  the  pharmaceutical  stocks  is  currently  being 
<br/>strengthened.  The implementation of the mSupply system that was installed in the first quarter of 
<br/>2021-2022 financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All donations received dispatched are managed through the Standard Operating Procedure, 
<br/>driven through this new warehouse information management system.  Sir, mSupply is a warehouse 
<br/>information and management system that covers end to end processes from procurement right down 
<br/>to distribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Minister for Health.  Now, I give the floor to the 
<br/>honourable Ravunawa and before I do so, honourable Members, just a quick intervention, there is a 
<br/>slight reshuffle in the list.  After honourable Ravunawa, we will then have the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister of Finance before honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways 
<br/>continues after that, and then it will be honourable Bulitavu followed by the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises, and Communiations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee for the presentation of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this motion for debate this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating impact on our national economy.  The review that 
<br/>was  carried  out  by  the  Committee  highlighted  the  audit  issues  that  were  identified  within  the 
<br/>Management of Unemployment Benefits and Management of Concessional Loan Package to Micro, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, pandemic is  not  a word to  use lightly or carelessly.    It is  a word that if 
<br/>misused,  can  cause  unreasonable  fear,  unjustified  acceptance  that  the  fear  is  over,  leading  to 
<br/>unnecessary  suffering  and  death.    Describing  the  situation  as  a  pandemic  does  not  change  WHO 
<br/>assessment and the threat that poses with this virus.  It does not change what WHO is doing, it does 
<br/>not change what countries should do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by coronavirus and this is the first pandemic 
<br/>that was caused by this virus.  We have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.  At the 
<br/>same time WHO has been in a full response mode since we were notified on the first case.  They 
<br/>called everyday for countries to take urgent and aggressive actions, and the Director-General of WHO 
<br/>mentioned that we have rung the alarm loud and clear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has never walked this road before and the motion before Parliament, 
<br/>the  Concessional  Loan  Package  that  was  provided  to  eligible  MSME  businesses  with  a  five-year 
<br/>repayment plan, including one year grace period with no principle or interest payment.  The loan 
<br/>repayment was to commence from the second year with a flexibility of a single annual repayment 
<br/>and even with payments spread over the years with interest calculations, will be based on a simple 
<br/></span><span>interest method. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji was one of the worst affected countries with a cumulative decline of almost 21 percent of 
<br/>our GDP - the largest ever economic contraction of 17.2 percent in 2020, with a further 4.1 percent 
<br/>contraction in 2021.  We lost a total of $4.6 billion in GDP over the last two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We lost around $4 billion in foreign exchange from tourism earnings due to the impact of 
<br/>Coronavirus pandemic.  Government tax collection also declined by 50 percent on average, it has 
<br/>lost a total of around $2.8 billion in tax revenue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  100,000  Fijians  were  either  unemployed  or  have  reduced  hours  of  work.  Socio-
<br/>economic  conditions  become  challenging,  and  the  Government  have  to  step  in  to  assist  in  the 
<br/>situation.  Government ensured macro-economic stability during the crisis, critical to maintain the 
<br/>confidence  and  for  economic  rebuilding.    Exchange  rate  stability,  first  major  crisis  without  the 
<br/>devaluation, unlike in the past we enterthe crisis with a strong foreign reserve position supported by 
<br/>external government borrowing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiscal stability despite the 50 percent decline in our tax revenue Mr. Speaker, Sir, we managed 
<br/>to  sustain  public  spending,  including  the  $500  million  livelihood  support  by  the  Government. 
<br/>Investment received, budget support, grants and increased concessional borrowing.  Financial sector 
<br/>stability, financial sector remained sound with adequate capital and liquidity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government introduced various measures to support businesses, rebuild the competitiveness 
<br/>of the tourism industry and also enticed new investment.  At the same point, ECAL has been removed 
<br/>with  the departure tax  reduced from $200 to  $100.  Removal of stamp duties and 6 percent  STT 
<br/>import tariff reduction across the board and removal of business licences.  Businesses were provided 
<br/>relief through deferment of tax payment,  reduction in  the FNPF contribution from  the normal  18 
<br/>percent to 10 percent and loan repayment holidays' concessional loans to MSMEs.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  COVID-19  Recovery  Guarantee  Scheme  of  $200  million  for  working 
<br/>capital  support,  zero  rated  VAT  on  21  essential  items  to  reduce  the  inflation  prices  on  our  local 
<br/>consumers.  Income support of over $500 million assisted those unemployed and in reduced hours, 
<br/>provided much needed physical stimulus for business activity and help increase our vaccination rate.  
<br/>This was on top of all other expenditures to ensure that there is no major disruption to our normal 
<br/>public services.

<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>829 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government had to increase its borrowing to sustain the economy.  Economic decline and the 
<br/>socio-economic consequences would have been much more severe, Sir, including a large devaluation 
<br/>if we did not take this concessional loan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Almost every country increased its borrowing, Mr. Speaker.  The levels of sustainability and 
<br/>mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic and Fiji is not isolated.  There are gaps identified in the two 
<br/>Audit  reports  in  which  the  relevant  Ministries  involved  are  taking  necessary  measures  to  address 
<br/>issues that are put in place, including the SOPs and guidelines for further use of such initiative.  This 
<br/>experience, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this  review can be used  as a learning curve for the  whole of 
<br/>Government and the respective stakeholders as our way forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to extend my appreciation to the honourable Members of the Committee who are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just be very brief.  I think a lot of detail 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was covered by honourable Maharaj and the Chairperson of the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just on the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and policies to govern the management of 
<br/></span><span>Aid, it is very important. The International Co-operation Unit of the Ministry of Finance is currently 
<br/>reviewing the SOPs and policies for Aid management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is very important.  The Unit, Sir, is responsible for providing financial advisory and 
<br/>policy support to the whole of Government in the management of cash grants, either budgeted or 
<br/>unbudgeted, or any  </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> kind  of support by any agency and aid-in-kind  so that we ensure that 
<br/>release  of  such  cash  grants  from  development  partners  are  in  accordance  with  the  Financial 
<br/>Management Act, Financial Instructions, Procurement Regulations and the Finance Manual of the 
<br/>Ministry’s Unit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, circulars to Government Ministries and Departments and checklist for release of 
<br/></span><span>ad hoc</span><span> donor funds, so I just wanted to say that to the discussion already which I know dealt with 
<br/>those  five  different  programmes  during  COVID-19.    I  will  reserve  my  comment  on  the  seed 
<br/>distribution for another time, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  motion  before 
<br/>Parliament. Let  me begin by stating  that my  response is  solely on the clarification of issues with 
<br/>regards to the Ministry of Agriculture.  The first issue raised in the Report is the absence of Standard 
<br/>Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Plans on Home Gardening and Farm Support Assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that honourable Members of this august Parliament understand that 
<br/>the nature of intervention required during the period of the pandemic was a bit abnormal, given the 
<br/>uncertainties and the huge expectation from the general public for food and nutrition security.  But I 
<br/>am glad to say that the Ministry rolled out the Home Garden and Farm Support initiatives and was 
<br/>concurrently developing the policies and SOPs at the same time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Backyard  Home  Gardening  Policy  was  signed  by  the  Minister  for 
<br/></span><span>Agriculture on 21</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2019.  The Policy highlights the process of implementation which is the 
<br/></span><span>SOP for the Programme that is currently in use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the short delivery of seedlings, the Ministry acknowledges the shortfall as stated in the 
<br/>Audit Report.  However, we must understand that we are dealing with biological processes.  Despite 
<br/>having  the  best  of  the  seedling  raising  facility,  you  would  always  have  challenges  achieving  100 
<br/>percent germination and survival till the hardening process.  As such, we want to assure Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>830 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that all seedling suppliers honoured their contracts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the weed control over the management of planting materials and seedlings, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, production of seedlings and planting  materials  is  not  as simple as it may seem.   If we are to 
<br/>depend on the natural processes, </span><span>dalo</span><span> suckers can be harvested nine months after the mother sucker 
<br/>is planted.  The shelf life of the </span><span>dalo</span><span> suckers is between three to four days and as such, it needs to be 
<br/>delivered and planted without delay. Therefore, seedling production and harvesting must synchronise 
<br/>with land preparation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, delivery had to be made at multiple sites and to a centralised facility and it 
<br/>takes time to collate multiple deliveries simultaneously.  And we note the concerns by the Audit team 
<br/>and assure the Parliament that all tally cards have been updated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the opportunities that have been presented as a learning 
<br/>or a takeaway from this exercise.  The Ministry of Agriculture does not have a nursery facility that 
<br/>can facilitate the production of seedlings of the magnitude that was required.  However, there had 
<br/>been talks with the British American Tobacco Company during the time when the honourable Leader 
<br/></span><span>of the Opposition was the Minister, to make use of the tobacco seedling production facility for the 
<br/></span><span>production  of  vegetables  seedlings  during  the  tobacco  offseason.    The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is 
<br/>already on to that initiative as we speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were also other developments that could have contributed to the efficiency of the whole 
<br/>process.  In terms of our tissue culture facility, there is only one functioning tissue culture facility 
<br/>which  produces  seedlings  from  tissue  culture,  and  it  belongs  to  the  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific 
<br/>Community.  Apart from that, there is another private facility that is located in Wainibuku, but it also 
<br/>does not have the capacity to meet the demands as in this exercise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of concerns on supplies, I want to assure this august Parliament 
<br/>that a proper market survey under the Ministry of Agriculture Procurement policy was conducted 
<br/>and price was the only factor that was considered for vendor selection.  Variety, quantity, quality, 
<br/>vendor reputation, as well as other value-added services were the other factors considered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  vetting  and  assessment  of  Home  Gardening  and  Farm  Support  Application,  the 
<br/>Ministry  acknowledges  the  finding  of  the  Audit  Report.  However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  should  be 
<br/>noted, again, that these were abnormal times and movement was restricted.  So, we had to rely on 
<br/>remote verifications either by phone or email, as well as that from our own Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>records as information on the recipients. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Post  COVID-19,  I  want  to  bring  the  attention  of  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/>Parliament that the Ministry has a Monitoring and Evaluation and the Risk and Governance Unit that 
<br/>regularly checks the policies and procedures across the Ministry to ensure compliance.  I think I had 
<br/>already  alluded  to  this  in  one  of  my  earlier  speeches.    All  Audit  findings  were  revisited,  and 
<br/>appropriate measures were put in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture has now established a database of potential suppliers and we are 
<br/></span><span>also  building  the  capacity  of  the  Research  Division  in  the  production  of  planting  materials.    In 
<br/></span><span>extreme cases, the Ministry will work with Biosecurity Authority of Fiji for the acquiring of seeds 
<br/>from restricted parts of Fiji due to the risk of diseases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  finish,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  thank  the  hardworking  staff  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture for their efforts in carrying this assistance through.  I have been told that they 
<br/>ran an operation called Green Link, which involved the traffic of farm produce at their checkpoints

<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity and I rise to give my 
<br/>short contribution on the Motion that is before Parliament.  Most of the points have been covered by 
<br/>the former Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  I also agree with you, Sir, that if this was 
<br/>a premature Audit, I do not know whether to support or do not support the recommendation that is 
<br/>in  the  Report.  But,  again,  it  is  now  before  Parliament  for  debate,  so  we  will  go  along  with  the 
<br/>recommendations that are there in the Committee’s Review Report.

<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  and  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. I think they have done their right approach into 
<br/>Annual Reports and Review Reports, not only appraising the Civil Servants who had worked hard 
<br/>during the crisis, but also the decisions that were made, given that they were in abnormal times, as 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways had put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, Fiji was in a new norm.  We all heard that because of COVID-19, we had to readjust 
<br/>ourselves  and  things  were  not  done  in  the  usual  manner.  Again,  what  has  been  identified  by  the 
<br/></span><span>Auditors are lessons to learn in preparation for any other pandemic that will be coming our way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister for Health had said, it was unprecedented. Nothing of that sort 
<br/>that Fiji had faced but we have gone past that, Sir.  Even the COVID-19 Response Budget that came 
<br/>after that, plus the 2021-2022 Budget, has policies that we are already now on our recovery mode in 
<br/>regard to our economy.  That goes down, again, to sound leadership and very decisive decisions that 
<br/>was done by the Government at that time that allowed us to sail through the pandemic and from that, 
<br/>building in one as a nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We would like to thank everyone.  The crisis actually called for our patriotism and also built 
<br/>up that resilient Fijian spirit within us to work together in moving our nation forward during those 
<br/>hard times.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the various assistance that were there, the Aid, plus the Agriculture Assistance 
<br/>that the honourable Minister for Agriculture has alluded to- the home gardening support, agriculture 
<br/>commercial support, farm support, Abattoir upgrading and all those programmes that assisted many 
<br/>who had lost their job and had to go back to farming to find alternative forms of employment as life 
<br/>moves on, while others were trying to politicise the people being laid off from work. But, again, this 
<br/>kind of crisis calls on the talent that God has placed within us that makes us think hard and also regain 
<br/>other things in our life that directs to our very own purpose that God probably created us for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MSME assistance in various villages that assisted many saw the Auditor findings and 
<br/>recommendations but, again, we understand that the RBF probably have made improvements on the 
<br/>things that the Auditors have highlighted that were some of the things that probably could improve 
<br/>the system as we go along.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  thing  that  was  approved  during  the  COVID-19  was  the  assistance  that  was  to 
<br/>cushion, called the stimulus package mainly for our citizens.  The $360 assistance to our citizens at 
<br/></span><span>that time was labelled as a handout by the Opposition.  But this is assistance targeted to people who 
<br/></span><span>were really in need at that time.  So, we are thankful that the systems in place, such as the M-PAiSA 
<br/>and MyCash are now systems that are also used by the current Minister of in the disbursement of the 
<br/>Back-to-School Assistance.  But, again, these are the system that were put in place by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government that the previous Opposition used to criticise, but they become very useful and very 
<br/>handy now.  I hope the honourable Minister for Finance will learn.  But these are the things that were

<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>put in place by the FijiFirst Government that the honourable Minister can continue moving on from 
<br/>the good works that has been done by the previous Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rather than talking about the wastage and criticising things that were done at that time, he 
<br/>should follow the responses done by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services and 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, defending the civil servants and the system 
<br/>that was in place, not politicising it, as he usually does.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the few things  that I would like to  say in  my  contribution  to  Parliament on the 
<br/>debate that is before us, and we look forward to the other Audit Report tomorrow on the same issue 
<br/>of COVID-19.  I commend the Report that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I will be brief and will go straight into 
<br/>perhaps, the areas where I think the Government can focus on.  Again, I am referring to my previous 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister for Health, how well prepared are we for the next one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to acknowledge the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways for the 
<br/></span><span>actions that the Ministry has undertaken to rectify and improve some of the issues that were raised, 
<br/></span><span>likewise to the honourable Minister for Health and, of course, from the Ministry of Finance as well 
<br/>on procurement systems.  We are thankful that we are taking positive steps to bring efficiency into 
<br/>the system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Likewise,  I also  wish to acknowledge the Office of the  Auditor-General  because the only 
<br/>positive that we can get out of this is the key lessons that we learn from it and how can we use those 
<br/>learnings in order to prepare us better for the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to be proactive rather than reactive.  I would admit that initially, 
<br/>we were reacting when we were overwhelmed.  Let us not forget the fact that there was a double 
<br/>blow during this period, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the catastrophes that we faced.  Right in the 
<br/>middle of COVID-19, we had </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, a Category 4 cyclone in April 2020.  We were stretched 
<br/>to the limit.  I wish to, again, acknowledge all those who contributed, not only from Government, but 
<br/>non-government organisations, civil societies, Fiji Council of Social Services and the list goes on, 
<br/>the Opposition for criticising and ridiculing, FRIENDS, definitely, although they were a proxy NGO 
<br/>to the NFP but, definitely, FRIENDS is a key player in our response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  my  plea  to  the  Government,  honourable  Attorney-General,  we  have  some  archaic 
<br/>laws.  I know that the Disaster Management Act 1998 is currently under review, and we need to bring 
<br/>in Local Government into the machinery of emergency response.  That is something lacking in the 
<br/>current Disaster Management Act 1998.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our response when it comes to the laws, was merely based on the Public 
<br/>Health Act 1965, if I remember correctly.  There were lots of challenges.  We were the ones in that 
<br/>room trying to make things move and happen.  The former Commander knows it very well, because 
<br/>of cross cutting issues, the duplication and overlaps that we have, we need to review the Acts because 
<br/>it  will  simplify  things,  particularly  make  things  easier  in  terms  of  guidance  to  our  operators, 
<br/></span><span>particularly, the Permanent Secretaries, who are Chief Accounting officers as well, and then it trickles 
<br/></span><span>down to the men and women on the ground who are going to implement the plans that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other major request that I have on Government is, it is not too late for us to have a national 
<br/>audit of our response.  We are thankful to the Office of the Auditor-General.  In the Military the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Home Affairs is well aware of the term ‘after action review’.  It is simply 
<br/>just a debrief.  Mr. Speaker, NDMO does that very well and NDMO is where it is today because of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>

<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>833 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these debriefs.  There is nothing to be hidden, but it is about effectiveness and efficiency.  We need 
<br/>to always prepare better for the next one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My experience in NDMO is, a lot of good reports from previous disasters were there but, 
<br/>unfortunately, it is kept on the shelf, and we wait for the next one.  That has always been the challenge 
<br/>and when we were in Government, honourable Attorney-General, we changed what we call shifting 
<br/>from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention.  That was the major statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>so that we can be more proactive, look at what were the lessons learnt, what needs to be done, who 
<br/>are the key stakeholders who can help us on this and what are the resources that are needed now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You see at Black Rock now we have the warehouse, strategically reserved not only for Fiji 
<br/>but for the Region, so I would say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because, again, there was a lot of frustration 
<br/>behind the scene.  We have come through it, but there are still major lessons that we can take on so 
<br/>that we can bring efficiency into the system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My last request, if the honourable Minister for Home Affairs can take the lead in this, we 
<br/>need an overarching National Emergency Response Framework.  I will say that again, right now it is 
<br/></span><span>time.  Based on the lessons learnt from COVID-19, we, as a country, need an overarching National 
<br/></span><span>Emergency Response Framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister  for  Trade  always  talk  about  the 
<br/>compartmentalisation, it is difficult when we are protective, we have our own areas, empires we may 
<br/>call it, but I think of the national interest, and the Ministry for Defence then has already undertaken 
<br/>that, but we need to look at it holistically and see if we can bring these together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  we  have  talked  about  the  1965  Public  Health  Act  and  then  a  framework  that  was 
<br/>brought in by WHO.  Mr. Speaker, WHO is important, they are a key stakeholder.  Ministry of Health 
<br/>is the lead agency and the rest of Government machinery support the Ministry of Health.  That is 
<br/>very, very critical and that is why we need this National Emergency Response Framework that will 
<br/>help us in terms of the way forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, once again, to all those who contributed and may I say, I also need to acknowledge 
<br/>the decisive leadership of Government, so no more excuses honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>carry on with the work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to be the final speaker on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this side of Parliament with regard to the motion in front of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, just by way of context, I quite concur with the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>that when we see reports, particularly, of global crisis such as COVID-19, the obvious question that 
<br/>comes out of this report is, what do we do next?  So, the honourable Leader of the Opposition has 
<br/>alluded to some solutions that we need to look at and I am sure we all agree that we will look at that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thought I just take us slightly back in history just to make one pertinent point about what do 
<br/>we do next.  In 2018, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the economy was starting to slow down, by that time the other 
<br/></span><span>side of Parliament was spending quite excessively.  When we got to 2019… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- 100 percent lies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- … the economy was in recession, it had actually taken a 
<br/>downturn, 1.9 percent I think was the number that was quoted by the Reserve Bank of Fiji.  So, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we were facing difficulties already and then COVID-19 hit and then it showed up all 
<br/>the issues that had been build up over time as the honourable Minister of Finance said, the wastage 
<br/>that had accumulated over time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know  the  other  side  of  Parliament  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  loves  to  praise  themselves  saying, 
<br/>“decisive leadership”.  One thing that they failed to say, for the first time in the history of Fiji, we 
<br/>got budget support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, $400 million came into the system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to 
<br/>help us through the crisis.  It was not exactly good financial management, there was a lot of assistance 
<br/>from our partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Humanitarian assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable I.S. Seruiratu interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Let us not get carried away, I am just taking us slightly back 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in history, just to make a point.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Can I just make a point? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The point I would like to make is this, apart from all the 
<br/>changes of legislations, apart from all the things that we would like to do,  I think what this country 
<br/>needs to do is seriously look at some sort of financial buffer.  I always go back to the biblical story 
<br/>of Joseph in the </span><span>Bible.  </span><span>Seven years of plenty so when the famine came, they were ready, he was 
<br/>ready.  That is where Fiji needs to move. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We need to look forward and what I am suggesting and I 
<br/></span><span>would love to get the views on the other side, Sir, because we need to attack this as a national issue.  
<br/>We seriously need to look at a sovereign wealth fund for the country.  I know that at the moment 
<br/>when I look at the budgets of the other side (former government), they were putting aside $5 million 
<br/>in the budget as an emergency fund and that is essentially what a sovereign wealth fund is. However, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difference is, you do not overspend and then put $5 million into that. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Review Report-Auditor-General’s Compliance Audits  
<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>835 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I just offer that suggestion  to Parliament  for us to  think  about 
<br/>because ultimately when the next COVID-19 hits, even with the situation we are in right now, we 
<br/>will all be climbing for coconut trees given what happened around that side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that I would just like to do, just from my Ministry to add to the findings of 
<br/>the Report. Some of the data that they collected, just in terms of the assistance that was given during 
<br/>COVID-19.  We all agree in Parliament, despite our political views that the assistance given to the 
<br/>various sectors was worthy and appropriate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the MSME Assistance that I am referring to, it was quite substantial.  The funding 
<br/>approved was about $48 million altogether.  A lot of that went to businesses, of course, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, and interestingly this is good for the honourable Minister for Women, 54 percent of the recipients 
<br/>were men and 46 percent were women-led businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The assistance that came at that time was quite appropriate, a lot of people had lost their jobs 
<br/></span><span>and so this assistance was very welcomed.  We acknowledge the work of the Government in actually 
<br/></span><span>providing that assistance.  I am told that in carrying out that provisioning of that assistance, it was a 
<br/>multi-sectoral  approach.    We  had  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Fiji  Institute  of  Accountants  that 
<br/>assisted in  terms  of assessing of the loans, Women in  Business, Fiji  Chamber of Commerce, Fiji 
<br/>Commerce &amp; Employers Federation (FCEF), Reserve Bank of Fiji and the Fiji Revenue and Customs 
<br/>Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the entities had actually supported the initiatives and I just thought I would share 
<br/>that here and just to place on record the gratitude to those that assisted in giving up their free time in 
<br/>weekends to actually ensure that these loans were processed and that the people that needed loans 
<br/>got loans at the appropriate time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I would like to acknowledge the people in the Ministry of Trade and Commerce as well 
<br/>like the other Minister said, they actually also had to spend the long hours in the office processing all 
<br/>the business permits and licenses that had to come out during that hard time.  Some of them actually 
<br/>resigned after the crisis was over because they were just so exhausted from all the work they had to 
<br/>do at that time.  We acknowledge them as well on this side of Parliament and thank them for their 
<br/>service to their country.  I think we all agree that it is indeed appreciated in terms of everything that 
<br/>the civil servants of this country did in a very trying time.  With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I would like to support the motion before Parliament and thank everyone for their contributions today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  give  the  floor  to  the  honourable  Chairperson  of  Public  Accounts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee for his reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members who contributed to the 
<br/>debate this afternoon. From the responses today especially from the ministries concerned, there have 
<br/>been  improvements  in  the  internal  control  and  governance  and  that  is  a  favourable  sign  for  us. 
<br/>However, I wish to comment on the question about the wrong timing of the audit by the Office of the 
<br/></span><span>Auditor-General or a need for a further review after the programmes are fully expanded.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will add here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this audit is a compliance or a performance audit which 
<br/>is needed to be carried out on this programme.  It is necessary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the process of a 
<br/>programme or a crisis such as this.  It will make every stakeholder to be on their toes whether in the 
<br/>beginning, middle or in the end.  It is shown in this instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost all Ministries 
<br/>were reviewed and they improved their processes and put in place SOPs in preparation for any future
