<h3>REVIEW REPORT OF THE OFFICE OF THEAUDITOR-GENERAL’S 2021 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW REPORT OF THE OFFICE OF THE  
<br/>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  review  Report  of  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2021 Annual Report which was tabled on 1</span><span>st</span><span> September, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament.  As the Chairperson 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to move the motion, I take this opportunity to speak 
<br/>on the motion, on the review of the 2021 Annual Report of the Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  OAG  is  established  under  Section  151  of  the  Constitution  of  the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji and the Audit Act of 1969 further specifies the powers of the Auditor-General to 
<br/>audit the Whole of Government financial statements and reports of all entities of government.  It also 
<br/>empowers  the  Auditor-General  to  conduct  Performance  Audit  of  government  entities  to  ensure 
<br/>Parliament  that  the  entities  achieve  their  objective  effectively  and  doing  so  economically  and  in 
<br/>compliance with all relevant legislations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  OAG  is  responsible,  on  behalf  of  Parliament  to  audit  accounts  of  all  government 
<br/>agencies,  state-  owned  entities,  statutory  authorities,  municipal  councils  and  provincial  councils 
<br/>except for its own office and those entities that may be exempted by law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG carried out the audit in accordance with the relevant provisions on auditing issued 
<br/>by the Fiji Institute of Accountants or other relevant standards considered appropriate.  Moreover, 
<br/>Section 152 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji states and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“At  least  once  in  every  year,  the  Auditor-General  shall  inspect,  audit  and  report  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a) the public accounts of the State; 
<br/>(b) the control of public money and public property of the State; and 
<br/>(c) all transactions with or concerning the public money or public property of the State.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2021 Annual Report was compiled in the height of COVID-19 pandemic 
<br/>and its review was carried out by the Members of the previous Public Accounts Committee.  Like 
<br/>any other office, the OAG was not spared from the pandemic.  As highlighted in the Report, there 
<br/>were few setbacks faced but it is encouraging to note that despite the setbacks, the office continued 
<br/>to carry out several audits, reaffirming their commitment to promoting public sector accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee in its review highlighted some of the notable findings which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stakeholders’  engagement  –  in  the  OAG’s  plan  to  improve  interaction  with  the 
<br/>stakeholders,  the  office  initiated  a  nationwide  essay  and  drawing  competition  targeting 
<br/>primary and secondary school students which received a lot of responses.  In addition to 
<br/>this,  there  was  also  a  workshop  planned  by  the  office  and  UNDP  which  targeted  civil 
<br/>society  organisations.    However,  it  was  postponed  due  to  the  pandemic.  Sir,  these 
<br/>engagements were intended to inform stakeholders on the roles, responsibilities and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expectations of the OAG and obtained feedback from stakeholders on the work of OAG 
<br/>and their expectations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  April  2021,  the  office  automated  audit  software  called  TeamMate,  the  accounting 
<br/>software Navision and Payroll Software and Pay Global were affected due to a significance 
<br/>cyber security incident which affected the Government’s ITC services, both of which were 
<br/>fully restored a month later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of improving audit conduct for Municipal Councils, Provincial Councils, Whole 
<br/>of Government, Government Commercial Companies, Commercial Statutory Authorities 
<br/>and other entities whose audited reports are delayed to be tabled in public.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the OAG continues to strive and improve the timeliness of reporting of the outcomes 
<br/>of audits to Parliament.  In April 2021, OAG issued a revised reporting guideline to clients 
<br/>with an inclusion of changes which the OAG hopes will impact the timeliness of audit and 
<br/>the reporting of audit outcomes to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section  7A(1)  of  the  Audit  Act  of  1969  empowers  the  Auditor-General  that  it  may  by 
<br/>contract  authorise  a  person  to  conduct  audit  or  special  investigation  on  behalf  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General.    The  basis  to  outsource  audits  arise  from  updating  of  backlog  audits, 
<br/>resource constraints in terms of shortfall in annual man hours, unplanned audit request as 
<br/>well as requirement of expertise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though the office was affected by COVID-19 implications, it continues to carry out 
<br/>its work both virtually and in office.  In 2021, the Office of the Auditor-General issued 70 
<br/>audit  opinions  as  compared  to  150  during  the  year  2020.    There  were  40  modified  or 
<br/>qualified audit opinions compared to 115 during 2020.  Reports to Parliament, there were 
<br/>16 reports tabled in Parliament, same number in 2020 which includes Performance and 
<br/>Compliance  Audit  reports.    There  were  six  completed.    There  was  also  a  special 
<br/>investigation on Housing Authority on Lots Allotment and Awarding of Tender for the 
<br/>various subdivisions since 2010.  In financial audits, 293 was planned for the year but only 
<br/>164 draft financial statements were received, out of which 94 was from the backlog and 
<br/>some from 2020 and beyond relating to provincial councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 14 audit reports were issued with 42 draft management letters for comments 
<br/>in the 2021 year.  The relationship with Parliament as well as PAC is satisfactory as depicted by the 
<br/>2021 PAC Survey Result.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Engagement with clients and other stakeholders through the entry and exit bi-annual survey 
<br/>showed that Office of the Auditor-General is being independent and adds value to their organisations 
<br/>through the audit.  They utilised $4.7 million in 2021compared to $5.05 million budgeted for them.  
<br/>They have 258,000 debtors, however we noted that fee payments of around $134,679 was made by 
<br/>the iTaukei Affairs Board for the auditing of the 42 financial statements for the 14 provincial councils 
<br/>for the years 2008 to 2010. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In professional development, this is a major initiative for the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/></span><span>due  to  manpower  demand  and  also  work  demand  on  the  areas  of  audit  and  will  continue  for  81 
<br/></span><span>technical staff, 5 executives and 16 support officers.  All in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the office has moved 
<br/>up several  knots to  where it was five years ago and the output was notable with  the reduction in 
<br/>backlog, with the leadership of Mr. Ajay Nand, the former Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  given  the  findings,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  Office  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General partners with the ministries, heads, provincial councils and municipal councils in 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>providing training for their staff to prepare and submit quality staff, annual financial statements for 
<br/>audit in a timely manner as set out by the office.  That a proper training plan be developed to be in 
<br/>line  with  the  audit  training  needs  of  the  staff  so  that  they  are  able  to  better  and  improve  their 
<br/>performance and productivity.  The Office of the Auditor-General should conduct comprehensive 
<br/>exit meetings all the time to allow ministries and departments to rectify pertinent issues before tabling 
<br/>or forwarding a report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  fourth  recommendation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  to  address  cyber  security  issues  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Office to invest in technology by developing data recovery and business continuity plans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to take this time to thank the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General for the outstanding work they are doing in terms of highlighting issues and promoting public 
<br/>sector accountability.  With those words, as the Member moving the motion, I thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now  open  for  debate  on  the  motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I offer the floor, I have in front of me a list provided by both Whips of the list of speakers:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J.N. Nand; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.A. Maharaj;  and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise contribute to the debate on the Review of the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General 2021 Annual Report.  The Committee noted that pursuant to Section 
<br/>152 of the Fijian Constitution, the primary role of the Office of the Auditor-General is to inspect, 
<br/>audit and report to Parliament on the public accounts of the State, the control of the public property 
<br/>of the State and all transactions with or concerning public or public property of the State.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee requests the Office of the Auditor-General to take note of 
<br/>the  recommendations  and  implement  accordingly.    Recommendations  such  as  the  Office  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General to partner with the line ministries, permanent secretaries, provincial councils and 
<br/>municipal  councils  with  regards  to  training  of  the  staff  and  submit  quality  draft  annual  financial 
<br/>statements of audit in a timely manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next recommendation is providing proper training to the staff to better their performance 
<br/>and  productivity  and  also  conducting  a  comprehensive  exit  meeting  to  allow  ministries  and 
<br/>departments to rectify pertinent audit issues before tabling of the report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee notes the Office of the Auditor-General’s commitment to 
<br/>the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), SDG target 16.6 which is to develop accountable and 
<br/>transparent  institutions  at  all  levels.  In  this  regard,  the  Committee  noted  that  whatever  questions 
<br/>raised by the Office of the Auditor-General in terms of utilisation and management of Government 
<br/>expenses, it was always responded in line with SDG target 16.6.    Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is my short 
<br/>contribution and I fully support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion for debate that 
<br/>is before Parliament.  The Ministry of Housing and Local Government acknowledges the very good 
<br/>recommendations by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on the Review of the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General 2021 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendations by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts are  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>     Review Report – OAG 2021 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>851 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very important and critical for improvement in the quality of draft annual financial statements.  I also 
<br/>commend  the  work  of  the  Auditor-General  because  he  always  ensured  that  all  ministries, 
<br/>departments,  authorities  and  local  authorities  maintain  transparency,  accountability  and  good 
<br/>governance at all levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  training  is  therefore  important  or  critical  to  enhance  the 
<br/>performance and productivity of relevant staff.  One of the recommendations that the Ministry of 
<br/>Local Government concurs with the Committee for the Ministry to partner with Municipal Councils 
<br/>to train the staff on the preparation and submission of quality draft annual financial statements for 
<br/>audit.  I think we must not see the Office of the Auditor-General as a partner, I think it is a catalyst. 
<br/>A catalyst that will ensure that the preparation of draft annual statements is done in the most efficient 
<br/>and most effective manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The collaboration between the Office of the Auditor-General and the Council or any Ministry 
<br/>and Department for that matter will allow staff of the Council or any Ministerial staff to understand 
<br/>the specific requirements of the financial statements and the significance of submitting the Annual 
<br/>Financial Statements and the Annual Reports in a timely manner.  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>officers  will  also  have  a  better  understanding  of  the  legislative  requirements  as  well  as  the 
<br/>fundamental requirements of the Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Municipal Council, it is indeed a very sad situation because some 
<br/>of the Councils are very far behind in their submission of Annual Reports. There has been a culture 
<br/>of complacency and lack of accountability.  But the Ministry is now having further discussions with 
<br/>the Administrators as well as CEOs on how best the Councils will be able to fast track some of the 
<br/>outstanding  financial  statements  that  have  to  be  submitted  and  completed  by  the  respective 
<br/>municipalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, we are trying to organise a forum where we encourage all the CEOs and 
<br/>one fundamental issue  that  is  going  to  be discussed is  for them to  ensure that they look  after the 
<br/>operational  affairs  of  the  Councils.  It  is  paramount  that  they  ensure  that  the  financial  reports  are 
<br/>prepared in order for the Office of the Auditor-General to audit the respective reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 
<br/>recommendation of the Office of Auditor-General to partner with the Municipal Councils to develop 
<br/>training, I think that is very important which will assist the Ministry and the Municipal Councils to 
<br/>coach staff and the timely preparation and submission of quality draft Annual Financial Statements 
<br/>for audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  accepts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Ministry’s monitoring role is a fully fledged internal audit 
<br/>team, something that the Ministry lacks at the moment, that is, to audit Councils.  They will establish 
<br/>a new financial year and it is in our hope that that is going to assist the Councils so that the timely 
<br/>preparation of financial statements and the statements are ready for audit by OAG.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry not to be hesitant to enhance policies and set specific KPIs for Councils, CEOs 
<br/>and Special  Administrators in  the preparation and submission  of financials.   Needless  to  say, the 
<br/></span><span>importance of the preparation of the Council’s Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another very important issue is the importance of having exit meeting.  Whenever the OAG 
<br/>completes its audit, it is always important that they discuss some of the audit issues that are raised by 
<br/>their team with the respective Councils, so the Councils are going to take all these issues on board 
<br/>before they present their report to PAC.  I think this is very important because it is also going to assist 
<br/>the Councils in addressing the core issues that are raised by OAG, otherwise if these issues are not

<div><span>    Review Report – OAG 2021 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>addressed then there will be recurring issues and will continue to be reported by the OAG.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the recommendations by the Standing Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, before I actually start, I would just like to inform  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Public Works,  definitely his thought is independent and our thoughts are 
<br/>independent as well.  So, we do not think the way his thinking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as background, these were our Reports. We were chairing the Committee then, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is why we are talking in favour of this Report because we know the importance of it.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, under the Constitution, the OAG is a Constitutional Office. It is independent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and we need to give the Office the independence and the support it deserves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Really? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  OAG  and  PAC  at  least  under  my  term  as  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chairperson had come together and started working very closely.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  alluded  to  yesterday,  we  used  to  have  meetings  in  the  OAG  whereby  following  that 
<br/>meeting, we actually allowed OAG to come and sit on the side of PAC whenever we used to conduct 
<br/>a public submission.  This actually gave a lot of opportunities to OAG to pinpoint issues that they 
<br/>used to face with Ministries.  One thing we saw, by doing so, most of the issues were actually resolved 
<br/>at the Committee stage itself because if any entity came before PAC and tried to lie, OAG was there 
<br/>to rectify there and then on that what is happening on the ground and what is actually been said before 
<br/>PAC.  I thank the new Committee as well, Mr. Speaker. Recently we visited the new office of the 
<br/>OAG in Vatuwaqa and we again went through the same session that we did four years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank OAG and the Acting Auditor-General in accommodating the PAC and 
<br/>presenting to us the way the audits are carried out and basically what were some of the audits they 
<br/>conducted in terms of ministries and other relevant agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Supreme  Audit  Institute  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  governance, 
<br/>accountability  and  transparency  in  the  Government.    As  such  the  OAG  is  expected  to  promote 
<br/>transparency and accountability through good governance of its own affairs in an ethical manner and 
<br/>within the ambit of law in order to fulfil its mandate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while we are talking about ethical audits, one thing that we were told during our 
<br/>meeting with OAG that the OAG has developed their own mechanism of having an internal audit 
<br/>team. So, basically in audit language they would actually call a auditor auditing the auditors. So, they 
<br/>have an internal audit team which ensures that the process that is followed to carry out audits for all 
<br/>the Ministries and other agencies is done up to par as required by Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) 
<br/>and Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI) expectation. To assist in this crucial 
<br/>role, it is important that the OAG leads by example and be are good model organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN Resolution acknowledges the role of Supreme Audit  Institute in 
<br/></span><span>forensic  Government  accountability  for  the  use  of  resources  and  performance  in  achieving 
<br/>Sustainable  Development  Goal  16.    To  promote  peaceful  and  inclusive  societies  for  sustainable 
<br/>development, provide access to justice for all, build effective accountable and inclusive institutions 
<br/>at all levels.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Auditor- General plays a critical role in ensuring 
<br/>efficient and transparent use of resources and achievement of SDG target 16.6, which is to develop  
<br/>effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>     Review Report – OAG 2021 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>853 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, the Committee noted that whatever question was raised by the auditor in terms 
<br/>of the utilisation and management of Government expenses, is related to the achievement of SDG 
<br/>target  16.6.    Through  the  execution  of  its  mandate,  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  promotes 
<br/>efficient, accountable, effective and transparent public administration and governance in achieving 
<br/>nationally and internationally agreed development plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SAI can also be considered as an oversight mechanism under the review and monitoring 
<br/>framework as evident in its inclusion in the National Development Plan 2017.  For your information, 
<br/>Sir,  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  now  prepares  its  annual  financial  statements  using 
<br/>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for small and medium-sized entities as required 
<br/>by the financial reporting framework.  It is important to note that the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>is funded through an annual one-line appropriation by Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this actually brings to an important point that was raised while we were at 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General and held discussions with regards to the virement of funds and 
<br/>approval by the Auditor-General.  One of the things as mentioned by the Chairman is the backlog.  
<br/>While having discussions, there is a fund provided to the Office of the Auditor-General, whereby 
<br/>they actually outsource the audits.  But the problem there is, whenever they go to institutions that 
<br/>carry out the audit, as soon as they get to know if there is a backlog, they are not interested in carrying 
<br/>out this backlog.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What the Office of the Auditor-General would suggest, if that money can be vired to have 
<br/>project staff rather than outsourcing this audit to auditors which are very expensive, time consuming 
<br/>and they are not interested if we are giving them a backlog of two years or three years.  So, if the 
<br/>honourable Minister of  Finance during his  reply can enlighten Parliament  if this virement can be 
<br/>done by the Office of the Auditor-General whereby, almost $1.2 million is allocated to the Office of 
<br/>the Auditor- General to have project staff rather than using that fund just to outsource auditing to 
<br/>other firms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, this enables the Office of the Auditor-General to fulfil its audit mandate on 
<br/>public sector entities and this includes financial audit, performance audit and special investigation.  
<br/>In r the 2021 financial year, the budget appropriation stood at $5.04 million compared to $5.6 million 
<br/>in  2020.    It  was  noted  that  only  93  percent  of  their  budget  was  utilised  due  to  COVID-19.    The 
<br/>Committee, after carrying out a thorough review on the Office of the Auditor-General, 2021 Annual 
<br/>Report, came up with few recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/></span><span>The  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  partners  with  line  Ministries,  Heads  (Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries), Provincial Councils and Municipal Councils to train their staff to prepare and 
<br/>submit quality draft annual financials.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This will prevent the backlog and going back and forth within the Ministries and the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General.  Recently, we were again informed that they have actually started conducting 
<br/>trainings for relevant agencies and Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/></span><span>That a proper training plan be developed to be in line with the auditing training needs of the staff, 
<br/>so they are able to better improve their performance and productivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we were discussing about COVID-19 related schemes this morning, I think I brought this 
<br/>up.  These people cannot get expertise, if you are getting an accountant to carry out an audit.  So 
<br/>proper training needs to be conducted for the staff of the Office of the Auditor-General so that

<div><span>    Review Report – OAG 2021 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are well versed in the sector they are going conduct the audit; and   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/></span><span>The Office of the Auditor-General to conduct comprehensive exit meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> We have been reliably informed that the current Acting Auditor- General is ensuring that he 
<br/>is part of the exit meeting to ensure that all the issues raised during the audit can be resolved 
<br/>at the exit meeting before the report is tabled to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I commend the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.  B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be brief.  The honourable 
<br/>Members who have spoken before me, have highlighted very clearly the importance of the Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General, which is an independent institution that provides external oversight on financial 
<br/>management  and  good  governance.    In  any  democracy,  in  any  Parliament,  the  importance  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General’s Report and the importance of the role of the Public Accounts Committee cannot 
<br/>be underestimated in terms of ensuring that there is accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a government, we should always be mindful and we on this side of Parliament, as a new 
<br/>Government,  we  want  to  ensure  that  every  dollar  that  comes  into  the  coffers  of  Government  is 
<br/>accounted for, there is value for money and that we should try and put all our effort in ensuring that 
<br/>it is not wasted, it is prioritised and that the people eventually benefit from it.  I am, of course, not 
<br/>saying that pilferage, wastage and mismanagement can never happen, and that is why it is important 
<br/>that the Office of the Auditor-General is well resourced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General’s Office gives that framework and provides an opportunity not only for 
<br/>those who manage funds, but also those who want accountability to actually work together.  The 
<br/>Auditor-General’s Report, whenever it comes out, does provide a sudden degree of excitement and 
<br/>scrutiny and therefore it is a constitutional body.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other day, Mr. Speaker, I heard the honourable Viliame Naupoto giving an End of Week 
<br/>Statement and he talked about institutional integrity.  In fact, I agree with him whole heartedly with 
<br/>whatever he said.  We always have to remember history.  I know honourable Usamate was talking 
<br/>about hypocrisy, but when I hear them talk about institutional integrity, talk about what happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we, sitting in the Opposition, were contemplating - we were actually learning not what 
<br/>they were doing right, but learning what they were doing wrong.  So, I feel that it is always good 
<br/>when you sit in the Opposition and come into Government, you actually understand and learn and 
<br/>that  is  why  we  always  talked  about  the  importance  of  the  role  of  the  Opposition.    I  hope  the 
<br/>honourable  Members  on  the  other  side  and  those  new  honourable  Members  would  learn  and 
<br/>understand  the  importance  of  what  they  say  from  the  other  side  with  respect  to  Government 
<br/>accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the OAG came under attack in this Parliament by the previous government, a massive 
<br/>attack  not  just  a  side  jab,  a  massive  attack  and  governments  never  do  that,  governments  have  a 
<br/></span><span>process. When you start attacking an independent institution in Parliament then Mr. Speaker, Sir, you 
<br/></span><span>reduce the importance of that institution, and they did this.  So, I wanted to just remind honourable 
<br/>Naupoto  that  next  time  when  he  talks  about  institutional  integrity,  he  should  remember  what  his 
<br/>colleagues  on the other side did.   So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a lot more than I can say about 
<br/>wastage,  about  not  following  this  Financial  Management  Act,  not  following  Procurement 
<br/></span><span>Regulations and you Mr. Speaker, Sir, know very well we were raising some of these issues with 
<br/></span><span>evidence in Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know the honourable Leader of the Opposition,  I was actually quite amazed that he was 
<br/>attacking  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  attending  the  Least  Developed  Countries  conference 
<br/>organised by the UN at their invitation.  I thought that he should have been thanking Fiji and thanking 
<br/>the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for making high level… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is half-past six 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are talking about a report and as usual the honourable Deputy Prime Minister is becoming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>irrelevant.  He needs to focus on the topic, Sir. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order on?
