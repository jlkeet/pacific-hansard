<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Legislative Programme - 2022-2023 Session of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a privilege for me  to share with this august 
<br/>Parliament  the  Legislative  Programme  for  the  Year  2022-2023  session  of  Parliament  that  will  be 
<br/>implemented by the Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Parliament as the legislative arm of the State has the constitutional authority 
<br/>to formulate and introduce legislation pursuant to   Section 46 of the Constitution of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji.  Section 47 of the Constitution goes on to state how these legislative powers are exercised in 
<br/>terms of introduction, deliberation, amendments and enactment of Bills.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>689 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Bills that have completed the consultation process or are a matter of urgency 
<br/>and  of  public  interest  are  brought  to  Parliament  upon  approval  of  Cabinet.    An  additional  factor 
<br/>crucial to this process, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the need for extensive and meaningful consultations on 
<br/>proposed changes to the law or introduction of new laws with people including rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government  is  committed  to  incorporating  a  consultative  approach  to  key 
<br/>decisions that affects the people of Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, key decisions reached will be based on 
<br/>consensus, relevance and national interest.  We will listen to the people and work with all identifiable 
<br/>stakeholders across the sectors and sections of the communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  Legislative  Programme  for  Year  2022-2023,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government  is  determined  to  review  and  repeal  the  laws  that  supress  basic  human  rights,  media 
<br/>freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of association, individual and group rights, the rule of law 
<br/>and freedom of speech will be sincerely adhered to so that sustainable solutions can be developed to 
<br/>benefit  society.    We  are  confident  that  freedom  of  speech  and  freedom  of  association  will 
<br/>inadequately promote participatory and inclusive policy making initiatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have already begun to, as the proverbial saying goes, “put our money 
<br/>where our mouth is”, we do not simply harp about what we do but we action and honor our words. 
<br/>To demonstrate this on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> March of this year, we conducted a public consultation on a proposed 
<br/>Bill to replace the controversial Media Industry Development Act 2010 formerly known as MIDA.  
<br/>The consultation was successful held at Level 9, Suvavou House and saw over 50 members of the 
<br/>media and academia in attendance who sought to strengthen the freedom of press and the people’s 
<br/>right to information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also the Government’s priority to review and repeal  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> related 
<br/>laws that marginalize </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> rights.  Consultations have been initiated in the reinstatement of the 
<br/>Great  Council  of  Chiefs  to  facilitate  the  voices  and  intent  of  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  traditional  leaders  and 
<br/>administrators.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet Ministers and also members of the other side are aware, 
<br/>proper consultations with he Land Owning Units (LOUs) were not consulted in a proper manner in 
<br/>2021  and  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  (Budget  Amendment)  Act  2021  was  rushed  through  during  the 
<br/>Parliamentary process. Those who were most affected by Act No. 22 of 2021 were the landowners 
<br/>who allowed the facilitation of the processing of mortgages, charges, caveats and pledges without 
<br/>the consent of the iTaukei Land Trust Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, under section 11(1) of the iTaukei Affairs Act 1944 in relation to the provision on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Procedure with respect to Bills affecting Fijian affairs,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When any Bill to be introduced in Parliament which appears to the Minister to affect in any 
<br/>important matter the rights and interest of the Fijians, and especially any Bill imposing taxes 
<br/>to be paid by them or relating to their chiefs, local authorities or land, it shall be first referred 
<br/>to the Board for consideration…”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was not conducted in 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  I mentioned earlier, this Government is committed to incorporating a 
<br/>consultative approach to key decisions that affect the people of Fiji, particularly in consulting the 
<br/>people  and  relevant  stakeholders  on  the  review  of  any  legislation.  Relevant  laws  related  to  the 
<br/>administration of the iTaukei institutions are currently being considered to improve their respective 
<br/>mandates under the law efficiently and effectively. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In particular, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has already begun preparatory work in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultation of the re-establishment of the GCC which is traditionally of the apex of the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>.  A 
<br/>team has been set up to take a holistic approach towards the reestablishment of the GCC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is also looking into finalising the regulation 
<br/>of intellectual property rights for indigenous communities which have been on the agenda in ongoing 
<br/>consultations between the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and the iTaukei communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is also looking at reviewing legislations on iTaukei, namely, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei Lands Act 1905;  
<br/>iTaukei Lands Trust Act 1940; 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs Act 1944; 
<br/>iTaukei Development Fund 1965; 
<br/>iTaukei Trust Fund 2004; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010; 
<br/>(7)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Natadola Bay Development Act 2010; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Momi Bay Development Act 2010; 
<br/>(9)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Regulation of Surfing Areas Act 2010; 
<br/>(10)</span><span> </span><span>Denarau (Nadi River) Development Act 2011; 
<br/>(11)</span><span> </span><span>Land Use Act 2010; and  
<br/>(12)</span><span> </span><span>State Land Act 1945. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further, Mr. Speaker Sir, as the matter of fact, we have delivered our promise to increase the 
<br/>retirement age to 60 years from 55 years by amending the Civil Service (General) Regulation 1999 
<br/>and work is  currently underway to  execute the removal of  short-term contracts  for civil  servants.  
<br/>Moreover, the reinstatement of the Ratu Sukuna Day and the inclusion of the Girmit Day as public 
<br/>holidays have been effected and published in the Gazette. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, relevant amendments have also been made to the Health and Safety at Work, 
<br/>commonly known as the General Workplace Conditions Regulations 2003 or what is called the “No 
<br/>Jab, No Job” Policy.  What this means, Sir, is that the requirement to be vaccinated is now no longer 
<br/>a requirement for a person to apply for a job in the civil service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government will continue its efforts to end violence against women 
<br/>and girls and promote women’s economic empowerment. The Coalition Government, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  is  determined  to  ensure  the  needs  and  interests  of  women  and  girls  will  be  reflected  in  the 
<br/>legislation, policies and the National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government will also look at reviewing the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration 
<br/>Act 1975 and related laws to revert the use of the name in the birth certificate which greatly affected 
<br/>married women and spouses who want to use their spouse’s name instead of their maiden name to 
<br/>vote, for example, or when applying for a passport or a driver’s licence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, preparatory work is underway with the Ministry of Local Government for 
<br/></span><span>elections of Municipal Councils. Further, work is also underway to align the retirement age of Civil 
<br/></span><span>Service and the Municipal Councils.  The Local Government Act 1972 is under review to increase 
<br/>the retirement age from 55 years to 60 years.  We intend to introduce an Amendment Bill at the June 
<br/>Sitting of Parliament.

<div><span>Work is also underway to replace the Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Scheme and National 
<br/>Toppers Scholarship with full scholarships with bond conditions, as mentioned by the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance in Parliament last week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is also looking to soon initiate public consultations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the following reviews: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultation  process  from  better  and  effective  outcomes.  We  will  ensure,  Sir,  that  draft  laws  are 
<br/>deliberated in consultation with relevant stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In doing so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government will build on the confidence and trust with 
<br/>businesses, investors and the wider community with regards to future policy and legislative initiatives 
<br/>and incentives in order to strengthen our institutions and legal framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In saying that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that we have already begun to walk the talk as we 
<br/>are actively making efforts to ensure that the views of all members of our communities are heard.  
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  or  his  designate,  for  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Attorney-General for his brief 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statement on articulating the legislative programme for 2022-2023 Session of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to give everyone a bit of background and suggest in case everyone has 
<br/>forgotten, with  respect.  This  particular book  - our Constitution, emanates from  what  was done in 
<br/>2007.  This was actually a consultation exercise that came out of the Peoples Charter for Change, 
<br/>Peace and Progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Show respect! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, they asked us to be respectful, may be you ought to, too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  I  did  not  utter  a  word  whilst  the  honourable  Attorney-General  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speaking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular Charter entailed a lot things, Sir, but I just wanted to spell out something so 
<br/>that the people of Fiji know and may be just a reminder to the other side, that the outreach activities 
<br/>with  respect  to  the  National  Council  for  Building  a  Better  Fiji  and  the  consultations  that  were 
<br/>undertaken throughout the country, the coverage was all the urban centres and about a thousand odd 
<br/>villages and settlements across the nation which came up with our Constitution, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  only  have  five  minutes,  but  I  just  wanted  to  specifically  refer  to  two  things  that  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General spoke about.  He spoke about the suppression of freedom, specifically, 
<br/>the Freedom of Speech and 
<br/>Freedom of Association. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all freedoms are covered under the Bill of Rights in this particular book.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 6 right through to Section 45 that is 39 …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was 73.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- May be he likes the sound of his own voice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>693 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir. Section 6 right through to Section 45 covers every single 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>freedom that you can actually think about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two that he basically referred to was the Freedom of Association and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also Freedom of Expression, and I think he said some issues about the Media Industry Development 
<br/>Authority (MIDA).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to Freedom of Association, Section 19(1) reads, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Every person has the right to freedom of association.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that covers the whole lot.  It is guaranteed in here.  If you have issue with respect 
<br/>to freedom of association, there are even provisions in this book that allows you to go to court to take 
<br/>it up.  How is that not guaranteed? The same applies to freedom of expression.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, he says that he is going to repeal laws widely held as supressing basic freedom, 
<br/>they have not ever been any suppression under this blue book.  There has not been. It is a story that 
<br/>they make up which follows their narrative, “Oh, freedom!”.  Freedom from what?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Freedom from you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am a lawyer.  I read it better than you do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me get  specific. Within this Constitution there is a thing that dictates the 
<br/>separation of powers.  Just on 1</span><span>st</span><span> of April, the honourable Attorney-General himself would seem has 
<br/>overstepped the mark. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE- Very poor, very poor!. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, he sent a personnel staff officer to inform a Judicial Officer 
<br/>of his decision to say, “Pay a sum of $1,500 as restitution on behalf of the accused person.”  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that is crossing the line! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor, very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, there is a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very clear to us that we are talking 
<br/>about the legislative agenda of the country. He is now bringing in issues that have nothing to do with 
<br/>the legislative agenda of this country.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, stick to what is on the paper. Very simple! He is a lawyer and lawyers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>understand simplicity, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am a lawyer, I understand it, and that is why I am raising it because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is a purported breach of the Constitution, Sir.

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Attorney-General is the Chief Legal Advisor to Government…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- …and not to the general public.  Mr. Speaker, he needs to understand 
<br/>now  that  he  is  Attorney-General,  that  he  must  act  as  such.    You  have  a  role  to  play,  even  in  the 
<br/>selection of Judicial Officers.  You must not intervene or make representations in a personal capacity 
<br/>in such matters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- , Mr. Speaker, can be seen as the Executive interfering with the Judicial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- A Point of Order, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I know the second bell has rung. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order, honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Standing Order 60 is on relevance.  We are 
<br/>now becoming irrelevant.  I know they are trying to be relevant but, unfortunately, they are getting 
<br/>very irrelevant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are you rounding off, honourable Member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, I have a great deal of respect for the honourable Minister for Trade.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do not demean yourself, please.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In short, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to basically finish off, so let me put this question to you, 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General,  on  equality.    Every  religion  in  Fiji  preaches  equality.    No 
<br/>discrimination on the basis of race, colour, creed, anything, Sir. All are guaranteed under this blue 
<br/>book.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you are talking about a programme that you are going to understand with respect to review 
<br/>of the legislation, we did that too.  I respect you for it, that is fine. There are a lot of archaic laws that 
<br/>we  need  to  undertake,  that  is  fine.    But  when  you  are  talking  about  suppression  of  freedom, 
<br/>suppression of any freedom at the end of the day, I think you are actually 100 percent wrong.  Equality 
<br/>for all means no discrimination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I think what needs to be said, finally, is in the Preamble of this Constitution, we 
<br/>recognised everyone, including the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, the Rotuman and our Banaban people. We recognised 
<br/>that this is the supreme law of the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Republic of Fiji is a sovereign democratic republic founded on 
<br/></span><span>the values of common and equal citizenry and national unity. Those words ‘equal citizenry’ should 
<br/></span><span>be tatooed on everyone’s forehead, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what this former Government was all about and that is what our Constitution says, 
<br/>and I hope every single law that they are going to bring through this Parliament bears that at the 
<br/>forefront of its acts and thoughts.

<div><span>Lastly,  Sir,  I  think  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  needs  to  remain  the  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance.  He himself said, “That my Prime Minister said to me that I am the Minister of Finance and 
<br/>I want to know what my obligations are and what my obligations are not”.  This is not, it is his.

<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  may  I  just  remind  you  that  the  tradition  in 
<br/>Parliament is that when honourable Members make their Maiden Speeches, that is only when we 
<br/>allow clapping to be undertaken.  I would like to implore on each and  every one that we kind of 
<br/>respect this Parliament, so no clapping when a Member finishes taking the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water and the Way Forward 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament,  I rise today as the 
<br/>Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services to provide Parliament with an update of water 
<br/>in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I speak Sir, countries around the world are meeting and taking stock of the progress they 
<br/>have made during this UN Decade for Action on Water and Sanitation - the decade from 2018 to 
<br/>2028.  Five years in, globally the focus is on Mid-Term Comprehensive Review of Implementation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a country, Fiji is also working towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal targets for 
<br/>water and sanitation.  As of today, nationally 82 percent of Fijians now have access to water supply.  
<br/>This number is close to 98 percent in urban areas, with more work to be done in providing access to 
<br/>water in rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Access  to  water  supply  is  not  the  same  as  access  to  reliable  24/7  water  supply,  and  I 
<br/>acknowledge that those of you who live in Suva do not have to be reminded of the difference in the 
<br/>two.    I  will  brief  Parliament  on  unique  challenges  of  the  Greater  Suva  area  and  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government’s plan to improve this situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unreliable  water  supply  and  disruptions  not  only  cause  unnecessary  pain  to  thousands  of 
<br/>Fijians, but it also has a significant socio-economic toll, with lost productivity and impact on all key 
<br/>economic sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Greater Suva area is supplied by two main water treatment plants - Tamavua and Waila.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Both these plants draw raw water from the Waimanu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tamavua Water Plant was built in 1961 and the plant has a designed treatment capacity of 60 
<br/>million litres per day. Waila Treatment Plant was built in 1982 and that Plant has a designed treatment 
<br/>capacity of 95 million litres per day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the two Treatment Plants were built, the total population of the greater Suva area was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>less than 100,000.  Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 360,000 people live in the greater Suva area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  greater  Suva  area  population  has  tripled  but  it  is  still  being  served  by  the  same  two 
<br/></span><span>Treatment Plants.  What is important to note is that today, just to meet the demand, Water Authority 
<br/></span><span>of Fiji (WAF) runs these old Plants at 110 percent of their designated capacity.  Despite that, there is 
<br/>still a daily shortage of three million litres between supply and demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have all had our disappointments with WAF.  When the tap runs dry in the morning, we 
<br/>all need someone to blame.  But I respectfully ask Parliament to indulge with me in the daily magic 
<br/>we expect from WAF.

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are relying on WAF to produce 110 percent of designed capacity from 
<br/>the  two  40-year-old  water  Treatment  Plants.    The  Greater  Suva  area  also  has  no  redundancy 
<br/>whatsoever, which means that even with one failed pump, or one faulty switchboard, it brings the 
<br/>entire system to its knees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The WAF pipe network is about 5,000 kilometres and most of it is old and failing.  In March 
<br/>this year alone, WAF had responded to 150 burst mains.  This, when compared to the international 
<br/>benchmark of three burst mains annually for every 100 kilometres of network, is a huge task. What 
<br/>the benchmark tells us is that we have our pipe network in an ideal maintained condition that should 
<br/>be no more than 150 burst mains throughout Fiji every year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, the rate at which new burst mains occur, is greater than WAF’s ability to fix, given 
<br/>its budget and resources.  Sir, the assets are old and need significant intervention.  We cannot continue 
<br/>to bleed at this rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, non-revenue water, in other words, the water that gets lost through leakage is now 
<br/>costing the Authority $23 million annually.  Leakage detection and rectification will be intensified 
<br/>and properly resourced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  WAF  has  inherited  age  old  infrastructure.    I  heard  those  sitting  on  the 
<br/>opposite side talk about this ageing infrastructure many times.  I always give credit to where credit 
<br/>is due.  They were right when they said infrastructure is ageing but what they failed to understand 
<br/>was that ageing infrastructure cannot magically heal itself.  It needs investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government understands that it needs to work with our funding partners to get 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the funds we need to build resilient infrastructure.  That is being actively pursued right now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, those on the opposite side had left the WAF with the task of getting blood out of stone. 
<br/>While they talked about ageing infrastructure, they reduced the WAF’s Capital budget by 53 percent 
<br/>in the last five years, and Repairs and Maintenance budget was also dropped by 59 percent.  This will 
<br/>not be the case with the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are midway into the Decade of  Action on  Water  and Sanitation, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   If 
<br/>access to 24/7 reliable water supply is a challenge, the task of providing access to proper sanitation 
<br/>is even more challenging. As a nation, we have achieved very little on providing access to proper 
<br/>sanitation.  If we continue on the current trajectory, Fiji will not be able to meet the United Nations 
<br/>SDG 6 targets for sanitation by 2030.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presently only 23 percent of our population has access to proper sanitation and the impacts 
<br/>on health and environment is significant.  In our urban areas we do have wastewater collection and 
<br/>treatment, the sewage network is already reaching capacity and wastewater treatment plants reaching 
<br/>the end of their design life.  Whether it is Kinoya Wastewater Treatment Plant in Suva or Navakai in 
<br/>Nadi, we are already at design capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, population growth in the Greater Suva area, as well as rapidly growing Nadi 
<br/></span><span>in  the  West,  requires  urgent  attention  on  wastewater  treatment  plants.  We,  as  a  government, 
<br/></span><span>understands that lack of attention to proper sanitation in rural areas, informal settlements, as well as 
<br/>new urban expansion areas will have a significant impact and needs to be prioritised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Water Ministers of the Pacific met in Nadi in November 2022. Fiji was represented and 
<br/>it stressed the need for urgent action on sanitation.  We will honour this international commitment 
<br/>and will embark upon delivering on this critical area.

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>697 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  cannot  talk  about  water  without  acknowledging  climate  change,  Sir.    Fiji  has  been 
<br/>experiencing  some  major  climatic  events  that  have  either  disrupted  the  provision  of  service  or 
<br/>completely damaged water and wastewater assets. We have had significant floods in the North, and 
<br/>I visited the WAF Team in the North and inspected the damage.  The cost of quick fixtures to respond 
<br/>supplies to Labasa ran into thousands, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, for Fiji, the impacts of climate change are growing and severe every year.  If 
<br/>not addressed significantly, our ability to access clean drinking water to all Fijians will be severely 
<br/>impacted.   Designing and building climate resilient infrastructure is the only way.  Hydrology data 
<br/>also  indicates  more  fluctuations  in  river  stream  flow  at  Savura  and  Waila,  worsened  by  climate 
<br/>change, human activity, silting and soil erosion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the World Bank has done a Climate Vulnerability Assessment Report for Fiji in 2017, 
<br/>the cost to reduce Fiji’s vulnerability to climate change was estimated at US$4.2 billion.  In planning 
<br/>for future water infrastructure, it is critical that vulnerability is addressed.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, WAF was created by our predecessors with the aim of improving water and 
<br/>sanitation.  It would be fair to note that the aim with which the WAF was created is yet to be achieved.  
<br/>A capable and financially viable WAF will be able to deliver its intended aim which is critical for 
<br/>Fiji’s economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In February, I met with the Asian Development Bank Team looking at WAF’s journey from 
<br/>its  inception  to  now.    It  was  their  conclusion  that  the  current  legal,  regulatory  and  institutional 
<br/>framework the way it operates now is inhibiting its ability to deliver water and wastewater services. 
<br/>The issues raised are being re-assessed and will be acted on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The corporatisation of WAF is critical for its ability to access various funding models that are 
<br/>currently  not  available  to  it.  I  should  make  it  clear  that  corporatisation  does  not  impede  the 
<br/>Government’s  ability  to  provide  subsidised  water  and  wastewater  services  where  needed. 
<br/>Incentivising water mitigation measures to expand these measures, is being looked into.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my intent is to provide an update to paint a clear and honest picture about 
<br/>the current state of water in Fiji, and I would like to assure everyone that the Coalition Government 
<br/>will improve on the situation in the four years ahead of us and we will also be looking at long term 
<br/>measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rewa River Water Supply Project will bring online additional 40 million 
<br/>litres  of  water  per  day  into  the  Suva-Nausori  system.    The  project  construction  is  on  track  to  be 
<br/>completed by July this year.  It will be a big boost for the Greater Suva-Nausori area and end the 
<br/>need for intermittent supply in parts of the system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have met the Project Managers and key contractors on site at Viria and impressed upon them 
<br/>that this system must come online in July.  I thank my predecessor, honourable Usamate, for his role 
<br/>in the project and it is my duty as a succeeding Minister to see that it is completed on time.  I am 
<br/>personally monitoring the project progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also need to improve the water supply network redundancy, and we are looking into the 
<br/>emergency works that are required to create some redundancy in the system, allowing WAF to help 
<br/>maintain  critical  assets  without  bringing  the  entire  system  down.    Extra  reservoirs  in  strategic 
<br/>locations are being looked into.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to mitigate the current challenges with water supply in Nadi and Lautoka 
<br/>area, there is an urgent need for additional water storage infrastructure to cope with the increasing 
<br/>demand,  and  we,  as  a  government,  have  initiated  a  scope  review  of  the  proposed  Nadi  Flood 
<br/>Mitigation Project.  We have been advised that a multi-purpose storage would meet flood mitigation, 
<br/>as well as water supply objectives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  we  work  on  short-term  measures,  the  reality  remains  that  our  current  water  supply 
<br/>system  remains  vulnerable,  and  we  need  to  look  at  short  term  measures,  such  as  water  truck 
<br/>operations.  This is an area which we are also looking into.  There have been complaints and they are 
<br/>being currently addressed for better services in these areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to inform Parliament that the Coalition Government has 
<br/>started the development of the Water Sector 2050 Strategy.  This is a long-term plan for the water 
<br/>sector, bringing together all key stakeholders of the economy such as tourism, agriculture, industry 
<br/>regulators, banking and technology, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It will focus on improving customer services and delivery of water services to citizens.  It 
<br/>will prioritise the economics of the provision of water services for supporting national development, 
<br/>through investments in climate-resilient infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the World Water Day, an ideation workshop was held to kick start this Water Sector 
<br/>Strategy  development  and  the  outcome  will  be  a  discussion  paper  for  releasing  at  the  National 
<br/>Economic Summit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will finish by saying that water and sanitation infrastructure requires long 
<br/>term thinking, and it is imperative on the current generation to plan for a better Fiji.  As a nation, for 
<br/>the first time, the Water Sector 2050 Strategy will provide us with a national vision on water, and 
<br/>will ensure that we are not in the same position come 2050.  It can still be utilised by FijiFirst, when 
<br/>it returns to power in 16 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, I note that there is a need for a National Infrastructure Strategy.  This is being 
<br/>pursued with our development partners to complement the Water Sector 2050 Strategy, the associated 
<br/>Financial Strategy and the Infrastructure Strategy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude,  our  attitude  to  water  must  change.    Sir,  it  is  a  precious  commodity,  and  the 
<br/>Government will do what it can, and the public also has a part to play in proactive water conservation 
<br/>measures and mitigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Minister, I am committed to achieving the objectives relating to water, as I have set out 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the next four years.  Let us all work together on Water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea.  When we return, I 
<br/>shall  ask  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  or  his  designate  to  make  their  response  to  the 
<br/>Statement.  The Parliament is adjourned.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to reply to the Ministerial Statement by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Public Works in relation to water.  He has outlined a lot of the things that 
<br/>WAF and the Ministry is looking at and basically a lot of the things that we have been talking about 
<br/>for the past four years, about the plans.  So, it is good now to see that those same plans and expressions 
<br/>have now been expressed by the other side once they have walked into the light and seen the situation 
<br/>as it was.  I only wish that honourable Radrodro was the one making the statement since he used to 
<br/>attack me all the time on those issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strategic development plan was in place.  A lot of these issues were 
<br/>addressed  in  terms  of  the  programmes  that  have  been  set  around  for  all  across  the  water  sector 
<br/>systems in Fiji.  But as I had pointed out in my End of Week Statement on Friday, 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/>and as the Minister has pointed, infrastructure is not something that you can do overnight because 
<br/>you always have the problems of the past and the problems of today, and you have got to manage 
<br/>both and you never have enough money for everything.  So, I am glad to see that that is being worked 
<br/>out, we looked at all the different projects that were established, all kinds of different things were put 
<br/>in place over a five-year period – boundary valve replacements, air valves, reservoir upgrading, new 
<br/>water treatment plant, wastewater and sanitation   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the biggest thing that we have had been able to do is the Rewa River Water Scheme.  
<br/>It has been in place for a long time.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you put in place a water facility, you do 
<br/>it after years of gathering data, so before we put in a water plant, for instance in the south of Taveuni, 
<br/>which is a big issue right now, you have to measure the flow of water in good weather, dry weather 
<br/>before you make the decision to spend millions of dollars on an infrastructure.  I am glad to see that 
<br/>this progress has taken place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of this is the issue of Climate Change, but you will notice with some of the things that 
<br/>the Minister is talking about, some of the solutions are not just in infrastructure.  For instance, the 
<br/>issues that we are having in Waimanu and by the way, the Waimanu River is very important to a lot 
<br/>of people in Parliament. I would just like to mention that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues there, the dirt in the water, the turbidity in the water is not just about water 
<br/>itself, it is  about  agriculture, how we cut  down trees, reef to  ridge, all of  these things have to  be 
<br/>managed holistically.  There are a lot of challenges.  People are now crying for water.  In my house, 
<br/>you come now to my bathroom, I have water stored in pots and whatever to put the water in.  I know 
<br/>it is a major problem.  People are still calling for water carts, there is never enough money for all of 
<br/>these, so it is a great challenge for us.  I wish the honourable Minister well on all the plans that he 
<br/>has put in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government, when it was in place, put in a lot of these processes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The climate vulnerability report, something that we had undertaken.   
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The National Climate Finance Strategy, where we looked at all the things that were to be 
<br/>impact by climate especially the vulnerability of our infrastructure which are located next to 
<br/>the sea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One can see the big problem that we have in Laqere where the major pipes are right in the 
<br/></span><span>middle  of  the  road  as  a  result  of  road  extensions,  and  it  becomes  a  huge  problem  to  move  these

<div><span>infrastructure away from where it is now.  But ultimately in terms of getting resilient infrastructure, 
<br/>this is what we have to do.  I am glad the honourable Minister is not complaining, not like some other 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers who we were talking about the other day. His getting ahead with the job. 
<br/>We need to get the financing.  We need to get the work hand in hand with people who can help us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was glad to see the report that came out of Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility.  Their 
<br/>report was handed out to the Pacific Water and Wastewater Forum that I think one of the last things 
<br/>I chaired as Minister in Denarau which outlined a lot of the problems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A big problem that we have in this Greater Suva area now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the increase 
<br/>in population, it is about 2.5 percent per year.  The inflow of people from the rural areas into this.  
<br/>So, it is going to have an even bigger problem in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government tried to address this initially by making restructure right, getting 
<br/>the systems to make this correct.  We took out the Water and Sewerage Department, we created the 
<br/>Water Authority of Fiji.  It did not mean that automatically everything will be hunky-dory, but over 
<br/>time, good governance, good systems, good ways of managing that process, we will ultimately get 
<br/>to the target of having good clean water for everyone and good sanitation for all our people in this 
<br/>country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  I  wish  the  honourable  Minister  well,  but  we  will  be  constantly  reminding  him  that 
<br/>everything that you are doing now is what we had put in place, and we look forward to the day when 
<br/>you start developing something on your own.

<div><span>Strategic Framework for Sandalwood Research and Development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very good morning to you and to the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>fellow colleagues of Parliament,  ladies and gentlemen listening from the public gallery and members 
<br/>of the public watching the livestream from the comfort of their homes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for the opportunity to deliver this statement on Fiji’s 
<br/>proposed  Sandalwood  Industry  Development  Strategy.  The  Strategy  provides  Fiji’s  plans  for  the 
<br/>development of a forest product which has a lot of history and sentimental value for the people of 
<br/>Fiji.  This Statement unpacks key actions implemented by the Ministry of Forestry, in collaboration 
<br/>efforts with partners in development, resources injected to develop the sandalwood industry and areas 
<br/>that is still needing attention to fully realise optimal returns from the sandalwood industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir sandalwood is not a new commodity in Fiji.  As we all know, sandalwood is 
<br/>the pioneer commodity traded in Fiji, unfortunately it has not been utilised to its full potential.  The 
<br/>history of sandalwood and its current potential and market demand calls for its revitalisation as a 
<br/>forest commodity.  This is the silver lining in the forestry sector apart from pine and mahogany that 
<br/>will propel the sector, benefit the community and supports national economic recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to elaborate on the Ministry’s priorities within the next few years.  
<br/></span><span>Firstly, the Ministry will continue to strengthen its capacity to support (through Government funding) 
<br/></span><span>community-based nurseries to ensure consistent and abundance seed supply for the establishment of 
<br/>new </span><span>yasi</span><span> farms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presently  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  has  also  established  community-based  nurseries  and 
<br/>assisted interested communities across Fiji on sandalwood seed technology and nursery operations.  
<br/>Sandalwood is one of the species supported in the “Thirty Million Tree” Planting Initiative with the

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>701 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aim of increasing local sandalwood resources, for large scale planting that can sustain a sandalwood 
<br/>industry in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, apart from natural sources, it is estimated that there is around 500 hectares 
<br/>of planted sandalwood in Fiji. To this date, there is close to 1,500 recorded sandalwood growers that 
<br/>have planted more than 200,000 sandalwood trees in these 500 hectares. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned in my Maiden Speech, the Coalition Government will ensure 
<br/>survival and growth and not just ticking the box to achieving the targeted number.  Focusing on the 
<br/>number alone was one of the biggest mistakes of the previous  Government.  The </span><span>yasi</span><span> replanting, 
<br/>nursery and seedling supply is also incentivised through the Ministry’s budgetary allocations for this 
<br/>fiscal year and will continue to gain optimum interest from farmers and landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker Sir, in order to reach the optimum levels of utilisation and benefits, 
<br/>we must have a thorough understanding of the value chain, not only the benefits but identify key 
<br/>players and areas of improvement government can assist throughout the supply chain to elevate the 
<br/>status of the commodity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will conduct a comprehensive and integrated value-chain and santol oil analysis 
<br/>to inform the Government of the potential socio-economic benefits, key areas of interest, investment 
<br/>and funding opportunities for the sandalwood industry.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is undeniable that the 
<br/>value of the sandalwood commodity is in its downstream processing and in its value adding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, the Coalition Government through the Forestry Ministry is looking to partner with 
<br/>potential donors, and funding institutions to assist interested commercial saw millers who are keen 
<br/>to expand and grow their operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public-private  partnerships  with  local  and  international  institutions  and  non-governmental 
<br/>organisations;  and  effective  bilateral  partnerships  with  other  countries  who  have  a  comparative 
<br/>advantage on sandalwood will be essential if the sandalwood industry in Fiji is to access international 
<br/>markets with premium rates for niche products processed locally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourthly,  the  Ministry  through  the  Sandalwood  Development  Programme  will  establish  a 
<br/>sandalwood brand recognition and development in the international marketplace based on its natural 
<br/>properties  and  competitiveness.  We  will  be  reaching  out  to  key  agencies  within  Government  to 
<br/>develop this brand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Ministry  takes  note  of  the  need  to  always  strike  a  balance  between 
<br/>production  and  protection.  Government  have  been  supporting  the  sandalwood  development 
<br/>programme since 2011 and have invested a total of $420,000 in the Programme in the last five years, 
<br/>ensuring the inclusive involvement of various key stakeholders including women and young people 
<br/>in the implementation of the project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fifthly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continues to value the importance of scientific research. 
<br/>In our journey to fully realize the optimal value of sandalwood, the Ministry in 2020 collaborated 
<br/></span><span>with  the  Australian  Centre  for  International  Agriculture  Research  (ACIAR)  improving  the 
<br/></span><span>understanding of the breeding biology and genetic diversity of </span><span>santalum yasi</span><span>, the local species.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For any commercial species, enhancing genetic conservation is important. It is not only to 
<br/>preserve the quality but also the cultural integrity of our local species, so it does not become extinct.  
<br/>The  Australian  supported  programme  was  for  developing  strategies  to  enhance  the  quality  and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>availability of </span><span>santalum yasi</span><span> germ-plasm and disseminating practical outcomes and implications of 
<br/>the project objectives to growers and practitioners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sixthly,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Ministry is  also  working  to  improve  the  sandalwood  market 
<br/>system to ensure equitable benefits to our local sandalwood growers. A sandalwood market concept 
<br/>has been developed for the establishment of Sandalwood Growers and Buyers Association and was 
<br/>highlighted in the report titled “</span><span>South Pacific Sandalwood Industry Plan for Fiji and Tonga”</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry have begun consultation with sandalwood growers in the West 
<br/>and will have consultations with growers in the North and Central Eastern Division then finalise the 
<br/>Association Cooperative bylaws before the formation of the Sandalwood Growers Association in the 
<br/>2023-2024 financial year in consultation with appropriate agencies. The Ministry is responsible for 
<br/>all sandalwood growers, it will therefore maintain an internal database, capturing information like 
<br/>the location of sandalwood plantations and seedling suppliers that will be shared with the Association 
<br/>once it is established.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, throughout history, the high demand for sandalwood has resulted in over-
<br/>exploitation, illegal cutting and black-market trade.  This brings me to the seventh strategy, to develop 
<br/>a fit for purpose regulatory framework for the sandalwood industry in Fiji, as it has been done in 
<br/>other nations. So, to sustainably manage and utilise sandalwood, a National Sandalwood Regulations 
<br/>will be developed in collaboration with other government agencies and stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  market  for  sandalwood,  heartwood  and  oils  from  Pacific  Island 
<br/>Countries, including Fiji, remained resilient, with 2019 sales of santalum album oil at US$1,750 to 
<br/>US$2,100 and up to US$2,500 per kilogramme. The average </span><span>santalum</span><span> </span><span>yasi</span><span> supply in recent decades 
<br/>has rarely exceeded 220 million tonnes of heartwood which is no more than about 7 percent to 8 
<br/>percent of the global sandalwood market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will therefore strategically focus its efforts on niche markets since it cannot 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compete with larger countries that have large areas of sandalwood.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is where 
<br/>branding will be vital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is not only looking at short-term goal but as part of the long-
<br/>term plan for sandalwood.  The Ministry for Forestry has been working very closely with sandalwood 
<br/>growers, buyers, investors to promote and revive the sandalwood industry in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sandalwood can only reach industry status if we collectively 
<br/>work together to implement the seven strategies of the Development Framework earlier discussed.  I 
<br/>therefore call on key stakeholders to join hands and make this happen.  Sir, I thank you very much 
<br/>for your indulgence and opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  Ministerial  Statement  this 
<br/></span><span>morning  on  Sandalwood  Research  and  Development  and  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  the 
<br/></span><span>statement.  It is a very wonderful, commodity for Fiji - sandalwood. It is the second most expensive 
<br/>wood oil, I think it is second only to argawood.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was in abundance in Fiji. When they found out about the abundance of sandalwood mainly 
<br/>in the Bua Bay in 1804 and started harvesting it when the Europeans came, it took just a little over a 
<br/>decade for that supply to disappear, it is because sandalwood is very slow growing, and it is quite 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>703 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rare.  I am glad to hear the programme to set a framework so that we can add one more commodity 
<br/>that people can take up and plant for their children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One issue with planting trees in Fiji I found out when I was the Permanent Secretary is that 
<br/>we tend to think that we plant sandalwood for us and it ends up with us harvesting them prematurely, 
<br/>but if we change that attitude and say, “no, we plant this for the future generation”,  then this type of 
<br/>very slow growing but very expensive wood can be harvested when it gets more oil which is a little 
<br/>bit over 20 years. I was just reading that in 2010 they harvested one tree in Lakeba and it was $16,000 
<br/>the value for that tree.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree that whilst we want to make it an industry, it is also quite a very good commodity if 
<br/>we use it as an insurance policy and I used to advertise it that way when I was Permanent Secretary.  
<br/>For example, if you have a child that is born today and then you go out and plant say 10 sandalwood 
<br/>trees so 20 sandalwood trees, if you have land. So, when the child is 21 years old, those 20 trees are 
<br/>also 21 years old ready to harvest. You are not paying any premium and there is enough money to 
<br/>kick start his or her life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same thing can be done to community-based buildings that we build.  If we build a church 
<br/>in the village and at the same time we go and plant say 50 </span><span>yasi</span><span> trees, by the church needs repairing 
<br/>or to be rebuilt in 20 years’ time, there you go, you have 50 trees at $20,000 each.  That is a lot of 
<br/>money to do the work and no more fundraising as we do now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think there are three types of sandalwood in Fiji: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Santalum </span><span>yasi</span><span> as the honourable Minister mentioned which is the indigenous Fijian species.  
<br/>The tree does not grow as big, but it got a lot of oil, that is the expensive one;.Santalum 
<br/>album, I think it is the Indian </span><span>yasi</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hybrid where they cross breed between the two. Santalum album (the Indian yasi is a bigger 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tree but it has lesser oil). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we implemented the One Million Tree earlier, not the one that they are doing now, it 
<br/>gave interest to the planting of the </span><span>yasi</span><span>. The Ministry of Forestry then come up with this technique 
<br/>of germination of </span><span>yasi</span><span> which is quite difficult. </span><span>Yasi,</span><span> if you plant one, in three years’ time the </span><span>yasi 
<br/></span><span>begins to flower and fruit and the business from the </span><span>yasi</span><span> begins there Because you can germinate the 
<br/>fruits of the </span><span>yasi</span><span> and then you start selling the </span><span>yasi</span><span> seedlings while you wait.  The </span><span>yasi</span><span> tree as it grows 
<br/>older is for the future generation that come in and harvest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to add that there are other expensive trees like agarwood and rosewood that 
<br/>have the same type of growth pattern as </span><span>yasi</span><span>. They are very expensive, but they are slow growing 
<br/>that maybe as you develop that framework for </span><span>yasi,</span><span> you should also look at agarwood and rosewood.  
<br/>I  know  that  rosewood  is  growing  in  Fiji,  I  have  seen  one  tree  and  we  can  add  that  to  the  </span><span>yasi</span><span>
<br/>framework.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for that Statement.

<div><span>Ministerial Visit to Australia – PALM programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/></span><span>the  Opposition,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, those in  the gallery as well as those watching 
<br/>from their homes; I rise this morning to update Parliament on my Ministerial Visit to Australia from 
<br/>12</span><span>th</span><span> March to 17</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, kindly allow me, first of all, to acknowledge our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>704 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for endorsing the Ministerial Visit and also the Australian Government for their continued support in 
<br/>facilitating the visit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  also  acknowledge  the  tremendous  support  provided  by  the  High 
<br/>Commissioner and his team in Canberra. The High Commission team is our first point of contact in 
<br/>relation to opportunities for improvement by the employers for our Fijian workers.  It is sad to note 
<br/>that  currently  Fiji  does  not  have  a  Liaison  Officer  in  Australia  despite  funding  approved  by  the 
<br/>Australian  government  in  2021  and  the  failure  of  the  previous  government  in  expediting  the 
<br/>appointment of the Liaison Officer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was informed by my team that the last Ministerial Visit to our workers in 
<br/>Australia under the Labour Mobility Programme was in 2018.  Since then, no other visit has ever 
<br/>been made to support our workers, even after the borders were opened or reopen, Sir. This, we can 
<br/>say again was sheer neglect on the part of my predecessor among many other things that the Coalition 
<br/>Government under the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister is now trying to correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Listen!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that the last Minister for Employment now has the audacity 
<br/>to ask questions in relations to the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme, when he did 
<br/>not make a single visit to our workers in Australia in the four-year term that he was the Minister for 
<br/>Employment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable P.K. Bala interjected)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- He had the luxury of having a very robust Assistant Minister, he could 
<br/>have even delegated that responsibility to him.  He did not even do that.  This is the reality of the 
<br/>matter.  This is how much they actually care for the workers who are out there left on their own.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We had a system in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Another legacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  quite  disturbing  to  note  that  despite  the  Australian  Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approving the funding in 2021, there is still no Liaison Officer stationed there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- There was no need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Let me now dwell on the role of the Liaison Officer, Sir.  The Liaison 
<br/>Officer becomes the first point of contact for all our workers to air their grievances for assistance to 
<br/>resolve that.  That role cannot be overemphasised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have now taken swift action, we have worked out  to  ensure that the 
<br/></span><span>Liaison Officer’s position is advertised under due process and we can assure our workers in Australia 
<br/></span><span>and their relatives in Fiji and the entire country that we are going to have a Liaison Officer based in 
<br/>our  High  Commission  very  soon  and  that  officer  will  be  travelling  around  attending  to  all  the 
<br/>grievances of our workers in Australia.

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>705 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also going to open a toll-free line so that workers can register their complaints directly 
<br/>for the Liaison Officer to attend to.  The High Commission is working on that.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>want to repeat, if this was done in a timely manner, many of our workers’ concerns could have been 
<br/>addressed long before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Fijian diaspora has given their full support to the Coalition Government 
<br/>and many are happy to invest in Fiji after the change in Government.  This is the new era of Fiji 
<br/>under  the  profound  leadership  of  the  People’s  Coalition  Government  and  our  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister, that the countries are now united as never before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to foster better relations for all Fijians and ensure 
<br/>that we look into the opportunities identified through the PALM Scheme on a systematic manner and 
<br/>in line with the policies and legislations in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the primary objectives of my Ministerial visit to Australia was to 
<br/>reaffirm  Fiji’s  commitment  under  the  Vuvale  Agreement  -  relating  to  labour  mobility.    My 
<br/>Ministerial  Team  met  with  our  bilateral  partners  in  the  Australian  Government,  the  Minister  for 
<br/>International Development and the Pacific, honourable Pat Conroy, and the Minister for Employment 
<br/>and Workplace Relations, honourable Tony Burke.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  our  meetings,  both  the  Ministers  have  assured,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  they  will 
<br/>continue to strengthen the Programme, as well as the compliance mechanism that are in place for the 
<br/>protection of the workers.  This conversation is now going to continue, Sir, and we expect positive 
<br/>action by the Australian Government in this direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministerial Team also met with the Australian Council of Trade Unions 
<br/>(ACTU) - the President of the Trade Union, Ms. Michele O’Neil, and its affiliates from the Health 
<br/>Workers Union, Farm Workers Union and Meat Workers Union where the majority of our workers 
<br/>are  employed.    I  must  acknowledge  the  assistance  provided  by  the  National  Secretary  of  the  Fiji 
<br/>Trades Union Congress (FTUC) in facilitating this meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we discussed a range of issues, including the rights of workers to join unions 
<br/>for better employment relations and collective agreement, and getting assistance from the unions in 
<br/>areas  where  the  workers  have  employment  relations  issues.    It  is  common  knowledge,  Sir,  that 
<br/>organised workers are better protected, and this is going to happen now.  They have access to their 
<br/>trade unions in times of difficulties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also brief the ACTU through President O’Neil  and the affiliates on the 
<br/>progress of the Coalition Government and the action taken on Labour Law Review, restoration of 
<br/>Human  and  Trade  Union  Rights,  the  Right  to  Collective  Bargaining,  Right  to  Strike  and  the 
<br/>establishment of a Tripartite Employment Relations Advisory Board in line with the International 
<br/>Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 144 on Tripartite Consultation.  These have been pending 
<br/>since 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the meeting with ACTU was historic.  After a long time, a Fijian Minister 
<br/></span><span>for  Employment  met  with  the  ACTU  Executives.    The  ACTU  President,  Michele  O’Neil,  in  that 
<br/></span><span>meeting, also congratulated the Coalition Government for winning the 2022 General Elections and 
<br/>in strengthening relations between employers and Fijian workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Team is also exploring potential growth industries under the programme 
<br/>for our Fijian workers to access, as well as ensuring that minimum standards, terms and conditions 
<br/>of employment as per the contract are complied with, by the current and potential employers.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  movement  of  our  workers  through  the  Labour  Mobility  Programme 
<br/>comes directly under the National Employment Centre (NEC) under my portfolio as the Minister for 
<br/>Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations.  This visit to support the workers, visit their work 
<br/>sites and their accommodation, I want to repeat, was long overdue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during Wednesday’s Parliament session, the honourable Nath asked an Oral 
<br/>Question, can the Minister update Parliament on the Minister’s support to the PALM Scheme?  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  in  response  to  that  question,  I  had  said,  yes,  and  I  now  wish  to  quote  from  His 
<br/>Excellency  the  President’s  Opening  Address  during  the  Opening  of  the  2023-2024  Parliament 
<br/>Session, and I quote,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Through the </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> Partnership Programme, Government will work closely with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Australian Government to improve opportunities for labour mobility.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, of course, further prompted us to put the exercise into effect without undue delay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Labour Mobility Programmes are part of my Ministry’s contribution 
<br/>towards Government’s commitment in fulfilling the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
<br/>(SDG) 8 on Decent Work and Employment Growth, as well as SDG 1 on No Poverty.  Fiji’s National 
<br/>Employment Policy under Policy Priority 5 also highlights the need to promote access to overseas 
<br/>employment opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implementation of this Policy Priority has been an ongoing activity for 
<br/>number of years now.  Fiji’s participation under the Seasonal Workers Programme started in 2015, 
<br/>following  the  signing  of  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  with  the  Australian 
<br/>Government.  In 2019, Fiji joined the Pacific Labour Scheme, following the signing of another MOU 
<br/>on 5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2019.  From April 2022, the two Programmes were brought together under the single 
<br/>PALM Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s participation numbers continue to increase steadily over the past seven 
<br/>years but faced an exponential growth from the beginning of 2022.  This follows the reopening of 
<br/>our borders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question was asked by honourable Usamate on spouses of 
<br/>the  workers  joining  the  Scheme.    This  discussion  is  still  ongoing  with  our  bilateral  partners,  and 
<br/>nothing has been finalised yet.  There are a number of factors that need to be considered such as cost, 
<br/>expected savings and welfare. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have met with the workers at various sites to hear their concerns raised in regard to 
<br/>their welfare and provided advice on addressing such grievances and assured them that we are here 
<br/>to assist them.  In terms of the social impacts, the Ministry is keeping a close track of the social issues 
<br/>that have resulted from the Scheme and working on how it can mitigate and reduce the impacts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total  numbers  that has  participated since 2015 under the seasonal  or 
<br/>short-term up to nine-month programme has surpassed 2,500 and with the long-term of one to four 
<br/></span><span>years programme surpassing 3,800. As of March 2023, over 6,300 Fijians have participated under 
<br/></span><span>the combined PALM Scheme in Australia alone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Bala also raised a supplementary question on the impact of the 
<br/>‘No Jab No Job’ Policy on the Programme.  Sir, the Ministry will continue to adhere to the Australian 
<br/>Government’s  requirements  on  the  full  vaccination  of  Fijians  who  wish  to  participate  under  the 
<br/>Scheme, both in Australia and New Zealand, but as alluded to by the honourable Attorney-General

<div><span>in this Parliament earlier and I confirm that discussions are now ongoing to see how we can get these 
<br/>rules relaxed to meet the Fijian standards by those two Governments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted earlier, the speedy growth of the PALM Scheme has resulted 
<br/>in the total number of 2,500 that participated under the PALM Scheme in 2022 alone and since Fiji 
<br/>joined in 2015.  The numbers are expected to continue to grow for the next few years and we will 
<br/>have to be up to it as well, to ensure that we are able to provide that service to all our workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a huge achievement for the hardworking Team in my Ministry that 
<br/>is  struggling  to  secure  adequate  resourcing  levels  of  growing  demands  and  also  sacrificing  their 
<br/>valuable family time to work after normal hours, including weekends. Sir, I want to draw the attention 
<br/>of Parliament to the fact that positions vacant for years, not filled despite budgetary allocations are 
<br/>overburdening our existing staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, from 2019 to  2022  - the three financial years, the Ministry has been having 
<br/>annual savings of an average of $1 million per annum due to the vacant positions not being filled. 
<br/>These vacant positions, Sir, were critical in the Ministry in terms of functions and ensuring that we 
<br/>meet the needs of the people.  However, due to political reasons best known to my predecessor and 
<br/>his Government, these positions were not filled.  The Ministry currently has 44 vacant positions from 
<br/>2020 which we are now trying to fill in consultation with the Ministry of Civil Service in line with 
<br/>the current procedures and policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.  NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.  NAUPOTO.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on relevance.  The topic that he 
<br/>had  mentioned  he  was  going  to  speak  on  was  his  trip  to  Australia  and  because  we  are  going  to 
<br/>respond, he is talking about totally something else, apart from his trip to Australia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am talking about the challenges we are facing in 
<br/>providing that vital service to our workers out there because of the lack of staff in our Ministry.  That 
<br/>is the point the honourable Member must understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has  lost 25 established positions, mostly 
<br/>technical in nature, due to not filling these positions from 2018 and funding was taken away by the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy in 2020. This has put the Ministry in a handicap situation.  Our performance 
<br/>level and staff morale has taken a battering on the hands of my predecessors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my delegation was able to visit … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Too many players. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- …a number of approved employers, workplaces under aged care sector, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the meat industry and meet with our Fijian workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must admit that these meetings were very humbling, seeing the impact 
<br/>that the Programme is having not only on our workers but the employers, especially the residents of 
<br/>these Age Care Homes where our workers are so popular. The joy that these residents are expressing 
<br/>towards our workers is heart-touching.

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministerial visit could not be complete if we did not engage with our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian extended families who now call Australia their home.  The Ministerial delegation was able to 
<br/>have several community engagements that were also organised by the Fijian communities.  These 
<br/>were through </span><span>talanoa</span><span> sessions to listen and hear the views of those on the ground and this was also 
<br/>an  opportunity,  on  behalf  of  the  Coalition  Government,  to  seek  their  support  in  monitoring  and 
<br/>providing welfare support to our Fijian workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our diaspora in Australia have welcomed the Coalition Government with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>open arms and many are ready to assist us in every way possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I wish to also respond to a supplementary question 
<br/>that  was  asked  by  honourable  Maharaj  on  the  misuse  of  business  perspective  in  relation  to  gaps 
<br/>created by the Scheme and how the Department of Immigration and the Ministry is dealing with that. 
<br/>Sir,  through  the  PALM  Scheme  eligible  approved  employers  can  recruit  workers  for  up  to  nine 
<br/>months  and  for  a  longer  term  up  to  four  years  in  unskilled,  low-skilled  and  semi-skilled.  The 
<br/>movement of these workers overseas to greener pastures is something that is not new and has been 
<br/>happening over the decade and these are personal choices where one prefers to work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The gaps that are created by the skilled migration, Mr. Speaker, Sir, had been exacerbated 
<br/>because of the closure of our Technical Colleges.  That is where the whole issue lies, and the closure 
<br/>of those that were attached to the secondary schools initially, opening of the Technical Colleges and 
<br/>then closing the Technical Colleges as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Scheme, initially, with secondary schools was providing that Stages 1 and 2, and then 
<br/>FNU monitoring that, and then feeding them on to FNU to carry up to Stage 4 and their Diploma was 
<br/>a very effective method.  But that was taken away and the Technical Colleges were opened without 
<br/>much study then.  So that is the gap that has been created and that gap, I must thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Education and the honourable Minister of Finance to provide an opportunity through 
<br/>Polytech which is going to eventuate very soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry  is  going  to  work  in  close  consultation  with  all  other 
<br/>stakeholders, including the employers and TVET providers, to try and upskilled our workers in the 
<br/>short-term, medium term and long-term are as per the need of the various industries.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to quote from what honourable Usamate said, “get on 
<br/>with the job”.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to advise him, yes, we are getting on with the job, but we 
<br/>have  to  clean  up  the  mess  as  well  and  that  becomes  a  challenge  with  all  pending  work  with 
<br/>understaffed and overburdened staff, and the rest of the challenges that we are faced with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  or  his  designate  for  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response to the Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the Ministerial Statement by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Employment,  Productivity and Industrial Relations on his recent visit to 
<br/>Australia.    I  welcome  Government’s  position  on  the  </span><span>Vuvale</span><span>  Partnership  which  was  the  FijiFirst 
<br/></span><span>initiative… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K.  BALA.- …and its continued provisions of much needed employment for Fijians 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the PALM Scheme.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure of the value of the visit at 
<br/>taxpayers’ expense for these purposes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K.  BALA.- We were quiet when you people were talking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems that the whole of this Coalition Government decided to package 
<br/>holidays for themselves and some of their wives at taxpayers’ expense on the pretext of some of the 
<br/>other works and the related visit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Aww! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Point  of  Order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Can  I  suggest  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member that he stick to … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Relevance, Standing Order 60, Sir.  I am getting tired to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>saying ‘relevance’, Sir.  I do not know whether they understand the meaning of relevance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, firstly, he is bordering very close on personalising the issues and in this Parliament, if 
<br/>you remember when I stood up in my Maiden Speech, I asked that we work together.  If you are 
<br/>going to start dipping into personalising issues … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are saying one thing and doing another.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- …Sir, like he is just starting to suggest, I know there has 
<br/>been public comments about myself, so I am mentioning this in a very respectful manner.  If they 
<br/>want to dip into the personal stuff, we can go ahead and dip into the personal stuff again, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  So, Sir, can I ask him to be relevant, stick to the Statement and stop meandering around like a 
<br/>baboon.  Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bala, you may continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I think he should stop wasting Parliament’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time because in his Point of Order, there was no order and, of course, no point.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister had mentioned in this Ministerial Statement about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Liaison Officer.  During our term, we worked smart …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  …  and  we  had  assigned  the  staff  at  the  Embassy  to  oversee  this 
<br/>Programme.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for record purposes, without having a Liaison Officer, we have sent 
<br/>close to 8,000 Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sent them and forgot about them, that is the problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  also  tried  to  justify  his  trips,  the  holiday  trip  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Shame, shame!

<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA … by saying, it is very important to have a Ministerial visit.  The reason 
<br/>why I never went, because the Australian Ministers were in the country, so we had those type of 
<br/>meetings and </span><span>talanoa</span><span> sessions, and there was no need for the visit.  But I do not know what he found 
<br/>so important in these last 100 days, that he had to go, but that is his choice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the former Minister for this portfolio, the PALM Scheme is already in 
<br/>place and its provisions are secure in providing work for the Fijians. The Ministry and its partners in 
<br/>the Australian Government has all due processes in place and the Programme is ongoing and does 
<br/>not require a Ministerial visit.  Maybe, that type of money could have been used to fix some of the 
<br/>potholes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to urge that such visits are made in order to secure programmes 
<br/>or to ensure its expansion, but the Programme is safe.  This was a taxpayer-fund drive for the Minister 
<br/>and it is time for the honourable Prime Minister to revisit such visits.  This will help ensure that he 
<br/>does not have to discipline Ministers who take off on ill-advised adventures using the money of the 
<br/>poor people of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  was  among  other  unionists  who  criticised  the 
<br/>PALM Scheme, as well as other overseas work opportunities secured under the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/>They complained long and hard, Sir, about the loss of workers here in Fiji…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor, very poor!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- …and all of a sudden, he makes an Australian tour to reaffirm the PALM 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is flip-flop politics at its best.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  the  last  laugh  when  my  good  friend,  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Lands, in his acting capacity as Minister for Employment, went to close the pre-departure training 
<br/>programme and highly spoke of the PALM Scheme.  But we all know in this Parliament what his 
<br/>thoughts  were  on  this  Programme  during  the  campaign.    He  knows  very  well;  I  do  not  have  to 
<br/>highlight anything on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PALM Scheme was secured by the former Prime Minister, among his 
<br/>many other diplomatic initiatives, including the </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> Partnership that was signed between him and 
<br/>the former Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison.  The Programme continues to provide work 
<br/>and skills pathways for thousands of Fijians.  It brings much-needed remittance and for most of the 
<br/>workers, it is the life-changing opportunity to build houses, to pay for the education of their children, 
<br/>it improves the quality of life in their village and the community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we were told, this same Government who were on the other side of the Chamber 
<br/>during the last time, said the villages will be empty by this Programme.  But now, all is good because 
<br/>they are sitting that side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Do not lie. No one said that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Oh yes, they did.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- They did.  Yes, they did.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Look at him!  You should be the last one to say that.
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>711 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The complainers about the PALM  Scheme failed to recognise that earlier but are quick to 
<br/>jump on a plane to reaffirm this Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  A win-win situation for all concerned 
<br/>in Fiji and our partners in Australia, who came on  board in response to one of the many FijiFirst 
<br/>initiatives that our colleague in the Coalition Government are jumping up and down about and taking 
<br/>credit where none is due to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> Partnership, a Programme that was invested in by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government is now reaping rewards for all Fijians well beyond any initiatives or programmes that 
<br/>we have yet to see from the Coalition Government in a hundred days.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note the Ministerial Statement and welcome the reaffirming of the PALM 
<br/>Scheme as another of the FijiFirst Government initiatives that this Coalition Government is riding 
<br/>on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visit by the honourable Minister was a waste of taxpayers’ money and I 
<br/>urge  this  Coalition  Government  to  demonstrate  to  the  Fijian  people  its  commitment  not  to  spend 
<br/>taxpayers’ money on trips that do not bring back material benefits to our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, the teachers have been calling us on the contract.  I 
<br/>have received on my phone that the teachers are complaining that they are getting five-year contracts 
<br/>but what we were told, contracts have all gone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You did not listen to him, what he said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Can you, please, keep quiet?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, but now, they are giving five-year contracts which was what FijiFirst used 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to do.  Where is the change?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank you for this opportunity.  </span><span>
