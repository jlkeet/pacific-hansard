<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
<br/> 2018 AND 2019 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the following Reports: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Review  of  the  Electoral  Commission  Annual  Report,  2018,  which  was  tabled  on  31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>August, 2022; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Review  of  the  Electoral  Commission  Annual  Report,  2019,  which  was  tabled  on  1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>September, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister,  
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament, as the Member moving the motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Reports of 
<br/>the on the Justice, Law and Human Rights Committee on the review of the Fiji Electoral Commission 
<br/>Annual Report 2018 and 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The two Committee Reports were tabled in the last term of Parliament  and I will proceed 
<br/>directly to some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in these two Reports.  For clarity 
<br/>purpose, I will first highlight the issues noted in the 2018 Report, and then onto the 2019 Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  2018  reported  year,  the  Committee  noted  seven  key  findings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>identified by the previous Committee, which I wish to summarise as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee identified that the Electoral Commission had given the opportunity to all 
<br/>Fijians, even those who reside in very remote locations to be able to vote through pre-poll. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Electoral Commission had achieved a milestone by successfully conducting another 
<br/>election for the year 2018, following the introduction of the D’Hondt system in the 2014 
<br/>General Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The  Electoral  Commission  was  commended  for  its  capability  in  addressing  challenges 
<br/>encountered  in  the  2018  General  Elections,  including  the  spread  of  false  news  about 
<br/>election via social media and the bad weather conditions that hindered voters from being 
<br/>able to vote during election day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The  Electoral  Commission  was  commended  for  the  system  in  selecting  the  three-digit 
<br/>numbers to be used for candidate numbers.  However, on the same note, it was noted that 
<br/>the system may cause confusion to the voters, given that more than one candidate may have 
<br/>a number comprising of three similar digits appearing on the ballot paper. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The  Electoral  Commission  was  commended  for  conducting  election  awareness  in  both 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>urban and rural areas inclusive of villages, communities and schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was highlighted that the 2018 General Election had a notable voter turnout compared to 
<br/>other countries that have the similar electoral system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee noted that there was insufficient gender related information provided in the 
<br/>Annual Report.  However, after seeking clarification, the Committee commends the work 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report–Electoral Commission 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports   3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>carried out by the Commission  in  empowering  women  and girls  and promoting gender 
<br/>equality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  2019  Annul  Report,  the  previous  Committee  identified  four  key 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>findings, and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Commission has undertaken a review of the 2018 General Election and have identified 
<br/>the main areas of improvements with the focus on improving the processes that guide the 
<br/>Commission service delivery and ensuring acceptability of the election processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>There have been key positive changes realised by the Commission, which strengthens its 
<br/>independence,  whereby  the  Commission  was  able  to  control  its  own  budget,  which  is 
<br/>separate from the Fijian Elections Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Commission’s Annual Report had insufficient gender related information, however, 
<br/>after consultation, it was encouraging to note that numerous activities and initiatives that 
<br/>the Commission was undertaking which promotes gender equality and empowerment of 
<br/>women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Commission had demonstrated that it also prioritises reducing inequality and promotes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>political inclusion of everyone in Fiji, even those who are living with a disability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these issues were addressed and clarified by the Electoral Commission and 
<br/>many information  on this  can be retrieved in  the Committee’s Report.  I  will go straight into the 
<br/>recommendations  put  forth  by  the  previous  Committee  for  the  consideration  of  the  Electoral 
<br/>Commission, which was intended for continued improvement in service delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Electoral  Commission  through the  Fijian Elections Office  continue  with  its advocacy 
<br/>programmes on the elections, which is in line with the Office’s Strategic Plan 2020-2023, whereby, 
<br/>it aims to strengthen the electoral participation through effective outreach and engagement processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate the Committee’s comments on commending the 
<br/>Electoral Commission for the strides it has taken in improving many areas of their service delivery 
<br/>in the electoral system in Fiji.  Given the achievements highlighted in the 2019 Report, it was noted 
<br/>that  there  were  further  improvements  of  election  processes  and  numerous  initiatives  that  the 
<br/>Commission  was  undertaking  and  to  promote  gender  equality  and  empowerment  of  women  and 
<br/>inclusion of all persons in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend and acknowledge the great work carried out by the previous 
<br/>Committee,  and  I  further  commend  that  Members  of  the  current  Standing  Committee  on  Justice, 
<br/>Law, and Human Rights. With those few words, I urge that the honourable Members of this august 
<br/>Parliament take note of the contents of the Committee’s Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor, I would like to inform honourable Members that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about six speakers have volunteered to provide their input into the motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.A. Maharaj; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu; and 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report–Electoral Commission 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>765 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I will try to keep it short as majority of the things has 
<br/>been covered by the current chairperson on what were some of the findings and what were some of 
<br/>the reasons that were given by the Electoral Commission and how they were actually addressing this, 
<br/>in particular the seven issues that were raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  basically  talk  about  the  involvement  of  women  and  their 
<br/>participation  in  Parliament.  There  had  been  a  lot  of  concerns  raised  that  the  participation  in 
<br/>Parliament with regards to women and gender equality is not enough.  However, while talking to the 
<br/>Electoral Commission and Fijian Elections Office, I believe this is something that needs to be done 
<br/>at the party level rather than at Parliament level whereby we encourage at least 50 percent of our 
<br/>candidates be females. If we are able to endorse these kinds of policies at the party level, that will 
<br/>encourage more participation of females in Parliament.  There had been calls previously of having 
<br/>certain seats reserved for women in Parliament, but at that point in time, the Committee came up with 
<br/>a fact that if we need to include them, it would be better to include them at a political level rather 
<br/>than just giving them seats in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue, Mr. Speaker, was with regards to the civil society organisations not allowed 
<br/>to create awareness on the voting process itself and this was after the writ is filed.  After the elections 
<br/>till the writ is filed for the next election, nothing is stopping the civil societies and NGOs to actually 
<br/>create this awareness.  The only reason that was used to stop Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to 
<br/>create awareness was to take the ownership because if there is any kind of misinformation that is 
<br/>relayed by the CSOs, that would mean that no one could be held accountable as per the electoral laws 
<br/>to take them to task if they are providing any kind of false information  or if there is any kind of 
<br/>misinformation that is causing confusion within the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third one, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to speak about is people living with disabilities. 
<br/>They are a very integral part of our communities and we should ensure that these people are given a 
<br/>fair chance and it is not about taking them to the polling station but it is about taking the polling 
<br/>stations to them.  One of the best ways that the Electoral Commission came up with this idea, was 
<br/>that if anyone living with disabilities, they should get themselves registered as postal voters.  This 
<br/>would mean that the ballot paper along with the Election Guideline Book is actually sent to them for 
<br/>them to vote because they also have a say and it is very important that we include them in the decision 
<br/>making or as to how they can contribute towards the policy making and the making of laws.  So, it 
<br/>is very important that we need to encourage the Electoral Commission to ensure that everyone living 
<br/>with disabilities, they are registered as postal voters.  This also includes all those people who are at 
<br/>home who are elderly and sickly, and they cannot make it to the polling station on the day of elections.  
<br/>I encourage, in order to have your concerns raised in Parliament, it is very important to vote because 
<br/>we have seen that the voter turnout is going low and low.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had three elections by now and it is going down.  We need to encourage, and I have 
<br/>said this in Parliament as well, we, as parliamentarians need to take a lead role in ensuring that the 
<br/>general public actually turns up to the elections office to vote on the day of election, whether it is on 
<br/>the day of election, whether it is through pre-polls or through postal voting, but it is very important, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these people turn up to vote because every vote counts.  If you want to have your 
<br/>say in the law-making process, it is very important to take this responsibility as Fijians to go and cast 
<br/></span><span>your vote. With those words, Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the work of the Committee and 
<br/></span><span>I support the motion.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief considering that the Report really 
<br/>only has one recommendation and that is with respect to its advocacy programmes that are required 
<br/>or for extension or more of it is actually required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report–Electoral Commission 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports   3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we all know, Mr. Speaker, this was actually the 2018 Election Report.  I think we have 
<br/>gone past it by far but it is quite commendable in terms of what was achieved during that particular 
<br/>election.    I  think  it  was  a  successful  one,  conducted  successfully,  the  Commission  is  actually 
<br/>commended for all the work that they have done.  I do not see anything untoward that has actually 
<br/>come about it.  Despite having quite a few challenges with weather and I think it is contained in the 
<br/>Report  with  respect  to  social  media,  et  cetera  that,  that  actually  happened,  we  had  a  reasonable 
<br/>turnout.  Honourable Alvick Maharaj is actually correct, I think the voter turnout numbers are getting 
<br/>low.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maybe it is something that we need to address for the future but all in all, Sir, the Committee 
<br/>obviously has deliberated, this is not the current Standing Committee but this is deliberated on by the 
<br/>previous Committee which we have just sanctioned and I think everyone should be quite proud of 
<br/>the fact that we had an Electoral Office and Commission that conducted the 2018 elections without 
<br/>too much problems at all and I think it would have come out in the Report if there was.  So, all in all, 
<br/>Sir, I support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an input and debate on the review 
<br/>of the Electoral Commission Annual Report 2018 tabled on 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 and the review of the 
<br/>Electoral Commission Annual Report 2019 which was tabled on the 1</span><span>st</span><span>  September, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on JLHR has extensively deliberated on the work 
<br/>of the Electoral Commission and I commend the Commission on the work they undertook in 2018 
<br/>and 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, the functions of the Commission as provided under the Constitution 2013 is to 
<br/>be responsible for the registration of voters, the conduct of a free and fair elections in accordance 
<br/>with the written law governing elections and any other relevant law, in particular, the registration of 
<br/>citizens as voters and the regular revision of the Register of Voters,  voter education, the registration 
<br/>of candidates for election, the settlement of electoral disputes including disputes relating to or arising 
<br/>from  nominations  but  excluding  election  petitions    and  disputes  subsequent  to  the  declaration  of 
<br/>election results and monitoring and enforcing compliance with any written law governing elections 
<br/>and political parties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Considering both reports, I note that the Committee has only made one recommendation that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is reflected in the review of the Electoral Commission.  The recommendation state and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That the Electoral Commission through the Fijian Elections Office continue with its 
<br/>advocacy programmes on the elections, which is in line with the Office’s Strategic Plan 2020 
<br/>–  2023  whereby  one  such  goal  is  to  strengthen  electoral  participation  through  effective 
<br/>outreach and engagement programmes.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I provide some insight into this?  On 14</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2019, the Commission launched 
<br/>the FEO Strategic Plan 2020 – 2030.  Pillar four of the Strategic Plan required the FEO to develop 
<br/>and  implement  effective  public  outreach  and  engagement  programmes  to  strengthen  electoral 
<br/>participation.    However,  on  19</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2020,  Fiji  confirmed  its  first  COVID-19  case  and  this 
<br/></span><span>pandemic was experienced throughout the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  COVID-19  pandemic  hindered  the  plans  of  the  Commission  to  implement  effective 
<br/>public outreach and engagement programmes in the community which prompted the Commission to 
<br/>direct FEO to be innovative in its plans to achieve effective outreach and engagement programmes.  
<br/>In trying to achieve this, the FEO through the support of the Commission conducted three nation-
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report–Electoral Commission 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>767 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wide surveys from 15</span><span>th</span><span> September to 31</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2020, 21</span><span>st</span><span> January to 11</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022 and 
<br/>August 22.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first survey received 14,137 responses.  The second survey received 9,576 responses and 
<br/>the  third  survey  received  8,154  responses.      All  surveys  were  done  throughout  the  country  and 
<br/>information  was  gathered  through  the  Voter  Survey  App.    The  purpose  of  these  surveys  was  to 
<br/>understand the behavioural pattern of the voters, their experience in the 2018 General Election, their 
<br/>preferred medium for receiving election information, test the success of the FEO 2018 Awareness 
<br/>Campaign, check whether their residential address and voter details were up to-date and find out if 
<br/>they knew how to vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  nationwide  survey  assisted  FEO  in  developing  and  implementing  effective  outreach 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engagement programmes such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>A  stakeholder  forum  on  enhancing  voter  participation  which  was  hosted  by  the 
<br/>Commission and FEO on 30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022.  This forum was organised to address the 
<br/>low voter turnout recorded for 2014 and 2018 General Elections and look at ideal best 
<br/>practices and options to create a greater participation for the 2022 General Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The various locals and international stakeholders attended this forum which included 
<br/>representatives from Australia, New Zealand, Electoral Commission, the International 
<br/>Foundation  for  Electoral  Systems  (IFES)  as  well  as  those  in  the  political  parties, 
<br/>grassroots,  youth,  women’s  group,  academics  and  members  of  the  organisation  for 
<br/>persons  with  disabilities.    This  forum  laid  the  framework  for  the  community 
<br/>engagement project ran by the FEO and the UNDP between 19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 and 12</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>September, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Community Engagement Project was undertaken in two phases. The aim of this 
<br/>project  was  to  train  and  certify  community  election  advocates  and  school  election 
<br/>advocates  so  that  they  are  able  to  go  back  to  the  community  and  conduct  voter 
<br/>awareness on how to vote, when to vote, voter registration and other important election 
<br/>information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first phase was from 19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 to 22</span><span>nd</span><span> August, 2022 in which 208 community 
<br/>election advocates were trained and certified.  These advocates were representatives of 
<br/>women and youth groups from religious organisations, settlements, villages as well as 
<br/>the </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> and district advisory councillors from all four divisions as well as 
<br/>members of the disability group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second phase was from the 17</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022 until 12</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2022 in which 
<br/>the Social Science teachers and Year 13 students through the approval of the Ministry 
<br/>of Education were trained and certified.  A total of 276 students and teachers in Suva, 
<br/>Labasa,  Savusavu,  Rakiraki,  Ba,  Nadi,  Sigatoka,  Lautoka,  Navua  and  Nausori  were 
<br/>accredited.  The FEO through this project was able to reach 6,514 eligible voters from 
<br/>87 respective school communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The  FEO  launched  the  “Know  Your  Election  Campaign”  which  was  a  major  voter 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>awareness campaign conducted in the year of the General Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first phase was running simultaneously with the nationwide voter registration drive 
<br/>from 25</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022 to 14</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022. Teams carried out awareness session in 
<br/>schools, villages and settlements and recorded 127,158 direct voter engagements.  The

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report–Electoral Commission 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports   3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>awareness  session  included  flip-chart  presentations  on  the  electoral  processes  and 
<br/>voters were provided with election information booklet, how to vote brochure to assist 
<br/>them in understanding the electoral processes.  The awareness ran concurrent with the 
<br/>registration and the team were deployed using the Rural to Urban Approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second phase was later concluded from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 to September, 2022.  This 
<br/>focused  more  on  the  urban  and  semi-urban  locations  where  majority  of  the  voter 
<br/>population  resides.  In  this  phase,  FEO  took  approach  of  taking  registration  and 
<br/>awareness to the doorstep.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Teams  were  deployed  to  densely  populated  settlements,  urban  hotspot,  popular 
<br/>locations  in  individual  streets  such  as  supermarkets  and  sporting  grounds,  60  teams 
<br/>were deployed for the five-week exercise.  Each team had three staff who were Trained  
<br/>in Awareness and Voter Registration, 1,169 villages, 555 settlements and 174 schools 
<br/>were covered with 43,102 direct voter engagement.  The main focus of this phase was 
<br/>to update the voter cards and inform them of the voting process and counting process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Apart  from  the  Direct  Engagement  Initiative,  FEO  also  took  advantage  of  the 
<br/>technology platform and established an election channel on </span><span>Walesi</span><span> which was set up, 
<br/>host  videos  created  by  FEO  showing  various  electoral  processes  such  as  the  voting 
<br/>processes, the counting of ballot papers and national candidates ball draw process.  The 
<br/>FEO also pushed out the e-talk on </span><span>Facebook</span><span> which was a five-minute segment featuring 
<br/>conversations with the former SOE.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  followed  a  </span><span>talk back</span><span>  show setup  in  which the former SOE was interviewed on 
<br/>various electoral processes or pressing issues relating to the elections work clarified.  
<br/>This encouraged direct engagement between FEO and the electors. An e-new segment 
<br/>was also pushed out on </span><span>Facebook</span><span> which provided an update and explanation of various 
<br/>electoral events.  These initiatives were pushed out in 2022 and it was derived from the 
<br/>response of those that took part in the three surveys who indicated their preference of 
<br/>having such publications to be hosted in the social media and free to air television. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another initiative was the Quiz Competition. On 15</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2020 
<br/>the FEO ran a virtual quiz competition as part of the International Day of Democracy, 
<br/>celebrations  which  garnered  a  lot  of  interest  from  the  public  especially  from  young 
<br/>voters.  The event  was complemented with an extensive awareness campaign on the 
<br/>FEO’s online platform, 256 teams took part in this competition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since then FEO has conducted 11 quiz competitions which had a total of 12,083 teams 
<br/>participating. The FEO wrapped up the quiz competition series with the last quiz on 
<br/>27</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2022.  The quiz competition allowed participants to research and gain 
<br/>more  knowledge  and  understanding  on  the  electoral  system  in  Fiji.    The  various 
<br/>electoral  processes  such  as  voting,  counting  and  tabulation  of  results  and  also  the 
<br/>methods of voting available in the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, although most of the initiatives were implemented in the Year 2022, at this 
<br/></span><span>juncture  I  would  like  to  commend  the  Commission  on  its  effort  to  try  and  strengthen  electoral 
<br/>participation in such a tight timeline given that Years 2020 and 2021, the country experienced the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic which restricted direct engagement with the stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Standing Committee for the recommendation of the Report, and I would like to 
<br/>reiterate that the Commission has managed to strengthen electoral participation through stakeholder

<div><span>       Review Report–Electoral Commission 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports   3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 7.30 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my comments on the motion that 
<br/>is before Parliament and that is on the Electoral Commission Annual Report 2018 and 2019.  The 
<br/>contribution  that  we  have  heard  from  the  honourable  Attorney-General  had  talked  about  the 
<br/>preparations towards the 2022 Elections, but the Report confines us to the financial year 2018 and 
<br/>2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the things that came out of that was the report by the Fiji Elections Office on the 
<br/>successful 2018 General Elections and I agree with the honourable Attorney-General when he said 
<br/>that  it  was  a  free  and  fair  Elections.    That  is  the  recommendation  of  the  Committee  that  the 
<br/>Commission has made strides into conducting a second successful election in that particular year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From then,  we had the  Multi-Observer  Group  (MOG) Report that  also  observed the 2018 
<br/>Elections and they came up with few recommendations.  That was part of the three Acts in 2020) - 
<br/>the Electoral Bill that was the Electoral Act 2014, Political Parties (Registration, Conduct, Funding 
<br/>and Disclosures) Act 2013 and the Electoral (Registration of Voters) Act 2012.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the things that came out of that public consultation as part of the observation by the 
<br/>MOG that resulted in some changes that was used in the 2022 General Election.  One was the voter 
<br/>card that was amended to allow us to know our polling station which has to be part of the details in 
<br/>our voter card.  That came in after a survey and a report from the 2018 General Elections conducted 
<br/>by the former Supervisor of Elections.  Many gave the excuse that they did not turn up to their voting 
<br/>venues  because they did not  know their venue because the voter card then only  talked about our 
<br/>polling station number or EVR number and did not specify our address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the changes that came out at that time and I would like to thank the former 
<br/>Attorney-General and also Minister responsible for Election for his leadership then in 2014 and 2018 
<br/>that led to the now third successful election in 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, as honourable Members of Parliament as national leaders, we have the duty to always 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>try to promote and advocate the credibility of our electoral system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- One of the other things that came up from this exercise was the 
<br/>use of false information during campaign and the onus is on us as national leaders and politicians, 
<br/>when  we  move  around  the  country  during  campaign,  we  must  ensure  that  we  always  protect  our 
<br/>electoral system.  I do not discredit it, and that is something that we must all learn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Attorney-General in his contribution.  Honourable Tikodudua, if you 
<br/>heard him properly, he actually praised the work done by the Commission and the former Supervisor 
<br/>of Elections and I thank him for giving credit to where it is due.  If it was not for the hard work done 
<br/>by the former Supervisor of Elections, none of us would be here.  That allowed the process for a fair 
<br/>election for political parties to campaign openly and also the process and many things that were told 
<br/></span><span>during the Elections that the Election will be rigged and all these lies that were commonly spread. 
<br/></span><span>But again, nothing, we have a change of government.  But if we had wanted to win the Election, 
<br/>people said they will win the election because they will rig the election, but see what the result we 
<br/>have now.  That all shows the good work that was done by the former Supervisor of Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite other allegations that are probably pending (I will not talk about that), but again it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our duty that we always promote our electoral system.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>771 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Those  are  few  things,  Sir,  that  is  part  of  all  the  single 
<br/>recommendation by the Committee to allow the Commission to create more advocacy to the public.  
<br/>We should not create fear amongst the people on the electoral system and we are the ones who should 
<br/>encourage them to come and vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The former Committee Chairperson had talked about the low voter turnout and we have the 
<br/>duty to encourage people.  I always believe that most of our political arguments always discredit our 
<br/>electoral system which results in the low voter turnout.  That should stop, Sir, because it will discredit 
<br/>the system that is already workable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat Sir, I would like to respond to the honourable Minister of Finance when 
<br/>he replied to honourable Premila Kumar about the former FRCS Chairperson that was sacked from 
<br/>the  regional  body  saying  why  he  was  chairing.    Again,  if  you  look  closely  at  the  Fiscal  Review 
<br/>Committee, I think it is being chaired by someone too that is also questionable.  He has also been 
<br/>convicted and awaiting sentence.  The honourable Minister should also look into it if there could be 
<br/>another person to be Chairman instead of a convicted person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you see the pattern, for the last few weeks and today, a similar pattern is being used by the 
<br/>Coalition Government and always ending with the honourable Minister of Finance as the last speaker.  
<br/>He is slowly becoming a ‘one man’ government, Sir… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not  only  that,  he  used  to  say  when  he  was  on  this  side  of  Parliament,  ‘the  two  men  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government plus the silent 25’.  I can say now it is like the ‘silent 28 and the one-man government’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My statement should not threaten the other two political parties.  They have got three Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers and I hope we see more of the two Deputy Prime Ministers and three participate a 
<br/>lot in summarising up the Government’s position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad  and  I  are  from  Macuata,  so  no  need  to  worry.    If  you  look 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>around, these are some of the things we try and improve next time in our debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Committee for the work that they have done in reviewing the Report and one of 
<br/>the things that the Coalition Government should have done, they should have waited for the former 
<br/>Supervisor  of  Elections  to  table  the  2022  Election  Report  before  it  came  up  with  the  decision  to 
<br/>suspend him because that would have helped the Committee a lot on the review of the 2022 General 
<br/>Elections plus the Multi-Observe Group Report.  That would have also improved our electoral laws 
<br/>for the 2026 elections.  Those are lessons learnt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are, obviously, looking at review of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two Reports; the Electoral Commission Annual Reports 2018 and 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  has  been  alluded  by  honourable  Members,  the  Electoral  Commission  is 
<br/>probably one of the most important constitutional offices in any democracy and for the conduct of 
<br/>free and fair election.  Under section 37(a) of the Financial Management Act all independent officers 
<br/>including the Electoral Commission should be adequately resourced, to ensure that they including 
<br/>effectively exercise their powers and perform their functions and duties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report–Electoral Commission 2018 &amp; 2019 Annual Reports   3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, just in terms of the 2018-2019 Financial year, the Fijian Elections Office was allocated a 
<br/>budget of $20.4 million to carry-out the 2018 General Elections.  However, giving the delay in the 
<br/>announcement of the Election date, the budget had increased to $22.1 million - an increase of about 
<br/>$1.7 million.  Of this $22.1 million, around $500,000 was allocated to the Electoral Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Government, through the Fijian Elections Office, spent $22.1 million on the 
<br/>Election Day to conduct the 2018 General Election with the voter turnout of 71.9 percent. In fact, the 
<br/>donor contributions to the Elections Office because the donors were kept waiting so was the whole 
<br/>country in the two Elections 2018 and 2022 because the Government was not clear and sure when 
<br/>they wanted to hold the Elections, so a lot of the donors held back, and the support and assistance 
<br/>came in the last minute.  So, the Ministry of Finance really has no record of that assistance provided 
<br/>directly by the donors to the Fijian Elections Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a number of issues have been raised by honourable Members from the other 
<br/>side.  The Election Commission, as I have said, is the most important institution in the conduct of 
<br/>elections anywhere in any democracy.  It is the Electoral Commission which supervise us, which 
<br/>oversees the functions of the Elections Office and the Electoral Commission in good democracies, 
<br/>transparent  democracies,  accountable  democracies,  is  the  most  powerful  institution.  They  make 
<br/>specific contributions and determine the kind of laws, the kind of environment that they need to create 
<br/>for the conduct of free and fair elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone knowns, the honourable Members on the other side know and 
<br/>honourable Maharaj I thought provided a very good contribution. He actually talked about the lack 
<br/>of women participation in politics, in Parliament, he talked about the low voter turnout, especially 
<br/>amongst the women voters and we saw that in the 2022 General Election, so he highlighted those 
<br/>issues very well.  But I think he held back, Mr. Speaker, from saying a little bit more as to why some 
<br/>of those things might have happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  is  why  the  Electoral  Commission  must  be  powerful,  must  be  independent,  must  be 
<br/>adequately resourced so that they take the responsibility, they actually advised the Government of 
<br/>the circumstances, the environment and perhaps, also the timing of the election in a country like ours.  
<br/>So all those factors such as cyclone season, holiday season and we saw that in 2022 Election, a lot of 
<br/>people, a lot of voters, people are not sure when the election is going to be held, people are planning 
<br/>for their holiday overseas, those from overseas were planning to come to Fiji, people were planning 
<br/>for holidays within the country and a lot of people actually left Suva to the islands because they did 
<br/>not know and they had booked their shipping routes and all the rest of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Electoral Commission, unfortunately, was not resourced and was not given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the kind of information that it normally ought to have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The way forward, Mr. Speaker, we want to ensure that the Electoral Commission undertakes 
<br/>proper planning, not only in terms of advising on the appropriateness of an election date but also 
<br/>making sure that proper planning does not lead to additional cost to the Government.  So improper 
<br/>planning, wrong timing whether it is to do with a cyclone, whether it is to do with flooding, rainy 
<br/></span><span>season, all those add cost to Government which could have easily been avoided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In New Zealand, Mr. Speaker, the Government announces the election a year before it is held, 
<br/>it  is  transparent  and  open.  We,  Mr.  Speaker,  have  not  seen  that  in  this  country  in  the  last  two 
<br/>Elections.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>773 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Electoral  Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  outreach  awareness  programmes 
<br/>to  strengthen 
<br/>independently  and  the  Electoral  Commission  right  now  is  currently  in  the  process  of  internally 
<br/>reviewing the 2022 General Election.  I think it is a good exercise and we hope to see appropriate 
<br/>reports from that review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  I kind  of remember there was  this programme  called  </span><span>Kids  Say the Darndest 
<br/>Things</span><span>. I have heard the most darndest things, honourable Bulitavu, just now.  He was talking about 
<br/>individuals.  That was the problem, a lot of them sitting on the other side thought that there were 
<br/>certain individuals who were indispensable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not think like that, we believe in the strength of institutions.  It does not matter who is 
<br/>in the position, if the institutions are strong, if the processes are strong, if there is transparency and 
<br/>accountability in governance whether you are in Government or Opposition, that makes it strong.  
<br/>So, it is a big joke coming from honourable Bulitavu who knows exactly what was there during the 
<br/>previous Government reign.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The systems, Mr. Speaker, also need to be improved. I mean, honourable Maharaj made a 
<br/>good  point  about  women  voters,  but  he  did  not  talk  about  the  fact  that  the  Government  actually 
<br/>brought in that stupid legislation which required women voters to go and change names and have 
<br/>new voter registration card.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, there was a lot of confusion  about  moving from  Green card to  a Blue 
<br/>Card.  Towards the Election, we were told that we could use it again.  Then we were told we could 
<br/>not use it. So, a lot of people, a lot of voters, Mr. Speaker, were confused.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree when they say we should not create fear but if you look at the Electoral laws, that is 
<br/>one of the things that the Coalition Government in good time is going to look at.  Some of the most 
<br/>stupid, draconian and unnecessary electoral laws exist in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Whether  you  talked  about  the  Political  Parties  Act  or  the 
<br/>Electoral Act, it is just draconian.  It creates fear in the laws itself, Mr. Speaker.   When we were in 
<br/>the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, and I hope that honourable Opposition Members would never feel the 
<br/>kind of fear that we felt as legislators in this Parliament when we sat in the Opposition for eight years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will make sure that they do not feel the same, that they have the freedom because the laws 
<br/>that  they  created  was  designed  to  strangle  the  Opposition  and  the  Electoral  Commission, 
<br/>unfortunately, was powerless and toothless.  Basically, it was dictated by the Fijian Elections Office 
<br/>as to what they should do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very important Report and we must, as legislators, whether you sit 
<br/>in the Opposition or in Government, because we know these things can change.  Today, we are in 
<br/>Government, tomorrow we are going to be in Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And some of them sitting on the Government side, when we said Government will change, they said, 
<br/>“In your dreams!”.  Well, I can say the same thing. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  can  say  the  same  thing,  but  I  will  not,  because  we  genuinely  believe  in  democracy, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transparency and accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, after being thrown into the Opposition by the people of this country, I 
<br/>hope  that  they  will  understand  the  true  meaning  of  democracy,  the  true  meaning  of  being  in 
<br/>Opposition and the true meaning of being in Government.  That is a lesson that they must learn and 
<br/>I know the honourable Leader of the Opposition will provide that counsel and guidance to some of 
<br/>them on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  with  you,  Sir,  in  that  Chair,  I  can  already  see  that  we  are  having  a  real 
<br/>Parliament.  We have created that environment and I think they must appreciate that, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/>They must appreciate the new Government for doing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that laws should never be made - keeping yourself 
<br/>in mind.  I used to remind them, but over the last eight years, including the electoral laws, they made 
<br/>laws to suit themselves and the electoral laws were always designed to suit the FijiFirst Party, the 
<br/>Government at that time, because they wanted to put the Opposition off the rail.  We, as a government 
<br/>are not going to do that, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all honourable Members 
<br/>for the debate on the motion.  Just a contribution from the motion on the floor, I totally agree with 
<br/>the former Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights with regards 
<br/>to our electoral system, we still need a lot of awareness on it.  That is what I saw during the campaign, 
<br/>people in the rural areas still do not understand our electoral system.  We need more awareness on 
<br/>that, and I hope we, as legislators, push for more awareness on this electoral system.  May be that 
<br/>was the reason why there were no turnout on voters for the 2022 General Elections.  We really need 
<br/>more awareness with regards to this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to this electoral system, I believe that it in such a way where we can compromise 
<br/>because in some places and areas, like honourable Maharaj was saying, the substitution for disability 
<br/>and the elderly needs to go by postal ballot.  We must understand that in the rural areas this is not 
<br/>available to them.  So how can the electoral system compromise with that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must keep in mind that voting is their right and they have to vote.  This is what I came 
<br/>across during the Election, the ballot papers could not be taken to them and they are far in the rural 
<br/>areas, how can they access postal ballot.  So, it is just more awareness and how we can compromise 
<br/>to see that the elderly and disability get the chance to vote, because it is their right and they have to 
<br/>vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some are just deprived of this because they cannot come to the voting station, which is unfair 
<br/>on that end.  Once again, with regards to our electoral system, it needs more awareness on the ground.  
<br/>With  that  note,  Sir,  I  commend  the  previous  Committee  for  their  Report  and  thank  the  current 
<br/>Standing Committee on this Report and I thank all honourable Members on their contribution to the 
<br/>motion on the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.
