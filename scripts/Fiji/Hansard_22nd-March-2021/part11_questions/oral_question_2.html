<p>Government Support – Tourism Industry Recovery Efforts 

(Question No. 49/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Given that the prolonged border closure and pandemic continue to have a dire impact 

on the Fijian tourism industry, can the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism 

and Transport update Parliament on how the Ministry is supporting recovery efforts for the 

industry?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA (Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport).- Thank you,  Mr. 

Speaker. Sir, I apologise in advance that my answer is a little bit lengthy but I think it is best heard.  

Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for the question.</p>
<p>Last Friday on 19th March, actually marked one year since our first case of COVID-19 and 

the weeks and months that have followed simply meant 40 percent of our GDP is lost.  But for all 

the hardship, the year has actually ushered in and has also given us a unique opportunity to reflect on 

the future of the industry, and the Fijian Government has always come together to prepare.</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the Fijian Excellence and Tourism Awards, the Honourable 

Prime Minister acknowledged the industry’s stalwarts for their contribution to the Fijian economy 

and how we have laid the groundwork when the first case finally came to Fiji.</p>
<p>Page 87</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are in a position today because we prepared ourselves even before the 

first case.  We knew it was only a matter of time and although the suffering we have seen has no 

dollar value and can never truly be measured in mere facts and figures, we can actually proudly say 

that we did a great job.</p>
<p>With respect to the tourism response team, Sir, our preparation is largely attributed to how 

we have come together as a nation to ramp up coordination, not only as different arms of Government 

but it has actually been hand in hand with the various industries and the communities and as Fijians. 

Through the TRT, we have addressed a number of unique issues with respect to the tourism industry.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Employment undertook an awareness on how employers should treat leave 

without pay and better work with employees. We have also accommodated exemption for marine 

vessel  surveys  which  will  now  be  issued  for  12  months  and  through  the  TRT,  the  industry  and 

Tourism  Fiji  were  already  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  to  create 

awareness  and  register all the frontline workers  and  everybody  else for when the next  batches of 

vaccines are made available, Sir.</p>
<p>In terms of budget relief, our historic 2020-2021 National Budget has undoubtedly been the 

driving force for most of our recovery effort, Sir, and Government has directly paid a $118 million 

in unemployment benefit which has largely gone to the tourism sector. The new tax incentives also 

in the Budget have kept the confidence of domestic investors and tourists arrival and we are actually 

realising the benefits. We had our “Love Our Locals Campaign” and since its inception last year, has 

been a key part of the tourism sector and what started with only hotels putting out specials for our 

locals has today encouraged tour and activity providers and transfers as well as restaurateurs to join 

the campaign and as of two weeks ago, we now have about 200 businesses from every region, actually 

signed up for it.</p>
<p>The local tourism market will be part of Tourism Fiji’s marketing strategies also even after 

the  borders  open,  Sir,  and  based  on  the  growing  success  of  our  “Love  Our  Locals”,  we  are  now 

embarking on the Pacific as a key source market and the preliminary focus will be to capitalise on 

existing leisure segment with the outlook of developing meetings, conventions and events. We have 

also  had the local events fund, Sir,  and the adaptation of the current  local  events  fund is  another 

initiative we are working on with the business community.  Our preparation also includes harnessing 

our  strengths  and  creating  the  actual  sectoral  linkages,  Sir,  and  we  are  looking  at  supporting  our 

MSMEs and including the requirement of having locally grown produce in the criteria for the funding 

and I think this was also mentioned earlier by the Honourable Minister for Agriculture about how we 

collaborate and get all of these things done.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the local  event  fund, Sir,  we have supported events  including the Fiji 

Festival in Suva, the Namosi Marathon, Beach Beats and Eats, Leleuvia Ocean Swim, A Sustainable 

Fashion with a Purpose and the Fiji Super 7s Series. With the other part of it also as the careFIJI 

commitment, Sir, with Fiji’s care and CFC programme we actually received global recognition by 

the World Travel and Tourism Council.  With this recognition, travellers can recognise destinations 

and businesses that are adopting health and hygiene protocols that are aligned with WTTC’s Global 

Safe Travels Protocols.</p>
<p>Sir, this may seem just like word but it is actually a very important component in terms of 

people making decisions about when travel does open and they actually get to Fiji.  So, to date, we 

have  registered  nearly  200  wellness  ambassadors  across  the  industry  with  about  400  businesses 

signed up and as I am updating this particular House, Sir, with the support, the Ministry of Health 

and Medical Services, we are out actually conducting second round of the CFC roadshow.  Sir, with 

the CRMT, also it has now been over 330 days since our last case outside of the border quarantine</p>
<p>Page 88</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>727</p>
<p>and much of the success is owed to the Fijian COVID Safe Economic Recovery Framework under 

which we have implemented safe entry both the leisure and non-leisure travel and to date, Sir, we 

have welcomed about 103 yachts, 438 passenger and crew under the Blue Lanes and these yachts 

actually arrived via Port Denarau Marina. To spread the associated economic activities, we are now 

working with relevant stakeholders also to see if we can designate Savusavu as an additional port of 

entry and as we all know Savusavu is a wonderful destination for yachters.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had mentioned in August in the House the last time, we continue to work 

with our industry partners to find new ways to encourage safe travel to Fiji, for instance, there is a 

programme called “work from home” or what we termed as “work in paradise”.  We call it, “work 

in paradise” where visitors who can stay longer and spend more money in the local economy.</p>
<p>Regionally  also,  we  have  introductory  meetings  with  New  Caledonia  and  Tuvalu  health 

officials to try and explore some quarantine, free travel and of course, there are number of variables 

to consider on this and at the moment, discussions with New Caledonia have actually being put on 

hold, Sir, in light of the community outbreak.</p>
<p>With Tuvalu, we are progressing to share health protocols and COVID-19 safe protocols to 

ensure this is done acceptably and therefore as a Pacific Pathway concern, progresses are actually 

being made, Sir.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Sir, I spoke about Fiji Airways and its partnership with the Tourism 

Industry.  I am putting together a 150,000 fully inclusive holiday packages in anticipation of borders 

reopening.    This  was  the  result  of  $60  million  travel  stiffen    and  commitment  by  the  Fijian 

Government in the last Budget and a quick meeting with Fiji Airways about a week ago, Sir.  We 

will  be  trying  to  get  that  done  as  quickly  as  possible,  and  as  soon  as  the  border  is  open  that  is 

something that is actually important to us.</p>
<p>Of course, no amount of preparation will ever get the industry back on its feet if we do not 

have visitor numbers resuming to the pre-COVID-19 levels and whilst support will continue we are 

actually still pushing very hard, Sir, despite all the negative publicity with our key markets; Australia 

and New Zealand, to open their doors to Fiji.</p>
<p>We are hopeful, Sir, with the vaccines, we are in a better position to actually make this happen.  

Tourism is certainly alive and well, Sir, and the industry will in most definitely a major part of our 

vital  recovery  plans  and  that  has  sustained  our  economic  growth  for  almost  a  decade.    We  will 

succeed, Sir, thank you very much.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    Honourable  Nawaikula,  your</p>
<p>supplementary question.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Considering the vaccination, considering the local situation in our 

market countries, especially New Zealand and Australia, when does the Minister expect things to 

return to normal?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I will give you the floor, Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, if  I have the answer, I would charge him for it, Sir.  It is the $100 

million question, so there are so many parts to this equation and I am sure everyone in this House 

understands.  What everyone must remember, is first and foremost for us, as priority is the health 

well-being and safety of our citizens and that is it.  We start there, Sir, at the moment with the vaccines 

that are being made available, once we are all vaccinated and I urge you all to get registered, so that</p>
<p>Page 89</p>
<p>728</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>we can all get vaccinated.  Once we are all vaccinated, we are in an even better position than we are 

now to make our submission that we can with respect to try and get Aussies, Kiwis, et cetera, and it 

is not just the Aussies and Kiwis, there are also people in the US who may be able to travel once they 

get vaccinated.</p>
<p>It  is  all  a  process  but  in  terms  of  the  time,  Honourable  Nawaikula,  it  is  a  million  dollar</p>
<p>question, Sir.  If I had the answer, I would tell you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Viliame Gavoka, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Qantas has announced that they will only fly people</p>
<p>who  have been  immunised.  Has Fiji Airways made a similar statements?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA.- If he is asking that question, then obviously, we have not, Sir, but again, 

I know the article that the Honourable Member is referring to, they did an article in today’s paper 

and he was saying that Qantas is saying that.</p>
<p>But what we are doing now will eventually lead to a vaccination passport that people will 

have to carry and all of that is part of it.  The mechanics of how we do it, you need to understand, it 

is not just about giving vaccination and you jump on the plane, it has to be worked out as to how it 

is done.  Because of vaccination has its limitation also, registration is one of the other thing.</p>
<p>The Honourable Minister for Health has laid out how this vaccine actually works, et cetera 

and how we deal with other countries so, for Fiji Airways to just turn around right now and say, we 

are not going to fly or unless we are vaccinated would be a bit premature, Sir.  We have to ensure 

that all the other boxes have been ticked, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- We will move on.</p>
<p>The third Oral Question for today is for Honourable Saukuru to ask his question.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of Tsunami Warnings</p>
