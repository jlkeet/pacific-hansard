<p>(Question No. 55/2021)</p>
<p>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on</p>
<p>the Kidney Dialysis Facility in Nadera?</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE (Minister for Health and Medical Services).- Thank you, Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir and I thank the Honourable Member for that question.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  last  week  on  Thursday,  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  commissioned  and</p>
<p>officially opened the Fiji National Kidney Centre in Nadera.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  at  the  last  Parliamentary  Sitting,  there  were  discussions  about  what  was 

happening in the Nadera Dialysis Centre.  Certainly work was happening, as you may be aware that 

I have said in the initial Parliamentary sitting that we have been able to have a Senior Biomedical 

Technician  accredited  with  Fresenius,  the  German  provider  of  the  machine  that  was  actually 

installing in it.</p>
<p>We have 10 machines that are in the Centre with three reverse osmosis machines. These are 

machines by  which  water is  brought  through from  the piping system into these  reversed osmosis 

machine. They are cleaned by ultra violet light and also by many other filters to ensure that they are 

sterile and ready to be taken across to the machines and therefore being able to take away the toxins 

from the patients.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  what  is  more  important  is  the  fact  that  there  is  growth  in  our  nephrologist 

services. This has happened because of the fact that we have two consultant positions in nephrology 

in  the  Ministry  of  Health.    When  the  former  consultant  left,  it  was  advertised  and  through  a 

competitive recruitment process through OMRS, an Australian applied and came across and he is our</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Head of Nephrology now within the Ministry of Health and also in Fiji. So we have the presence here 

both in Suva and also in Lautoka, we have the capacity to actually look after 40 Fijians in Suva at 

the moment. There is also a capacity to increase the dialysis to 180 sessions a week.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the fact that they are offering this nephrology service and actually providing 

advise around it is the opportunity to also rescue Fijians from not having dialysis so that they can be 

able to have treatment to prevent them from having dialysis and that is  also one of the important 

things that the Fiji National Kidney Centre would be able to provide. We are also now looking at 

being able to look at being able to look at other means to be able to provide this service outside of 

Suva for chronic dialysis.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister. Honourable Members, that brings us to 

the  end  of  today’s  sitting.  I  thank  you  all  for  your  co-operation  and  contributions  to  today’s 

proceedings.  Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. We adjourn.</p>
<p>The Parliament adjourned at 7.23 p.m.</p>
