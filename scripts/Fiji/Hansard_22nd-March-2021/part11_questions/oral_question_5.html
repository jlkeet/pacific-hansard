<p>(Question No. 52/2021)</p>
<p>HON. RATU S. MATANITOBUA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update</p>
<p>Parliament on the initiatives to make land available for agricultural development?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY  (Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment).-  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, we are working very hard in terms of assisting farmers so that they can have land for 

cultivation and there are a number of ways we are doing that.  One is that our Ministry is working 

very closely with iTLTB.  They are having regular meetings with the Deputy General Manager as to 

how we could facilitate.  We do get direct requests from new investors for land in various parts of 

the country where they prefer to undertake commercial farming.  That is one way we are facilitating 

availability and access to land.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, secondly, Government through the budget has allocated $6.9 million under 

the Committee on the Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL) Programme, to assist in subsidising rental 

rates for farmers so that the landowners are able to get the true rent while the farmers or new farmers 

are not affected or not incentivized to rent that particular piece of land and undertake farming.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a pretty successful programme which started a number of years ago 

and this yearâ€™s budget has got $6.9 million.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are number of allocations which 

is there to incentivize farmers to expand commercial agriculture as well as new farmers to come in 

and take advantage of those assistance to undertake commercial farming.</p>
<p>For example Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sustainable Land Management Programme has $0.3 million 

dollars; Agriculture Extension Services to provide technical advice has about $0.6 million; Export 

Promotion Programme that helps both the exporters as well as the farmers link to the exporters  - 

$0.25 million;  Food  Security  Programme to  ring-fence the rural  interior,  maritime, households to 

secure their households with respect to food and nutrition has an allocation of $0.25 million.</p>
<p>We  have  an  allocation  for  coconut  farming,  ginger  farming  $0.6  million,  flat  land 

development  so that  we  undertake clearing and development  of land so that  farmers  can use that 

particular land for cultivation.  That particular scheme is there for the Demand Driven Agriculture 

(DDA) programme.  The farmers are given the assistance or land clearing at zero cost to them.</p>
<p>Access  road,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $0.8  million  is  allocated  to  construct  access  roads  so  that 

farmers are able to access the land or get their produce and have an access to the market.  Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, without having these farm roads, it is very difficult to have that value chain operate efficiently.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>We have a livestock extension programme under which we have beef, goats, sheep and cattle.  So, 

all in all we have got allocation for different crop and livestock to allow and incentivise and assist 

farmers to get into agriculture and expand so that we can push commercial agriculture.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on to the sixth Oral Question for today.  I now</p>
<p>call on the Honourable Sharma to ask his question.</p>
