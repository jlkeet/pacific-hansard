<p>Japanese Aid – Fight Against Crime 

(Question No. 53/2021)</p>
<p>HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 

Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on how the $5.5 million 

aid from Japan will contribute to the fight against crime, particularly in maritime zones?</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU (Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, 

Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management).-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Again 

we are thankful to the Japanese Government for this package of $5.5 million and the initial discussion 

started back in 2017 as well under the Japan’s Grant Aid for the economic and social development 

programme, under Japan’s International Corporation Assistance (JICA).</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this assistance will come  in two batches, if I would say.  I have already 

received the first part of it and the remaining component probably will be arriving into the country 

around  June  and July  period.    What  we  have  received  so  far,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  includes  11  rigid 

inflated boats, we have 22 rescue boats, underwater camera unit, underwater communication system 

and diving and training equipment.  This will definitely assist the Police Force in so many ways, 

particularly, in dealing with crimes here in Fiji, in investigations of various crimes, particularly in 

maritime and rural zones, drug raids, including attendance to some of the court cases and conducting 

community outreach programmes to raise awareness on preventative measures of curbing crime.</p>
<p>Additionally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  equipment  will  also  assist  us  in  terms  of  our  role  in 

assisting other Ministries, for example, Ministry of Fisheries on illegal fishing in the rural areas which 

is a concern, particularly, to the resource owners.  This will assist us in that regard too.  Furthermore, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, the equipment will also assist our first line responders when it comes to disasters, 

particularly, with the rescue boats that I have mentioned apart from the 11 rigid inflated boats.</p>
<p>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  mentioned  about  underwater  communication  systems, 

cameras,  et  cetera.    These  equipment  will  strengthen  our  police  maritime  and  marine  capabilities 

during drug operations through intercepting unlicenced boats and yachts in Fiji’s waters, monitoring 

transponders on ocean floor pursuing suspects on water, filming illegal activities above and under 

water and for routine maritime patrols. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, Honourable Minister. We will move on to the next question</p>
<p>and I give the floor to the Honourable Kepa to ask her question.  You have the floor, Madam.</p>
