<p>Plans to Minimise Flooding – Ba Town 

(Question No. 51/2021)</p>
<p>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update</p>
<p>Parliament on the Ministry’s plans to minimise flooding in and around Ba Town?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY  (Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment).-  Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Honourable Member for asking the question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ba Town has been severely affected by recent  floods.  The contributing 

factor of course is the excessive rain that is happening in the catchment and downstream as well.  But 

one of the ways to quickly solve that problem to some extent, is to clear off the Ba River so that the 

excessive water that comes downstream can be discharged in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2015 was the last time when the Ba River was addressed. Following that 

we thought that you know Ba River could be cleared by a company which is undertaking iron mining. 

Unfortunately that company has their own interest. We have decided that we will dredge the Ba River 

for five kilometres downstream from the Ba Bridge and 14 kilometres upstream from the Ba Bridge 

a total of 19 kilometres. We have advertised, calling for expression of interest from the private sector 

to partner with us to undertake dredging of the Ba River.</p>
<p>The  expression  of  interest  closed  last  Friday.  We  wish  to  select  not  one  but  a  number  of 

companies and engage them in cleaning up the Ba River and pay the royalty and take the material 

and sell it so that they can make their money.</p>
<p>Of  course  there  are  certain  processes  that  need  to  be  followed  which  we  our  part  we  are 

undertaking, for example, we are now undertaking scoping of the entire 19 kilometres.  We will be 

getting the fishing rights waiver, we will be going through the process at the Ministry of Lands to 

fulfil all the obligations there and with their concurrence, we will be engaging a number of operators 

to dredge the Ba River.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we had to do that, it will cost us no less than about $3 million a total of 

1.5cubic metres of silt material that needs to be dredged from Ba River.  The last time we did 1.4 

million cubic metres of silt material was excavated four times starting from 2012 to 2015.  So, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, if everything goes as per plan, we intend to engage a number of contractors maybe in a 

few months’ time.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the river mouth has an exclusive licence to the mining companies and are 

in discussion with them through the Ministry of Lands to do the rightful thing, to move the machine, 

to open up the river mouth.  If they do not do that then, we will have to relook at their contract because 

they cannot hold the Ba community at ransom.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>731</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Nawaikula, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Does the Ministry have enough money to pay for all that?</p>
<p>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is precisely the problem with those people 

from the other side.  I have just said that we are engaging a number of contracts for private sector 

where in partnership they will undertake the dredging and then they will pay the royalty, take the silt 

material, sell it and make money. Not a single cent they will have to spend.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on.  The fifth Oral Question for today, I call</p>
<p>on the Honourable Ratu Matanitobua to ask his question.  You have the floor.</p>
