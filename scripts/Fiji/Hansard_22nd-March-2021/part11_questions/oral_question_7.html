(Question No. 54/2021)</p>
<p>HON. RO T.V. KEPA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Page 94</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>733</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts update Parliament on 

the  status  of  the  survey  conducted  by  Save  the  Children  Fiji  and  the  Ministry  on  school 

dropouts that was announced in October 2020?</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR (Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.  The Honourable Prime Minister, Honourable Cabinet colleagues and Members of Parliament, I 

rise to answer the question asked by Honourable Kepa in Parliament today.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to correct the question. The survey conducted was by the 

Ministry and our Fiji Programme Support Facility funded by DFAT.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can start 

by saying that we at the Ministry are very focused on implementing the Fiji Government’s “No Child 

Left Behind Commitment” and we have as a Government made substantial investments in ensuring 

education is made accessible and affordable to all the children of Fiji.</p>
<p>The FijiFirst Government has implemented a number of initiatives that directly benefit the 

education sector and the children of Fiji. One such initiative is the Tuition Fee Free Grant which we 

also call FEG. That is aimed at ensuring that parents do not have to bear the full burden of sending 

their children to schools.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Free Education Grant was introduced in 2014, it not only provided 

relief to the parents but also encouraged children who had dropped out of schools to re-enrol. The 

initiative initially recorded 215 students who had re-enrolled and I feel that was a great achievement. 

In 2013, we had a total of 203,157 students enrolled in our schools, 135,526 primary and 67,631 in 

secondary. Today, that figure stands at 221,637 students in all our primary and secondary school.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the Fijian Government continues to make significant investment in 

ensuring that we do not leave any child behind, there are several factors that often force children out 

of  schools.  The  last  survey  was  conducted  in  2018  on  the  causes  of  student  dropouts  in  primary 

schools in Fiji and it revealed that more children leave school due to abuse, disability, other economic 

factors such as poverty, health problems and social factors. The Ministry has since then reviewed a 

number of its policies on child protection, behaviour management and counselling policy to ensure 

our children are given the appropriate forms of assistance and support so that they remain engaged 

and committed towards their academic ambitions.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the pandemic last year, the Ministry engaged the services of the Fiji 

Programme  Support  Facility  to  conduct  an  evidence-based  survey  on  the  out  of  school  children, 

school age children who have never enrolled in a primary school or who have dropped out and are 

no  longer  attending  school  and  this  survey  will  help  us  initiate  and  form  policies  to  bring  these 

children back to school.</p>
<p>The report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is here with me. It is in the final draft stage. This will be formally 

handed to the Ministry by DFAT in a couple of weeks and during my tea break, Honourable Kepa 

has shown a keen interest in receiving a copy of this. Honourable Kepa, I will definitely make it 

available to you and all the other Members who are interested to know and help us towards getting 

these children back in school. Like I said, there are various factors.</p>
<p>The report has been compiled in consultation with our relevant stakeholders and this includes; 

the Save the Children Fund, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), 

Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, Fiji Bureau of Statistics, the Fiji Disabled 

Federation and our teacher unions.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it may not be in our capacity to address all factors that force children 

out of schools, we have been in a position to extend support to those dropouts due to poverty reason. 

The Ministry has provided support to families who are not able to send children to schools and again 

this is done in partnership with our various stakeholders who keep our children at heart.</p>
<p>Through  collaboration  with  our  donor  partners  including  DFAT,  UNICEF,  private  sector 

organisations  in  Fiji,  NGOs  and  religious  organisations.    This  year,  we  have  assisted  more  than 

10,000 affected students across the country through the provision of school bags and stationery.  We 

have also assisted 93 students in the Northern Division with shoes and uniform.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are currently working with the Australian Government (DFAT Sector) 

to provide food assistance to 19 schools in the Western Division and the 33 schools in the Northern 

Division, out of which 23 are boarding schools.</p>
<p>Students in these identified schools are being assisted with lunches as well.  Students in the 

boarding schools are being provided with breakfast, lunch and dinner.  This programme was initiated 

after we identified schools and communities that had their farms destroyed afterTC YasaandTC 

Ana.  This programme will go on for 12 weeks and we will allow communities to normalise their 

farming resources.  We have also engaged members of the community such as our mother’s club and 

village groups in assisting, preparing and serving meals to our children.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through programmes like this, we will be assisting 6,280 students, 1,728 in 

the Western Division and 4,552 in the Northern Division.  We are also working with our Fiji Police 

Force to identify children wondering off the streets of towns and cities and put them back in schools.  

I am proud to say that I have received funding and support from the Prime Minister’s Office to look 

at street kids initiative and as of today, we have successfully put two students back in school who 

will be monitored to ensure that they do not fall out again.</p>
<p>We have a number of students we have profiled in the Central Division with our Police Force 

and who we will work with the parents to put them back in school.  I had a meeting with the parents 

last week and the reasons given by the parents were varying factors.  Of course, we sympathise with 

the parents and one of the things that came out quite clear was, some students really do not want to 

go to school.  These students will be put through counselling, but I am proud to say that I have put 

two students in school today and we have spoken to the Head of School to ensure that he continues 

to advise us of their attendance.  Like I said, we are not giving up on any child, but we need co-

operation from the parents and a whole of society approach to ensure that we assist our children.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  other  than  that,  as  a  Government,  we  continue  to  invest  in  a  conducive 

learning environment.  I will go back to what my colleague, the Honourable Minister for Women has 

said and actually plead to the Members of Parliament, we are right across, if you have issues with 

that, please talk to us and we will provide.</p>
<p>Honourable Salote Radrodro, this is in response to your social media post, you could just ask 

me, how long will it take for me to rebuild a school.  Five schools currently are awaiting approval 

from the Ministry of Economy.  I think we have just being given the green light, so construction will 

start next week.  These are the students who are currently in the tents.  We will be providing them 

with the semi-permanent structured buildings while we work to provide new buildings.</p>
<p>We  have  identified  15  schools  that  will  be  rebuilt,  we  have  secured  funding  for  that,  but 

obviously there is a process that needs to go through.  The contractors have given me six to ten weeks 

to  complete these buildings.   They  are  at  Lekutu Secondary, Maramarua District  School,  Dreketi 

Primary School, Bua District School and Dama District School.  These schools within the next six to</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>735</p>
<p>ten weeks, I can assure the House that we will move the children out of the learning shelters and back 

into their classrooms.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Minister.  Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa?</p>
<p>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- I thank the Honourable Minister for her response where she mentions 

DFAT and the policy leaving no children behind and her evidence-based studies.  Just in case, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, if the Minister has some kind of comparative study which is being conducted by the 

Ministry to look at the trend of school dropouts because you did mention school dropouts.  If you 

have any comparative study done over say the past five years, if you have it available, if you could 

give me a copy?    Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I am sure that will be the case.</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Yes, I have two documents in front of 

me, one is the report of the initial study done in 2018 and this report that I have in the final stage.  

Obviously these two documents do show trends.  Like I said, I will be sharing it with those interested 

from both sides of the House, so we can come up with solutions.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  We  move  on  to  the  eighth  Oral  Question  for  today  and  I  call  on  the</p>
<p>Honourable Veena Bhatnagar to ask her question.</p>
