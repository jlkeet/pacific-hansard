<p>(Question No. 50/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honorable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 

Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the effectiveness of 

our tsunami warning system?</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU (Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, 

Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I wish 

to thank the Honorable Member for raising this question.</p>
<p>The simple answer is, it is effective, can be improved and government is committed to making 

those improvements.  I will explain a bit, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  this work is shared between the Pacific 

Tsunami Warning Centre and the Mineral Resources Department, where they have the Seismology 

Observatory  Team  and, of course, the Ministry of Rural Development and Disaster Management.  

Basically,  tsunamis  will  be  triggered  by  earthquakes  in  terms  of  the  detection  and  monitoring  of 

earthquakes.</p>
<p>Page 90</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>729</p>
<p>We have about eight seismic stations in Fiji, in Dawasamu; Nasinu Village; Nabukelevu i Ra; 

Yasawa  i  Rara;  Mua  in  Taveuni;  Tubou  in  Lakeba  and  Dogotuki  in  Vanua  Levu.    Those  are  the 

seismic stations, Sir, and we have three tide gauges, one in Lautoka Wharf, one in Suva Wharf and 

one in Vatia in the Ba and Tavua area.</p>
<p>The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre helps us as well, particularly with their voice and they 

are relaying information and the voice work through satellites and they give us advance information 

as well, usually within the range of 15 minutes but it has come down now to lesser than 15 minutes.  

Apart from the detection, communicating the information perhaps, is where some of our challenges 

lie but as I have said, it can be improved and Government is committed to make the improvements, 

particularly to our people in the rural islands where there is no Vodafone or mobile phone coverage.</p>
<p>What Government did through a Japanese funded aid few years back, was to improve on the 

AM  stations  and  that  has  helped  us  in  communicating,  particularly  with  the  extreme  rural  areas.  

Mobile  applications  and  the  use  of  mobile  phones,  we  are  still  in  discussions  with  the  service 

providers, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Of course, there is a modem that we are currently exploring, it is with 

Singapore that we are hopeful that we can procure and have it with the service providers apart from 

the blast text we use, particularly, during disasters and COVID-19, but we are also looking at a system 

where through the modem, every mobile user will be alerted through this modem that will be with 

the service providers and with the Ministry of Rural Development through the NDMO office as well.</p>
<p>We  have  the  early  warning  systems,  we  have  our  disaster  risk  reduction  in  the  Suva 

Peninsular, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we started a few years back with an initial three sirens and then added 

a few more.  Now we have about 13 sirens within the greater Suva area, starting from Nadawa to 

Lami.  We have this concentration because that is the concentration of our economic activities as 

well and heavily populated too.</p>
<p>We  are  following  the  Honorable  Prime  Ministerâ€™s  meeting  with  his  Japanese  counterpart.  

Way back in 2017, we have also been able to secure some funding and that funding has been signed 

and confirmed that we will start this project in November this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where we will 

install an additional 26 sirens for Viti Levu.</p>
<p>Those  26  sirens,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  locations  have  been  identified.    It  will  start  from 

roughly the Kiuva area right up to Lautoka.  If you are interested in the details I have the locations 

that have already been identified given the technical aspects of the machine that we are getting.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the training of our people. Now, the village communities 

the Ministry has conducted over 300 trainings in almost all the four divisions - training our people to 

manage their own disaster responses should they receive alert.</p>
<p>So, that basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  the work  that we have done  as  I  have stated.    It  is 

effective for now but can be improved and, of course, Government is committed in making those 

improvements.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Honourable Saukuru?</p>
<p>HON. J. SAUKURU.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his response to that question.</p>
<p>My supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, our people have been asking why was a warning</p>
<p>not issued but later in the day on the 5th March this year, a retraction was issued?</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>22nd Mar., 2021</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Mr .Speaker, Sir. I have already stated in 

this Parliament there is a difference between alert and warning, so people are alerted.  Warning is 

only given if the signs and all the predictions are indicating that it is going to happen in terms of the 

height of the waves and when it is coming that is when the warning will be given.  But everyone is 

alerted initially, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, we will move on.</p>
