<p>Installation of New Boiler - CWM Hospital 

 (Question No. 48/2021)</p>
<p>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  inform  Parliament</p>
<p>when a new boiler will be installed at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital?</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE (Minister for Health and Medical Services).- Thank you, Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir, and I thank the Honourable Member for that question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the CWM Hospital used to have two boilers: one located at the East Wing 

and the second at the West Wing of the Hospital.  The one at the East Wing feeds the autoclave room, 

the operating theatres and the wards while the one in the West Wing provides steam and hot water to 

the laundry, kitchen and the West wards.  In the boiler room, there are two boilers.</p>
<p>In  2019,  the  Government  Tender  Board  approved  the  Ministry’s  request  to  purchase  two 

boilers: one for the East and one for the West Wing.  These machines were to replace the two older 

ones and the total cost was nearly F$800,000 and had come to their recommended life time and were 

due for replacement.</p>
<p>However,  the  preparation  towards  the  project  implementation  was  interrupted  by  the  fire 

incident in the West Wing boiler that not only destroyed the boiler machines but rather the entire 

CWM Hospital West Wing boiler room unusable after the technical assessment by the Ministry of 

Infrastructure and the subsequent identification of traces of asbestos in the boiler room infrastructure 

in May of 2019.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this was safely and hygienically removed by experts but this had significantly 

stalled the boiler replacement process.  The Ministry continued with the project, the purchasing of 

the new boiler with the contract signed in early 2020, however, there is a global procuring landscape 

that  has  been  affected,  the  supplier  from  New  Zealand  was  unable  to  source  the  boiler  from  the 

manufacturer at the same price.</p>
<p>The Ministry had deferred this project for further discussion with the Fiji Procurement Office 

and advice had been received that the tender needed to be recalled and changes in price and scope of 

works, and this is an ongoing process that is happening with the EPO.  Instead of two boilers, we 

have  now  made  a  presentation  to  have  one  boiler  repaired.    The  tender  documents  for  the  new 

purchase are currently undergoing through their own processes with the Ministry and the Ministry of 

Economy.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>725</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Is that the supplementary question you</p>
<p>wish to ask?</p>
<p>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Yes,  it  is,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  thank  the  Honourable 

Minister for his reply.  Would it be correct, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Hospital lacks the boiler, the 

health and well-being and safety of patients and staff are at risk?  I would like to ask the Honourable 

Minister, how has the absence of the boiler  contributed to  the rise of infections of surgical  cases 

which had been returning to the CWM Hospital and also how has this contributed to the lack of linen 

in the wards at the CWM Hospital?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  yet  to  see  any  evidence  that  the 

Honourable  Member  has  alluded  to.    What  evidence  does  she  have  that  there  has  been  a  rise  of 

infection?  I have just raised the point that there is a boiler that continues to exist in the East Wing.  

That boiler works and at the moment that is currently being used to be able to look after the theatre 

services.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the services in the West Wing of the Hospital, the boiler that is not working 

any more, obviously has been taken out because of the fire.  The services are predominantly laundry 

and has been through a competitive tender arrangement.  An outside contractor is actually providing 

the laundry services to the Hospital and the hot water and the steam needs of the Hospital kitchen are 

now back, met by gas and electricity, in essence certainly Fiji Gas came to the fore and talked to us 

about how we can be able to do this in utilising gas and also utilising electricity.  Our boiler exists 

on the East Wing of the Hospital.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on to the second Oral Question for today and</p>
<p>I give the floor to the Honourable O’Connor to ask his question.</p>
