<h3>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.-</h3>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to actually support the informal sector, Government 

actually introduced the “Stronger Together Job Support Scheme” and the concessional loan of Micro 

Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) which they all know about.  It is not like we are sitting 

around just doing nothing and twiddling our thumbs, we have done a lot already and we will do some 

more. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of the MSME loans, over $30 million was actually disbursed to 5,438 businesses and 

this  is  across  the  sectors  of  agriculture,  wholesale  and  retail,  food  and  hospitality,  transportation, 

manufacturing  and  other  service-driven  sectors  under  the  concessional  loan  facility  of  MSMEs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Under  the  Stronger  Together  Job  Support  Scheme,  a  total  of  70  employers  have  been 

approved worth around 1,081 new jobs, Sir.  In terms of MSMEs, the Fijian Government, since about 

2007,  has  invested  $90  million  dollars  into  the  MSME  sector,  our  livelihood  programme  that  is 

designed to support and develop MSMEs and create employment and diversify our economic base 

and ultimately alleviate poverty.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  have  actually  invested,  Sir,  and  these  are  the  amounts  that  are  under  the  various 

</span></p>
<p><span>programmes: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Young Entrepreneurship Scheme, we invested more than $200,000.   

(2)</span><span> </span><span>National Exports Strategy, we have invested more than $15 million.   

(3)</span><span> </span><span>Northern Development Programme, we have invested more than $10 million. 

(4)</span><span>

</span><span>IHRDP Programme, we have invested more than $2.8 million.  

(5)</span><span> </span><span>Micro Small Business Grant, we have invested more than $34 million. 

(6)</span><span> </span><span>Concessional loans of MSMEs, that is close to $30 million. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  really  this  is  such  a  good  thing  for  the  Honourable  Minister  so  we  are 

</span><span>actually so pleased and we are so proud to say that under the MSME concessional loans, close to 46 

percent are actually women entrepreneurs.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>697 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just quickly to finish off, Sir, visitor arrivals in 2020 declined by about 84 

percent to around 147,000 visitors.  Now, 147,000 visitors is similar to arrivals during the 1990s and 

I think that may have been when the Honourable Gavoka was at the Fiji Visitors Bureau. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The closure of the border, domestic movement restrictions, reduced domestic demands and 

continued uncertainty has weighed heavily on business activity, that is the truth, Sir.  They need to 

understand that.  The economic estimates have declined by 19 percent in 2020, has been a loss of 

GDP of around F$2 billion. It is not a simple task to be able to manage an economy at this particular 

point and juncture and that is not just for us, that is for any other country, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>It must be put into perspective honestly and truthfully like we do always, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

and you know, it is quite simple and I will sit down by just saying this, Sir: if you had a business 

from the tourism sector and you were earning let us say, for example, $2 billion and another billion 

from the airlines, that is $3 billion and overnight, you earn nothing, you would also suffer too, Sir.  

We do recognise that, but we have done a lot more than any other government prior to this.  Thank 

you, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his contribution to the debate.  I now 

give the floor to the Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviatoin.  You have 

the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  M.R.  VUNIWAQA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    First,  I  would  like  to  take  this 

opportunity  to  thank  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  for  their  Review  Report  on  the 

Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation’s  Annual  Reports  for  the  Years  2014  to 

2016/2017, that made a number of recommendations that I would like to firstly speak to.   

</span></p>
<p><span>One of the recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which has been referred to by the Opposition 

is  in  relation  to  the  need  to  liaise  closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy  to  ensure  that  adequate 

resources are provided for in any new programmes.  Like any other Ministry, not only the Ministry 

of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, this is something that happens every year through the 

budget  cycle, where Ministries would front up with their needs for the  year ahead and justify the 

resources that they asked for from the Ministry of Economy.  So, it is an ongoing initiative through 

the national budget consultation process.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On technology, the recommendation that is being made in relation to the upgrade of the ITC 

</span><span>system that the Ministry has and we totally agree, Mr. Speaker, Sir, something that is being referred 

</span><span>to by a number of Members on the Opposition side.  It is a need for the Ministry and something that 

as a Government, we have been working towards and I am happy to announce that we finally have 

the right platform in place to carry out the reforms, not only in relation to the IT System, but also in 

relation to the policies surrounding social protection and the programmes therein.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This came about, Mr. Speaker, Sir, through an assessment that was made by DFAT in 2019.  

It  is  a  fiduciary  risk  assessment  that  they  carried  out  on  the  social  protection  system  and  they 

identified the gaps  within the current  IT System that needed to  be addressed.   We sat  down with 

them, we went through the Report and we did accept that these are the needs of the Ministry which 

</span><span>Government has also endorsed and it is due to that that DFAT, you would recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

</span><span>poured almost $10 million into the Ministry late last year.  A portion of the money that  they had 

granted to us, was for these - a reform of the IT System, the Standing Operating Procedures around 

our programmes, and the capacity-building for officers who work in the Social Welfare Department.  

</span><span>It is a two-year reform programme.   

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 59</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government of Fiji within the current year’s budget, has also poured in half a million 

dollars to complement the $2.19 million that DFAT has put in, so that the two-year programme can 

take place and put in place a better and more effective ITC System for better service delivery to our 

over 80,000 beneficiaries, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So that is in play right now, as we speak.  To start off 

the process, Cabinet has already endorsed a social protection policy a few weeks back, that would 

lay the platform for all these reform programmes to carry on through the next two years.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to a few of the statements that have been made by the 

other side in today’s debate.  I must say that I have been listening with great interest and I noted that 

not many of them spoke on the Report itself.  A lot of the discussions and debate that have evolved 

in the House today, have been to do with poverty in Fiji, it is an important topic to discuss, yes.  But 

I am speaking about this in the context of parliamentary rules and procedures and having to speak on 

a Report that has been tabled, which has not been done properly, I felt.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But in any case, a lot has been said about the incidents of poverty as per the Household Income 

and Expenditure Survey 2019- 2020, and that Report has been used consistently by the other side to 

show  that  the  incidents  of  poverty  has  risen  from  28.1  percent  in  2013  to  29.9  percent  in  2020, 

comparing  two  Reports.    Yet,  I  did  not  once  hear  from  the  other  side,  about  any  qualification  in 

relation to the using of the 2019-2020 figures that the CEO for the Bureau of Statistics himself had 

stated in the Report that we have been using all day.  Page 1 of the Report actually says, and I would 

like to quote this: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The survey result also reflects the changes in the methodology and best practices 

in  household  welfare  measurement,  in  line  with  the  latest  international  and  regional 

guidance on aggregate construction and poverty measurement. The major adjustments in 

the  methodology  includes  the  using  of  consumption  expenditure  measures  over  the 

traditional income measures in welfare analysis.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, up until this 2019-2020 survey, we have been using, as a nation, a totally 

different methodology to measure poverty in Fiji.  For this Report, we have come up with  a new 

methodology and there is reason for that … 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  M.R.  VUNIWAQA.-  There  is  reason  for  that  and  good  reason  for  the  changing  of 

methodology.  In fact, the CEO for Fiji Bureau of Statistics (FBOS) goes on to say:  “Therefore, the 

survey result is not directly comparable to the previous HIES survey results.” And he went further to 

produce a five-page annexure to show the differences in the methodology that he has used and I have 

also been advised that as we speak, the World Bank is assisting …  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects)  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- We do not know that, Honourable Prasad.   It could be high, it 

</span><span>could be low, I do not know.  My point is, we are comparing apples to oranges and we should not do 

</span><span>that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is alright to cite the figure, it is alright to cite the figure of 29.9 percent  but it is simply 

</span><span>wrong to say that it has increased, given that we are using a different methodology this year. But, be 

</span><span>that as it may, the World Bank is now assisting the Bureau of Statistics … 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>699 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- …  in a write-up of the Poverty Assessment Report for Fiji, as 

part of the standard World Bank analytical package to contribute to the World Bank’s engagement 

for Fiji and the Pacific. Now, the Report will attempt a back casting of comparable poverty trends 

and  it  is  that  approach  that  will  then  allow  us  as  stakeholders,  to  make  a  direct  comparison  with 

previous HIES Surveys.  So, Mr. Speaker, be that as it may, yes, poverty is an important issue for us 

to be addressing now. The figures we are looking at now was prior to COVID-19 and we understand 

that. We understand that as a government, it is an important issue to address, so what are we doing 

about it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We do have a Poverty Monitoring Unit that monitors our programmes and policies across of 

government. The poverty reduction measures that Government has taken across ministries to see how 

effective it is and it is something that Honourable Professor Prasad had referred to in the statement 

that he made and I agree with it.  For every policy or programme that we put in place, it is important 

to be able to monitor and evaluate to see if it is effective, if the people that are being targeted are 

actually benefitting out of these programmes and it is something that the Poverty Monitoring Unit 

does on a daily basis.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Its latest report, Mr. Speaker, they looked at 22 programmes for the fiscal year 2019/2020. 

They looked at 22 programmes across 14 ministries.  It is a report that is being considered internally 

at the moment and will be tabled in Cabinet shortly, to be shared with my Cabinet colleagues, so it 

is not right to say that as a Government, we are coming up with programmes and we are not even 

sure  whether  they  are  working  or  not.  There  is  a  specific  government  department  whose  sole 

responsibility  is  to  monitor  and  evaluate  such  programmes  and  make  recommendations  to 

Government on gaps to address or opportunities that may arise.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, one of the Opposition Members, I think it was Honourable Salote Radrodro, 

who  referred  to  social  protection  as  creating  a  dependency  syndrome  and  says  that  it  does  not 

empower people.  So, I was listening to her whole contribution and trying to make sense out of that 

particular statement.  I was wondering whether is it, I do not know, I could be wrong, Honourable 

Radrodro, but what I was hearing was this. Why are we pouring money into social protection when 

we should be using that money to empower people to go into business? So, scrap social protection, 

get everyone to go into business.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Seriously! Seriously! Social protection can play and does play a key role in reducing poverty 

</span><span>and inequities. The whole world knows that. The Fijian Government knows that which is why Mr. 

Speaker, if we look at the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, Section 37, there is a constitutional 

guarantee of this right for every Fijian. The gaps that exist between the haves and the have nots, it is 

wide and this is why social protection systems are put in place in countries that can afford it to ensure 

that, that gap is narrowed down and that is why we have that social protection system in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  am  glad  that  over  the  years  since  the  inception  of  social  protection  systems  in  Fiji,  the 

welfare  system,  there  have  been  a  lot  of  studies  by  independent  bodies  and  we  are  talking  about 

World Bank, we are talking about some foreign governments that have done reviews of the social 

</span><span>protection system and one thing that these reports, these reviews came up with, was that they love 

</span><span>the idea that we have this social protection and that we need social protection systems in our country.  

They have come up with recommendations, and I will give an example.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Back in 2010 and 2011, the World Bank reviewed our social protection system at that time 

</span><span>and made recommendations that what  we used to  have then was the  Family Assistance Program.  

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 61</a></p>
<p><span>700 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>They recommended that it become more targeted that instead of family assistance, we do poverty 

benefit and introduce the proxy means debt, which is used now. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, what they were saying, yes, it is lovely to have a Social Protection System program, 

but it is important that you target the vulnerable groups that you are actually aiming at and make sure 

you get those people.  That is why those kind of recommendations have been implemented over the 

years.  That is why we started with the Poverty Benefits Scheme back then.  They also recommended 

that we come up with a Social Pension Scheme which we now have implemented over the years. 

</span></p>
<p><span>They also recommended for a Disability Allowance which we started implementing in 2018, 

so these reviews continued.  These interested stakeholders continued to look at our social protection 

system and they continued to tell us how to make them better.  One of them is what I referred to 

DFAT with their fiduciary assessment.  They have made recommendations for a reform with the IT 

system.  They went a step further and gave us $2.19 million for it.  So, these assessments continued 

to be done to make sure that our Social Protection System remains what it supposed to be addressing; 

the vulnerable people in our community. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Apart  from  that,  the  World  Bank  and  currently  is  the  World  Food  Programme,  they  are 

</span></p>
<p><span>looking also at the top ups that government give to a social welfare beneficiary post disasters. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years since </span><span>TC Winston, </span><span>the Fijian Government has been able to 

use the Social Protection System platform that we already have, to assist welfare beneficiaries post 

disasters and they have done this through top ups where beneficiaries get more than they normally 

do in a particular month. 

</span></p>
<p><span>That  particular  exercise  has  been  touted  as  international  best  practice  by  the  World  Bank 

where our Director for Social Welfare himself, was invited to Germany, I think it was 2018 or 2019 

to go and tell the rest of the world basically, what we did in Fiji post Winston and how this best 

practice that every country can adopt and it is something we should be proud of.  It is something to 

be proud about as a country. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Tell them, tell them! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  M.R.  VUNIWAQA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  was  also  a  question  that  I  wanted  to 

address that was posed by Honourable Salote Radrodro, I believe.  What is the Government’s intent 

</span><span>for moving programmes to the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation which is not 

</span><span>fully equipped to run programmes?  I believe she was referring to again </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>; the Home Care, 

the Help for Home Programmes that was happening. 

</span></p>
<p><span>One thing we need to understand, </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>was the first cyclone of its kind to hit us in this 

country and as a very responsive government, we had to look around and see the best machinery we 

already have in place that could deploy this assistance in the most effective way and quickly enough.  

Of course, it had to be us, because we already have the Social Protection platform in place.  Our 

officers are already very well versed….. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  M.R.  VUNIWAQA.-  ....with  the  communities  that  were  very  badly  affected  by  </span><span>TC 

</span><span>Winston.</span><span>  That is why it came to the ministry and when we started (because we have never done it 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 62</a></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>701 

</span></p>
<p><span>before), it was difficult.  We were running all over the place but by the end of the exercise, I would 

say, that the officers of the Ministry for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation did a great job in 

deploying the assistance that government needed to deploy at that time. 

</span></p>
<p><span>But that also enabled us as a ministry, which is something I believe that is also being raised 

in the report to come up with standard operating procedures in relation to these new events.  What 

can we do, what should we be doing if you are hit again by that kind of cyclone and Government 

decides to deploy again, the kind of assistance that we did post-</span><span>TC Winston</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, there was also mention about the budget for women’s project as an alternative 

to  social  protection.    I  have  said  this  so  many  times,  I  do  not  know  how  else  to  say  it,  the 

empowerment of women like poverty alleviation, is not something that belongs to my Ministry alone, 

to the Ministry for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation.   There are cross cutting issues that 

every Ministry has something to do with and as a former Director for Women, Honourable Salote 

Radrodro should know that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In relation to the budget for women, the economic empowerment or empowerment of women 

generally,  the  Ministry  this  year,  has  started  a  gender  transformative  institutional  capacity 

development  programme, starting with  nine agencies, eight  Ministries, plus the Fiji  Police Force, 

where for two years, gender experts from the Ministry and our partner non-government organisations 

will go into these Ministries,  look at their policies and their programmes and see that it is gender 

sensitive, that the opportunities that each Ministry has to empower women in the particular sector, to 

make sure that the policies and programmes that already exist in these Ministries, are actually gender 

sensitive and are doing all they can do in relation to the empowerment of women in Fiji.   Mr. 

Speaker, it is not a standalone issue, gender equality, empowerment of women, poverty alleviation, 

it is across of the Governments spectrum.   

</span></p>
<p><span>My final point, Mr. Speaker, is in relation to Honourable Nawaikula and his social media 

post.    I  am  saying  this  because  I  have  a  serious  request  on  behalf  of  over  80,000  social  welfare 

beneficiaries that we serve, as Members of Parliament, when we make these posts, people believe it, 

they listen and believe it.  His post was that this person receiving a pension was getting $100 and 

then kept reducing, that is wrong.  Social pension does not change, it only gets removed when the 

beneficiary dies.  So he posted it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>My  request  is  this,  we  have  Members  of  the  Opposition,  the  likes  of  Honourable  Aseri 

</span><span>Radrodro, who makes the effort to come to my office with the list of names of beneficiaries who may 

</span><span>have  issues  with  their  accounts,  and  we  help  them  out.    Then  we  have  the  likes  of  Honourable 

Nawaikula, who uses the circumstances of a social welfare beneficiary for political purposes.  It is 

wrong.  What we did, Mr. Speaker, in fact, when I read that, I called him up, he did not call me.  I 

called him, asking for the details. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- I wanted the details of the person who had gone to him so that I 

</span><span>could  find  out  what  was  wrong.    He  finally  forwarded  me  the  information  in  relation  to  this 

beneficiary and I called the number he gave, it was his brother because the beneficiary is in the place 

that had no communication, so that is fine.

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>We managed to speak to his brother and found out that he is not on the social pension scheme.  

He was not on pension.  So my advice to his brother was to transfer him to the pension and to come 

to our office.  So, my request Honourable Members, when you come across these kind of cases when 

people come to  you for  assistance because of  your position as Parliamentarians, do not  use it for 

political football, but come to me.  Bring the issues to us and we will help. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for her contribution to the debate. I now 

call on the Chairperson for the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to speak in reply.  You have 

the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I do not have any further comments. Thank 

</span></p>
<p><span>you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the contents of 

the Report.  I remind Honourable Members that once the vote is taken on the motion it ends there 

and the Report will not be debated again in Parliament.  This will be the case for all the Standing 

Committee Reports that will be debated this week.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Question put.

<p><span>Motion agreed to.

<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, Honourable Members for your contribution to the debate on 

</span></p>
<p><span>that Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to 

sitting  times  I  will  now  a  suspension  motion  to  be  moved  and  I  now  call  on  the  Leader  of  the 

Government in Parliament to move his motion. You have the floor, Sir.
