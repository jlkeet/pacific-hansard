</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations, Youth and Sports; 

(2)</span><span> </span><span>Minister for Local Government, Housing and Community Development; and 

(3)</span><span> </span><span>Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministers may speak for up to 20 minutes.  After the Minister, I will then invite the Leader 

of the Opposition or his designate to speak on the statement for no longer than five minutes. There 

will also be a response from the Leader of the National Federation Party or his designate, to also 

speak for five minutes. There will be no other debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  upon  the  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and 

</span></p>
<p><span>Industrial Relations, Youth and Sports, to deliver his Statement. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Progress on the Workmens’ Compensation and ILO Conventions adopted since 1996 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to inform this august House on the progress of 

the workmen’s compensation cases currently dealt with by my Ministry, which relates to injuries and 

deaths that have occurred during and in the course of employment till 31st December, 2018.  I will 

then speak on the ILO Conventions, recommendations and protocols adopted since 1996.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, worker’s compensation is an important element of the work of the 

Ministry to ensure that the rights of workers and employers in such instances are looked after under 

the  ambit  of  the  relevant  legislations.    It  also  ensures  that  we  have  in  place  regulations  and 

implementation frameworks to ensure that rightful compensation is made where it is due.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through progressive labour reforms implemented by the Fijian Government, 

the Workmen’s Compensation Act  1964 was repealed, and the Accident  Compensation Act  2017 

came into force on 1st January, 2019.  From 1st January, 2019, any workplace accident is reported 

to and investigated by the Accident Compensation Commission of Fiji.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  quickly  recap  on  the  total  number  of  worker’s 

compensation cases that my Ministry has dealt with over the 10-year period from 2008 until 31st 

December, 2018.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go on to the figures, let me briefly explain the investigation process. 

This involves locating workers that have changed addresses and have left employment, refer workers 

for  final  medical  assessments  and  send  compensation  claims  to  employers,  extract  employment 

</span><span>details, interview workers, workmates and dependents for death cases.   The outcome of the cases are 

</span><span>determined by the doctors that have undergone the Impairment Assessment Training. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has trained some 200 doctors nationwide from 2010 to 2018 

to carryout final medical assessment on workplace injuries and deaths using the American Medical 

Guide. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the 10-year period, there were a total of 11,558 cases reported to my 

Ministry and these cases were investigated. These reported cases comprise of 86 percent injury and 

</span><span>14 percent death cases.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  total  of  4,007  injury  cases  were  paid  out,  amounting  to  a  sum  of 

$15,460,996.02.  This comprises of 2,941 private sector injury cases with a compensation payment 

of  $8,576,548.15  and  1,066  injury  cases  for  Government  with  the  compensation  payment  of 

$6,884,447.87.

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>647 

</span></p>
<p><span>Over  the  same  period,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  were  a  total  of  563  deaths  with  a  total 

compensation paid at $13,296,413.76.  This comprises a total of 65 death cases in the private sector 

with  compensation  of  $1,510,185.42,  as  compared  to  498  deaths  in  the  public  sector  and  a  total 

compensation of $11,786,228.32.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to report that over the 10-year period, my Ministry managed 

to settle and closed 10,768 cases, equivalent to 93 percent of all the reported cases.  In total, over the 

same period, and as of 12th March, 2021, the total compensation payment of $28,757,409.78 was 

made to the workers who were injured during the period.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reported compensation cases over the last five years revealed that the 

top four high risk industries where majority of the reported workplace accidents occurred were the 

construction industry, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels, manufacturing and among 

statutory authorities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the 790 pending, I wish to further clarify that my Ministry has completed 

the process  of 50 percent  of the cases  and this comprises of 166 cases,   which  is  21 percent  for 

unallocated workers; 62  cases, eight percent awaiting medical reports from the Ministry of Health; 

133 cases which is 17 percent are before the Employment Relations Tribunal for determination; and 

30  cases  which  is  equivalent  to  4  percent  are  still  on  recovery  period  before  the  final  medical 

assessment is carried out.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  remaining  50  percent  or  395  pending  cases  are  currently  under  investigation  by  my 

Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and to clear these pending 395 cases, my Ministry has implemented the 

following measures: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span><span>(2)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>establish Taskforce teams in all Divisions from 27th February, 2019 till todate; 

close  liaison  with  the  consultant  in  conducting  final  medical  assessment  for  injured 

workers to determine the percentage of permanent disability; and 

continue to publish names of unlocated workers in my Ministry’s </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The main challenge for my Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in resolving these pending cases that 

have occurred until 31st December, 2018 is that, these pending cases were all subject to the mandated 

procedures under the repealed Workmen’s Compensation Act 1964, where the cases are disputed by 

the employers based on a fault-based system.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was also the main reason why the FijiFirst Government reformed the 

Worker’s Compensation Scheme in 2019 to establish the Accident Compensation Commission of 

Fiji under the no-fault-based system. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly,  the  high  mobility  of  workers  and  former  workers  locally  and  overseas  which 

resulted in the Ministry having great difficulty in locating those clients, despite the numerous media 

marketing approaches taken, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  release  of  claims  through  delayed  payments  from  the  employers  is  another  major 

challenge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as these are vital for the Ministry to process and pay out to the workers 

and conclude the cases.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  wish  to  thank  all  our  stakeholders  and  partners  working  with  my 

Ministry during these  years for  the investigation  and resolution  of the Workmen’s Compensation 

cases.

Recommendation 2015 (No. 204).

Recommendation 206 - Violence and Harassment Recommendation 2019 (No. 206). 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the intent to bring these recommendations and conventions to the attention 

of this House is to assure that Fiji remains compliant with those Instruments or is in the process of 

gaining compliance.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, compliance is not an automatic process and in some instances, requires a 

considerable planning and implementation phase before compliance is achieved.  The important thing 

to note from this listing of ILO Instruments is that, Fiji has been part of the conversation and global 

reforms under this world body, to ensure that the rights of workers are respected and all aspects of it 

is enshrined in the respective legislation.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, moving forward, Fiji will continue to be part of this conversation and work 

closely with ILO and local stakeholders, to ensure that we have a productive and protected workforce. 

I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement.  I now give 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor to the designate of the Leader of the Opposition.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Leader of the Opposition is unwell today and has sent his apologies.  I give the floor to 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Leawere.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable Minister for 

his  Ministerial  Statement.    From  the  outset,  I  would  say  that  the  workers  of  this  country  are  the 

backbone of the economy and also, they are the nuts and the bolts that make the engine room ticking 

and they are very, very important in terms of our moving forward. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last five years, there was no annual report tabled 

in this august House, as required by law, from the Ministry of Employment.  The Annual Report was 

tabled in 2016, so the statistics that are available are five years old. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R.  LEAWERE.-  It  is  sad to  see this disregard for the workers in  Fiji,  where the 

Ministry does not see fit to ensure his annual report is tabled and work of his Ministry is properly 

evaluated.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  Shadow  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial 

Relations,  I must raise the concern of the workers or the plight of the 115,000 laid off by the tourism 

industry  and  workers  downstream,  affected  by  the  travel  restrictions  as  a  result  of  the  pandemic.  

However, Sir, if the Government had been prudent, the nation would not be over-leveraged and there 

would be funds and resources available to cushion the impacts of the pandemic. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to the management of worker’s compensation, I am glad that 

the Ministry has been working on the massive backlog of cases.  However, all cases after January 

2019 should now be referred to the Accident Compensation Commission of Fiji and the onus is on 

the Ministry to speed up and dispose off all pending cases to 31st December, 2018, so that workers 

and their dependants are duly compensated.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Minister went on to say that the number continues to rise 

and we believe that this year, it must not drag its feet and conduct due diligence as most of these 

workers and their families suffer with the delay in paying out the compensation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight the continuing breach of the labour laws by employers. 

I  have  received  complaints  of  employers  who  do  not  issue  written  contracts  to  their  workers  as 

required  by  the  law  and  then  terminate  them  at  will.    When  workers  seek  a  certificate  of  their 

termination to seek FNPF assistance, employers often delay or never write the letters.  This grave 

injustice, Mr. Speaker, Sir, must be looked at by the Ministry as required by the law, and employers 

are not keeping two sets of records for their workers.   

</span></p>
<p><span>My  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is;  what  is  Government  doing  for  the  laid-off  workers,  in 

particular from the tourism industry?  While Government is channelling resources into infrastructure 

development  and  capital  projects,  there  should  be  more  assistance  for  alternative  livelihoods  for 

workers who have been laid off.  I also wish to appeal to employers to keep workers employed on 

reduced pay hours or pay, but, please, keep them employed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  2019  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  (HIES),  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  was 

conducted before COVID-19 pandemic revealed that poverty has increased in Fiji.  If a similar survey 

is conducted today, the poverty figure must be higher because over 100,000 workers have just lost 

their  jobs.    There  is  a  dire  situation  in  this  country  for  these  workers  and  their  families,  who  are 

struggling today to send children to school and feed their families.  Government’s mismanagement 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>651 

</span></p>
<p><span>of  the  economy  since  2006  has,  unfortunately,  resulted  in  the  current  dire  straits,  and  beautiful 

speeches in Parliament cannot hide this fact.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your indulgence, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for his contribution.  I now give the floor 

to the Leader of the National Federation Party, the Honourable Professor Biman Prasad.  You have 

the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable 

Minister for his Statement.  I am particularly pleased that he was able to provide a 10-year summary 

of the details of the worker’s compensation.  I think that that is the kind of statistics this House should 

appreciate and I want to thank the Honourable Minister for putting that out very clearly.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  only  thing  that  I  have  a  concern  with,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  compensation  is  that, the 

Honourable Minister did not talk about the timeliness and the time that was involved in the lodgement 

of a particular complaint or accident and when and how it was resolved, so I think that would be 

interesting statistics as well.  Although in 10 years, it sounds that the compensation might be big but 

if you divide that on an average, it is about less than 1,000 cases that have been dealt with, and half 

of them would have probably got the compensation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But  the  second  part  of  the  Honourable  Minister’s  Statement,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  very 

interesting and this is where,  I think, it is quite shameful that Fiji has not been able to adhere, in 

particular,  to  Convention  87  -  Freedom  of  Association  and  Protection  of  the  Right  to  Organise 

Convention 1948. 

</span></p>
<p><span>If  I  can  highlight  some  of  those  issues,  while  the  Honourable  Minister  said  that  we  have 

ratified, we understand that and the compliance will take time.  But I think the 109th Session of the 

International Labour Conference in Fiji is quite damning and I think it is high time that Fiji and the 

Government takes this matter seriously.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When you have these ILO sessions, when you talk about a particular country not complying 

or not facilitating, it affects the status, the confidence that we provide to the investors, and to those 

looking at Fiji.  And if I can just quote from this recent report on Fiji, especially on the trade union 

rights and civil liberties, this is what the Committee is saying, Mr. Speaker, and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“Recalling  the  independence  between  civil  liberties  and  trade  union  rights  and 

emphasising that a truly free and independent trade union movement can only develop in 

a  climate  free  from  violence,  pressure  and  threats  of  any  kind  against  the  leaders  and 

members of such organisations, the Committee requests the Government to make serious 

efforts  to  ensure  that  State  entities  and  the  officials  refrain  from  anti-union  practices 

including arrests, detention, violence, intimidation, harassment, interference in trade union 

activities  so as to contribute to an environment conducive to the full development of trade 

union rights.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  requests  the  Government  to  consider  issuing  instructions  to  the 

police and the armed forces in this regard and to provide training to ensure that any actions 

taken during demonstrations respect the basic civil liberties and fundamental labour rights 

of workers and employers.  Further the Committee firmly expects that any charges against 

Mr.  Anthony  related  to  the  exercise  of  his  trade  union  activities  will  be  immediately 

dropped.”

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>There are many other recommendations, Mr. Speaker, and the one that I want to quote also is 

the one on appointment of members to the functioning of the Employment Relations Advisory Board 

to review labour legislation and this is what the Committee says, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The  Committee  trusts  that  the  Government  will  refrain  from  any  undue 

interference  in  the  nomination  and  appointment  of  members  to  the  ERAB  and  to  other 

tripartite  bodies  and  will  ensure  that  the  social  partners  can  freely  designate  the 

representative.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee expects the appointment of ERAB members to take place without 

delay first to allow this mechanism to re-convene and meet regularly in order to pursue the 

labour law, review and meaningfully address all outstanding matters in this regard.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>There are several other recommendations and issues on this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to 

Convention  87.    There  is  one  on  the  Public  Order  (Amendment)  Decree  and  this  is  what  the 

Committee says, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The  Committee  urges  the  Government  to  take  the  necessary  measures  to  bring 

section 8 of the Public Order (Amendment) Decree into line with the Convention by fully 

repealing  or  amending  this  provision  so  as  to  ensure  that  the  right  to  assembly  may  be 

freely exercised.”              

</span></p>
<p><span>There are other recommendations, Mr. Speaker,  on Political Parties Decree on dissolution 

and suspension of organisations by administrative authority and then there is a recommendation on 

Convention 98 - Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention.   

</span></p>
<p><span>What  this  shows,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  that,  we  may  be  ratifying  conventions  and  the  Minister 

rightly said that compliance is the most important issue.  We can sign these international conventions 

and say that Fiji has signed it but what is the practice?  What is the compliance mechanism?  Are we 

changing the laws?  Are we making sure that we facilitate that?   

</span></p>
<p><span>At every session of the ILO, they have raised this issue about the Fiji Government’s failure 

to  address  the  compliance  issues  under  Convention  98  and  Convention  87.    This  is  what  this 

Government  should  focus  on  because  right  now,  we  are  trying  to  provide  confidence  to  the 

international community and we must do this as a matter of urgency.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Leader of the NFP for his contribution to the debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  that  concludes  that  part.  We  will  now  move  on  to  the  second 

Ministerial Statement for today and I now call on the Minister for Local Government, Housing and 

Community Development to deliver her Statement. You have the floor, Madam.  

</span></p>
<p><span>NFA Integrated Community Fire Warden and Emergency Framework  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  Honourable 

Ministers,  the Honourable  Leader of the Opposition,  the Honourable Members  of Parliament and 

members of the public; thank you for the opportunity to present to this august House the National 

Fire Authority’s (NFA) Integrated Community Fire Warden and Emergency Framework.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  want  to  outline  the  work  of  the  NFA  and  how  the 

Authority  meets  the  challenges  of  educating  Fijians  on  fire  safety  to  mitigate  and  minimise  the 

number of fires in Fiji.  

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>653 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Framework was launched by the Honourable Prime Minister on 27th 

February,  2021  at  Yako  Village  in  Nadi  to  create  awareness  and  a  state  of  preparedness  when  it 

comes to structural fires.  As owners of properties, each citizen has to take ownership and ensure that 

their properties have the necessary fire safety plans and equipment.  Having well-trained community 

fire wardens and certified fire safety communities is a step in that direction.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Yako Village have set the example for all other Fijians. As 

the Honourable Prime Minister had said at the launch, the best way to fight fire is to prevent fire, and 

that is the job of all citizens, not just our professional firefighters. The people of Yako have shown 

that they can keep their communities safe rather than being vulnerable and solely dependant on the 

NFA. The Framework is simply an integrated effort of the Government, private sector and our local 

communities to enhance resilience and to become stronger and robust.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the Framework essentially does is encourage behavioural change and 

genuine  shared  responsibility  for  emergency  preparedness.  We  want  to  build  a  connection  with 

communities and explore the opportunities for a truly community-centred approach.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the exhibition of skills learnt by the Yako community Fire and Emergency 

Response Wardens was absolutely magnificent to watch.   It was a proud moment for the community 

and the NFA as we witnessed how this initiative completely transformed the youths of Yako Village, 

who can now contribute more by serving their communities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  were  informed  by  the  community  elders  that  the  community  church 

which was once empty is now filled with these youths. They have taken a step forward by taking 

ownership of protecting their community. The purpose of this Framework is to minimise fires that 

we see as a regular occurrence, so what we are trying to do is create awareness amongst members of 

the community and give them a sense of responsibility and preparedness.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Minister responsible, I acknowledge with admiration the integrated 

effort inbuilt in the Framework which has brought the NFA, the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and 

the Fiji Police Force together to mould these youths.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The community fire wardens were trained on basic skills in lifesaving, evacuation, fire drills, 

awareness of community policing, sexual harassment, drugs and self-discipline. The launch of the 

Framework was the pinnacle of this initiation and the beginning of a five-year programme to be rolled 

out in Fiji.  In fact, 32 other communities in the Western, Central and Northern Divisions are ready 

to be a part of this Framework.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Framework will be rolled out, covering a total of 1,193 villages and 

settlements that are under the ambit of 302 District Advisory Counsellors.  With 50 percent of Fijian 

population  below  the  age  of  27½  years  and  69  percent  below  the  age  of  40  years,  we  have  the 

opportunity to engage many more Fijians under this Framework.  We can have a large population 

fully prepared to identify the structural issues that can be corrected to avoid fires, whilst also being 

prepared to deal with fires.   

</span></p>
<p><span>These youths will be appointed by the community and they must be physically and mentally 

capable to undertake training for the full duration, committed and a permanent resident of the subject 

community. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 55.9 percent of Fiji’s population reside in urban areas.  This is attributed to 

the extension of town boundaries, which are also the legal fire boundaries in accordance with the 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 15</a></p>
<p><span>654 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>National Fire Service Act 1994.  Approximately, 44.1 percent of Fiji’s population or 390,635 Fijians 

reside in rural areas. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this data is used by NFA for community survey and analysis, and includes 

the  identification  of  communities,  community  structure,  population  profiling  and  determining  the 

willingness of the community to participate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the role of NFA’s services has evolved since its establishment.  The essential 

services provided by the NFA no longer just evolves or involves firefighting.  They are also skilled 

in  responding  to  road  accident  rescue  operations,  hazardous  material  response,  search  and  rescue 

operations, flood and swift water rescue operations, providing emergency ambulance service, first 

aid assistance and carrying out urban search and rescue operations. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with Government’s assistance over the years, the NFA has been able to take 

its services closer to the communities.  They have been able to reach out to a large population to put 

a stop to the occurrence of unwanted fires and attend to emergencies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  number  of  fire  incidents  in  Fiji  is  alarming.    Fires  impact  people, 

property  and  the  environment.    In  some  cases,  the  losses  are  extraordinary,  causing  deaths, 

widespread damage to property and house contents.  We cannot imagine the pain of losing everything 

to a fire, including the lives of our people. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last five years, 46 persons lost their lives in fire incidents.  In 2021, 

there were three deaths as a result of house fire.  The effects are devastating to families and businesses 

and collectively can be substantial.   

</span></p>
<p><span>An  analysis  of  emergency  response  statistics  over  the  last  five  years  revealed  that  NFA 

responded to an average of over 4,600 calls, of which approximately 50 percent were on variety of 

fire-related emergencies, such as sugarcane, building or vehicle-related fire. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  greater  concern  is  the  number  of  structural  fires  that  have  occurred.  

Despite NFA having conducted numerous community awareness programmes, house to house visits 

and educational institutional programmes, the number of residential fire remains consistently high.  

The statistics analysed for the last five years have indicated that the NFA has responded to an average 

of 139 structural fires, of which 91 percent were for residential properties. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a slight drop in structural fires in 2020, in comparison to 2019.  

The NFA  attended 133 structural  fire incidents, in  2020, compared to  140 in  2019.  There was a 

significant drop in the number of commercial property fires in 2020 which was eight, compared to 

18 in 2019.  The reduction in commercial fires is indicative of the commitment by the private sector 

to engage NFA in commercial training programmes. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFA has conducted 84 commercial training programmes in 2019, compared 

to 54 in 2020 due to COVID-19.  The business sector also has annual inspections before compliance 

certificate is issued.  In addition, all commercial building construction plans are vetted for fire safety 

compliance. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The devastating impact of fire to everyone’s life can be crippling.  In 2019, the total estimated 

</span></p>
<p><span>value of property damages caused by fire was $22 million but in 2020 it was $13 million. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>655 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is, therefore, apparent that there is no room for being complacent based 

on these statistics.  It is envisaged that the integrated approach promoted in the Framework will assist 

in preventing and in dealing with emergencies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The NFA’s Strategic Plan for the period 2020-2025 outlines the strategies and commitment 

to  realise  the  vision  of  “Resilient  Communities  with  Effective  Emergency  Services”.    The  first 

strategic goal related to the Strategic Plan is the safety and prevention, which focusses on the need 

to deliver effective risk reduction guidance and activities to prevent fires and emergencies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The achievement of the first strategic goal is expected to result in: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>reduced likelihood of unwanted fires; 

increased preparedness for emergencies; 

communities’ ability to recover from emergencies better; and  

strengthen mechanisms for protection of critical facilities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is,  therefore,  imperative  that  an  integrated  community  approach  is 

initiated,  if  we  are  to  realise  resilient  communities  that  will  work  closely  with  the  fire  service  to 

effectively respond in the event of any emergency.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Integrated Community Fire Warden and Emergency Response Framework is the perfect 

example  of  the  integrated  approach  to  dealing  with  fire  emergencies.    It  is  a  guideline  to  ensure 

communities  are  central,  through  preparedness,  response  and  recovery  from  fires  and  other 

emergencies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Framework has been developed to provide guidance on the roles and 

activities of communities towards fire safety and the resilience in the face of any emergency.  This 

integrated community approach will enable NFA to work closely with communities and teach them 

to become first responders in the event of an emergency. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  whilst professional agencies, such as NFA, Police, NDMO and the Ministry 

of  Health  remain  at  the  forefront  of  emergency  planning  response  and  recovery,  the  Framework 

promotes  resilience  as  everyone’s  business.    The  model  for  this  Framework  involves  a  four-step 

process. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  first  and  important  step  is  the  identification  of  communities  and  their  willingness  to 

</span></p>
<p><span>participate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Step  2  relates  to  determining  the  readiness  level  of  the  community  and  identification  of 

distance from the nearest fire station topography of the area, building structures and building spacing, 

water supply and other water source provision. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3 relates to the development of strategies through workshops with the community and 

</span></p>
<p><span>its newly-appointed volunteer community fire wardens. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Step 4 relates to the sustainability of this programme where the Authority will ensure that 

quarterly refresher training workshops are conducted, along with monthly community engagements 

and meetings. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the important aspects of this integrated community initiative is the 

valuable role in identifying those with special needs and ensuring that no one is left behind in any 

emergency.  There are opportunities for the nearest fire station crew to involve the community fire 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>wardens  in  emergency  drills,  and  friendly  competitions  between  fire  warden  teams  and  nearby 

communities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the community fire wardens are issued with certificate on completion of 

their  training  with  the  NFA,  certifying  them  to  carry  out  their  roles  as  community  fire  wardens.  

Community fire wardens also conduct fire safety inspections of every house in their community.  The 

compliance level of the home is illustrated by a small coloured sticker pasted on the front door of 

that house.  A green colour sticker represents full compliance, amber represents semi-compliance 

and red represents non-compliance to fire safety. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this basically provides a snapshot on the fire safety compliance level of that 

</span></p>
<p><span>community which should give anyone a sense of security if the compliance sticker is green.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  believe  that  this  new  Framework  initiative  will  greatly  contribute  to  the  reduction  of 

property fire that is claiming properties and lives.  It will also make our youths more responsible 

towards their community.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the only way to fight fire is to make all Fijians become firefighters, making 

</span></p>
<p><span>them understand the risk of fire and the steps they need to take to eliminate that risk.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank our past and present firefighters and volunteers 

who are our true heroes  putting their lives in  danger to  protect  Fijians from  fire disaster  and any 

emergency.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to take the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for the Ministerial Statement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the designated speaker for the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, 

</span></p>
<p><span>the Honourable Tabuya.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The Integrated Community Fire Warden 

and  Emergency  Framework  sounds  like  a  very  fancy  phrase  but  let  us  look  at  the  reality  on  the 

ground, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Minister has not stated to us whether the fire stations around the country are 

operational, especially in the rural areas, to realise this particular proposed Framework.  For example, 

the Nabouwalu  Fire Station  building is  completed but  not  functional,  so  our people select  to  call 

Seaqaqa to get services.  How are they going to realise that?  

</span></p>
<p><span>We have thousands of villages in Fiji.  How are they going to cover those villages and what 

kind of budget is being allocated to realise this? We already hear a 50 percent down on revenue, what 

is the priority given to stopping fires?  Here, we have the Honourable Minister herself saying that the 

number of fires in Fiji is alarming, is it alarming enough to have a budgetary allocation?  We have 

not heard that from the Honourable Minister.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, we have a huge population.  We have heard from the Honourable Minister that 

there is about 44 percent of population in rural dwellings and then we have those who live in squatter 

and  informal  settlements,  in  homes  that  are  far  from  adequate.    My  question  to  the  Honourable 

Minister is; why is the NFA charging services for uninsured properties?  Why are they not telling 

this House about that?   

</span></p>
<p><span>I visited a family in Makoi whose house was burnt down.  Of course, they were distraught 

that they had lost their belongings, only to be informed later that they had to pay for the services.  

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 18</a></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>657 

</span></p>
<p><span>Why are our people who are already living in poverty and we are charging them services - our public 

service?  We are already paying taxes for our public service. Why are we slapping our poor people 

with the bill to pay for fire services?  Why are they paying double? Why did not the Honourable 

Minister answer that? 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the Honourable Minister talked about the needs of people with special needs, 

the need for them to be looked after.   I visited a home of a family in Davuilevu, whose house burnt 

down earlier this year.  They were just lucky that their mum who is bedridden, happened to be in 

hospital on that day, the night their house was burnt down. They live just a few doors away from the 

Davuilevu Fire Station.  The first truck came, they ran out of water.  When the second truck came 

and hooked up to the fire hydrant, it could not work. So, why has the Honourable Minister not told 

us that?   Are all the fire hydrants in Fiji being checked and operational?  What is the use of having 

these fire hydrants?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, the reality of the matter - this is what is happening on the ground.  Now, the Household 

and  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  of  2017,  there  was  no  question  on  whether  the  property  is 

insured.  It  asks about the material of the roof, the outer walls, are they getting water source and 

electricity source?  One simple question, how many homes are insured?   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is very important for us to know because obviously, if they are charging us, we have to 

be  able  to  see  how  the  Government  can  help  our  people  to  insure  their  property  so  that  there  is 

possibly less fires.  Perhaps, people feel more responsible but we hear that this is not even a question 

on this survey.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Recently,  Mr.  Speaker,  with  the  tropical  cyclones  we  have  had,  numerous  power  cuts  by 

Electricity Fiji Limited (EFL) and power surges that can threaten homes with fires, what is EFL doing 

about that?  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, our people are entitled to adequate housing which specifically connects back to 

that and if we are going to be charging people with those services, then ensure that our people can 

insure  their  homes.    Once  again,  we  are  targeting  our  people,  the  poorest,  who  live  in  uninsured 

homes across the nation and once again, the Government is slapping them with a double tax to pay 

for this service and they should be ashamed of themselves.  Our people are dealing with poverty and 

here we are – the Government charging them for this.  Remove this immediately, please!  Thank you, 

Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for her contribution to the debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Honourable Leader of the National Federation Party. You have the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would actually like to give 

some credit to the Honourable Minister for providing the details from the strategic framework.  I 

have had a quick glance at that Framework and I think it is important to have that Framework and 

also have a strategic plan.  But I fully concur with my colleague, Honourable Tabuya, about the lack 

of details as to what is involved in terms of providing the services.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I was told by a cane farmer in Tavua, who lives about seven kilometres away from Tavua 

Town that he had to actually pay $600 for a fire pole on his sugarcane farm.  So, we need some clarity 

and some details as to the nature of services that the NFA is going to provide?  Is it just confined to 

services to the ratepayers?

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Well, I will tell you more about horses and bullocks 

</span></p>
<p><span>later.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  think  it  is  not  clear  as  to  what  sort  of  charges  they  ought  to  pay  if  they  are  outside  the 

boundary of the town.  What is the framework in which they can operate?  What is the accessibility 

to  the  services  from  the  NFA  for  those  who  are  outside  of  the  town  boundary?    It  is  absolutely 

important.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I know the Honourable Minister talked about 1,193 villages and settlements and I think it is 

a good idea to provide capacity building - provide support to villages and settlements so that they 

understand the risks involved in a situation where you will have a fire.  But it is also important, Mr. 

Speaker, as alluded to by Honourable Tabuya, to know what sort of services they can provide and at 

what charges.  Invariably, those would be people who are poor, who are finding it difficult to make 

ends meet and on top of that, if you end up with a fire you have got to pay for those services so we 

need some clarity on that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, I also think that this is a very important subject. There is much 

more and I hope that the Honourable Minister will give another Ministerial Statement on a number 

of other issues under her portfolio with respect to deteriorating infrastructure in towns and cities, 

rates,  hikes  and  regulations.  There  are  lot  of  issues  that  the  Honourable  Minister  has  to  inform 

Parliament as to what and how she is dealing with it because those are very, very urgent issues right 

now facing our people in towns and cities.  I hope that the Honourable Minister would, Mr. Speaker, 

in the course of this week, provide a Ministerial Statement and address some of those issues that have 

been of concern to towns and ratepayers in all the towns and cities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Last week, Mr. Speaker, I was in Savusavu and there were serious issues about machines not 

working and drains not being cleaned.  I have complaints from town councils and cities about rubbish 

not  being  collected,  grass  not  being  cut.    These  are  very,  very  important  issues  that  people  are 

bringing to us on a daily basis and the Honourable Minister ought to provide an update as to what is 

happening and why is it not possible for town and city council administrators to deal with those issues 

in a timely, efficient and effective manner?  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Leader of the National Federation Party for his 

</span></p>
<p><span>contribution to the debate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, on that note, we will take an adjournment for refreshments and proceed

<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  will  proceed  with  the  third  Ministerial

</span></p>
<p><span>Recycling and Waste Management in Fiji 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Prime Minister, the Honourable 

Leader of the Opposition and Honourable Members, I would like to take this opportunity to inform 

this august House of the steps taken by the Ministry of Environment to address waste management 

through recycling in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Constitution  entitles  all  citizens  to  a  clean  and  healthy 

environment.  A clean and healthy environment is essential for the health and wellbeing of the public, 

as well as the natural ecosystems and their ability to continue to provide life-sustaining ecosystem 

services.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a clean environment does directly affect the health status, playing a major 

role in the quality of life, number of years of healthy life lived and other health disparities.  The built 

environment,  for  instance,  workplaces,  factories,  educational  institutions,  common  recreational 

spaces,  transit  systems,  et  cetera,  affects  both  individual  health  and  environmental  quality.    For 

example, recycling of products greatly reduces landfill waste and the resulting toxic pollution from 

the same. Of course, it results in financial savings and the circular economy.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are countries around the world who take great pride in marketing their 

country as a tourist destination by showcasing how clean their country is.  No visitor wants to visit a 

country whose environment is not clean as it can be a health hazard.  Countries in our neighbourhood 

have competitions amongst settlements and villages for clean environment.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  clean  environment  is  often  seen  from  the  perspective  of  humans  only.  

However,  the  three  components  of  the  environment  -  physical,  biological  and  social,  all  strongly 

interact with each other.  This phenomenon between the three enables sustainable life on earth. When 

there is an imbalance created amongst these three, that is when we see sustainability being threatened.  

A key imbalance occurs when we continue to use resources faster than they are being produced.  This 

is a human element contributing to the unsustainability on earth.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  clean  environment  is  a  binding  constraint  for  long  term 

sustainable  environmental  growth  and  development.    There  are  countries  which  are  struggling  to 

reverse damages to their environment, loss of habitat and species because they took their environment 

for granted.  Some argued along the lines of the famous economics Professor Simon Kuznets, who 

noted that as per capita income increases, people will be willing to spend a large share of their income 

on environmental goods and thus, any adverse impact on environment in the early stages of growth 

could be reversed after increases in income.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At that particular point in time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Simon Kuznets’ hypothesis was very famous 

and was thought to be a revolutionary argument.  However, over time, it was noted that this claim 

could  no  longer  be  supported  empirically  due  to  the  irreversible  nature  of  certain  environmental 

damages.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, environment must be seen synonymous to growth, they must 

go hand in hand.

<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question that arises then is; who generates waste?  Every one, every 

institution, every decision making unit, household, farmer, business, institution or the  educational 

institution, you name it, every decision making unit.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the waste generated by us, humans, has a great detrimental effect to the 

environment.    We  are  generating  far  too  much  waste  which  cannot  be  dealt  with  sustainably.  

Increasingly, waste that is not biodegradable is fast filling our oceans and landfills, let us say, plastic 

waste as an example.  A recent study found that of the 6.3 billion metric tonnes of plastic waste being 

produced, out of which only 9 percent of that plastic waste has been recycled.  Studies indicate that 

if we do not act now, there will be more plastics found in our oceans than the fish stocks by 2050.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  all  know,  the  negative  consequence  brought  about  by  rapid 

industrialisation and economic growth is, indeed, a large scale waste generation associated with the 

same.  Adding to this, there is an inherent behaviour to choose synthetic alternatives over  natural 

resources.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  danger  with  this  is  that,  as  income  continues  to  rise  particularly  in 

developing countries - movement from low income category to middle income category and from 

middle income category to high income category, people tend to lose their consciousness about the 

waste they are generating and their willingness to recycle or reduce the waste.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, solid waste management affects every human being, this is irrespective of 

individuals  managing  their  own  waste  or  the  Government  providing  these  services.    As  national 

spaces  around  the  world  urbanise,  develop  economically  and  grow  in  population,  a  World  Bank 

report estimates that waste generation will increase to 3.4 billion tonnes in 2050.   Sir, it is estimated 

that, at least, 33 percent of this waste is being mismanaged globally today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through history, humans have moved from small scale hunter gatherers and 

agrarian societies to more commercial and consumer-based societies.  We have essentially moved 

further away from economies that value the continuation of resources to a more disposal-oriented 

society.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Coming home, here in Fiji, the waste generated in the Central Division are reflective of waste 

generation patterns elsewhere in Fiji, assuming that to some degree of a margin of error, we can then 

use that as a proxy to say what is the situation with regards to waste distribution, waste generation 

distribution and disposal throughout Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an average Fijian produces about 0.7 kilogramme of waste per day.  Waste 

generated  in  the  Central  Division  can  be  split  into  two  major  categories  and  these  are  household 

wastes brought in by municipal councils and commercial and industrial wastes brought in by waste 

managers.  Both share an equal portion of the contribution with household wastes having a slightly 

bigger part of this portion.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have continued to exceed the year-on-year 90,000 tonnes mark at Naboro 

Landfill since 2017 and this is a clear reflection of the growth in consumerism of the economy and it 

is also a reflection that people are still not concerned and not undertaking, at least, by choice, reducing 

waste or recycling waste. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is estimated that production systems will devour about 140 billion tonnes 

a year of minerals, ores, fuel, fossil fuels and biomass by  2050 - three times the current consumption.  

Global food production alone needs to increase by 50 percent by 2050.

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, natural resources, such as water are in danger.  Agriculture alone already 

accounts  for  about  70  percent  of  global  water  consumption.  To  meet  such  huge  food  production 

increase,  the  two-thirds  of  the  water  withdrawn  from  the  rivers  of  the  earth,  lakes  and  aquifers 

currently used for irrigation will need to be dramatically increased and will need to take into account 

the entire natural sources and environment to consideration, if we want to meet up with this demand.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As I mentioned a few minutes ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the rate of plastic waste ending up 

in our oceans each year, it constitutes a serious threat to our ecosystems, wildlife and human health. 

In addition, it is also projected that about 20 percent of the world’s oil production will be used to 

make plastic and power the manufacturing of the same.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Given this grave scenario, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the urgent need for the hour is, while we continue 

to push for economic growth, we must not compromise on our environment. We are custodians of 

our environment for our future generations. They too have a right to enjoy the same level of natural 

resources and environment quality as we are enjoying now. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, we must look at waste reduction.  While we are talking 

about  recycling  that  comes  in  the  second  stage,  in  the  first  stage  we  must  look  within  at  our 

consumption processes and our production system to see how we can reduce waste.  If you are able 

to do that, then the recycling part will be much easier and a smaller lot to deal with.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to re-engineer our production process, we need to re-look at 

our  consumption  processes.    Waste  volumes  can  be  significantly  reduced,  if  waste  avoidance 

behaviours are adopted. This means, making a conscious change and choosing to select products that 

are not developed on a single use premises.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  must  make  attempts  to  recycle  waste,  at  least,  those  that  are  generated  by  us  and 

furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow others who are willing to recycle waste to pick up and use it.  

What happens is that sometimes, while we are creating or generating waste and we are not recycling 

it, we are then also stopping others who are willing to come and pick up that waste and use it or 

recycle it in their business process.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to change our mindset.  If we are 

not, for some reason or the other, are engaged in recycling and if there is someone, a third party, who 

is willing to pick it up and recycle it, let them do it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the re-use of waste is essential to ensuring that potential re-usable items do 

not have a premature end of life.  There are two positive externalities in that, waste management 

costs are avoided and delayed and the burden on natural raw material is delayed or totally avoided.  

For example, if we recycle paper while we  deal with an externality, a negative externality about 

reducing the paper waste going to the dump sites or into the natural resources environment but we 

are also delaying or avoiding a burden on the resources which is going to be utilised to produce these 

papers if we had not recycled the paper waste. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can deal with two outcomes 

with just a simple approach of recycling waste.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the theme for this year’s Global Recycling Day which was on 18th March 

is  our  “Recycling  Heroes”.    The  Ministry,  in  recognition  of  the  theme,  led  the  national 

commemoration of the recycling day - commending the efforts led by our heroes. These heroes could 

be our students, our children, individual households, farmers and business owners.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry promoted the vitality of recycling, called for action, for all 

Fijians to come together in one accord and put our country and the planet first, reigniting the mindset 

of communities, businesses, citizenry and individuals around Fiji. It was a day of reckoning to see 

recyclables as valued resources.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need a national movement. Individuals cannot say I am not contributing 

to it and therefore, I do not have to do anything because if the environment quality reduces, everyone 

will be affected whether you contributed or not, so the environment cannot be seen as a private good, 

rather environment quality is a public good, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the global economy stumbles due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 

international borders remain closed, nations have adapted to utilising locally available resources and 

live within their means.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of positives out of COVID-19 and one positive often 

cited  by  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  is  about  looking 

within, utilising the locally available resources.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an amazing opportunity for 

us to move forward as we get out of this COVID-19 pandemic.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the soaring costs and the challenges to cross-border transportation of raw 

materials have also made a meaningful dent into our thinking.  Businesses or business houses are 

now  relooking  at  this,  how  we  are  able  to  re-engineer  our  production  processes  while  we  are 

resourcing locally for the benefit of the economy and the people, but also we are reducing and saving 

on transportation costs.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recycling is the easiest way to protect our environment and protecting the 

wellbeing of our communities, the future generations to come. The success of recycling, however, 

depends on the active participation of every, every individual, every decision-making unit and I say 

the decision-making unit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whoever, whether it is a farmer, household, wherever the 

decisions are being taken, those decisions must include futuristic options, views and future scenarios.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Environment supports the efforts of our partners, individuals 

and companies to ensure that Fiji’s recycling sector emerges as a key solution to the environmental 

problems posed by poor waste management.  The Ministry embarked on several initiatives, to name 

a few. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On  Friday  last  week,  18th  March,  the  Ministry  launched  the  Framework  for  Zero  Waste 

Business Certification Programme targeting the private sector.  I am delighted to inform that there 

are several businesses that have volunteered to come on board for this Programme.  The first business 

to come on board this programme was McDonald’s Group Fiji.  Our hearty congratulations to them 

for taking this initiative or this important step, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry is creating a meaningful opportunity to transform plastic bottles, 

particularly.  We are currently working on Container Deposit Regulations (CDR) under the Environment 

Management Act 2005.  The CDR is one such system that will enable and incentivise and motivate people 

to rather than throwing the bottles, willingly collect it, taking it and depositing it for a small return. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this model of adding a mandatory value to the potential recyclables is expected 

to be extended to other waste forms based on its success with beverage containers, such as the PET bottles.  

Once we are able to trial this with these PET bottles, we could then extend it to other types of waste which 

could be treated in the same manner as PET bottles, which could be deposited in vending machines, et 

cetera. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is good potential  for  replicating such a system  with  other  difficult 

wastes, such as tyres, waste oil and derelict vehicles, to name a few.  You may ask; what is happening 

to all these used tyres?  Where are they going?  We need to begin somewhere.  We started with PET

</span></p>
<p><span>bottles and we will get there as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and ensure these waste products are utilised 

and recycled. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry will be finalising and putting forward a National 7 Policy so that Fiji and its 

institutions can align to the 7R concept.  The policy is intended to promote the concept supporting 

the circular economy model with the goal of forming a set of legislation to engrain circular economy 

into our everyday choices. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has also declared the Naboro Landfill area as a tax free 

zone, to allow for the setup of recycling ventures.  The Ministry has partnered with other relevant 

Ministries in promoting this zone and attracting investment groups.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry of Environment recognises the importance of recycling waste and safeguarding 

the  environment.    The  Environment  Management  Act  2005  sets  out  the  framework  for  waste 

management  and  pollution  control  in  Fiji.    The  Ministry  promotes  compliance  in  newer  ways  of 

surveillance and monitoring and support to our communities through the Waste Management Think 

Tanks established by the Ministry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have established a think-tank, a group of people, expertise in different 

areas on this matter only, given noting the gravity of this particular issue.  The Ministry cannot do it 

alone,  as  I  alluded  to  earlier  on.    We  need  a  national  movement  to  protect  our  country,  our 

environment, our natural resources, not only for ourselves but for future generations as well. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  global  community,  in  consistency  with  the  recycling  agenda  are 

recognising the efforts of the recycling heroes in their respective countries.  This includes the Civil 

Society Organisations (CSOs), business sectors, activists, students, et cetera. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to join my colleagues in the Ministry of Environment to motivate 

and call everyone in  this country to  join us in  this national  movement  to keep our country  clean.  

Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and I now 

give  the  floor  to  the  designated  speaker  for  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  Honourable  Salote 

Radrodro. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the Honourable Minister 

for the narratives on waste management and yes, we agree that it is a national concern which we must 

consider  very  seriously  because  waste,  as  he  alluded  to,  is  threatening  our  public  health,  our 

environment,  climate  and  humanity  as  a  whole.    Therefore,  the  question  I  ask  the  Honourable 

Minister Reddy is; how is the Government looking at waste as a valuable resource that can be re-

used and cycled as business opportunities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I know he touched on that briefly, but he did not come out strongly on what the Government 

can do rather than just talk about it.  What programmes are in place to be able to actualise their words.  

Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in waste from industries, mining and mineral extraction, 

logging, domestic and food waste, if not handled effectively, Fiji will fall deeper into the vicious 

cycle of poverty, as reflected in the 2019-2020 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make some recommendations which I hope the 

Honourable Minister responsible will not only listen and try and object to, but to hear and try and do 

something about it. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 25</a></p>
<p><span>664 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, Mr. Speaker, let us stop all these cake-cutting, marking all these international days 

and divert that money to assist in the clean-up campaigns and waste removals, particularly in the 

Nausori-Nasinu corridor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, is that before industries are established, they must be designed for 

recycling.  For example, Government should aggressively pursue research into the reuse of plastic 

bottles and tyres, as alluded to by the Honourable Minister.  But we must step up to that and have 

some kind of serious engineering research done so that those materials could be turned into industrial 

construction materials.  Maybe, that will also help in the maintenance of our roads, particularly the 

potholes. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  another  recommendation  is  that,  the  Government  must  revisit  their  failed 

promise  on  the  waste  transfer  station  for  the  Central  Division.    My  colleague,  the  Honourable 

Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations, Youth and Sports is smiling from the 

other side as he is very familiar with that because the project was not carried through.  We, on this 

side of the House, very strongly objected to the location, Honourable Minister, not to the idea of the 

project but to the location which was to be at Laqere.  We opposed that very strongly and then that 

saw the natural death of that project. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  am  requesting  the  Honourable  Minister  now  responsible,  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Agriculture, Waterways and Environment to revisit that project and try and revive it so that it is done 

because waste management is a very big issue.  It is a challenge in the Nausori-Nasinu corridor and 

if you will recall in my maiden speech, that was one of the issues I had highlighted  and we, on this 

side,  continuously  highlight  that  because  that  is  where  the  majority  or  bulk  of  our  residential 

communities are located. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, I heard the Honourable Minister touch on it but I would like us to look at 

it and take it to a level that a parliamentary committee be established to specifically look at this issue 

with the mindset that we turn our waste into wealth.  That can be done, Mr. Speaker, but it needs the 

commitment,  the  political  will  from  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  as  well  as  from  the  Acting 

Minister for Economy, and all Ministers responsible from the other side.  If it, in case, reaches and is 

tabled in Cabinet, that you all support it.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for her contribution to the debate.  I now 

give  the  floor  to  the  designated  speaker  for  the  National  Federation  Party,  the  Honourable 

Qereqeretabua.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  I  thank  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement earlier. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Minister is absolutely correct when he mentioned about tourists and visitors 

not wanting to visit a place where there is a lot of rubbish.  And as we try and push Australia and 

New  Zealand  to  open  their  borders  to  us,  I  think  that  should  be  front  and  centre  because  we  are 

struggling environmentally, and we will struggle to reverse or, at least, mitigate the degradation of 

our environment that we see all around us. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Last year, the Government tender portal, Mr. Speaker, made mention that a company called 

Shanghai Electrical had been awarded the operational tender for the Naboro Landfill.  I do not know 

when they will be taking over the Naboro Landfill, but I do hope and pray that their processes will 

be as strong as we see currently.

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, during your travels along the Queen’s Road, just out in Veisari before you get 

to the FMF biscuit factory, if you look over on the left, you will see one of the many eyesores on the 

Queen’s Road and this is a compound which was operated by a Chinese national, with the specific 

aim of collecting  and sending plastic and paper  waste to  China for recycling.  Unfortunately, the 

owner had to abandon the operation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If  you  go  past  now,  the  compound  is  full  of  plastic  bottles  and  other  waste,  and  is  now 

overgrown with vines and grass.  I understand that the site is now being remedied by the owner of 

the land.  Can the Honourable Minister, please, ensure that this does not happen again down the line? 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  collaboration  with  the  private  sector  from  the  Government  side,  I  hope  the  Ministry  in 

particular, the Department of Environment will really collaborate in good faith with the private sector.  

The Vunato Rubbish Dump is one that comes to mind when we are talking about waste management.  

The repeated fires and the leaching of plastics into the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>just outside Vunato is something that 

we must be thinking about.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, lecturing us on waste management is all well and good but trying to link that to 

the thousands of families who can only afford noodles packed in plastic. I would like to know what 

the Honourable Minister is doing in terms of working with production houses to make recyclable 

packaging easier and cheaper to produce in-house or in Fiji.  What kind of work is the Department 

of Environment and the Honourable Minister doing across the board to encourage things like the use 

of nappies, as opposed to diapers for communities where water and washing is not a problem?   

</span></p>
<p><span>The amount of glass that goes to the landfill could be broken down and used for sand-blasting 

at our shipyards, Mr Speaker.   The list goes on so just in terms of the Honourable Minister’s speech 

today,  it  is  great  to  lecture  everyone  but  I  want  to  know  the  amount  of  work  being  done  in 

collaboration  with  all  the  Ministries,  to  really  encourage,  support  and  reward  locals  for  using 

recyclable materials for composting, and the list goes on.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  her  contribution  to  the  debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, we will move on.
