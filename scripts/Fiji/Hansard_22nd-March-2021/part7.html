<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I now invite the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 

</span></p>
<p><span>to speak on his motion.  You have the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  

Alleviation oversees the Department of Social Welfare, Department of Women and Children and the 

Department of  Poverty Monitoring Unit.  The Ministry’s role is: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>to provide care and protection programme for children as stipulated under the relevant 

legislations; 

to  provide  social  protection  programme  for  the  disadvantaged,  older  persons  and 

disabilities; 

the administration of poverty alleviation programmes; 

the empowerment of women and gender mainstreaming; and 

to monitor, evaluate and report on the progress and impact of the  Integrated National 

Poverty Eradication Programme.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee,  upon  being  referred  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 

Alleviation Annual Reports, invited its senior officials on Thursday, 28th March, 2019 for a public 

hearing.    During  this  meeting,  officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 

Alleviation enlightened the Committee on numerous programmes funded by Government and donor 

partners,  future  plans  and  initiatives  aligning  to  the  Ministry’s  strategic  goals,  execution  of  new 

proposed plans and pending projects and overall operations aligned to SDGs and the measures that 

are being taken by the Ministry to progress the SDGs.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee noted the changes in the Ministry’s focus from the sole provision of social 

protection programmes to a planned, programmatic</span><span> </span><span>approach towards prevention, new innovations, 

graduating  welfare  to  workfare,  new  communication  campaigns  for  child  abuse  and  community 

directed programmes on violence against women.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As  the  Ministry  responsible  for  care  and  protection  of  children,  women  and  the 

disadvantaged, people with disabilities and older persons, it continues to provide social protection, 

gender  mainstreaming  and  empowerment  programmes  to  address  people’s  needs  and  alleviate 

poverty.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee commends the work of the committed and motivated individuals, who have 

</span><span>worked together to bring the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation to newer heights.  

</span><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Chairperson.  Honourable Members, the floor is 

</span></p>
<p><span>now open for debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Honourable Viliame Gavoka.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    As  we  deliberate  on  this  Report,  Mr. 

</span><span>Speaker, I would like to focus primarily on the Poverty Alleviation Programmes and raise the serious 

</span><span>concern of SODELPA that Fiji is falling into a vicious cycle of poverty and debt trap.  This is very 

concerning, Mr. Speaker, and if I could define what vicious cycle of poverty is, it is a set of events 

or factors by which poverty, once started will continue, unless there is sustainable intervention and 

commitment in the implementation.   

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>667 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, this House needs to focus on sustainable intervention on what we face today, as 

it is quite obvious and evident across the country that poverty is a huge issue in our country.   Over 

the last six years, poverty has increased from 28.1 percent to 30 percent. This is prior to COVID-19 

and one asks the question; where is the boom in all these?  We have been hearing about the boom 

but in actual fact, poverty has been increasing.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  all  know  what  the  figures  are  and  they  are  very  worrying,  actually  very 

depressing.  At least, 115,000 people have lost their jobs in the formal sector.  This is not including 

the underemployment in the informal sector.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If 115,000 people, Mr. Speaker, have lost their jobs and it comes down to one in each family, 

you are talking about 575,000 people in this country who are now facing extreme hardship.  For a 

country  of  less  than  a  million  people,  this  is  quite  worrying,  Mr.  Speaker.  This  is  a  very  serious 

concern to our Party and we need to look at remedial actions on how to arrest all these, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  some  key  indicators  -  revenue  is  down  by  50  percent.  This  is  despite  the 

reduction in revenue of 50 percent that has been put in place by the Government.  Employment, as I 

have said, is down and the key economic sectors, Mr. Speaker, are also under-performing.  Visitor 

arrivals we all know, why? Electricity is down, mahogany is 98 percent down, reduction in Value 

Added  Tax  (VAT),  commercial  banks  for  lending  is  down,  cement  production  is  down  and  job 

advertisement is down. This is all from the Reserve Bank of Fiji Report, as late as February.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  debt  level,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  now  73.2  percent  of  GDP,  domestic  debt  is  $5.1  billion, 

external debt is $1.7 billion and this is not including the $1 billion from the World Bank and from 

Japan.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, we need to have immediate measures in place to reduce expenditure. I know 

that salary cuts have been put in place but in some areas, the highest paid need to have a 25 percent 

reduction in their pay but this is not happening.  We are not talking about pay across-the-board but it 

is to be pro rata, to reduce those at the highest level.  Mr.  Speaker, we can reduce the telecom costs, 

the purchase of goods and services by $20 million, unallocated debt payments worth $300 million, 

there are so many things we can do and that we can save about $755 million. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the financial market also needs to be reinvigorated.  If you look at the banks 

today,  there  is  low  appetite  for  borrowing.    We  should  incentivise  to  create  more  borrowing  and 

</span><span>reduce interest rates.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker, the overnight lending rate is 0.25 percent, yet some banks are still charging 

interest at 8 percent, 9 percent and 10 percent, so something is not right.  There is no confidence in 

the banks to lend at a more attractive rate to attract more investments. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We all know that liquidity is high - $844 million and, Mr. Speaker, I just want, at this time, 

for this Parliament to salute our people overseas who have remitted about $652 million last year (up 

to December), which is the highest ever.  We need this House to say, “thank you” to our people in 

overseas, who are now contributing to the second highest source of revenue to Fiji.  We should, as a 

</span><span>people, say, “thank you” to them.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We should do what we can to thank them.  In the Philippines, Mr.  Speaker, the size of a 

remittance is in billions, I think it was $80 billion the last time I checked.  When they come back 

</span><span>from the Philippines, they are pampered by the people of the Philippines, who thank them for what

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>they are doing to their country.  So for us, this House must recognise our people from abroad who 

are sending this kind of money to keep us alive. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, some key  solutions  to  address  the  vicious cycle of poverty  include;  creating 

jobs, raising minimum wage, increasing income tax rebate on workers with more than three children, 

supporting paying equity, establishing cash for work programmes, investing in affordable child care 

and early education and expanding healthcare. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.    Speaker,  on  the  debt  trap,  get  rid  of  the  expensive  loan  portfolio,  restructure  and 

consolidate all debts and sell redundant assets - unfortunately, FijiFirst has sold all the assets in this 

country  so  we  do  not  have  much  more  to  go,  minimise  taking  additional  loans  and  restructure 

expenditure based on real revenue.  You dream up revenue that you cannot realise and you tag your 

expenditure according to that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>You need to live in the real world.  You are orbiting away from reality, Mr.  Speaker.  Reduce 

interest rates, get the RBF to relook at its policies, get RBF to relook at the rates and motivate the 

banks  to  lend  more,  stimulate  the  economy,  generate  tax  revenue  and  issue  debt  bond  to  local 

entrepreneurs.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker, you can do this.  Instead of borrowing from abroad, you can issue bonds locally 

</span></p>
<p><span>to big businesses.  You can raise money locally. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You do not know. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, easy to talk, this is what SODELPA can do, we know 

what we can do.  The problem with FijiFirst is that, they are now crippled, they cannot even think 

anymore.  The problem with FijiFirst is that, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Did we have a Bill here late last week?  They said, “Oh, we made a mistake to that Bill.  Can 

</span></p>
<p><span>we put it out?”   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- And there was TELS, and they said, “Oh, they are wrong!   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We cannot rely on this Government anymore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to 

</span></p>
<p><span>do it alone.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe on this point, the economy is in crisis.  There is a lack of confidence 

on  investment,  they  subdue  demand,  the  key  sectors  of  the  economy  are  not  performing.    We 

understand why tourism is not performing but what about mahogany?  What about fisheries?  What 

</span><span>about pine?  What about minerals?  Why is it that they are not performing? 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Tourism goes down, everything else goes down.

</span></p>
<p><span>669 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Stop talking in isolation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Stop talking in isolation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and there is inconsistency 

</span></p>
<p><span>in fiscal policy amongst other policies.  There is a need for a proper policy mix.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all we are saying is that, you have been doing it alone for one year now with 

COVID-19.    We  have  been  asking  you  to  be  more  inclusive,  to  be  a  bipartisan  and  include  the 

Opposition.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have spoken here in December last year about an economic summit.  I 

tabled a motion here and we talked about it, everyone together to look at the economy that is in crisis.  

You have proven to the people of Fiji that you cannot do it, so let us get everyone to sit in and do it.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if not, the cycle of poverty and the debt that we are in will stiffen everything 

in this country.  We are giving you some ideas on how to do it.  We are offering our assistance, we 

can help you do a better job of it.  It is best, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they come down from their high 

horses.  This  is  not  the time to  be grandstanding  and include everyone together in  the process  of 

reviving the economy of this country. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know most times with the FijiFirst, it is like having a dialogue with the 

deaf but I think they are running out of ideas.  It is time to say, “We are here, we can work together 

and we can make it better.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Gavoka.  I give the floor to the Honourable Ro 

</span></p>
<p><span>Teimumu Kepa.  You have the floor, madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- I thank the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on 

Social Affairs for this Review Report.  The national poverty rate, as outlined by our Party Leader in 

2013 and 2014 was 28.1 percent with the latest figures from the 2019-2020 Household Income and 

Expenditure Survey showing that poverty has increased to 30 percent.  This means that more people 

today are poorer than when the Annual Reports were written from 2014 to 2017.  This tells us, Sir, 

that 30 households out of every 100 households are deemed to be falling into the poverty category 

and this is a vicious cycle, bringing them into a deep debt trap which is difficult to get out of. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the issues raised in this Report which makes the work difficult for 

</span><span>the Ministry to manage is firstly, the geographical dispersion of their offices all around the city and 

</span><span>the country and trying to find enough room for the personnel and storage space for all the documents 

and equipment is not easy, since the Ministry has to manually do most of its work rather than storing 

it digitally. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In this regard Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the recommendations of this Report is that the Ministry 

should work closely with the Ministry of Economy and other stakeholders for appropriate resources 

to upgrade its ICT unit and to strengthen its network for setting up the Ministry’s database.  On 7th 

June, 2019, </span><span>fijivillage </span><span> stated that the digiFIJI App will create a people’s hub and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“So  that  when  someone  applies  for  Government  services,  peoples’  basic 

</span><span>information can be checked, if they qualify, for example, for social welfare assistance.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>This is highlighted in the OAG Report which was Parliamentary Paper No. 151 of 2019.   

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 31</a></p>
<p><span>670 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we hardly hear anything of this App.  Is the App working or not, 

to facilitate and assist the most needy, or was it just a lot of hype - a lot of talk but no action, to help 

the people who are waiting and hope that they will be assisted out of the cycle of poverty?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Another  recommendation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  the  Ministry  liaises  closely  with  the 

Ministry  of  Economy  to  ensure  that  adequate  resources  are  provided  for  any  new  programmes.  

According to this Review Report, which we are looking at presently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the years 

2014 to 2017, each year the Ministry is requested to take on new programmes, for example in 2016 

to 2017, it was the Help for Homes Initiative; in 2018 there were three new programmes, which were 

the Homes CARE, Bundle Insurance and the third one was the Bus Fare Top Up.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not only expected to juggle all the balls in the 

air without dropping any, but also to work miracles with a fixed budget on these programmes that 

requires rapid deployment of resources and funds with the Ministry having to adjust its initial budgets 

and  resources  to  accommodate  the  new  programmes.    Thus,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  this 

Report, disruption is caused under normal activities and plays additional stress on the resources that 

are available to the Ministry and impact on its output.   

</span></p>
<p><span>However, if you dig a bit deeper, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will find it is not as clear as it may 

seem on the surface or as addressed in the Review Report.  One such provision was in the 2016 to 

2017 Budget, item titled, Help for Homes Initiative, which was allocated $20 million.  In the 2018 to 

2019 Budget Estimate, this allocation was revised upwards to $44.9 million. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We must appreciate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this is not a programme as it was for only one year 

and it is a one-off project.  Although this Report states that it is the responsibility of the Ministry of 

Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, this Help for Homes Initiative was parked in Head 50, 

which is under the Minister for Economy.  Its implementation, according to the audit report, is by the 

Construction Implementation Unit which is understaffed but under the Ministry of Economy.  Why 

is this project, which is stated here in the Report, under the Department of Social Welfare, when the 

power  and  the  person  holding  full  authority  is  the  Minister  of  Economy,  where  he  makes  all  the 

decisions on this allocation?  This is very puzzling indeed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and poses more questions 

than answers.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Lastly, on social welfare, the audit report states that the life certificates were not issued to 

recipients  in  accordance  with  the  SOPs,  verification  from  FNPF  were  not  carried  out  before 

</span><span>approving pay-outs and in some instances, worryingly, payments were made to recipients who had 

</span><span>been deceased 12 years and beyond, which is depriving people qualified for assistance from receiving 

the help that they need.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  key  findings  that  were  noted  was  that,  it  was  the  internal  controls  that  needed  to  be 

managed better to ensure the Ministry evaluates and reviews it SOPs to ensure that application and 

payment processes are fully complied with, to halt the cycle of poverty and the death trap that people 

may get themselves into because of the systems inefficiency and ineffectiveness.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly enough, Mr. Speaker, according to the Auditor-General’s Audit Reports for the 

</span><span>year ending 2016, the Ministry of Economy’s Internal Audit and Governance Division carried out an 

</span><span>investigation for recipients  who breached the Help  for Homes  Initiative and the investigation has 

been handed over to the Police.  Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, the Chairman of the Committee in his right 

of reply, can update us on some of these programmes especially the Help for Homes Initiative which 

</span><span>sounded so promising when it was first introduced here in Parliament, and how these breaches are 

</span><span>being addressed as this can be revived and promoted from project to programme to assist people,

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>especially with the cyclones and other natural disasters that will continue to affect the country.  Thank 

you, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Kepa. I give the floor to the Honourable Professor 

</span></p>
<p><span>Prasad.  You have the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my view, this is a very important 

ministry and more important in the post-COVID scenario.  I have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, no doubt that 

the Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation is a competent Minister and 

that she would be taking into account some of the things that I am going to say and also probably 

respond to some of the questions that I am going to raise.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Obviously,  starting  from  where  Honourable  Gavoka  left  off  and  that  is  this  report,  Mr. 

Speaker, on the 2019 and 2020 HIES which was done before the onslaught of COVID-19 on our 

economy, if you compare this with the HIES done in 2013 and 2014, the poverty rate has actually 

increased.  It is a small increase, you might say, a big increase given the nature of the poverty that 

we  have  in  the  country,  but  the  fact  remains,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  all  the  policies  that  we  heard 

Government  was implementing supposedly to  reduce the poverty rate that  was there in  2013 and 

2014, has not worked.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Those  policies,  unfortunately,  have  failed.    Poverty  has  increased,  the  figures,  this  is 

Government’s  Bureau  of  Statistics  figure  which  says  that  the  poverty  level  in  this  country  has 

increased.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. Dr. M. Reddy interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- That means, Mr. Speaker, that the Government policies 

to reduce poverty - as an economist, I am afraid that he cannot understand the simple fact that the 

poverty rate has increased.  What the Honourable Minister should do in her Ministry is to order a 

special audit of all the supposedly poverty alleviation programmes that have been put in place over 

the last three or four years, all the  expenditure that we saw going into so-called poverty alleviation 

programmes in 2017 and 2018 must be audited, reviewed and analysed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I want to point out some figures, Mr. Speaker, because this is very important and I think part 

</span><span>of the responsibility of the Ministry, according to this report, is to monitor the poverty situation and 

basically the Ministry has no option but to look at this report.  This is Government’s own report, the 

Bureau of Statistics Report.  This is a very clear document on which the Government should now, 

going forward, put its policies, and design its policy programmes.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at the survey, 30 percent means about 258,000 individuals are living in poverty.  

If we add another 20 percent which means about 258,000 individuals who are always on the margin 

of poverty line, we could be looking at a poverty rate of about 50 percent right now in this country, 

Mr. Speaker, which means you are adding another 200,000 individuals falling below the poverty line.  

</span><span>And  as  Honourable  Gavoka  said,  if  150,000  people  have  lost  jobs,  the  statistics,  the  Report  also 

</span><span>shows  that  employment  income  makes  up  about  74  percent  of  the  total  household  income  which 

means that if that many people have actually lost jobs, then many more households would have fallen 

below the poverty line.

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other important  finding  from  this Report, Mr. Speaker, is that 62 percent  of the poor 

reside in rural areas and the Eastern and Northern Divisions obviously have higher poverty rates than 

the Western and Central Divisions, but this is like pre-COVID.  Post-COVID, Mr. Speaker, these 

scenarios  would  change.    I  mean  in  the  Western  Division,  particularly  Nadi  and  Sigatoka  areas, 

people would be badly affected.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the other important statistics (this is pre-COVID), if you look at the childhood 

poverty rates, it is about 34 percent of the total number of children under the age of 15 years.  So if 

you look at the total number of children under the age of 15 years, 34 percent are actually living in 

poverty.  The other interesting statistic, Mr. Speaker, from  this Report, is of the total  households 

which have more than three children. Of the total number of households in the country which have 

more than three children, 44 percent are living in poverty.  

</span></p>
<p><span>These are startling statistics, Mr. Speaker, and this is why I am saying, contrary to what the 

Honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment is mumbling from the other side, 

you have to look at how those policies work.  Why were we not able to reduce the poverty from 28 

percent  when  we  thought  that  all  these  policies  that  we  are  putting  in  place  are  going  to  reduce 

poverty?  It did not!   It is not about accepting the blame.  There is no shame in it to say if we had 

these policies.  Look at the small and medium enterprises, the $1,000 cash grants we are giving  - 

whether that worked, if it worked, how far did it work?  Why did it not work?  

</span></p>
<p><span>All governments, Mr. Speaker, throughout the world review these policies. You get experts 

to audit these policies, look at the impact, where were the pitfalls, was it in the implementation?  The 

policy  may  have  been  good.  The  intention  of  the  policy  may  have  been  good  but  the  actual 

implementation of the policy, Mr. Speaker, has not produced the result which shows that the poverty 

rate actually increased.  And if the Honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment 

wants to deny the Bureau of Statistics Report that the poverty has not increased, then there must be 

something wrong with him.  

</span></p>
<p><span>So, the issue, Mr. Speaker, is that we need to go back and review what was done before so 

that we can learn lessons but also so that we can design policies and programmes going forward that 

will have an impact on reducing poverty.  I said this before in Parliament, Mr. Speaker, that we have 

a situation post-COVID where our economy is in a very depressed state. The issue is how do we 

create demand and  I said, right now in the face of declining revenue, lack of physical space, any 

government in that situation, would look at three things. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, you make sure that our children get the best in education.  You do not cut the education 

expenditure.  Secondly, you make sure that health facilities are available.  Yes, we are concentrating 

on COVID-19, but there are other things, for example, when we say 62 percent of the poor reside in 

the rural areas and this is why we are emphasising the availability of medicine, the availability of 

services in the health centres and subdivisional hospitals, because these are the people who cannot 

afford to go to a private pharmacy and buy medicine.  They rely on public hospitals, they rely on 

public availability of medicine to cushion the impact of poverty on this group. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other point that I picked up and the Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa mentioned that is the 

</span><span>recommendation.  I thought these recommendations are very interesting, the two where it talks about 

</span><span>the ministry should liaise closely with the Ministry of Economy.  Those are two recommendations 

there and those are important recommendations because it is even more important now; post COVID-

19, because more and more people are going to  fall into poverty and if we must have a plan Mr. 

</span><span>Speaker, Sir, not for one year, next two years; we must have a plan for the next five years because 

</span><span>we are in a real economic strife.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>673 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is going to take about five years, even if we have the borders opening soon and we would 

like the  borders to open sooner than later.  Everyone is hoping and praying that it will happen, but 

even if that happens, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must think long term because it is not going to be anything 

before five years that we are able to bring the economy back on track and that means that we will 

have serious issues about poverty, loss of income, providing health facilities to our poor and that is 

why we need to look at education, health and income support. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I think this Ministry is going to be the most important ministry in terms of making sure that 

those who need the income support in fact, a lot of planning would require between the Ministry of 

Economy and the Ministry of Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation to be able to allocate 

enough resources at least, for the next two years when we are going to have these serious issues, I 

can tell you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can ask you to just remind the  Honourable Minister for Agriculture, 

Waterways and Environment if he has some intelligent interjections to make, I would appreciate that, 

but he is actually quiet annoying and  is distracting me from the points I am making. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I think Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important for us to look at income support and as I was 

saying, we, on a daily basis, and I am sure these Ministers are also getting that feedback from the 

ground. People are going to the Ministers, sometimes they go to the Ministers, they cannot get them 

and they come to us.  Many of them actually ask for numbers of the Ministers, so we have a list of 

numbers for all the Ministers in our office and we give it to them.  Because people are desperate, 

people want answers.  At least they want us, Members of Parliament, to talk to them and that is why, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important for us to give full support to this Ministry.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If we are cutting expenditure, we must look at where we can cut expenditure, so that we can 

divert resources to that ministry and I hope that it will be done in the Budget that this  Ministry is 

empowered to look at the most vulnerable, most needy which includes women and children, which 

includes poor in the rural areas, poor in the urban areas and squatter settlements.  They, at this point 

in time, would need the biggest support and that is what we need to do and we cannot afford to have 

a single cent wasted at this point in time.  That is why it is very important for all the Ministries to 

ensure  that  the  planning,  implementation  and  the  targets  that  they  are  setting  to  help  the  people 

actually gets to the people that is intended for. Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, we will have serious poverty 

issues in this country. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Professor Prasad. Honourable Salote Radrodro, 

</span></p>
<p><span>you have the floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, I have my list of speakers here and I am going to go by this list.  If you 

</span></p>
<p><span>indicate late, you will go late.  You have the floor, Madam.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to 

contribute to the debate on this Ministerial report.  I would like to highlight on Page 7 the roles and 

responsibilities of the Poverty Monitoring Unit and relate that to the recommendations that have been 

given in regards  to provision of resources, human resources and other equipment and also to the  

</span><span>establishment of database.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst we have heard the contribution from Honourable Gavoka and Honourable Professor 

Prasad, focussing on the increasing rate of poverty as given by the statistical news on 8th February, 

</span><span>this  Unit,  Mr. 

2021, I believe the most recent statistic on our poverty rate in Fiji.   However, 

</span><span>Speaker, is a very small unit in the Ministry, it is not well equipped in regards to its human resources, 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 35</a></p>
<p><span>674 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>to be able to carry out that important role of evaluating Government’s poverty related programmes 

and policies.  And like as has already been alluded to, the policies are there, the programmes are there 

but they are not working.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  regards  to  the  Ministerial  name,  it  says  “Poverty  Alleviation”,  major  percentage  of  the 

budget goes to the Social Welfare recipients and we note that there is an increase in this allocation 

over  the  years.  We  must  try  not  to  mislead  the  people  in  saying  that,  that  contributes  to  poverty 

alleviation, Mr. Speaker.  Really what that contributes to is creating a dependency syndrome mindset 

in our country.  So the policy in Government having to increase this social welfare allocation does 

not really empower our people in regards maybe, if they give more allocation to the Department of 

Women  so  that there  could  be  more  small  and medium  enterprises  or  projects  that  women  could 

apply for or women’s group could apply for, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span>That is an important aspect that the Government must relook at in having to place the Poverty 

Monitoring Unit in that  Ministry.  I remember before, it was placed with the Office of the Prime 

Minister. In my view, that is correctly placed, it must be there or working together with the Ministry 

of Economy to  be able to evaluate effectively the effectiveness  of these  programmes that tries to 

address poverty alleviation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  on  Page  8,  I  would  like  to  touch  on  this  to  enlighten  us  more  on  these 

programmes  which  the  Ministry  has  been  given  after  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  and  they  were  home  initiative, 

Home Care Programme, bus card top-up and all those.  The Ministry has highlighted that they are 

not in a capacity to be able to handle those new programmes.  But Mr. Speaker, the question really 

is, what is the Governments intent in having to transfer those programmes to the Ministry? What is 

the intent, when they know very well that Ministry is not really fully equipped in terms of human 

resources, in terms of equipment to be able and funding, to be able to address those issues properly?  

Why did the Government move that to that Ministry when it was effectively sitting with that Ministry 

in regards to National Disaster Management?  So, having to move that, it raises a question on the 

Government’s intent.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  must  note  that  because  of  the  increasing  rate  of  poverty,  what  has 

happened to the Home Care Programme for </span><span>TC Harold,</span><span> </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana </span><span>because without those 

programmes, how is the Government assisting our people in regards to the reconstruction of their 

homes? 

</span></p>
<p><span>We have heard, Mr. Speaker, that the big percentage of people living with poverty is in the 

</span><span>rural areas and as we know those affected by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> are in 

the rural areas.  But the Government has failed to assist our people in regards to reconstructing their 

lives in rebuilding their homes.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So, I go back to the question on having to ask, what is the intent?   I will ask this question to 

the Acting Honourable Minister for Economy, in having to transfer those programmes to a Ministry 

that is not fully equipped to capture and effectively run those programmes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Salote  Radrodro.    I  give  the  floor  to  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got two comments to make in relation to 

Honourable  Professor  Prasad’s  comments.    He  has  said  that  Government’s  poverty  interventions 

</span><span>failed and, therefore, poverty has increased.

</span></p>
<p><span>675 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when an academic or researcher makes that kind of statement, that person 

</span></p>
<p><span>must produce to us the details of the research on the success or failure of each intervention. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Wait, wait!   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to see from Honourable Professor Prasad where is the research for 

each intervention that Government has made to demonstrate whether it is failed or successful.  Where 

is it? Produce it to this House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Prasad is using that Poverty Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>to say that individual intervention by various Ministries failed.  Where is it? 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order.  Mr. Speaker, I think the Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Minister is totally misleading the Parliament as to what I have said.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- No, no! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- I said two things.  Firstly, poverty rate has increased, 

compared to the previous survey.  I said that it shows that Governments poverty alleviation policies, 

I did not talk about individual policies has not work to reduce poverty. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- No, no. Do not change it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- On top of that, Mr. Speaker, I said that the Government 

</span></p>
<p><span>must go and do its audit and review those policies to see whether it works with that policy.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- My time! My time! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR  B.C. PRASAD.- So, he has  totally mislead  what  I have said, which 

</span></p>
<p><span>reflects very poorly on the Minister himself,  Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I will leave it at that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr, Speaker, Sir, I have not finish. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Alright, you have the floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Misleading, that is why. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the second point, any intervention through any 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministry will have an effect. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  does  not  mean,  I  hope  the  Honourable  Member  understands,  if  the 

poverty rate increases, that does not mean that the intervention fails.  The question is that, without 

the intervention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the poverty rate could have been higher.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order!

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why he is totally misleading. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister for Health? 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- It pains.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a short contribution.  We 

all  know  that  the  whole  world  is  grappling  with  the  economic  challenges  of  COVID.    There  are 

countries around the world that are really struggling big time.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I have been privileged, Mr. Speaker, to be at a meeting of the Pacific Health Ministers and I 

can tell you, it is a struggle all over the world.  There are countries that have chosen to reduce the 

budgets of their Ministries of Health because of the economic constraints they have.  With us, that 

has not happened.  We had an increase in our Ministry of Health budget.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, there are many ways in which Government is able to support those who need 

social protection and they are not limited only to the Ministry of Social Welfare.  There is work being 

done with the Ministry of Agriculture in terms of the seedlings and chickens being given, in terms of 

the  support  given  through  MSMEs  in  the  Ministry  of  Trade,  security  is  so  important  in  these 

challenging times, the accessibility to roads and water - these are the many ways that are intersecting.  

That is what Honourable Prasad seems to be insinuating in his debate that it was only the Ministry of 

Social  Welfare  that  is  actually  working  around  the  areas  of  poverty  and  it  is  not  -  these  are  all 

intersecting in many ways to be able to support the work of the Ministry of Social Welfare.  They 

provide the leading role but all these Ministries work together, including what we do in the Ministry 

of Health.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As we speak, the Free Medicine Programme registration continues in the West, the dialysis 

centre which has opened (which I will talk about a little bit more at the end of the week) - it is only 

$75 for those who earn below $30,000 annually  - these are the many ways in which Government 

works and also working hand-in-hand with the other stakeholders outside of Government.  One must 

remember that the stakeholders outside of Government take their cue from Government’s leadership 

and they are able to provide and look at ways in which we can map together.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, one thing that I would also like to bring to the fore is that, when these reports 

were done, the budget for the Ministry of Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation, was actually lesser 

</span><span>than what it is enjoying today - their budget kept on increasing significantly over the last few years.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, the Honourable Gavoka talked about the importance of being inclusive.  

Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago, I saw a picture of the Honourable Radrodro standing outside being 

very emotional, that is not inclusiveness.  Inclusiveness is being able to allow everybody to be part 

of, to be able to empower everybody and work hand-in-hand and work together.  I thank you, Mr. 

Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Just take your seats for the time being. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, I still have six speakers on this agenda item but before we continue 

</span><span>with that which I do not intend to do until after lunch - Honourable Members, the list is as follows: 

Honourable  Mosese  Bulitavu,  Honourable  Tikoduadua,  Honourable  Nawaikula,  Honourable 

Bulanauca, be ready when you are called.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>677 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, as you are all aware, the Fijian Government has mobilised COVID-19 

vaccines  for  the  country  which  is  crucial  in  protecting  all  Fijians  from  the  pandemic  and  to  also 

prepare  our  country  when  borders  reopen.    Subsequently,  the  Fijian  Government  has  opened 

registration to all Fijians who wish to be vaccinated. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On that note, I wish to inform all Honourable Members that the Ministry of Health Officials 

will be present in the precincts from tomorrow, that is, Tuesday, 23rd March, to assist Honourable 

Members who prefer to undertake face-to-face registration for the COVID-19 vaccine. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members are therefore requested to have your birth registration number, which 

is evident on your birth certificate, on your your e-profile account on the DigitalFIJI platform.  For 

those Honourable Members who do not have access to their birth registration numbers, this can be 

provided on site by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services once you present your valid ID. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Your valid ID is also required to complete your registration.  This includes your passport, 

voters ID card, joint FNPF card and TIN card or your driver’s licence.  As leaders who have been 

elected to represent the Fijian people, I encourage all Honourable Members to lead by example and 

register accordingly.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you Honourable Members.  On that health note, we will now suspend proceedings for 

lunch and after lunch we will take the speakers in that order in the continuation of the debate, but that 

is not the final list - there are several others wishing to take it from there.  We adjourn for lunch. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.31 p.m.

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.35 pm. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate. I now give the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor to the Honourable Aseri Radrodro.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to make a short contribution 

on the motion that is being debated before the House today, on the Annual Report for the Ministry 

of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation for the final period ending 2014, 2015 and period up to 

July 2016.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But, before I make my commentaries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this time, even 

though it is after lunch, to give my well wishes to the Honourable Attorney- General, the Honourable 

Minister for Forestry and the Honourable Leader of the Opposition for their speedy recovery from 

their illnesses.  This has incapacitated them for quite some time and I pray that they will be well again 

soon to re-join us in this august House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our health is crucial to our roles as Parliamentarians and we must at all times 

have a lot of exercise.   I think the Honourable  Minister for Health and  Medical  Services  and the 

Honourable  Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Transport,  Disaster  Management  and  Meteorological 

Services are leading the way in having their exercises during the lunch break.  Most, especially, have 

lot more rest to allow us to dispose our duties to the best of our abilities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just going through the Reports that is before us this afternoon, I would like 

to  make  some  short  commentaries  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee.    First,  on  the 

recommendation of the Committee, that the Ministry should liaise with the Ministry of Economy to 

ensure that adequate resources are provided for any new initiative, I fully concur that this is a valid 

recommendation that the Honourable Minister should take into consideration as it will improve the 

standing productivity of this important Ministry.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will suggest that the Ministry 

in  addition  to  this  recommendation,  addresses  its  current  services  and  be  provided  with  adequate 

resources so as to allow continuous flow of its existing services to women, children and the elderly 

citizens of Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Every  now  and  then,  I  sometimes  have  to  inform  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Women, 

Children and Poverty Alleviation about some beneficiaries of their programmes who have advised 

that they have stopped receiving assistance for some unknown reasons.  The Honourable Minister, 

</span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say, has been helpful in trying to find the reasons for such incidences when 

</span><span>they arise and for this I am very grateful.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to highlight that most of the beneficiaries of the programme 

reside in rural areas, as has been alluded to earlier by some Members on this side of the House and 

the issues of conveniently accessing those services becomes a challenge on its own. For example, on 

our  recent  visit  to  the  Yasawa  Islands,  beneficiaries  of  such  programmes  in  Soso  Village  had 

requested that I highlight to the Honourable Minister, which I did, and to Government that if one has 

to travel to Lautoka, the return boat fare is $100.  So to collect an allowance, they will have to travel 

to Lautoka and wait for another system of payment, another period of payment to allow them to make 

</span><span>it back to the Yasawa Islands on another $50 or $50 plus allowances plus food voucher.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when they do travel to Lautoka, that is, the inconvenience that they will 

create to their relatives and friends who  they will have to stay with to anticipate the next periodic 

</span><span>allowance payment from the Ministry of Social Welfare. This is due to the absence of resources to 

</span><span>allow them to not only receive their allowances from their villages but be able to use it as well. We 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 40</a></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>679 

</span></p>
<p><span>need to find a way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to help these islanders access and use their welfare assistance 

to look after themselves. Spending more money to obtain a lesser amount of welfare defeats the logic 

of  assistance,  so  I  hope,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  Minister  and  the  Government  will  look  into 

resolving these challenges very soon.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on the recommendation for appropriate resources to upgrade its ICT 

Unit,  to  strengthen  its  network  and  database.  This  is  a  very  sad  status,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the 

Ministry is yet to have a proper database and I strongly urge that this be made a priority in the next 

budget session.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Food Voucher Programme, if the Ministry could also look into 

providing  more  accessible  outlets  so  that  recipients  who  are  residing  in  the  villages  are  able  to, 

without delay, access cashing in on their food vouchers, access their monthly allowances to ensure 

that they do not have to travel all the way to the urban centres, Suva or Nausori or Lautoka to access 

their food vouchers and allowances.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  trust,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  line  Ministry  can  look  into  these  issues  along  with  the  Fiji 

Competitive &amp; Consumer Commission so as to allow our welfare recipients to access their basic food 

needs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  Honourable  Radrodro.  I  give  the  floor  to  Minister  Jone 

</span></p>
<p><span>Usamate. You have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  talk  about  the 

Report that is before the House in relation to the Ministry of Social Welfare and its annual reports 

for the years in question. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I think one of the issues that I wanted to highlight was, I appreciate the observations made by 

the Honourable Radrodro, who is actually talking to the recommendations in this Report. The thing 

that I wanted to address is some of the earlier comments that were made had nothing to do with the 

reports in question.  

</span></p>
<p><span>They were trying to depict the effectiveness of the FijiFirst Government as indicated by the 

level of the poverty reports that came out and some of the comments that were made, were to my 

mind  the  things  that  I  wanted  to  address.  One  of  things  that  we  need  to  know  right  now  is  that 

</span><span>inequality in the world is a rising phenomenon. It is not something that is found only in Fiji. It is 

</span><span>found right across the world. It is something that keeps on increasing year after year and governments 

all over the world are grappling with this particular issue.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There was a question that was asked in this House, where is the boom. I think the boom, the 

Bainimarama Boom as it has been called is being reflected in the nine years of consecutive economic 

growth that we have had and all the developments that we have been able to produce as a result of 

that.   It is being seen in free education that was never given before and now is provided. It has been 

seen in the subsidies that we give to power (electricity) subsidies for water. All of those things go to 

the most marginalised people in our country.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think one of the most significant impacts that you have seen in the Bainimarama boom, if 

you look at the Ministry of Economic and  Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation 

because we have been able to grow the pie in this country, we have been able to set aside funds for 

</span><span>the most marginalised in our country.  That is the sort of thing that we have been able to do, it is 

</span><span>reflected in that.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Inequality is growing across the world.  The boom has been seen in all of these things that I 

have talked about. If we see, for instance, we all know what has been happening in our country, as is 

being said here.   Revenue is down by 50 percent and that is a reflection of COVID-19 as a reality of 

what we have.  If you look at the inequities in Fiji, inequality is measured by the Gross Domestic 

Coefficient.  I think the Honourable Attorney-General has mentioned this before.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When you look at the Gini Coefficient figures for Fiji that measured these things and I have 

to see the years that it was, let me just have a look at my notes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it was from 

the year 2002 up to the year 2013, the inequities in Fiji  actually improved.  But I look at the Gini 

Coefficient, for instance, for the USA in 2019, it went up to 0.48 which shows inequity is rising even 

in the richest countries in the world.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Here in Fiji, we are doing a lot to address these sorts of things, and I want to, a lot of the 

things  that  have  been  mentioned  here  about  this  Government  not  putting  the  needs  of  the  most 

marginalised as the most important thing in what we do, is not correct.  That is something that needs 

to be recognised and rectified.  I leave the issues that would be related to the recommendation to this 

paper to the Minister who will speak on that particular issue.  We should not use that as to paint a 

picture of how well government is doing.  I think I will rest it at that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Nawaikula.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The motion that we are debating 

now is the review of the Ministry for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation and it covers some 

years from 2014 to 2017.  We are now debating the findings of the Standing Committee on Social 

Affairs on those annual reports. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell, I think what the Ministry of Women and Poverty Alleviation 

needs  is  capacity.    It  is  obvious  from  the  content  of  this  report,  from  the  recommendations  and 

observations of the Auditor-General’s Report and from the Special Audits in relation to this Ministry 

that it needs  capacity.   It is  an important  Ministry that  covers  a lot of things, even recording and 

monitoring poverty and it needs capacity growth in order to do that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Before I get into that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just reply first to what Honourable Usamate 

said. He was asking, “Where is the boom?” And the Honourable Minister said, “We will find the 

</span><span>boom in free education, we will find the boom in everything that is free”.  But giving out subsidy, 

</span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not boom.  That is consumption; reckless, politically motivated consumption.  

That is not boom, that is the reason why the economy is at its knees and the sooner that other side of 

the House understands that, the better. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I was happy today, even for Honourable Usamate, on the other side, to acknowledge that the 

economy is in crisis, but the next thing that they should also acknowledge is that they are to blame 

and they should stop blaming COVID-19.  That is where we are now, Mr. Speaker, is that in relation 

to poverty, we are going through this cycle of poverty.    They are to blame because we were up there 

on the 30 percent, then we went down and you have taken us back to 30 percent poverty.  That was 

</span><span>even before COVID-19, so you are specifically to blame for poverty.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If I also  can refer to Honourable Dr. Mahendra Reddy’s comments where he quoted  from 

Honourable Professor Prasad, to say that, “Government poverty intervention failed”, and that is the 

</span><span>reason why poverty has increased.  I second that, that is totally true because they are looking at the 

</span><span>macro level, instances of your programme might succeed.  

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>681 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- But the macro level is here and Honourable Professor Prasad told 

him, “look here, it is in the statistics.”  If I quote Honourable Professor Prasad to him, he said “if the 

Honourable Minister cannot accept the statistics on poverty in relation to that, then something must 

be wrong with him.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject)  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- That is what he said.  If the Honourable Minister cannot rely on 

the Government statistics in relation to poverty and to clarify why it has gone up to 30 percent then 

something must be wrong with it?” 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject)  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Mr. Speaker,  coming back to the Report which is Parliamentary 

Paper No. 60 of 2019.  The first thing that the Committee stated was to outline the responsibilities of 

this Ministry and I wish to repeat that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Ministry  of  Women  oversees  three  departments,  namely  the  Department  of  Social 

Welfare,  Department  of  Women  and  Children  and  the  Poverty  Monitoring  Unit.    In  relation  to 

poverty, they do nothing about poverty but assist the Government in monitoring that.  In relation to 

that, I think they will agree with us that we are now running in a cycle of poverty and add to that, a 

death track which I will come to later.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Look at the results and then you will agree with us.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Have you been to the roads?  Full of potholes that is wastage and 

years  of  wastage,  employing  contractors  who  do  not  know  how  to  build  roads  and  that  is  where 

wastage has gone to.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, let me tell you this, next to FSC which has accumulated nearly $40 million loss 

</span><span>in the last 15 years comes the Department of Roads.  They have spent nearly over $1 billion of public 

money and where is the result – potholes, potholes and potholes.  That is what I am talking about, 

that is no boom, that is no boom. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject)  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- The Honourable  Minister  is saying “four lanes here and there”. 

But if the four lanes breakdown after two years, what use is that?  If the four lanes after two years 

become potholes, what is the use of that? That is wastage.  Coming back to the report because they 

</span><span>have dragged me away from that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  In  relation  to  the  Report,  I  wish  to  make  a  comment  on  the  

Department of Social of Welfare’s role. Under Social Welfare, it looks after poverty benefit scheme, 

food vouchers, bus fare subsidy, child protection allowance and special pension.  I wish to say here 

that two weeks ago, I had a discussion with the Honourable Minister about someone who called me 

up to say, “I used to receive $100, then it became $80, then it became $50.  Can you please ask the 

Minister?  So I am put it in my </span><span>Facebook</span><span>, “Honourable Minister can you explain the reason why?”   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  spoke  and  the  representative  from  the  Ministry  came  to  see  him,  but  they  have  not 

returned and that is the truth.   It was $100 and it became $80, $50 and the explanation was a statement 

was given by the Permanent Secretary to say that, they continuously review situations and that is 

probably the reason why.  But the review must be done in consultation, please. Do not do the review 

unilaterally. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The same thing they did in relation to the bus fares.  Bus fares used to be $40 then suddenly 

it became $20, some went to check and it is $13 and now it is $10.  For someone travelling by bus 

from my village (Buca Village) to Savusavu, it costs $8.00. So, how are they going to return?  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT. MEMBER.- What about their …. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Well, it is not …. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Minister will speak after me and he can rebut me wherever I go wrong.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- So, that is what I wish to say in relation to the special pension.  

And it goes hand-in-hand with the finding of the Special Audit.  The Special Audit, some years ago, 

said that this has been abused, there is no procedure.  They need to review their process and that is 

the reason why.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Next,  Mr.  Speaker,  let  me  now  look  at  this  Report  which  has  made  a  number  of 

recommendations. The first one being that the Ministry should liaise closely with the Ministry of 

Economy to ensure that adequate resources are provided for any new programmes.  That goes hand-

</span><span>in-hand or support what I have stated that they need capacity.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  must  give  money  to  the  Ministry  for  Women  and  Poverty 

Alleviation  so  that  they  can  improve  their  procedure,  so  that  there  is  no  abuse.    The  Honourable 

Minister will agree with me that even the audit in relation to about $5 million - the way it was used, 

I am not sure by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Office or a foreign nation for 

the Elimination of Violence Against Women.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There were 30 recommendations of how they could not utilise that money properly for what 

is needed. There was the amount of about $800,000 that was never used because it needs capacity.  

</span><span>It needs to improve its IT, it needs new programmes and probably this old problem is caused because 

</span><span>it has got a very old IT problem that cannot identify the amount. Next week, it gives $80, this week 

it gives $50 because they need new programmes, so capacity.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  other  recommendation  that  they  set  up  is  that  the  Ministry  worked  closely  with  the 

</span><span>Ministry  of  Economy,  Civil  Service  Reform  Unit  and  stakeholders  from  appropriate  resources  to 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 44</a></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>683 

</span></p>
<p><span>upgrade its ITC Unit.  So, Mr. Speaker, that is probably why they are making payments, sometimes 

$100, $80 because that programme needs to be changed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There  is  another  very  important  recommendation  here,  Mr.  Speaker.  Does  the  Ministry 

identify new programmes and work with faith-based groups and other community groups to address 

the issue of increasing beggars?  

</span></p>
<p><span>We have Saint Vincent de Paul, Homes for Hope and every faith-based organisation has their 

own  programmes.  They  need  to  work  closely  with  the  Ministry,  and  that  is  one  of  the 

recommendations that is here.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  wish  to  now  make  a  few  comments  in  relation  to  this  household 

statistical  news  or  the  policy  situation  that  we  are  now  facing  because  that  comes  under  the 

jurisdiction.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As I said, and I wish to repeat also what was stated by the Honourable Gavoka that we are 

falling into a vicious cycle of poverty and debt trap.  That is the saddening situation that we are in 

now.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. MEMBER.- Your views? 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Well, I am begging you, please, to agree with us so that we can 

move forward instead of living in self-denial.  We have been living in self-denial since 2006 thinking 

that the economy is growing and growing when it is not, and it was placed before them when the 

revenue suddenly dropped in 2017 from $4 billion to $3 billion to $2 billion and this year, while you 

are operating, you are operating at $1.6 billion.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I agree with him entirely, and I also agree with Honourable Gavoka, Mr. Speaker, that we 

should acknowledge and thank those that are giving money from because they are contributing more 

to our GDP and to our revenue more than the Ministry  of Agriculture, more than the Ministry of 

Fisheries, much much more than the Ministry of Roads, who, all that they are doing is creating pot 

holes here and there.  So, we should acknowledge and say “thank you” to those people that deserve 

it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just go through some statistics now because if you cannot believe us, 

</span><span>you better read this.  The latest amount of poverty, let us take borrowing, for example, the amount of 

</span><span>$1 billion from WG Group and $200 million from Japan - that is the latest, not even counting what 

is already there.  We are roughly around $6 billion.  If you add those to our $6 billion national debt, 

it will be well over $8 billion, that is where we are now.  Well, do you believe me now?  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Chorus of interjections) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  I  can  tell  the  other  side,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  poverty  in  Fiji  has 

increased from 28.1 percent to 30 percent and this is why I am saying we are running in a cycle, 

chasing our statement because we were 30 percent before, we went down and now you brought us 

</span><span>back to 30 percent. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In case they want to know, I will tell you now - Central and Eastern Divisions are the most 

poorest  of all areas now.   I  think the  Eastern Division is  Lau, that is  where  you come from, Mr. 

</span><span>Speaker.  Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and just to go back when we told them “do not borrow”, this is 

</span><span>what  they  told  us,  ‘we  borrow  to  finance  operating  expenditure  due  to  shortage  of  revenue.    We

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>borrow  smartly  because  it  is  borrowing  and  not  increasing  debt.    We  borrow  so  that  the  future 

generation need not borrow, this is all bollocks.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Yes, it is al bollocks and we have been telling them.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- What?  Where?  Let me tell you now where we were because they 

asked in relation to our government debt.  In 2014, the total debt was $4.8 billion; 2015, $4.2 billion; 

2016, $4.5 billion; and now we are at $6.98 billion.  That is not including, as I say, the $1 billion 

from the World Bank and $200 million from Japan. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- What is your point? 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- My point is that, our </span><span>dinau</span><span> is excessive.  Our </span><span>dinau</span><span> by over $8 

billion is untenable.  We do not have the revenue to pay that.  That is basically, what I am saying, I 

hope you hear that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Well, I had.  I have all the figures here and I am not finished yet.  

Now, let me tell you this, Mr. Speaker, Sir: Despite the reduction in revenue in the budget, the decline 

is still 50 percent. What kind of budgeting are you doing?  You cannot even do the budget and the 

reason is because I have already said here, Mr. Speaker, they took away the National Planning Office.  

The National Planning Department is now just part of the Ministry of Economy, one desk for the 

National Planning and another desk for the Budget.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Well, the National Bank is finished. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- The National Bank is finished.  Now, it is their problem and our 

</span><span>total current debt level is 73 percent, domestic debt is 5.1 percent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know they 

want  to  talk  about  the  National  Bank.    I  think  we  have  far  more  greater  problems  now  than  the 

National  Bank.    You  look  at  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation,  what  did  they  do  to  the  Fiji  Sugar 

Corporation?  Consecutive losses, losses and losses - $400 million of losses, that is worse than the 

Fiji National Bank.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are still asking, who took the sugarcane farmers?  It is not the farmers, 

it is not even the land, it is the management.  Your skills and qualification, they got nothing.  All they 

did to the economy is destroy the economy, piling up many debts and then run away, who will suffer?  

</span><span>You, Mr. Speaker, Sir, me, your children, my children and our grandchildren, and that is what they 

</span><span>are doing to us.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Nawaikula.  I give the floor to the Honourable 

</span><span>Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster 

</span><span>Management.  You have the floor.

</span></p>
<p><span>685 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Thank  you  for  this 

opportunity to contribute to the motion before the House on the Report on the Ministry for Women, 

Children and Poverty Alleviation.  I wish to state from the outset that the Ministry does not work in 

isolation.    When  the  Opposition  talks  about  the  capacities  and  all  the  other  issues  that  they  have 

highlighted, again, I wish to assure this august House that the Ministry does not work in isolation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>For that reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to poverty reduction, which seems to be the 

main focus of the debate this afternoon, poverty reduction is a whole of Government approach.  It is 

not only the Ministry that looks specifically about this issue.  Of course, poverty reduction and all 

the efforts by Government and us as a country to reduce poverty should be a thing that concerns all 

of us.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But I find it strange to hear the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, concerned about poverty because 

when  we  discuss  about  poverty  alleviation  programmes  and  initiatives  in  this  House,  they  call  it 

“freebees”, “vote buying” and this is the dilemma that they are in.  On one end, they recognise that 

we need to assist them but they cannot look beyond their nose, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They are so quick 

to speak rather than digesting the information and do some critical thinking and analysis and then 

look at the issues.  I do not know what to say.  The Honourable Nawaikula focuses on potholes, but 

look at the bridges that are currently being constructed: the cost of a pot hole and the cost of a bridge 

- something is wrong up here.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is the HIES Report of 2002.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is one Report that we, in the Ministry 

of Rural Development in support of the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, take 

into consideration very seriously and we look at the various initiatives that we have and, of course, 

in  the  Integrated  Rural  Development  Framework  that  was  borne  out  of  the  consultations  in  the 

People’s Charter and, of course, the Framework in 2009, we follow these very closely. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On the incidence of poverty in Fiji in 2002 and 2003 was around 35 percent and in rural Fiji 

it was about 40 percent, in urban Fiji it was about 29 percent, this is 2002.  If you look at 2008, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, it was 31 percent from 35 percent.  In 2013 and 2014, it was 28.1 percent.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  are  asking  about  the  boom.    In  the  programmes,  the  incidence  of 

poverty, according to these: this is the 2008 Report, the 2019 and 2020, every five  years.  Those 

statistics are from the very institution that we have, let us not be selective, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is 

the incidence of poverty.  If you go by divisions, if you look at the urban poverty, even for now in 

</span><span>Vanua Levu, it was 53 percent. I attended that conference with my good friend, Professor Wadan 

</span><span>Narsey.  It was 53 percent back then, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Where is it now in Vanua Levu? It is 42 

percent, from 53 percent.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to contextualise what is before us.  I have spoken about analytical 

and critical thinking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of course, it is an issue that we need to address.  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, if I may say when it comes to poverty in the rural areas particularly, alright put aside 

the pandemic but look at the cycle during 2002 to 2021. How many disasters hit Fiji? Who are the 

most vulnerable during disasters?  

</span></p>
<p><span>It is the poor who are the most vulnerable and if they cannot come out of that cycle of poverty 

</span><span>through the various intervention programmes, they will be still in that loop, Mr. Speaker, Sir and this 

is why the necessary interventions.  Do not call assistance programmes “freebies” because with rural 

people  and  rural  poverty,  you  will  need  to  understand  the  economy  of  the  poor.  You  need  to 

</span><span>understand  them,  where  they  are  because  there  is  no  one  size  fits  all  solution  when  it  comes  to 

</span><span>addressing rural poverty, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

increased, we have improved on addressing most of the issues. Slight increases because of the latest 

report that we have but if we look at where we were and I will suggest to all the Honourable Members 

start from 2002.  If you also look at what Professor Wadan Narsey says here because when it comes 

to Household Income and Expenditure Survey Report, samples are taken at random.  It is not every 

household in the urban areas, it is not every household in the rural areas and it is not every household 

in the whole of Fiji.  It is taken at random, Mr. Speaker, Sir and of course, that is clearly stated here 

in the Report, so it is not and if I may add to what I have just stated, in rural Fiji this is one of the 

questions that I asked Professor Wadan Narsey way back in 2008. What is your definition of poverty 

and how do you quantify poverty?    

</span></p>
<p><span>We need to look at that because when it comes to the basic needs assessment, whether it is 

on food poverty line or the non-food poverty line, these are western approaches trying to analyse 

poverty, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I always argued in rural Fiji, most rural Fijians have better meals 

than us, even in this august House. Three meals a day and then it is a huge problem too in rural Fiji 

about keeping records of their income.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  was  part  of  a  survey  way  back  in  1985  when  I  was  with  Native  Land  Development 

Corporation, together with Israeli economists on agriculture people in Waibau and Lomaivuna. These 

are farmers but they do not even know their expenses, let alone their income, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so 

when it comes to keeping records of what is their consumption and so forth.  It is very difficult, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, so when we are looking at this report, I urge all Honourable Members, let us understand 

our people because when it comes to the cost of living or the cost of basic needs, whether it be on the 

food poverty line or the food basket or whether it comes to the non-food items. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a huge difference and, of course, we need to take this into context.  

So  I  can  say  that  there  are,  of  course,  areas  that  we  need  to  address  and  maybe  the  Honourable 

Minister can talk on that, but let us look at this within the context of what we went through, how we 

are progressing as a country and the determination of government to assist those that are in poverty, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to also end, let us also differentiate between chronic poverty and temporary 

poverty.    There  is  a  difference  between  chronic  poverty  and  temporary  poverty.    Of  course,  the 

environment will have some implications on these. 

</span></p>
<p><span>If we read this book, I do not know how many on the other side have read this book, so that 

</span><span>when we make contributions, we can be leading not only those we need to get out of the poverty 

loop, but of course, to assist all the stakeholders that are involved in this Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I urge all Honourable Members, let us leave aside our politics, let us focus on the issues that 

our people deserve and they need that environment to be created for them so that they can excel in 

society.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Bulanauca.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I wish to comment on the Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>of the Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation Annual Report 2014 to 2017.   

</span></p>
<p><span>First  of  all,  I  wish  to  comment  on  the  vicious  cycle  of  poverty  and  debt  trap  that  we  are 

</span><span>experiencing, particularly with the cycle of poverty.  In my contribution and the proposal that I have 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>687 

</span></p>
<p><span>is an intervention and we request the government to commit itself in order to  arrest or at least to 

mitigate or lessen the effect of the cycle of poverty hitting Fiji’s economy and the people right now. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Poverty  in  Fiji  has  increased  from  28  percent  to  30  percent  in  the  last  six  years  and  41.6 

percent in the rural areas.  Also the trend of government debts have increased and the graph is quite 

steep  and  even  the  Honourable  Attorney-General’s  comments  on  borrowing  is  hollow.    His 

comments  were  on  borrow  to  finance  operating  expenditure,  there  is  a  question  mark  there  and 

borrow smartly, there is a question mark there too. You still have to pay.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The future generations need to borrow and after that, more expenses, so all those comments 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, are all hollow.  The current status of debts has increased from 73 percent to 85 

percent on GDP.  So, debt servicing of $34.8 million gives a shortfall of $13.8 million of $47 million 

monthly average.  What are we talking about here? 

</span></p>
<p><span>The economic and financial market situation is bad. I do not want to elaborate on that, but we 

are dealing here with the Ministry that merely consumes by way of services which we need to do 

anyway, therefore our expenditure need to be controlled, if not reduced with alternatives. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Other Ministries through their expenditures need to be reduced or controlled as well in the 

Military, Police, President’s Office, Office of the Prime Minister, so it is important to have a good 

look at all those things.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Also  the  key  indicators  of  our  shortfall,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  are  many.    Some  have  been 

mentioned but I just need to focus on two here; shortfall on mahogany production – 98.7 percent.  I 

have  been  harping  about  that  here  for  several  years  now  and  there  is  not  even  need  to  increase 

production, particularly in the economic sectors - in the forestry and mahogany.  Also, the Ministry 

of Lands and Mineral Resources’ arrears stands at $23 million.  That is 232 percent over annual rent 

of $10 million.  We need to get our income in and other areas; VAT to be down and all that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to focus on our economic ministry to get revenue in order to 

move forward, particularly looking after these women, children and poverty alleviation programmes 

that we need to improve in the future. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  solutions  to  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  see  it,  we  need  to  create  jobs.    As  I  already 

mentioned  that  we  need  to  focus  on  agriculture,  the  Department  of  Lands,  Ministry  of  Forests, 

</span><span>Ministry of Fisheries, et cetera, and be competitive in whatever products that we can do in ways of 

</span><span>doing things. We need to increase our production.  In the last four years, when there was no report 

and over the years, production has been going down most of the time.  So, we need to produce more 

in order to get more foreign revenue into our country and how we can serve people better; in other 

areas of services the Government Departments need to move into.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Increase  income  earned,  income  tax  on  workers  with  more  than  three  children  and  share 

wealth. It is important that we share wealth down to the grassroot level and also across all levels, Mr. 

Speaker. Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, in expanding preventative health care rather  than concentrating on curative care.  It is 

</span></p>
<p><span>important to concentrate on that because it is much, much cheaper than curative care.   

</span></p>
<p><span> I just want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he said the expenditure needs to be concluded.  I 

</span></p>
<p><span>now wish to comment on the findings of the Standing Committee. They have a lot of concern in the 

</span><span>lack of resources and funding on technology needs to be improved. The Ministry to improve their

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>services and  the increase in the number of beggars  that they have come across and also the Rights, 

Empowerment and Cohesion  Reach Programme in the urban and rural, which is a project funded by 

Japan. This project funded was ended in 2019, I am not too sure if funding is going to be continued 

or not.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, there are reports and concerns on the Golden Age Home in Labasa, the construction of 

a new elderly persons’ home in Babasiga, Ashram in Labasa. Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I also have a concern 

here on family pledges that are unsuccessful.  It is very important for us to focus on.  It has also been 

reported here that awareness be conducted in the </span><span>Bose Ni Tikina</span><span> and </span><span>Bose ni yasana</span><span> for families to 

care for their elderly.  Where are the churches’ participation, the increasing churches, et cetera? It is 

important to focus on that, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The need for qualified caregivers, yes, we will go along with that.  The Lomani Au Children’s 

Home and Pearly Gates Home, et cetera.  The budgetary increased in 2014 which was $14 million to 

$56 million.  Now it is going down, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The fact remains, increase instances of care 

for the age, orphan and disabled physically and mentally need for care is increasing.  We should ask 

ourselves about the root causes of all these.  To me, I can see it is in the homes, it is the family and 

parents are failing in their role and duty.  

</span></p>
<p><span> I can go into various details about the authority where do parents get their authority from, 

particularly from the </span><span>Bible</span><span>.  It is important that we get our family, unity and parents intact.    Also in 

Genesis 1:2 -, it says that God bless them, be fruitful and increase in number that includes parents 

and children and subdue it and every living creature. Whatever Christian churches are doing in the 

</span><span>vanua</span><span> in particularly, what are we doing? What can we do to minimise this? Do we have to build 

more institutions or Homes and reduce the budget?   

</span></p>
<p><span>To me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, education is very important, it is vital, to bring back responsibility 

to  the  home,  families  to  look  after  their  own  responsibilities.    After  their  elders,  their  crippled 

children, et cetera.  Government may help and others too from those individual families as part of 

their own life of serving and giving out love for others. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, education of the heart is spiritual.  You need to have the whole church.  We 

need to have parents bringing their families together every day for devotion and worship - sing, pray 

and hear God’s word together and share.  They should also meet, discuss and plan together - pray 

each day and also pray for healing.  It is important that our families are intact again.  Here also the 

</span><span>education  of  the  heart  is  where  the  decision  making  comes  from  -  have  the  Holy  Spirit  there. 

</span><span>Otherwise if the Holy Spirit is not there the devil will occupy you so, it is important to select and go 

for the right spirit in you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Highly  important  and  I  need  to  mention,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  fatherlessness  or 

motherlessness  is  a  major  contribution  to  lawlessness  which  contributes  to  violence,  poverty, 

intolerance, abuse of this and that, so on and so forth.   It is important that we have our families intact 

with the fathers and mothers there, if not the influence of the father will not be there.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Some of us get married and get divorced.  Some do not get divorced but even though they are 

</span><span>in the house, they are not there.  Some are in the house but not playing their role to guide people in 

</span><span>the right way so it is important that we must have the right education for our home and family in 

order to resolve the future.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly is education of the head and heart - I do not need to elaborate on that.  It is academic 

</span></p>
<p><span>and all of you know.  It is important to educate our people in God’s word which is the absolute truth.   

</span></p>

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>689 

</span></p>
<p><span>The absolute truth is not anywhere else but only in the Bible.  This must be in the curriculum, biblical 

moral values, principles and virtues. We must also live as examples because action speaks louder 

than the words. You must confess, Honourable Prime Minister.  If you have done something wrong 

you must confess. I am thankful to the Honourable Minister for Defence for confessing the wrong 

they have done with the Police Bill – that is love in action and I am thankful to him for that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Sadducees  and  Pharisees  got  together  and  questioned  Jesus  and  asked  which  is  the 

greatest commandment in the law.  Jesus replied and said “Love the Lord your God with all your 

heart (spiritual); with all your soul (body) and with all your mind (mental); this is the first and the 

greatest commandment. The second commandment goes like this - love your neighbour as you love 

yourself.    

</span></p>
<p><span>These two commandments are important.  You may laugh at it but it is important to go back 

to  our  foundation  of  the  family  -  to  educate  our  families  to  be  good  decision  makers.    Parents, 

children, families to keep and serve the old aged, the orphans, and those with special disabilities at 

home to  reduce  or lessen Government’s involvement, except  for serious cases.    It  is  important  to 

learn  new  skills  so  that  we  not  only  become  the  heads  in  our  homes,  but  also  become  teachers, 

doctors, nurses in the home.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Physical  health  and  a  good  body  is  important.    More  emphasis  on  preventative  care  is 

important, Mr. .Speaker, Sir, and it is cheaper.  Good food, water, exercise and herbal medicine which 

is pure and cheap is not only for healthy living but to rebuild or regrade.  So, it is important, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.  Healthy relationships, positive attitudes and spirit as you go along - prevention is better 

than cure and it also cheaper.  You must use skills and the proper use of it will be meaningful in 

paving the way forward.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Shifting our roles and responsibilities to the Government will not solve our problems – we do 

not have to shift our family problems to the government because we are too concerned about working 

shifts and overtime to get more money out of greed or whatever but there is no time for it.    

</span></p>
<p><span>We do not have time for the aged, the orphans or the people with disabilities. We must have 

</span></p>
<p><span>time for all  God’s  children, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because blessings are not  in  your money  or  assets.   

Blessings are found in the love of the spirit in you or us and it is manifested in the good we do to 

serve others starting from Jerusalem, or starting at home with the family.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But the Government is willingly taking over those responsibilities from the parents or from 

</span><span>the homes, for many reasons.  Some do it for political reasons - you want votes and you go to certain 

people.   Some want to be in control – they want to be God and control everything.  The one world 

order is already being initiated through the League of Nations, United Nations, World Bank, IMF 

and now, under COVID-19 rules.  More will come with the insertion of 666 microchips on your right 

hand or your forehead.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The sign of the beast, the sign of the devil, the sign of Satan as in Revelations 13, 16 and 17 

- go and read it.  We need to have a totally new look at how we serve individuals in our families, our 

households or in our communities Mr. Speaker, Sir.  With the current system we are separating our 

</span><span>households by singling out women, children and people living with disabilities as if they are the only 

</span><span>ones suffering from poverty.  We are building and just choosing homes for them - building or trying 

to  build  new  superficial  homes  under  a  foreign/alien  roof  and  shifting  a  God-given  family’s 

responsibilities to the Government.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>You need a change, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so instead of calling it the Ministry of Women, Children 

and Poverty Alleviation we should call it the Ministry of Family.  It will be totally holistic.  It is 

where all fathers, mothers, females, children, elderly or disabled, not in-betweens, are looked after, 

protected, nourished, in passion, love from the heart, not to be politically correct but correct in the 

eyes of God.  Nip the problem in the bud.  Do not be part of the evil spirit, the spirit of Jezebel and 

the spirit of legions to dismantle God given created homes, which is the family institution. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Encourage  and  educate  parents  and  children  accordingly.    The  roles  and  responsibilities 

towards parents, children and persons with disabilities must be in our hands - they must die in our 

hands or in our homes because of love.  Honour your father and your mother, you will be good and 

have a long life and you will be blessed.   There are serious consequences if you do not and we are 

now experiencing it.  To empower and source God-given created families and institutions to properly 

carryout and enjoy that natural care.   We need to strengthen God given families in their homes to 

cater for the elderly and people with disabilities and do away with evil Satanic formulas. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Why not institute an inquiry or commission not only to see financial projections but also the  

implementation of physical and spiritual benefits which these changes may bring about for a better 

society and lessen the cost of building new institutions by government.  We need to strengthen and 

secure families, reduce reliance on artificial, superficial government man-made institutions for God-

given  love  and  care  which  would  be  relatively  cheaper  -  families  will  be  blessed  even  against 

COVID-19 or similar pestilences arising now and in the future.  Thank you Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for his contribution to the debate.  I now 

</span></p>
<p><span>give the floor to the Honourable Bhatnagar.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. BHATNAGAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to make a short contribution 

to the motion on the floor this afternoon.  First and foremost I acknowledge the work of the Standing 

Committee on Social Affairs and note the contents of the Review Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In a nutshell Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation 

Services cuts across all the socio-economic sectors in Fiji which includes supporting families without 

income,  supporting  children  at  risk,  to  improve  services  to  both  disabled  and  older  persons  and 

ultimately, to fill the need to empower women for greater value adding to mankind. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With respect to the recommendations made by the Committee on the Golden Age Home, Mr. 

</span><span>Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight that the Ministry is now seeing a trend where old people are 

</span><span>being abandoned by their relatives and there is a growing waiting list of applicants who have been 

referred to or have applied to be accommodated in one of our Homes.  More challenging is the fact 

that some of these cases do not fall under the category of old persons, but also include those with 

some form of disability whether physical or mental.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, there are no dedicated homes for disabled persons, thus, in trying to address this 

issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is working with other homes for older persons for referrals if 

possible,  at  the  same  time  encouraging  the  communities  through  its  awareness  programmes  for 

families to fulfil their duties to look after their elderly family members and to access the Government 

</span><span>social  pension  scheme  or  disability  allowance.    Here,  I  concur  with  Honourable  Bulanauca  for 

</span><span>families to take ownership to look after their elderlies and the loved ones and they can also apply for 

the social pension scheme and disability allowance.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  order  to  achieve  this,  the  Ministry  is  also  conducting  care  giving  trainings  with  the 

</span><span>communities and trying to build their capacity to care for their own people.  For that it is required to

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>691 

</span></p>
<p><span>understand the trend and to provide a baseline on the need for respite care and training resources for 

the carers.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, plans are underway for the renovations of the three State Homes, work 

has commenced first with the Labasa Golden Age Home, that is the Babasiga Ashram, which should 

be  completed  in  this  financial  year,  with  plans  to  include  the  other  two  Homes  in  Samabula  and 

Lautoka in the coming years. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Under the National  Council for Older Persons (NCOP), the Ministry works in  partnership 

with  other  organisations  that  have  institutions  that  care  for  the  older  persons.    These  include 

organisations such as HART, Father Law Home, Saint Vincent De Paul, Pearce Home and Home of 

Compassion.  There is an institutional forum that is made up of members of these organisations that 

meets  every  quarter  to  update  and  discuss  issues  relating  to  the  care  and  protection  of  the  senior 

citizens.  Apart from its work with these institutions, the Ministry also works with existing NGOs 

such  as  Ba  Senior  Citizens  by  providing  funding  for  programmes  likewise  encouraging  senior 

citizens  in  establishing  their  district  committees  that  would  be  the  advocates  in  their  own 

communities to look at the plight and protection of our senior citizens.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Through NCOP minimum standards for the care and protection of the older persons in the 

institutions have been developed and currently implemented and monitored in these Homes.  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has engaged APTC and FNU as partners in the training and development 

of its caregivers.  MOUs have been signed and scholarships have been issued by APTC for those 

working as carers in the institutions to be trained in caregiving.  FNU students are attached with the 

Homes annually as part of this partnership.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would also like to highlight that there are 11 residential 

homes for children in Fiji.  Two of these homes are State owned homes that accommodates young 

girls between the ages of 14 years to 18 years.  The young girls are often victims of abuse and there 

are also occasions where the court orders remand for young female offenders to await  their court 

date.  This home is called Pearly Gates Home and is located at 41 Mahaffy Drive, Domain.  The 

service is outsourced to an NGO for global compassion and the home is given an annual grant for the 

operations, administrations and care of the young girls, meets their needs ranging from educational 

needs to health needs and for some, special needs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second State home is the Fiji Juvenile Rehabilitation and Development 

Centre (FJDRC) located at Lakeba Street, Samabula. The Centre is administered by the Department 

and is responsible for the safe keep of young juvenile offenders awaiting court decisions and for some 

</span><span>are on committal warrant. The remaining homes, namely Dilkusha Home, St. Christopher’s Home, 

</span><span>St.  Philomena  Children’s  Home,  Homes  of  Hope,  St.  Minas  Children  Home,  St.  Tevita’s  Home, 

Treasure House Christian Children’s Home, Lomani Au Home and Veilomani Boys Homes are all 

owned and operated by the faith-based organisations, all children are in the age category of 0 to 13 

years and all have care orders.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Admission rates is never static as admission is on a case by case basis. There are currently 

</span></p>
<p><span>170 children placed in the homes and their breakdown are as follows: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span><span>(2)</span><span>

<p><span>The divisional officers are responsible for visiting the homes and working with the children

issues that the children may have. There is an institutional forum which is made up of members from 

these homes that meets with the Director and senior staff of the Department on a quarterly basis to 

discuss issues and concerns that relate to the care and protection of these children.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with reference to the recommendation on the increase of beggars on our 

streets, I wish to highlight the following.  Currently, the Ministry has profiled 266 cases on the streets 

of our  cities and towns,  however, not  all of them are permanent  beggars.  Some beggars  are very 

mobile  and  have  homes  and  they  move  from  one  town  or  one  city  to  another  when  there  are 

opportunities such as festivals or national  events. Others spend their day on the streets but return 

home in the evenings while some have homes and family but prefer to live on the streets and there 

are those who are homeless and call the streets their home.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Working with such individuals is challenging and the success rate is very low.  I must admit, 

however, there are success stories where some individuals have been given bean carts and are still 

selling while others had been issued with hawkers licence and some have been assisted in finding 

work.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry has established a Unit within the Department of Social Welfare to look at the 

challenges faced by the beggars. The Unit works with other stakeholders to assist these beggars find 

meaningful work which of course suits their abilities. This also includes finding their families and 

placing them back, finding accommodation and linking them to other service providers that can assist 

and mentor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In situations where families could not be found, the Ministry works in partnership with faith-

based organisations in facilitating accommodations for these individuals. Such organisations include 

the Salvation Army for its housing of juveniles found on the streets, the Good Samaritan Inn, Society 

of St. Vincent De Paul and the State Homes, that is our Golden Age Homes especially for the elderly 

</span><span>persons and the mentally challenged.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Before I take my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the staff of my Ministry, the 

Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, as a family for their compassion, for their 

dedication, their patience in their bid to serve the underprivileged in our society.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 6th March, we celebrated World Social Workers Day and I take this time 

to  sincerely  thank  and  salute  the  hundreds  of  social  workers,  tirelessly  working  to  make  our 

communities a better place for the most vulnerable. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir</span><span>.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for her contribution to the debate. I now 

</span></p>
<p><span>give the floor to the Honourable Kuridrani. You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I will just make a short contribution 

</span><span>because some of my colleagues have shared in this House some of the things that I need to say, so I 

</span><span>will be very short.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>693 

</span></p>
<p><span>I understand what has been mentioned from that side of the House, that poverty is a global 

issue or global problem, that is fine.  But what they did not mention was that the reason for poverty 

in most of these countries are different, just like in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The problem here is that. this Government has been lying about its economic growth for the 

last ten years, so they designed programmes according to lies and based on lies.  I heard from the 

Honourable  Professor  Prasad  that  the  problem  is  whether  they  have  actually  implemented  those 

programmes or not, that is another question. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I gathered in the last Appropriation Report for the Ministry of Agriculture in 2019, more than 

$30 million of their budget was not used, so was it really money?  That is the problem because they 

have been living on lies.  They have been designing programmes based on lies, so that is why they 

cannot implement the programme and get the exact output of what is needed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem in Fiji is the wrong policy mix that they are using.  Say for 

instance,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  we  understand  and  know  very  well  that  maritime  islands  and 

coastal villages have a wealth of marine resources. These people can move out from poverty if they 

are given the approval by the Ministry to use their marine resources.  Even during </span><span>TC Harold, </span><span>they 

stopped the harvesting of sea cucumbers which all these islands have.  These islands, people from 

the maritime and coastal areas do not need government assistance.  They have the resources but the 

policy that this Government is using to stop them from using their resources, that is what is enhancing 

the poverty level in Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Look at  the issuance of a licence.  For a shop  to  be established as a retail  business  in  the 

village in 2019, we used to pay $95 to get a licence.  You know how much as of last year?  They get 

almost $500.  They have to go to the Ministry of Health, National Fire Authority and the Department 

of Environment; yes they know it! That is their policy and here they are trying to say that they care 

for the people. No, they do not care!  Their policies are not helping the people to move out from 

poverty. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Seruiratu said that they needed a holistic approach; that is correct.  You cannot 

tackle poverty in isolation.  We need a holistic approach.  Look at the performance of the Ministers.  

I wonder which authority is monitoring or appraising their performance.  How many ministries have 

updated their annual reports until 2019?  Look at the Ministry of Agriculture - 2015 and we rely on 

the Ministry of Agriculture to  move  Fiji  out  from  this crisis,  yet  they only have the 2015 annual 

</span><span>report.  Where is  the 2020 Census  Report?  It  is still not  here, taxpayers paid  $4 million  for that 

</span><span>report.  It is almost one year gone, you cannot provide the report, so who is monitoring them? 

</span></p>
<p><span>The solution here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to eradicate poverty in Fiji, we need to eradicate them.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for his contribution.  I now give the floor 

to the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    First,  I  would  like  to  just  take  this 

</span><span>opportunity to say thank you to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for their hard work on 

</span><span>coming  up  with  this  Report  and  also  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation for a tough and hard work that she does.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just now we heard someone saying that our policies are bad, we are lying.  

Let  me tell  him something, Sir, we  have had 10 straight  years of economic growth  that has been 

unsurpassed, unchallenged and no one has ever done it, so take that to bed.     

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  lot  has  been  said  and  I  am  sure  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Women, 

Children and Poverty Alleviation will address those specific issues in the actual Report. But I want 

to briefly go through some of the issues that have actually been raised with respect to the economy 

and especially what was raised by Honourable Gavoka.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every single economy has contracted due to COVID-19.  The pandemic is 

obviously severely disrupted the global economy, not just Fiji, with devastating impacts on financial 

markets,  jobs  and  businesses.  The  International  Monetary  Fund,  Mr.  Speaker,  has  projected  the 

global contraction of around 3.5 percent for 2020 and in reality these makes it the worst economic 

crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s. So it has to be put into perspective before they come 

here  and  shoot  off  what  they  want  to  without  actually  thinking  about  it.    These  pandemic,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, has impacted and severely impacted household incomes and it actually  threatens to 

derail the significant progress that many economies around the world have made over the years to 

actually reduce global poverty.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  impact  with  respect  to  economy  is  like  Mauritius,  like  Fiji,  like  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Maldives and Bahamas that were tourism dependant countries have been double digit contractions.   

Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have, in fact, everyone in this Parliament on this side of the House has pretty 

much several times spoken about the actual Government debt issue.  Government revenue, let me 

say this very  clearly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been  reduced by 50 percent  compared to pre-COVID 

levels.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, there are only two options once that happens.  One option was to cut expenditure and the 

other option was to borrow more and it is a simple as that, Sir. We chose the latter for the betterment 

of the country and I want to ask the Opposition, Sir, if they want to lower debt then what expenditures 

do  they  really  think  that  we  should  be  reduced?    If  their  suggestion  is  stop  borrowing,  are  they 

suggesting that we cut the Civil Service pay or no they will not say that, are they suggesting that we 

reduce infrastructure spend, are they suggesting that we reduce the money we spend on health?  Are 

they suggesting that we reduce the money on education? Where is their alternative budget?  Never 

to be seen, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the alternative to reducing borrowing will have a lot of implications and 

</span><span>will actually further effective economies.  Now prior to COVID-19, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government 

debt was actually falling, debt to GDP ratio fell from about 56 percent in 2011 to 43 percent in 2015. 

So the debt ratio was actually falling and then everyone chooses to forget this, we had a Category 5 

cyclone by the name </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> which literally blew us out of the water in 2016 and now we have 

COVID-19 yet we still survived, Mr. Speaker.     

</span></p>
<p><span>We  survived  because  we  have  a  strong  economy,  we  survived  because  we  have  a  strong 

Government,  Sir.    The  recent  increase  in  debt,  Mr.  Speaker,  which  is  projected  to  be  around  84 

percent of the GDP by the end of this financial year is mainly due to the fact that Government revenue 

</span><span>is down by 50 percent from pre-COVID levels.  The debt to GDP ratio has increased substantially 

</span><span>not only due to high levels of borrowing, Sir, but also due to massive contraction in the  nominal 

GDP. The nominal GDP has reduced from about $12 billion in 2019 to $10 billion in 2020.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Temporarily  increase  in  Government  borrowing  is  important  to  provide  much  needed 

</span><span>physical impetus and I want to emphasise it, it is needed to provide much needed physical impetus 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and  

Poverty Alleviation 2014-2017 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>695 

</span></p>
<p><span>to create jobs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to develop infrastructure and actually continue to provide essential 

Government  services.    These,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  actually  critical  for  economic  stability  and  it 

actually lays the foundation for a very quick recovery for Fiji.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Through this pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has actually borrowed but we have 

borrowed sustainably, Sir, and we have borrowed from the most credible, multilateral and bilateral 

institutions  such  as  the  Japan  International  Corporation  Agency  (JICA),  World  Bank  and  Asian 

Development Bank (ADB). I hope everyone hears this: these credible agencies actually lending to 

Fiji at this point in time reflects the legitimacy of the need for Government to support the economy, 

which has to be put into perspective, Sir.  It actually also shows that these lenders, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

are confident on the Fijian Government’s ability to repay back these loans: that is the whole point.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has never ever defaulted on any debt repayments.  This has enabled the 

Government to ensure Government programmes and Civil Service salaries are maintained and not 

substantially impacted.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Government has actually recently borrowed from the International Development Association 

around US$125 billion which is a concessional loan and this is the kind of loans that we actually 

give.  It is a concessional loan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with a 40-year repayment term inclusive of a 10-

year grace period and a 0.75 service charge.  In addition, from the Japan International Corporation 

Agency (JICA) worth around US$100 million, with the 15-year repayment term inclusive of a four-

year grace period and an interest of 0.01, that is one basis point, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Our most recent loans have been accessed through policy-based loans which are financing, 

only  released  upon  the  completion  of  agreed  reforms.  These  reforms  have  actually  been  agreed 

without development partners - incredible, respectable institutions such as JICA, World Bank and 

ADB as well as Australia and New Zealand governments.  Offshore borrowing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as 

I had actually cautioned, the substantial impact on foreign reserves without which would have led to 

a possible devaluation and significantly impact in the Fijian Financial Systems.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Foreign  Reserves  currently  stand  at  about  $2.2  billion  and  that  is  sufficient  to  cover  6.8 

</span></p>
<p><span>months of retained imports and is likely to remain strong in the near future.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Post-COVID-19, Mr. Speaker, Sir, setting the debt to GDP ratio on a downward trajectory 

will  actually  be  a  key  focus  and  will  be  largely  dependent  on  the  quick  economic  rebound  and 

</span><span>progressive reductions in the budget deficit over the medium term. 

</span></p>
<p><span>While financing growth through increase debt is warranted during this extraordinary time, the 

sustainable long term focus will be on a private sector-led growth that will bring down the GDP ratio. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, I just also wanted to just quickly point out that Honourable Nawaikula was talking about 

all these debts that we took.  He actually forgets that all these loans that he is talking about are actually 

part  of  the  2020/2021  Budget  approved  by  Parliament.    He  knows  about  it,  we  are  not  actually 

borrowing anything additional, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  unemployment  support,  let  me  put  it  into  perspective.  

</span><span>Unemployment support provided by the Government in partnership with the Fiji National Provident 

Fund (FNPF) since April 2020, it has been critical in supporting the livelihoods of those that have 

been affected.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Before you start going on over their money, they may tell you about their money.

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Just listen. May be you should listen, it is time you listen. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- So far, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of $236.2 million has been paid out to 

support those that are unemployed or on reduced hours.  Now, let me say this very slowly: Of this, 

Government has paid out $118.3 million, and around $117.9 million has been withdrawn from FNPF 

members’ General Accounts.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  100,000  Fijians  have  actually  been  assisted  so  far,  put  that  into 

</span></p>
<p><span>perspective.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have an actual chart on this.  If they want I will actually give it to them so 

</span></p>
<p><span>that they can decipher it.
