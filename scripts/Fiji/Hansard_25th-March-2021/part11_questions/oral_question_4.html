<p>Plans to Mitigate Flooding in Rivers and Creeks 

(Question No. 76/2021</p>
<p>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 

Parliament on the Ministry’s plans to mitigate the impact of the frequent flooding of smaller 

rivers and creeks?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY  (Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment).-  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, earlier this week I gave an update  on what our plans were with regard to dealing with 

flooding in Ba Town, in particular, for Ba River. Often we talk about these bigger rivers - Ba, Nadi, 

Rakiraki, Rewa, Labasa, Qawa and Navua.  Sir, but we also sometimes  forget that there are other 

small  waterways,  creeks  and  rivers  that  are  threatening  during  heavy  rain;  threatening  our 

infrastructure, crops, livestock, settlements and therefore, we also need to clear them. They are, over 

time, have been silted due to what is happening upstream in the catchment.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have identified those rivers, about 150 of them and divided them intothree-phases. The first phase is about to start on Friday next week, we will give it out to the CentralDivision. In the first phase, we are going to desilt 25 creeks in the Central, Northern and Western 

Divisions. In the Central Division there are three creeks that we need to desilt, nine in the Western 

Division and 13 in the Northern Division. The total number of kilometres that we will be desilting is 

56 kilometres.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, desilting 56 kilometres is a lot of work. What we have done, 56 kilometre 

would mean close to $120 million to $150 million. But what we have done is, we work smartly, we 

are  working  with  the  private  sector,  where  we  pick  up  the  part  of  the  cost  of  working  with  themataqali, the landowners and getting their fishing rights in liaison with the Ministry of Lands. We 

have  picked  up  the  cost  of  undertaking  the  Environmental  Management  Plan,  so  the  Ministry  is 

picking that up.</p>
<p>So for each creek and river, we do the Environmental Management Plan so that the desilting 

work would go according to that plan so there will  be no destabilisation of the river bank and the 

flora and fauna will be intact. How many metres from each of the banks they need to desilt?  What 

volume they need to desilt, all those too are defined in the Environmental Management Plan.  Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  the  private  sector  pays  the  royalty  to  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  then  picks  up  thematerial sales and the private sector then gains from that.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the 25 creeks that we are doing in phase one, that we have got 

the entire paperwork ready and we are going to start from next week Friday. Nine  in the Western 

Division – Solovi, Saru, Navolau, Narewa, Nakorotubu, Nadele, Draunivi and Malakua. That is 16.9 

kilometres. The three in the Central Division – Wainibuabua, Wainadoi and Nabukavesi. This is a 

total  of  17  kilometres.  The  13  in  the  Northern  Division  -  Tacilevu,  Nabia,  Navidamu,  Vatudova, 

Wavuwavu, Vuniyalayala, Vunivutu, Nasealevu, Nakelikoso, Korotari, Dogoru, Nakama, Nubu, so 

a total of 21.5 kilometres. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this way we are able to save a substantial amount 

of money the State otherwise would incur and we are able to work in partnership with the private 

sector and assist these communities, protect the infrastructure, protect the crop and livestock and we 

are able to ensure that the access water is discharged very quickly.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa, you</p>
<p>have the floor.</p>

<p>25th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>1013</p>
<p>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  For the Central Division, I did not hear 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, mentioning the Toga Crossing.  What are the plans for upgrading the Irish Crossing 

because right now with this heavy rain, it will be flooded.  That Irish Crossing serves four villages 

and settlements, so the question is, what are your plans for that crossing?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Honourable  Member,  the  crossings  are  done  by  Ministry  of 

Infrastructure.  We do not deal with the crossings, but if you are talking about the river, as I have 

said, this is phase 1.  Phase 1 we are doing 25.  There is a total of 150 that we have identified.</p>
<p>So Phase 1 we are doing 25, now once this has started, then we will work on Phase 2, a list 

of rivers and creeks where we need to do a lot of work where we need to come to themataqali,they 

give  their  consent,  they  agree  on  how  much  they  will  be  paid  and  go  through  the  Native  Lands 

Commission and through the Ministry of Lands to get the waiver documents all in order, and then 

the Ministry of Environment, at the same time, will be doing the Environmental Management Plan.  

So the crossings are under the jurisdiction of the ……</p>
<p>(Honourable Member interjects)</p>
<p>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- No, no, we do not do crossings.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- We move on to the fifth Oral Question for today.  I give the floor to the</p>
<p>Honourable Rasova to ask his question.  You have the floor.</p>
