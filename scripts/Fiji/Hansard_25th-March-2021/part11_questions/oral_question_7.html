<p>Cash for Cultivation Programme 

(Question No. 79/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update</p>
<p>Parliament on the progress of the ‘Cash for Cultivation’ Programme announced recently?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY  (Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment).-  Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Honourable Member for asking that question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture released our strategic plan with  five</p>
<p>strategic objectives and food and nutritional security is one of the key strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  would  have  noted  that  following  COVID-19,  food  and  nutritional 

security  became  very  important,  very  critical  for  all  countries  because  for  every  country,  when 

borders  were  closed,  we  were  looking  to  ensure  that  the  Governments  were  able  to  secure  their 

households with respect to food and nutrition.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  noting  this,  the  Secretary-General  of  the  United  Nations,  Mr.  Antonio 

Guterres, has declared that this year, they will hold a Food Systems Summit as part of the Decade of 

Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030.</p>
<p>The Summit will launch bold new actions to deliver progress on all 17 SDGs, each of which relies, 

to  some  degree, on  healthier  and  more  sustainable  and  equitable  food  systems.   The  Summit  will 

focus on the fact that we all must work together and transform the way the world produces, consumes 

and  thinks  about  food.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Summit  is  about  re-looking  at  our  production  and 

consumption systems, if we are to secure our households in all parts of the country and the worldwith regard to food and nutrition.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is meant to be a people’s Summit and a solution Summit that will require 

everyone to take action and transform the world’s food system.  The primary objective or aim of the 

Summit is guided by five action tracks, which are as follows, to:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>generate significant action and measurable progress towards the 2030 Agenda versus 

sustainable development;</p>
<p>raise awareness and alleviate public discussion about how reforming our food systems 

can help us all achieve the SDGs by implementing reforms that are good for people 

and the planet;</p>
<p>develop principles to guide governments and other stakeholders look into leverage thefood systems and support their SDGs; and lastly</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>1017</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>create  a  system  of  follow-up  and  review  to  ensure  that  the  Summit’s  outcomes 

continue to drive new actions and progress.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to inform this House that Fiji is actively involved in the national 

dialogue  in  the  lead-up  to the  regional  Food  Summit  planned  for  June  2021.    So, there  will  be  a 

National  Food  Summit  in  June,  Sir,  followed  by  the  Global  Food  Summit  which  is  planned  for 

September this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also quite pleased and happy to announce that our Permanent Secretary 

for the Ministry of Agriculture, Mr. Dass, will be the national convenor as appointed by the Ministry 

of Foreign Affairs, for dialogues.  Through this mechanism, we will be engaging a broad range of 

stakeholders across Government.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by convening our own independent national dialogue, we will  be able to 

have  a  seat  at  the  table  and  contribute  directly  to  the  Summit’s  ambitious  vision,  mission  and 

objective.  Whilst we are working purposely on the ground to achieve our objectives, we are actively 

participating in the regional and global levels to ensure the mission and our approach Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move towards the June’s national Summit, we have, apart from 

the  existing  programmes  for  Food  and  Nutritional  Security  launched  this  Cash  for  Cultivation 

Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>In the first round, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking at about 2,500 participants in this Cash 

for Cultivation Programme.  In the Cash for Cultivation Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, each farmer 

will get $200 if they cultivate the minimum of one acre of land for agricultural crops.  As of now, we 

have registered and approved 1,150 farmers to spread across the four Divisions to get these $200 per 

farmer for cultivation, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have pretty good spread and these farmers will be receiving this cash:</p>
<p>(1)Northern  Division:  Macuata  -  200  farmers;  Cakaudrove  -  76  farmers;  Taveuni  -  24</p>
<p>farmers and Bua - 50 farmers.</p>
<p>(2)Western Division: Nadroga & Navosa - 80 farmers; Ba - 75 farmers; Tavua - 50 farmers;</p>
<p>Nadi - 40 farmers; Lautoka - 40 farmers; and Ra - 150 farmers.</p>
<p>(3)Central  Division:    Tailevu  -  75  farmers;  Naitasiri  -  75  farmers;  Serua  -  30  farmers;</p>
<p>Namosi - 20 farmers; and Rewa - 50 farmers.</p>
<p>(4)Eastern Division:  Lau - 20 farmers; Lomaiviti - 50farmers; and Kadavu - 80 farmers.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  250,000,  we  are  looking  at  2,500  farmers;  1,150  have  been</p>
<p>approved.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker,  Sir, we are expecting some more money, we are looking at another $200,000 

coming from another development partner, and quite likely, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we might be getting 

another half  a  million dollars.  So, it  means the  more  money we get for this Cash  for Cultivation 

Programme, more farmers will benefit.  We are putting caps in areas so that all farmers from different 

areas participate in this Programme.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>25th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  four  objectives  we  have  discussed  for  the  Cultivation</p>
<p>Programme:</p>
<p>(1)(2)(3)</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Households are motivated to grow their own food. 

Their livelihood will be supported because they will have cash in their hand. 

Rural economy will benefit because they will be spending in the nearby shops and the 

suppliers.  

Agriculture will expand for national interest.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  The Honourable Niko Nawaikula, you</p>
<p>have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Can  the  Honourable  Minister  clarify  to the  House  who  are the</p>
<p>people or which institution will be funding this?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  quarter  million  that  we  have  received  isthrough  New  Zealand  Government  through  ADRA.    We  have  got  $200,000  from  anotherdevelopment partner and we are in talks with another development partner from one of the countries 

but at the moment it has not been confirmed so I do not want to reveal the name, but they are saying 

that they want to come on board because they have seen how these four objectives are being served.</p>
<p>It is an output-oriented programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given that you deliver this output and 

you will be given that particular cash.  We are in a totally win-win situation, households have food 

security, livelihood is improved, rural economy benefits and we are pushing and expanding national 

agriculture.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Members, Oral Questions is over and we have 

one  Written  Question  for today,  and  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Ro  Filipe  Tuisawau  to  ask  Written 

Question 80/2020.</p>
