<p>COVAX – COVID-19 vaccine 

(Question No. 75/2021)</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 

plans  to  vaccinate  the  remaining  population  who  are  not  covered  by  the  first  COVAX 

donation of the COVID-19 vaccine?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE  (Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services).-Vinaka 

vakalevu,Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the Honourable Member for that question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

we have been having discussion with multilateral partners also with bilateral partners.  As you knowthere are countries around the world that have actually ordered vaccines more than their needs withintheir own country.  Nevertheless, countries like Australia, New Zealand have indicated to us that they 

are willing to help us in our procurement but we have also as a government, we have made it very 

clear to COVAX that we are willing to purchase the vaccines ourselves.</p>
<p>We are very clear also that we want to vaccinate 650,000 Fijians and the first 20 percent as 

we have  heard  from the Ministerial Statement is coming  through the COVAX  facility, 15 percent 

free and 5 percent subsidized which the Fijian Government is paying for.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, there are few vaccines that have been certified so as to speak 

by the  WHO.  They are the Pfizer vaccine which  is requiring the ultra-cool chain pre-dominantly 

being used in America and also initially in Israel and some other countries.</p>
<p>The AstraZeneca which we  have used  here  in Fiji, it is safe  for us and safe  in  many othercountries  around  the  world  and  the  ones  that  are  manufactured  in  India  AstraZeneca  is  calledCovishield.    We  also  have  the  Moderna  vaccine  and  also  just  recently  the  Johnson  and  Johnson</p>

<p>vaccine which is thought to be a game changer in a sense that you will only require one vaccination 

instead of two.  So, the other vaccine that required at least, initially 21 days but now they are talking 

about anywhere between 8 days to 12 days between the vaccines.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every country in the world at the moment, want to be able to access vaccine.  

The other night when I left Parliament here at about 12 midnight, we are part of what is called the 

Access to COVID-19 tools Facilitation Council.  Fiji is represented on that council.  So, we had a 

meeting and one of the issue at the moment is access to vaccines.  Access to vaccines is an issue that 

a lot of country around the world are having.</p>
<p>It was interesting because also in that discussion, there are countries around the world that 

are wanting oxygen, they are wanting steroid for the treatment of people with COVID-19 because 

there  are  community transmission and so whilst all the countries in the world  want access to vaccine, 

there  are    countries  in  Africa,  for  example.    There  are  countries  in  other  places  where  they  have 

community transmission of COVID-19 where they are really wanting other medicines and oxygen, 

apart from the vaccine itself. Then that is in itself is like what you might say a “triple burden” in a 

sense because they not only wanting vaccine but also the ability to be able to treat those that have 

COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  made  it  very  clear  in  our  discussions  with  COVAX,  they  were 

going to supply the first 20 percent within the first quarter.  As we have alluded to, we are hoping 

that 88,000 doses will arrive very shortly.   We are also talking with our ability to be able to get the 

whole vaccine, so we have penned out for the whole of this year,  in essence will be about getting 

vaccines.</p>
<p>We  have  also  seen  with  what  is  happening  with  vaccine  hoarding.    These  are  first  world 

countries that are hoarding vaccines from one another.  I have just read in the news very early this 

morning, it was found in Italy that there was a couple of millions of doses of the vaccine that the rest 

of the European Union did not know, and it is becoming a grab across the world.  That is something 

that countries such as ours are really pushing on the diplomatic and all the global states that we cannot 

have that.</p>
<p>Every country is affected, whether big or small, therefore, it is important that vaccine equity 

is something that we all push for.  I think one of the things that is becoming very clear and that is one 

of the reasons and I have alluded to you in the Ministerial Statement today, that we received the first 

doses of vaccine in the Pacific is because we have our house in order, because we got the paper workin place and because we are COVID-19 contained.  That is why I also encourage us, and I thank theHonourable  Members  who  have  registered  in  the  last  few  days,  it  is  important  that  we  do  our 

registration, that we are ready, that we show to COVAX, we also show to those who would be able 

to give us the vaccine that we are ready to receive the vaccines as they come.</p>
<p>I want to make it is also very clear to  this august House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and to the nation 

at large, that the Fijian Government, just like it has been doing with all the vaccinations that we use 

for our children will only bring vaccinations that have been certified by WHO.</p>
<p>Lastly, Honourable Dr. Lalabalavu raised the issue in his reply to the Ministerial Statement 

this morning, the concerns about the data that was taken from the individuals in terms of registering 

for the vaccine.  I want to also make it very clear that that information, as I have said in the Ministerial 

Statement,  is  only  important  for  the  data  managers  to  actually  do  this  stratification.    That  is  the 

importance  of  information  that  is  put  in  for  the  data  managers  to  be  able  to  help  us  with  thestratification.</p>

<p>The first cab of the rank is the frontline health workers and their families, followed by the 

vulnerable groups, then followed by all of those who are above 60 years, then lastly at 18 to 60 years 

old.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Nawaikula you have the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Does the Government have the money to buy what is needed to</p>
<p>vaccinate the remainder of the population?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Firstly,  yes, we do have the  money, Secondly,  it  is  free.</p>
<p>Thirdly, you do not have to pay $15 to get your registration done.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Supplementary question, Honourable Member.</p>
<p>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There are lots ofmisinformation out there.  What is the Ministry doing with regards to awareness in staying ahead ofthe misinformation and the other information out there with regards to vaccination?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  DR. I.  WAQAINABETE.-  I thank  the  Honourable  Member  for that  question.    As  I 

have  alluded  to,  we  all  have  to  show  leadership  and  responsibility  in  awareness.    I  think  it  is 

imperative  upon  us,  we  have  seen  how  it  is  important  that  we  actually  support  one  another  in 

economic recovery.  I think it is important for us to understand that when we are all vaccinated, then 

we are in a position to be able to open up our borders so that we can get the tourism industry on track.</p>
<p>Already that is beginning with the “Blue Lanes” that is happening and that is very important, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I hear “no” coming from the other side, we cannot do that, we all know that the 

tourism industry has so many back end industries that it supports.  So when the tourist comes, it is 

the airline, it is the flight attendants, it is the pilots, it is Airports Fiji Limited, it is the transport, it is 

the taxis, it is the curio handicraft, it is the famers and so many back end  in the industry.</p>
<p>I think it is important that we all as Members of this august House participate in being ableto rebut those fake information.  The Ministry of Health working with digitalFIJI and the Ministry ofCommunication  and  development  partners  have  rolled  out  a  comprehensive  information  package 

similar to what was done with COVID-19. But I think it is important for us, for those of you who 

haveFacebookinside this noble House, please pick it up and share it on yourFacebookpages.</p>
<p>Let our Fijian people know that this is the way forward for us.  It will not only help us to open 

borders but more importantly protect lives.  See what is happening in Papua New Guinea, see what 

is happening in French Polynesia, see what is happening in countries similar to us or all around the 

world, that can happen here. Your family can pass on, my 99-year-old grandmother is at risk of dying 

if COVID-19 goes through the community. That is why we need to support each other with vaccine 

registration programmes and spreading the good word about protecting our nation.Vinaka vakalevu.</p>
