<p>Quality and Safety Standards of Construction Materials  

(Question No. 74/2021)</p>
<p>HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Given that the building and construction sector is very  important for the growth of 

economy, can the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport explain 

to Parliament how the Ministry is ensuring that building and construction materials imported 

or manufactured in Fiji are compliant to quality and safety standards?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA (Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport).- Thank you,</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable Member for the question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the building and construction sector in Fiji is actually critical for the growth 

in Fiji and the rest of the world.  It is critical for the growth of any economy.  During pre-COVID-

19,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  building  constructions  sector  was  actually  booming  and  employingthousands of Fijians. As this august House has heard over this week, Sir, despite the pandemic  in2020, we still have 1,458 building permits issued, which means investors’ interest in Fiji still  remain.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>25th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Now as a sector grows, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with a growth importance of  high standards and 

high quality buildings that actually comply with standards.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade, 

Tourism and Transport through the Department of National Trade Measurements and Standards is 

actually responsible  for setting standards for all goods and services  in Fiji. We even have a brake 

check by this particular Department, Sir.</p>
<p>The Department has actually developed relevant building materials standards which ensures 

that the building  materials are actually  fit for purpose and more importantly,  fit for our condition.  

There are over 24 odd building related standards adopted as Fijian specifications and some of the 

building material standards that were in place are for materials such as roofing coils, cyclonic screws 

and steel reinforcing materials, such as deformed bars and welding mesh, et cetera. These mentioned 

materials are actually critical components of any building that is being built, whether it is a home or 

whether it is a multi-storey building.</p>
<p>I wish to highlight that sinceTC Winston,the Ministry is actually focused primarily on ways 

to  ensure  that the  Fijian  public  and  the  private  sector  are  fully  aware  of  the  current  standards  for 

building materials.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we have actually worked hand in hand with stakeholders to look at howwe can actually make buildings more resilient and most importantly, Sir, more resilient to Category 

5 cyclones.</p>
<p>One  of  the  major  causes  of  the  destruction  of  buildings  is  actually  non-compliance,  Mr</p>
<p>.Speaker, with the Fijian National Building Code (FNBC).</p>
<p>Now, in order to minimise this  non-compliance  issues with Fijian National  Building Code 

(FNBC),  the  Ministry  in  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank  Group  developed  the  guideline  for 

improving  building  safety  and  resilience  for  new  single-storey  houses  and  schools  in  rural  areas 

throughout Fiji, Sir.</p>
<p>The  Ministry  and  the  World  Bank  Group  worked  with  the  relevant  agencies,  such  as  the 

Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs,  Provincial  Offices,  Ministry  of  Infrastructure,  Ministry  of  Economy, 

Construction  Industry  Council  and  Fiji’s  Institute  of  Engineers  and  Fiji  Architects  Association  to 

develop this easy to use guidelines. Guidelines have been  translated into three vernacular languages 

and  is  available  on  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  website,  with  the 

exception of the Hindi version which is actually currently been finalised.  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker,Sir, the Building Standards Committee also which was established in 2016 to specifically look at therealignment and modernisation of standards to current international best practices.</p>
<p>In  this  regard,  the  standards  for  roof  sucking  foils,  steel  coils,  grading  for  steel  coils  and 

reinforcing materials were actually put in place.  Now, the Ministry is actually working on two more 

critical standards so that standards for wind blow and plywood.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of its responsibility, the Department also monitors the standards and 

quality of building materials that are actually manufactured here in Fiji and imported into the Fijian 

market.  This is undertaken through markets surveillance methodology and confirmative assessment, 

third  party  or  independent  clarity  laboratory  to  demonstrate  the  compliance  of  products  against 

standards. We do not let anything get through, Sir, that does not actually comply with the standards.</p>
<p>Market  surveillance  methodology  includes  premarket  and  post  markets  surveillance  whichactually incorporates testing and inspection of the building product before and after the product enters</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>1009</p>
<p>the Fijian market.  This is a globally accepted good practice which enhances protection for all our 

consumers and builds the trust of investors.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the Ministry also issues import permits for materials, such as 

roofing coils and cyclonic screws.  In over the past three years, we have actually issued 80 import 

licences for cyclone screws and 605 licences for roofing coils.  We also work with other agencies, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, such as Fiji Revenue and Customs Services to monitor these products at the border 

or at the point of entries.</p>
<p>In  terms  of  compliance,  the  Ministry  undertakes  investigation  of  any  complaints  also  of 

possible  violation  of  these  respective  standards  under  the  Quality  Control  Act  1992  and  whilst 

monitoring  and  enforcement  is  important to  maintain  these  standards,  a  continued  awareness  and 

advocacy  also  is  equally  important.    This  is  where  we  work  actively  with  the  public  and  private 

sectors to create awareness on this particular standards, Sir.</p>
<p>I have highlighted a key initiative that the DNTMS under the Ministry undertakes to ensure 

that the standards are updated and meet our ever challenging market demands and in case of building 

material standards, the Department actually ensures thorough compliance so that we have buildingsthat are resilient to elements of nature and user friendly for all Fijians, Sir.  I hope that answers thequestion, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  We move on to the third Oral Question 

for today and I call on the Honourable Nawaikula to ask question his question.  You have the floor.</p>
