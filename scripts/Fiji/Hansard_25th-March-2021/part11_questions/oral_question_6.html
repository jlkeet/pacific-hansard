<p>Reticulation Water System – Rewa Delta 

(Question No. 78/2021)</p>
<p>HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 

Minerals Resources inform Parliament on the plans for the reticulation water system in the 

Rewa Delta?</p>
<p>HON.  J.  USAMATE  (Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  andMinerals Resources).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and thank you to the Honourable Member forhis question.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>25th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>In the earlier part of this year, in the aftermath ofTC Yasa, there were a lot of issues raised 

about water in the Rewa Delta by the people who were living there and as a result of this, the Water 

Authority of Fiji had to undertake some investigations and some repair works on the water system in 

the Rewa Delta in response to the complaints of low pressure and also in some cases of not getting 

water  at  all.    There  was  intermittent  supply  to  the  chiefly  village  of  Lomanikoro,  that  means 

sometimes they were getting water being supplied late in the evenings or the early morning hours, so 

not water all round.</p>
<p>In this particular zone where there was intermittent water, WAF had to mobilise its teams  to 

walk the lines, to follow the pipelines where the distribution lines, whether the water is being supplied 

and look at the areas that needed to be repaired and attend to them.  As we speak now, water supply 

has been restored at Lomanikoro Village.</p>
<p>The WAF teams also had to go and identify areas on which the mains in Lokia Village had 

burst. The water that comes through the Rewa Delta comes across from Narere and flows down from 

Narere  to  Debulu,  goes  through  the  swamp  areas  down  to  Lokia,  then  it  goes  underground  from 

Naililili, goes underwater and across to Lomanikoro then it is distributed further down to the Delta.</p>
<p>So they had to identify the burst mains at Lokia Village, also at Debulu, just at Narere andalso at Vunuku.  Even though after they had repaired all these mains, they found that there were still 

some areas in the Delta area that continue to receive low pressure and  intermittent supply, meaning 

they  have water  sometimes  but at other times they do not.  These  include  villages of Nasigatoka, 

Nadoi, Nasilai, Vutia, Tavuya, Nakaulau, Nabua, Drekena, Vunuku, Narocivo, Nukui and also some 

informal settlements such as Nariri and Naroro.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, what WAF had to do at that time is to get a barge and the areas that could not 

be reachable by roads, to make sure that they could cart water to some of these areas.  I am aware 

that there were also water tanks placed at Nasali Landing for our villagers to also come up and take 

water from that landing to take it down to their areas, while at the same time, we had to come in as it 

was  suspected  that  the  fault  was  in  the  submarine  lines  -  lines  that  come  across  from  the  Lokia 

Landing across to Lomanikoro.  So in order to carry this out, WAF had to walk the line from Debulu 

all the way down to Lokia, this means walking through swamps.</p>
<p>I actually tried to walk along with them and it is not easy to walk along those swamps because 

it  is  very  hard  to  identify  where the  leaks  are  when  you  are taking  the  pipes  through the  swamps 

because it is full of water.  They also had to follow it all the way down to Nukui Village which isright down at the mouth of the Rewa River where it meets the sea to identify and rectify the significantleaks that were contributing to the water loss.</p>
<p>By a method of elimination, the WAF Team also carried out flushing works of the submarine 

pipes, those on both ends of the river - the Lokia side and they were to identify the pumps and flush 

it up to make sure that you get all the silt out of the system and then go across to the other side of the 

river,  through  Lomanikoro,  they  initially  had  to  get  the  digger  to  dig  it  out  because  it  was  a  big 

excavation that they had to do, and because of the difficulties in getting their digger, they had to get 

actual workers to actually do the job, it was a big job.  I went there and saw what they did.  I mean I 

tip my hat off to the workers of Water Authority, it is hard work, it is dirty work but they still managed 

to do it.</p>
<p>They carried out the flushing works to get rid of the silt to make sure that these are not the 

cause of intermittent water supply.  The flushing means that you are removing the air pockets and ifthey are in existence, they will significantly affect the water pressure to the customers.  In parallelwith the flushing works, WAF also installed a number of new isolation valves along the way, that</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>will allow for the removal of silt built up in the future because the silt also will affect the quality of 

the  water,  the  dirtiness  or  the  cleanliness  of  the  water,  and  also  the  pressure  of  the  water  that  is 

received by the customers.</p>
<p>In addition to these measures, WAF has completed the reactivating of the Lomanikoro Header 

Tank.  There is a big tank that sits in Lomanikoro Village. This tank will allow them to provide the 

different storage for areas within the Delta, the pressure and the flow is now being monitored through 

the WAF National Control Centre.  So they have to look at the amount of water when you have pipes 

that are connecting, how much  is open to go to one distribution line and another one that goes to 

another distribution line, and at the same time make sure that there are some water going into this 

tank that sits in Lomanikoro Village.  There is another similar tank I think in another village down in 

Noco so these are tanks of water that you build up and when there is lack of supply, they can feed off 

into those particular tanks.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now water supply has been restored to Lomanikoro, Nasigatoka, the Vutia 

area, Drekena Village, Nabua Village, Nadoi Village and Nasilai.  As a way forward, WAF will also 

continue to work on  identifying  leaks  in  Lomanikoro Village Reticulation System.  There will  be 

ongoing verification of the distribution network and also reconfiguration of the system to get the bestout of the Lomanikoro Head Tank, reconfigure it - how much more water goes into the different pipesand lines that are in that area. They will also continue to work the lines within the Delta to identify 

and address any additional leaks within the Delta area.  This is something that the Water Authority 

of Fiji (WAF) opts to work with, especially with theTuraga Ni Koroand the Water Committees in 

each of the villages. So if they do find leaks, Water Authority of Fiji can be informed quickly so that 

they can try to address that.</p>
<p>Also the cleaning of domestic customer meters, there has been a lot work there, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.  A friend, a school mate of mine at the University of the South Pacific (USP) sent the message 

thanking me but I think I am not actually to be thanked.  The people to thank are the:</p>
<p>(1)Water Authority of Fiji’s Management Team and Staff (I actually visited the Rewa Delta 

three times during this operation and I just like to specifically mention the Team members 

that worked very hard on this particular operation

<p>Three Supervisors: Ratu Filimoni Seniloli, Mosese Maivunidawa, Netani Kubunavanua 

Technical Officer, Mr. Jo Kuinisivo</p>
<p>Seeing the amount of work that they had to do in difficult conditions, I appreciate the work that is 

done by the Water Authority of Fiji.</p>
<p>There have been a lot disparaging comments about Water Authority of Fiji but seeing how 

they have worked, I think I am very thankful that they have been able to restore water to the  Rewa 

Delta.  There are still other challenges that are before us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I am grateful that the 

water can be extended down to the Rewa Delta.Vinaka Vakalevu,Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa.</p>
<p>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honourable Minister for restoring the waterinto the  Rewa  Delta  and  he  has  been  as  he  said.  A  few  times  in  the  past three  weeks,  I  even  got</p>

<p>pictures being sent to me of the shower in Vutia which they have not been able to use.  So I thank 

him and the Water Authority of Fiji, and that he should appreciate also working through the silt and 

the swamp because that is our environment.  It is a beautiful environment, as you know, Honourable 

Speaker, ‘Me da gole ga yani e na vei dabibi’.Vei kemuni na TuragaPrime Minister, I would like to 

thank you and we look forward, Honourable Minister, to the two reservoirs: the one in Lomanikoro
