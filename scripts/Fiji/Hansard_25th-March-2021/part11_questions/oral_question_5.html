<p>COVID-19 Biosecurity Measures  

(Question No. 77/2021)</p>
<p>HON. S.R. RASOVA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update</p>
<p>Parliament on the COVID-19 biosecurity measures at our ports of entry?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY  (Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment).-  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, I do not know why this question is directed to me because biosecurity does not come 

under my Ministry, it comes under the Ministry of Public Enterprises.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- We will relook at that question at some future time, so we will move on</p>
<p>to the next question.  I hope the next person is ready.</p>
<p>The sixth Oral Question for today, the Honourable Vegnathan to ask his question.</p>
