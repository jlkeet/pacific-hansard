<p>Questions</p>
<p>1007</p>
<p>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR  (Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community</p>
<p>Development).- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for his question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to advise Parliament that my Ministry, Ministry of Local Government 

is not in receipt of any petition send by the market vendors association.  Because we did not receive 

the petition I do not know what is in the petition and therefore, I cannot answer this question.  I have 

checked  with  the  Prime  Ministerâ€™s  Office,  I  have  checked  with  Commissioner  Northern,  I  have 

checked with Labasa Town Council and none of them are aware of this petition, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on. Honourable Professor Prasad, you have</p>
<p>the floor.</p>
<p>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker.  Just to inform 

that I received a copy of that petition. It was copied to me and members actually raised it with me. 

So that is why I put the question. I can give the copy of this petition to Parliament.</p>
<p>(Hon. Government Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- No.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p>
<p>(Hon. Government Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order!</p>
<p>Honourable Members, when that petition gets to the Honourable Prime Minister, he will be 

able to look at it and then you probably be able to ask the ask question on that at some later time. But 

as of today, the Honourable Minister said she has not received it and she has also asked around.  We 

will move on.</p>
<p>The second Oral Question for today, I call on the Honourable Lal to ask his question. You</p>
<p>have the floor, Sir.</p>
