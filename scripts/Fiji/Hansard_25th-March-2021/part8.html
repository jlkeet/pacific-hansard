<h3>REVIEW REPORT - 2014 GENERAL ELECTION JOINT REPORT BY THE FIJIAN  
ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND THE SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS</h3>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report of the 2014 General Election Joint Report 

by the Fijian Electoral Commission and the Supervisor of Elections which was tabled on 16th 

May, 2019.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I now invite the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law 

</span></p>
<p><span>and Human Rights to speak on his motion. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity as 

the  Member  moving  the  motion  to  make  a  contribution  on  the  Committee’s  Report  on  the  2014 

General Election Joint Report by the Fijian Electoral Commission and the Supervisor of Elections.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I briefly would like to give some background to the Committee’s review on 

the  2014  General  Election  Joint  Report  that  was  referred  to  the  Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights 

Committee in the last term of Parliament and then reinstated in this new Parliament and referred to 

the current Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Chairperson, I would like to highlight that the Committee’s  mandate was 

fulfilled by reviewing the Joint Report (as it was then constituted) and the Multinational Observer 

Group (MOG) Report on the 2014 General Election.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee also considered the previous Committee’s consideration of the submissions 

</span><span>from  the  public  and  key  stakeholders  that  were  relevant  to  the  contents  of  the  Joint  Report.  The 

Committee does not see this process as a review of the entire electoral system but the specific issues 

raised in the Joint Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee thoroughly deliberated on the Joint Report and the review  findings  by the 

previous  Committee  which  highlighted  a  few  pertinent  matters,  which  were  discussed  with  the 

representatives of Fiji’s electoral management bodies. If I may Mr. Speaker, some of these pertinent 

matters include the: 

</span></p>
<p><span>• 

</span></p>
<p><span>• 

• 

</span></p>
<p><span>legal  challenges  that  were  encountered  by  the  Electoral  Commission  and  the  Fijian 

Elections Office; 

confusion caused by pre-poll; and 

issues regarding the counting process. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Committee noted that the discussions with the SOE and the FEC was

</span></p>

<p><span>956 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>SOE and the FEC was beneficial since it allowed for clarification of the issues identified from the 

review  and  also  enabled  the  identification  of  progress  in  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Electoral 

Management bodies.  My Committee, therefore, reiterated the previous Committee’s sentiments, in 

that the clarification provided on the issues noted from the Joint Report, was satisfactory. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the review, the current Committee noted the previous Committee’s 

deliberation  on  the  Report  and  the  issues  that  were  noted.    Some  of  the  issues  were  the  aspect 

concerning the legal challenges that were encountered by the Fijian Elections Office (FEO), and the 

concerns about the confusion and aspects of counting processes.  In the face of the Joint Report, it is 

the position of the current Committee that the mandate was fulfilled by reviewing the deliberation of 

the previous Committee when it reviewed the Joint Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  current  Committee  reviewed  and  considered  the  submission  received  by  the  previous 

Committee from the public and key stakeholders  that were relevant to the contents of the Report.  

The current Committee does not see this process as a review of the entire Electoral system as well.  

Having  noted  the  Committee’s  mandate  with  regards  to  this  Joint  Report,  the  Committee  also 

recognises that such a comprehensive review of the current system should be okay after the 2018 

General Elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee noted that progress has been made with regards to addressing many of  the 

concerns  raised  in  the  Joint  Report  yet  every  system  has  room  for  improvement.    After  the  2018 

General Elections, Fiji has completed two election cycles under the new Electoral System and this 

will allow for a fuller understanding of the challenges in the new system and an opportunity to gather 

and consider lessons learnt. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At the conclusion of the 2018 General Elections, it would be right time for the Parliamentary 

Committee to conduct a full review of the Electoral System through the Election Report to ensure all 

aspects of the system are considered.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would  like to inform that this review  is 

currently underway by the Justice, Law and Human Rights.  We are actually going around collecting 

submissions on the three Electoral Bills and the Joint Report that is before the Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now give me time to discuss 38 MOG Recommendations that were part of 

the  Joint  Report  of  2014  General  Elections.    For  the  review  of  the  2014  General  Elections  Joint 

Report,  it  was  noted  that  there  were  38  Recommendations  highlighted  by  the  MOG.    From  the 

Review, it was also noted that 19 of the 38 MOG Recommendations had been accepted by the FEC 

and acted upon in some progressive manner. 

</span></p>
<p><span>If  I  may,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  humbly  appraise  this  august  House  of  the  review 

regarding the MOG Recommendations on the 2014 General Elections.  The first recommendation 

was on the legal framework for Elections.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 1  

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji  should  consider  becoming  party  to the  International  Convention  of  Civil  and  Political 

Rights.  The comments from the Supervisor of Elections and the Fijian Electoral Commission at that 

time after seeking clarification  in 2017, was that it did  not have any  jurisdiction to deal with this 

particular recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 2 

</span></p>
<p><span>To ensure credibility of the electoral process, it is necessary to also include the participation 

</span></p>
<p><span>of domestic accredited non-partisan election observers.  Again, Mr. Speaker, it was recommended 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 20</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>957 

</span></p>
<p><span>that it was not under the jurisdiction of FEC or SOE to abide by this particular recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 3 

</span></p>
<p><span>Political Party Identification should be included on a national candidate list or voter should 

be permitted to bring “How to vote” materials inside the polling station or the ballot paper should be 

redesigned to include candidate names and parties.  At that point in time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, back in 

2017,  it  was  informed  and  submitted  that  it  does  not  have  any  jurisdiction  to  deal  with  this 

recommendation, but currently the Committee is reviewing this particular recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 4 

</span></p>
<p><span>The National Candidate Listing should be arranged in both numerical and alphabetical order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This recommendation was rejected by the Commission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The FEC and the FEO submitted that the order to maintain consistency and simplicity, one 

</span></p>
<p><span>list is enough. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 5  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  range  of  penalties  for  electoral  offence  should  be  proportionate  and  appropriate  and 

</span></p>
<p><span>comparable to international standard and practice. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this recommendation was also rejected, as FEC and FEO submitted that the 

Court  has  the  discretion  on  the  penalty  to  impose  depending  on  all  the  circumstances  of  the  case 

including any aggravating  factors of the case and the gravity and seriousness of the offence.  The 

Court will apply judicial principle when exercising its powers of sentencing. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 6 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government of Fiji should review and finalise all existing electoral laws 

</span></p>
<p><span>and regulations governing elections well in advance of the next election.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The FEC and FEO submitted that it does not have the jurisdiction to deal with this particular 

</span></p>
<p><span>recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 7 

</span></p>
<p><span>The division of responsibilities between the FEC and FEO should be clarified.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The FEC and FEO submitted that the amendment to the Electoral Act in February 2017, has 

clarified the roles of the SOE and the Commission. It has established that both organisations have to 

work together to deliver the election. The SOE is bound by all decisions of the Electoral Commission.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 8 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, consideration should be given to reducing requirements for party registration 

</span></p>
<p><span>and activities.  This recommendation was rejected at the time of seeking the clarification. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The FEC and FEO submitted that, despite Fiji being a single constituency, it is necessary that 

</span><span>Political Parties have national reach and approach in terms of their  formation and policy to ensure 

</span><span>balanced policy-making approach. It was also noted the number of Political Parties.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 9 

</span></p>
<p><span>Public office holders, including trade union officers, should be allowed to be political party 

</span></p>
<p><span>members. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FEC and FEO submitted that it does not have jurisdiction to deal with this 

</span></p>
<p><span>particular recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 10 

</span></p>
<p><span>The FEO and FEC should consider implementing electoral and campaign calendars, to ensure 

political parties and other election stakeholders have adequate time to prepare for the election cycle. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Electoral Commission will publish a calendar of event and key dates for the next General 

</span></p>
<p><span>Elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 11 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Public  Order  (Amendment)  Decree  (now  Act)  should  be  revised  to  allow  groups, 

</span><span>including political parties, to gather without requiring a permit. It was advised that the Public Order 

Act 2012 has been amended by Parliament to allow political parties to conduct meeting without a 

need of permit. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 12 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the  national  candidate  numbers  should  be  drawn  earlier,  to  allow  parties 

</span></p>
<p><span>sufficient time to publicise these ahead of pre-polling.  This recommendation was also rejected. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It was advised that this time around, parties will have sufficient time to campaign and inform 

voters of their candidate numbers.  The period between the Writ of Elections and the polling will be 

sufficient time  for the  candidate.   Furthermore, Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  currently,  once the Writ  is  filed, 

there would be no government for, at least, seven weeks.  We cannot actually increase this time to 

allow the country to go without a government. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 13 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  next  recommendation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  on  Political  Party  Polling Agents.    Rules 

</span><span>regarding the use of paper in the polling station should be clarified and observers and the party polling 

agents  should  be  able  to  carry  paper  into  polling  station.    It  was  advised  that  amendments  to the 

Electoral  Act  in  February  2017  has  clarified  that  Political  Party  agents  and  Observers  can  take 

materials approved by the Supervisor of Election inside the Polling station.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 14  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  FEO  should  provide  clear  information  materials  in  advance  of  the  election,  which 

</span></p>
<p><span>includes the role of political party polling agents in the polling process. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 15  

</span></p>
<p><span>More comprehensive training for party polling agents on their roles and responsibilities in the 

</span></p>
<p><span>electoral process should be provided by political parties or other responsible bodies.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>959 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 16 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  media  accreditation  process  should  be  simplified  and  all  media  outlets,  including 

</span></p>
<p><span>international media, should have sufficient advance notice of deadlines and timelines. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, for Recommendations 14, 15 and 16, it was advised that the FEC will publish a 

handbook for polling agents and the media. The handbook will explain the roles, responsibilities and 

restrictions for polling agents and observers.  It also gives guidance to agents and observers on how 

to deal with particular issues in the polling place. It is anticipated that the political parties can use 

this handbook to develop their polling agent operational procedures.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 17  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Media Industry Development Authority should issue clear, timely and practical reporting 

guidance.  It was advised, Mr. Speaker, that FEC does not have jurisdiction to deal with this particular 

recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 18  

</span></p>
<p><span>Penalties  and  breaches  election-related  reporting  rules  should  be  reviewed.  This 

</span></p>
<p><span>recommendation was rejected. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the FEO or FEC submitted that the Courts have the discretion on the penalty to 

impose, depending on all the circumstances of a case including the aggravating factors of a case and 

the gravity and seriousness of the offence. The Courts will apply judicial principles when exercising 

its powers of sentencing. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 19  

</span></p>
<p><span>Should the Media Industry Development Authority continues its role in future election, there 

is a  need  for an  independent institution to adjudicate complaints about its actions, consistent with 

Fiji’s legal and constitutional framework.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker, this  recommendation  was  also  rejected,  it  was  advised  that the  FEO or  FEC 

submitted that the MIDA  is a statutory  body and  the High Court has oversight of the activities of 

MIDA. Therefore, no further changes are required in this framework. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 20  

</span></p>
<p><span>There is a need for a regulation as well as an independent institution to prevent media biases, 

</span></p>
<p><span>thus ensuring a level playing field among election participants.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, this was also rejected, it was advised that MIDA  is a statutory body, and the 

High Court has oversight of the activities of MIDA. Therefore, no further changes are required in 

this framework. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 21  

</span></p>
<p><span>To facilitate prospective voters in remote areas to vote, the duration to apply for postal voting 

could be lengthened and the Fijian Elections Office should be more active in providing support and 

</span><span>amenities.  

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 23</a></p>
<p><span>960 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, it was advised that Parliament has amended the Electoral Act in February 2017, 

to allow the SOE to distribute postal ballots by the best practical means. This should allow voters in 

rural areas to receive the ballot well in time. The MOG Recommendation 21 is, therefore, accepted, 

but we have developed an alternative solution. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 22  

</span></p>
<p><span>It is important for voters and political parties to be informed of the national voter roll through 

all accessible means. We were informed, Mr. Speaker, that the printing and display of the National 

Register of Voters is now an annual exercise, and to enhance the sense of citizen ownership of the 

Register, the FEC has approved rules that will allow a voter to object to the registration of another 

voter. We believe that this will promote greater involvement of Fijians in the electoral process.  Each 

registered political party was given a copy of the register free of charge.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 23 

</span></p>
<p><span>The FEO should continue and expand its efforts to reach remote areas within person Voter 

</span></p>
<p><span>Education Programme. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It was advised that the awareness and the outreach programmes from the FEO will intensify 

as we approach the 2018 General Election. The FEO already has an awareness session built into the 

registration drive but a more formal and direct face to face awareness programme will be undertaken 

and that was from 15th January, 2018 to 15th April, 2018.  

</span></p>
<p><span>A Publication Guideline has been established to ensure that all voters have access to necessary 

</span></p>
<p><span>basic information about the election and the process of voting. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 24 

</span></p>
<p><span>Voter and civic education should be introduced in the secondary school curriculum in order 

</span></p>
<p><span>to raise voter awareness in future elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  were  informed,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  the  FEO  has  advertised  globally  and  secured  the 

services  of  Ms.  Yvonne  Gouldie,  an  Electoral  Expert  to  develop  the  Secondary  School  Electoral 

Awareness Curriculum. It was anticipated that the Curriculum will be ready for implementation in 

schools by 2018.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 25 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  FEO  should  create  a  mechanism  to  respond  to  reports  of  inaccuracies  of  information 

</span></p>
<p><span>provided by the SMS voter registration checking service.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We were  informed, Mr. Speaker, that for the 2018 General Elections, a call centre will  be 

established to assist voters with election queries. This call centre will  action queries on the check 

your polling venue SMS and online platform.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 26 

</span></p>
<p><span>Section 115 of the Electoral Decree, 2014 and now an Act should be revised to encourage 

civil  society  engagement  in  the  election  process, including  removing  restrictions  on organisations 

</span><span>receiving foreign funding.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>961 

</span></p>
<p><span>It was advised, Mr. Speaker, that the FEC and FEO submitted that it does not have jurisdiction 

</span></p>
<p><span>to deal with this recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 27 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Government  of  Fiji  should  engage  with  civil  society  organisations  and  actors  to  help 

</span></p>
<p><span>support its civic education efforts. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It was advised that the FEC and FEO submitted that it does not have jurisdiction to deal with 

</span></p>
<p><span>this particular recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 28 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Multinational Observer Group (MOG) respects Fiji’s national laws. However, the MOG 

</span></p>
<p><span>suggested that the FEO provide clarification on the reasons for rejecting civil society applications. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This recommendation was also rejected, Mr. Speaker. It was advised after verifying from file 

records that all reasons for rejection of applications under Section 115 was properly given, therefore, 

</span><span>the MOG has made an inaccurate observation in this recommendation. 

</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Recommendation 29 

</span></p>
<p><span>‘Pre-polling’ should be re-named ‘early voting’. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This  recommendation  was  also  rejected.    It  was  advised  that  the  FEC  believes  that  it  is 

unnecessary  to  make  semantic  changes  to the  electoral  system  from  one  election  to the  next.  We 

prefer  to  maintain  consistency  in  the  electoral  process  so  that  voters  can  become  more  confident 

about the system. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 30  

</span></p>
<p><span>Pre-polling location should be determined earlier and local officials should be consulted in 

</span></p>
<p><span>their selection. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  was  advised  that  the  FEO  launched  its  first  edition  of  the  Fiji  National  Polling  Venues 

Directory in March 2017. The purpose of the Directory is to allow Fijians to locate and learn details 

</span><span>about  individual  polling  venues.  This  Directory  was  developed  after  thorough  consultation  with 

</span><span>various agencies. An online version of this Directory is also available.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 31 

</span></p>
<p><span>Information on timing and locations for polling should reach all voters, with special efforts 

</span></p>
<p><span>made for voters in remote locations.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It was noted Mr. Speaker, Sir, that having established those areas where pre-polling will take 

place, it will  now be much easier for the FEO to inform voters in these areas about the exact timing 

for pre-poll in the polling places. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 32  

</span></p>
<p><span>The reason behind the regulation to ban pen and paper for observers should be clarified and 

</span><span>reviewed, as it could raise questions on the openness of the voting process.   We were informed, Mr. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 25</a></p>
<p><span>962 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Speaker, Sir, that the Amendment to the Electoral Act in February 2017 clarified that political party 

agents and observers could take materials approved by SOE inside the polling station. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 33 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consideration should be given to simplifying the voting process inside polling stations.  This 

</span></p>
<p><span>recommendation was rejected, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At the time of seeking the clarification  it was advised that Fiji’s polling process inside the 

</span></p>
<p><span>polling station is one of the simplest in the world and will not be changed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 34 

</span></p>
<p><span>A chronological list of procedures for each phase of Election Day should be made available 

</span></p>
<p><span>at each polling station as a guide for party polling agents and observers.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It  was  noted  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  an  important  part  of  the  polling  agent  handbook  is  a 

detailed explanation of the process for voting, counting and results transmission.  A diagram is also 

</span><span>included that explains the process on a polling day. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 35  

</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure sufficient training for polling station staff.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  training  of  election  officials  would  be  conducted  in  phases  for  2018  as  well  as  2022 

General  Elections,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    This  is  an  ongoing  process  now.  There  will  be  a  refresher 

programme organised following an announcement of the election date.  With elections more than a 

year away, at that point in time the FEO did ensure that recruitment would be done early to allow 

sufficient time to train the officials. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 36 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consideration should be given to simplifying the counting process.  It was advised that the 

counting process has been adjusted to allow staff greater convenience in undertaking this important 

role.  The Commission has once again limited the total number of voters to 500, which will mean 

that staffs who are doing counting will not be overburdened. The reconciliation book and the protocol 

</span><span>of results book have been modified to allow ease of use. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 37 

</span></p>
<p><span>Observers and party polling agents should  be allowed to maintain a continued presence  in 

</span></p>
<p><span>polling stations, including throughout the voting, counting and packing processes.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It was advised that a training manual has been prepared keeping in mind that observers and 

agents must be allowed to remain inside the polling station throughout the whole process.  Special 

emphasis has been placed on ensuring that this is conveyed to election officials during training.  The 

polling agent handbook by FEO also makes specific reference to this.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>963 

</span></p>
<p><span>It was advised that the EC and  FEO does not have  jurisdiction to deal with this particular 

</span></p>
<p><span>recommendation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the 2014 General Elections Joint Report saw the 

Committee also paying careful consideration to the MOG Report and the recommendations that were 

put forward in the Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As  alluded  to,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  out  of  the  38  Recommendations  put  forward  19 

Recommendations were accepted by the Electoral Commission and acted upon in some progressive 

manner.  Nine Recommendations were said to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Electoral Commission 

and these were Recommendations 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 17, 26, 27 and 38.  However, 10 Recommendations 

were rejected by the Electoral Commission with reasoning, as I had alluded to earlier, and those were 

Recommendations 4, 5, 8, 12, 18, 19, 20, 28 and 29. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  also  noted  the  deliberation  on  the  principles  of  gender  equality  and 

appreciates the apparent gap in placing emphasis on such requirements when the Joint Report was 

drafted and tabled in Parliament.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  having  noted  the  Committee’s  mandate  with  regard  to  the  Joint  Report,  the 

</span><span>Committee also recognises that such a comprehensive review of the current system should occur after 

the 2018 General Election.  The Committee also notes that since the tabling of the Joint Report, that 

progress has been made with regard to addressing many of the concerns raised in it, yet every system 

has room for improvement. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With  those  few  remarks,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  for  making  my 

</span></p>
<p><span>contribution.  </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  for  his  motion.  

Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and I give the floor to the Honourable Gavoka.  

You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  In terms of the electoral process, a concern 

with SODELPA is the declining number of our people turning out to vote.  If I can go back to our 

history, Mr. Speaker, in 1999, 89 percent of our people who registered to vote came to vote.  In 2006, 

it was 87 percent; in 2014, it was 83 percent; and in 2018, it had fallen to 71 percent. This is a very 

serious concern to us, Mr. Speaker, and we believe that every effort must be made to get our people 

</span><span>to  exercise  their  right  which  comes  to  them  once  every  four  years,  to  decide  on  the  kind  of 

</span><span>government they want over the next four years.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I have spoken in this House, Mr. Speaker, about that moment of truth, that whatever we do, 

it points to that particular time when a citizen of this country or when a Fijian, enters the privacy of 

that voting booth and decides on who is to form the government they want for the next four years.  

Everything we do, Mr. Speaker, points to that moment of truth. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, it would appear from the turnout at the last General Election that we are failing 

in that area.  Too many people did not come out to vote and in quantum, that was 171,000 people in 

2018 and 90,000 or so in 2014.   For a small country like Fiji, where the connection is pretty intact, 

it is quite a worry that many people are not exercising their right. 

</span></p>
<p><span>What we see, Mr. Speaker, is that political parties are not being empowered to play their role 

</span><span>to help in this process.  Too often, we come up with so many restrictions as we have today, affecting 

</span><span>the  work  of  the  political  parties.      Let  me  just  say  here,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  electoral  systems  and 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>political  parties  are  both  critical  to  enhancing  electoral  integrity  and  achieving  more  genuine 

representation.  Without political parties, the electoral system is merely a system that does not deliver 

people’s representation.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is almost inconceivable to have a functioning democracy without 

political  parties.    Political  parties  serve  a  wide  variety  of  functions,  such  as  aggregating  and 

articulating  interest,  developing  policies  that  provide  voice  and  choice,  selecting  candidates  for 

elected  office,  organising  legislatures,  coordinating  information  and  activities  of  government, 

recruiting and linking leaders and supporters and conducting electoral campaigns.  None of these are 

achieved just by having an electoral system in itself.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important to have political parties functioning in full.  Being at the 

heart of democracy, political parties require financial resources to perform their functions.  Money is 

the all-important oil that keeps the party machinery going.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday we heard from Honourable Professor Prasad about how unfair the 

system today is in providing the funding to the political parties.  We are badly handicapped in the 

way  it is done and one asks the question on what FijiFirst does with all the  funding that has been 

</span><span>provided over the years.  We are told to use the funding only for parliamentary purposes.  We wonder 

</span><span>if the same instructions have been given to FijiFirst.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about funding, we are the people who come to Parliament on 

the back of those who can only contribute $2.  If you look at this side of the House, there are 21 of 

us.  Those who brought us to Parliament are the people who pay $2 membership fee and on the back 

of that, we made it into Parliament.  Now, we have some plans to make it difficult for these people 

to  contribute to the  party.    If  you  want to  sell  roti  parcels,  you  have  to  process  it  in  the  way  that 

someone contributes $10,000, like the other side of the House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our model as a people is on </span><span>solesolevaki</span><span>.  We have the </span><span>soli,</span><span> we have the 

</span><span>kati,</span><span> we have the barbeque, et cetera, and to expect our people to process their contributions in the 

same way the FijiFirst collects their $10,000 per person, is very grossly unfair.  We want our people 

to be engaged in politics and engaging in politics is to help keep  your political parties functioning 

alive, so do not make it difficult for our people to engage in politics.  Remove all those fixtures that 

FijiFirst is cooking up because people have to exercise their right and they need their political parties 

so that they can get the government of the people, by the people and for the people.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is what concerns us about the way we are today, the way  it was in 

</span><span>2014 and 2018, and we are very concerned.  If it is not corrected, the numbers will be worse in 2022.  

I have spoken, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about confidence building  measures to help our people  have the 

confidence to come out and vote.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The system today is very intimidating, it is too restrictive.  If you look back into 1999, why 

was it and how was it that 89 percent of the voters came out to vote?  In 2018 why was it that only 

71 percent came out to vote?  Because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, people were empowered, the system was 

made user-friendly and people came out to vote.  Political parties must be part of the process.   

</span></p>
<p><span>All these, Mr. Speaker, we are now told as the 2014 and 2018 that 48 hours before the day of 

election is a black out.  Yet in the last General Elections, would you believe from the other side, some 

people  had  propagated  that  some  fake  news  about  Diwali,  et  cetera,  came  from  SODELPA  and 

affected  the  outcome  of  what  would  have  been  ours.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  get  rid  of  all  those 

</span><span>restrictions, make our people come out and vote.  Make it user-friendly.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>965 

</span></p>
<p><span>I am happy, Mr. Speaker, when I presented to the Committee that in 2022, at least, we will 

have the symbols of the parties, the photograph of the candidate and their number.  That is a step in 

the right direction and I commend the Committee for providing that, Mr. Speaker.  That is part of 

confidence building measures that we continue to highlight.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the danger here is that, the people will lose interest in their Parliament, and 

it is already happening.  As I said lately, the Sessions of Parliament used to be the highlight of the 

month.  We used to sit once a month, it used to be the highlight of the month and the questions were 

the highlight of the day.  It was at prime time and it used to be viewed across the country when people 

knew that their questions were being asked in this Parliament at that hour.  Now, it is being relegated 

to the end of the evening when everyone is tired and no one is watching.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As much as I respect the Ministerial Statements, please, put them to the end of the day because 

the Ministers are reading monotone and they can put everyone to sleep.  Let us have that robust part 

of the morning to come back when people expect their Parliament to be in full operation and they see 

that freedom of speech that is fundamental to democracy being practised in their Parliament.  The 

way  it  is, Mr. Speaker, is all one way and as I said,  it is killing the  interest of the people  in their 

Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for us, we are in campaign mode.  I know there are restrictions, we can only 

carry  out  awareness,  but  we  need  to  start  levelling  the  playing  field.    In  some  jurisdictions,  the 

Government provides funding to all political parties on an equal basis to carry out their work.  If we 

want our people to participate, to be fully engaged in politics, that is something that we should also 

consider and we would be all for it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When we become government, SODELPA will make sure that everyone is treated fairly.  We 

will give a sum of money to FijiFirst, we will give a sum of money to NFP and a sum of money to 

SODELPA. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We will treat everyone equally.  The people of Fiji know that change 

is coming, that a new world is emerging after 2022.  They will see democracy being practised to the 

highest level that we have ever seen in this country.  Change is coming!  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  time  is  coming  when  the  tyranny  of  FijiFirst 

</span></p>
<p><span>becomes the past and they will become a small footnote in the history of this country.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are exciting times for us on this side of the House as we head towards 

forming the Government in 2022 and we want people to be engaged.  We believe that if the 171,000 

people had voted in 2018, some people could have been sitting on this side of the House and we will 

be sitting on that side of the House. Mr. Speaker, we know that and that is  what political  leaders, 

need to do to engage their people in the fullness of their rights in a democratic community that we 

have like Fiji.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I commend the work of the Committee, Mr. Speaker, they are doing a good work.  As they 

consulted people across the country, I wish they would be given all the support and then implement 

what we are hearing from across the country.  The word is very clear, make it user-friendly so that 

we can all participate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, a new dawn is happening and if we make these changes, we will see a greater 

</span></p>
<p><span>participation by our people. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Gavoka.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, just stick to the content of the Report, make that generalisation, just 

the content of the Report as presented.  I do not want to hear about the history of all the other elections 

that had taken place but the content of the Report put today, let us stick to that. We do not have all 

the time right now.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Next on the list is the Honourable Professor Prasad. You have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. While I thank the Chair of 

</span><span>the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for his Report, I was kind of baffled as 

</span><span>to why the Committee did not make any recommendations  like  it did  in this Parliamentary Paper. 

73/2019.  That was the review of the Electoral Commission and MOG reports into the 2014 General 

Elections and what we debated and noted last month, Mr. Speaker, the recommendation in this Report 

is and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“After  reviewing  the  2014  General  Elections  Joint  Report  by  the  Supervisor  of 

Elections and the Fijian Electoral Commission, the Committee has no contentious matters 

to bring to the attention of the House. The Committee recommends that the Parliament take 

note of the contents of this Report.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this  is  in  my  view, a  far  cry  from the recommendations contained  in the 

Parliamentary Paper No. 73/2019 where the Committee actually recommended for the setting up of 

a special parliamentary committee to carry out a comprehensive review of elections systems and I 

want to quote this recommendation as well:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“For a number of the recommendations noted in the FEC Annual Report 2014 and 

the MOG Report 2014, the Committee notes that there will be more evidence upon which 

</span><span>to  determine  if  there  are  still  challenges  after the 2018  General  Elections  which  will  be 

</span><span>determined from the Commissions’ Annual Report, therefore, after the upcoming election, 

Fiji will have two electoral cycles completed and that will be a good time for Parliament 

post-election to do a comprehensive review of the system,  to gather lessons learnt from 

previous two elections and to compare with best practices in election management with the 

goal that Fiji has the best electoral system possible.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>So, Mr. Speaker, I heard the Chairman talked about the 38 Recommendations and I am glad he did 

that because it actually shows why those recommendations were important.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Recommendations, Mr. Speaker, fell into two parts; one could have been entertained by 

the FEC itself and the other required legislative changes.  So and so the statement from Honourable 

Maharaj that for some of those recommendations the FEC or the SOE did not have the jurisdiction, 

is actually correct.  They do not have the  jurisdiction to make  legislative changes. The  legislative 

</span><span>changes will have to come to Parliament, it will come through a special parliamentary committee or 

</span><span>an Act of Parliament. 

</span></p>

<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>967 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  you  know  it  does  not  make  any  sense  to  say  the  FEC  does  not  have  the 

jurisdiction. Yes, we understand if it is a legislative change recommended by the MOG or FEC, then 

it will be for Parliament to consider.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  same  Committee  also  recommended  for  a  review  of  the  penalties  in  the 

Electoral  Act  to  reflect  international  standards,  and  my  question  is;  why  did  the  Committee  not 

reiterate the same recommendations in respect of the Joint Report of the Electoral Commission and 

Supervisor of Elections. I mean it is not a million dollar question, it is simple.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee may have decided that after making substantial recommendations, it would 

not  repeat  those  for  the  risk  of  something  like  a  broken  record  to  the  Committee  may  have  just 

reviewed the work being done by its predecessors before the 2018 Elections and to avoid time wasting 

relied on the outcomes of the Committee before its dissolution before the 2000 Elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The third reason is most likely a contributing factor to the absence of any recommendations 

and that is the change in the composition of the Electoral Commission in early 2017.  From the expiry 

of the three-year term of the former Commission and his Chairman, which made it wide-ranging and 

I repeat, wide-ranging and sensible recommendations in conformity with the Multinational Observer 

</span><span>Group. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The new Electoral Commission appointed in early 2017 adopted a different approach to the 

former Commission’s Report basically ignoring major recommendations as well as that of the MOG.  

They  are  also  not  reflected  in  the  current  reforms  being  proposed  through  amendments  to  the 

Electoral Act and I might add, the Political Parties (Registration, Conduct, Funding and Disclosures) 

Act which Parliament still has to consider. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ignoring  the  recommendation  of  the  former  Commission,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  captured  in  the 

Verbatim  of  Proceedings  before  the  Committee  perceiving  the  current  one.    This  is  available  as 

Appendices to the Report that we are scrutinising and taking note of.  In particular, Mr. Speaker, I 

refer  to  the  Verbatim  of  5th  October,  2017  when  the  Supervisor  of  Elections,  FEO’s  Legal  and 

Compliance Officer and Media Officer appeared before the former Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Supervisor  of  Elections  and  Legal  and  Compliance  Officer  still  hold  their  respective 

offices while the Media Officer has gone back to Fiji Broadcasting Commission (FBC), the same 

organisation and the News Room from which he had graduated to the Fijian Elections Office. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, to illustrate the change of position from the former FEC to the newly appointed 

</span></p>
<p><span>one, which is still chaired by the same person, and I will quote portions of the Verbatim:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“The Supervisor, in his brief submission, made it abundantly clear that what he was 

saying  was  the  position  of  both  the  Commission  as  well  as  his  intents  of  the  former 

Commission’s recommendation and Report whose term was not renewed.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  must  be  recalled,  Mr.  Speaker,  for  record  purposes,  that  the  former  FEC,  chaired  by  a 

prominent lawyer from a reputable firm in Lautoka, had taken the Supervisor of Elections to Court 

for  disregarding  the  decision  on  upholding  a  successful  objection  against  a  FijiFirst  candidate  in 

2014.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Just  because  the  FEC’s  ruling  came  after  4.00  p.m.  on  a  Friday,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  end  of 

working  week  of  the  three  day  period,  but  still  within  the  calendar  day,  the  Commission  first 

</span><span>challenged the decision of the Supervisor of Elections in the High Court which was rejected by the 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 31</a></p>
<p><span>968 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Judge, but then in the Court of Appeal, Mr. Speaker, where all the three Judges unanimously ruled 

that the Supervisor of Elections was wrong to disregard the decision of the Commission. 

</span></p>
<p><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  amongst  changes  to the  Electoral  Act  in  February  2017,  came  the 

stipulation of the timeframe of 4.00 p.m. as deadline for decisions and objections which the Court of 

Appeal had ruled to be wrong. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, in what is termed as a brief submission by the Supervisor, he told the Committee, 

</span></p>
<p><span>amongst other things, the following (because this is very important) and I quote from Page 2 of the 

Verbatim Report of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law &amp; Human Rights on 5th October, 2017: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The way to interpret that the Electoral Commission’s approach to the reports as 

well  as  this  submission  and  everything  is  that  the  Commission  noted  the  report  by 

Multinational Observer Group (MOG) and previous Commission was and they made their 

own position; they decided what they wanted to do about it. 

</span></p>
<p><span>They  approached  the  Committee  to  inform  the  Committee  that  this  is  what  the 

Commission believes should be made out, based on that recommendation, against what the 

</span><span>Commission thinks.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Chairman  also  clarifies  to  me  that  and  I  can  convey  to  the  Committee  that 

because we are the Electoral Commission, the Electoral Commission does not want to get 

engaged  into  a  political  exercise  of  rebutting  and  then  commenting  on  political  parties’ 

statements as this submission, as well as  further statements, have  been used  by political 

parties in campaigns, et cetera, et cetera. So, the fact of the matter is in Fiji, the political 

system is now using the electoral system as a campaign tool.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  paragraph  later  in  the  verbatim,  the  Supervisor  makes  his  incredible 

</span></p>
<p><span>statement and I quote,  

</span></p>
<p><span>“Usually the electoral authorities are not politicised indirectly.   However the case 

in Fiji, the moment is different and we acknowledge that and we are working within our 

legal framework to ensure that we do not cross any boundaries.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>What did the Supervisor mean here, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Was appearing before a Parliamentary 

Committee politicising the Fijian Elections Office?  If you have an electoral change, an Act that is 

</span><span>considered by the Committee, if you appear before the Committee and make these statements, it is 

</span><span>not politicising the Fijian Elections Office or the Electoral Commission or the office of the Supervisor 

of  Elections.    Was  the  Supervisor  referring  to  a  joint  statement  or  submission  by  the  parties  in 

Opposition  and  outside  Parliament  for  changes  to  electoral  laws  based  on  what the  Multinational 

Observer Group and the Electoral Commission, soon after the 2014 election, recommended? 

</span></p>
<p><span>Clarifications about these statements in the verbatim lead to perceptions.  We do not want to 

believe in perception, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but the fact is that the former Commission’s recommendation 

in our view, has been railroaded and raises a lot of questions and eyebrows. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want leave it at that, but suffice it to say that the laws governing the conduct 

of elections as well as those of political parties and the media, in my view and in our party’s view, 

remain very, very regressive.  Unless we address those regressive laws and make those  legislative 

changes that was recommended by the Multinational Observer Group, that was recommended by the 

</span><span>2014  Electoral  Commission,  we  are  not  going  to create  a  level  playing  field  because  that  is  what 

</span><span>democracy is all about.

<p><span>Political parties and the laws governing political parties and he electoral system must provide 

that space, freedom for political parties and voters to engage in the political processes.  Thank you, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member.  Honourable Dr. Waqainabete, you have 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would just like to make a 

</span></p>
<p><span>short contribution. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Let us go back again to the recommendation.  After reviewing the 2014 General Election Joint 

Report by the Supervisor of Election and the Fijian Electoral Commission, the Committee has no 

contentious  matters to  bring  to the  attention  of  the  House.    The  Committee  recommends  that  the 

Parliament take note of the contents of the report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have three Electoral Bills that have been brought to the House 

and is going through its process through the Parliamentary Committee.  It will be interesting to see 

what happens and I think it will address some of the concerns that have been raised currently in the 

</span><span>House. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to finish by saying that the Honourable Gavoka keeps on talking 

about change and changes happening, this will happen.  I do not want to dwell a lot into it, but the 

people in 2018 have spoken and the constituency of the House, how it constitutes now, we on this 

side, and they on that side is because of the grassroots people that he talks about, which are people, 

my relatives, Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and Minerals 

Resources’ relatives, Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport’s relatives, 

they picked us and that is why we are here.  I thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Qionibaravi, you have the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  ADI  L.  QIONIBARAVI.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  rise  to  contribute  to  the 

motion before the House.  I thank the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and 

Human Rights and the Members of the Committee for the Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they have not made any recommendations.  In reading through 

</span><span>the Joint Report by the Electoral Commission and the Supervisor of Elections.  They also did not 

</span><span>make any recommendations in their report.  However, I would like to read the conclusion of their 

report which states, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The 2014 General Election was a testament to the collective will of the people to 

</span></p>
<p><span>return the country to democracy.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>It was indeed Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji had  looked forward to the  2014 General 

Election because we all wanted to have our democracy back.  Be that as it may, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 

political  parties  had  identified  shortcomings  in  the  2014  General  Election.    They  made  concerted 

efforts to bring these to the new Electoral Commission but it was to no avail.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it is well known that  if authorities do not consult the people,  it does not 

matter how well a law is written. Its implementation will be hampered by the notion of its imposition 

</span><span>on the will of the people.  We have had two general elections in Fiji and the people remain doubtful 

</span><span>on the system of election. The doubts are represented by the people who had voted the Opposition

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>candidates, the 2014 and 2018 General Elections.  The numbers had increased and will continue to 

increase Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  doubts  are  contained  in  the  joint  Opposition  parties  submission  to  the  Fiji  Electoral 

Commission after the 2014 General Election and whilst preparing for the 2018 General Election, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.  I wish to highlight just seven of the recommendations: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(4)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(5)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(6)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(7)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>That  a  total  review  be  conducted  on  the  IT  system  used  in  the  Election’s  Office  in 

particular all computers and the software used in the counting of votes.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That the count at the polling stations to be taken as a final count unless there is a dispute 

and an audit of recount is to take place or a recount at the National Tally Centre.    

</span></p>
<p><span>That all </span><span>Turaga Ni Koro,</span><span> advisory counsellors  provincial  councils, </span><span>tikina </span><span>councils, town 

councils, rural local authorities, be notified by telephone, email and letter by the Fijian 

Elections Office in order to  inform their communities about voting, and not just to be 

informed through the media or a press conference as most are not available to this medium 

of communication.  

</span></p>
<p><span>That Section 119 of the Electoral Act be amended in order for the Electoral Commission 

to approve observers and not the Minister for Elections.  

</span></p>
<p><span>That the Electoral Commission be granted its own separate budget and to employ their 

own employees including their own Secretary.  The underlying philosophy has to be that 

the  Electoral  Commission  and  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  primarily  objective  is  to 

facilitate  free  and  fair  election  rather  than  to  defaults  to  a  restrictive  and  forbidding 

environment  and rules.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That the Minister responsible for Elections should be the Honourable Prime Minister as 

has been the precedence.  The people of this country are asking for fairness, and that is 

all. We simply ask for fairness so that all political parties compete on an even playing 

field.  

</span></p>
<p><span>That our prayer for true equality be imposed by the Electoral rules so all political parties 

send an equal chance under the system rather than a system that is designed to deregister 

parties and punish politicians.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  would  just  like  to  refer,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  an  example  of  how  rules  operate  against 

opposition parties.  I turn to the specific provision that has greatly handicapped opposition political 

parties.  I speak, Sir, about the 48 hours blackout before the day of election.  First, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

the blackout does not apply to pre-poll voting which begins two to three weeks before voting day.  

So in fact one day voting is a myth because elections actually take place over a month in Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the experience of 2014 and 2018 the 48 hours blackout is designed to enable the 

ruling party to silence opposition parties.  I say that because in 2018 internet trolls established fake 

pages mimicking the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>, the </span><span>Fiji TV News</span><span>, et cetera, and spread fake posts, for example, in 

falsifying SODELPA policy to abolish Diwali.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be interesting to investigate and find out who really was behind the 

fake post.  Due to the requirements of the blackout period and draconian penalties meted out to those 

</span><span>who breached the blackout period, the Opposition Parties could not go mainstream or through social 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>971 

</span></p>
<p><span>media to correct these  lies which were detrimental to our final  voter count.  Even the  mainstream 

media could not point that these are fake stories and fake pages.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I now wish to address the exclusion of the judiciary and need for an effective remedy redress, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, when there are problems experienced with the electoral process, as we did in 2018 

with our Court of Disputed Returns, it is unfortunate to, say the least.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As  I  have  said  in  my  contribution  in  the  last  session  in  February,  the  Court  ruling  on  the 

administrative evidence from certain witnesses basically collapsed the electoral petitions that were 

filed as the key witnesses were withdrawn.  There was no point in continuing with the exclusion of 

key witnesses.  A ruling that could not be appealed and appealed effectively frustrated the judicial 

challenge and the rights of parties and citizens to redress.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There is a need, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a holistic review. In our view given the many flaws in 

the  current  system,  and  already  publicised  by  the  political  parties  and  individual  members  of  the 

community, a holistic review of the whole electoral  framework is required to look in  detail at the 

issues identified.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The proposed amendments in Electoral Legislations will not bring about electoral integrity, 

</span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.   It is easy to label any process free and fair but we noticed the lack of transparency 

and different interpretations of rules in the last two General Elections.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Electoral Commission had recommended the following in 2014: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>That  the  Electoral  Commission  should  be  empowered  with  independent  legal  advice 

instead of solely relying on the Solicitor-General. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The provision of symbols on ballot papers and not only on candidate booklets freeing up 

the media in respect of the elections process.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Making observation of elections less restricted.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Removing draconian provisions in the Political Parties Act.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a need to improve the process to ensure a fair system 

and a level playing field.  If Government considers the view of the people please withdraw the three 

Bill to amend the Electoral Provisions.  What is needed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the appointment of an 

independent commission from both sides of the House to carry out a holistic approach and the review 

of the whole legislative framework for elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we from this side of the House make these recommendations in the 

public interest so that the will of the people is truly heard and implemented.  I thank you, Sir, for the 

opportunity to speak on this motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member.  Honourable Minister for Employment, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Productivity, Industrial Relations and Youth and Sports, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  rise  to  speak  on  the  Report  by  the 

Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights on the 2014 General Elections Joint Report 

by the Fijian Electoral Commission (FEC) and the Supervisor of Elections (SOE).

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Honourable Gavoka, in his contribution, said that because of the fake news 

they lost some votes but he forgets that just last year, the Opposition Whip made a very damaging 

statement in regards to Diwali.  Sir, I want to put that matter to rest.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I wish to briefly speak on the Multinational Observer Group (MOG) 

summary of findings.  The outcome of the 2014 Fijian Elections broadly represented the will of the 

Fijian  voters.    The  conditions  were  in  place  for  all  Fijians  to  exercise  their  rights  to  vote  freely, 

Honourable Prasad.  The political parties were free to campaign and the campaigns were peaceful.  

This is the report that I am referring to.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- This the summary of the findings.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Number three will hurt them because this is the truth.  The media made good effort to cover 

the  elections.    The  Fijian  Elections  Office  and  polling  officers  were  all  well  prepared  and  voting 

procedures  were  correct.    Police  played  in  a  neutral  manner  when  needed.    Voter  information 

campaign by the FEO and the EC was extensive.  Counting processes was well organised and lastly 

</span><span>the group also observed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the election was conducted in an atmosphere of calm.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  the  short  timeframe  in  2014,  the  Supervisor  of  Elections,  Mr. 

Mohammed Saneem conducted the 2014 General Elections in one day with high polling under the 

new electoral system with single constituency.  Sir, there were 248 candidates.  This  system, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, has brought Fiji into the modern era and in line with principles of equal votes for equal 

representation with the one person, one vote system.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Hear, hear! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It has enabled, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a fair and a transparent system with the 

national  lines of voting where each voter casts her or his vote for one candidate of their choice.  In 

fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2013 Constitution removed the racial voting that we had since 1970.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the 2014 Elections, there were a lot of talks by the Opposition parties 

that the voters will find difficulty in the new system and Mr. Saneem was not well qualified.  Only 

0.75 percent was invalid votes.  This shows that the electoral system is not only fair but results in 

maximising the value of the votes for voters.  Mr. Speaker, the SOE, Mr. Saneem proved all critics 

</span><span>wrong and at this juncture I wish to thank him and his team for a job well done before, during and 

</span><span>after.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  the  previous  elections,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the  communal-based  constituency  system,  this 

percentage of invalid votes was much higher resulting in the loss of the democratic rights of the voter 

to  have  their  votes  validated  and  not  invalidated.    I  am  very  hopeful  with  more  awareness 

programmes and with voters learning  from past mistakes, I am confident that this percentage will 

decrease even further in 2022.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the electoral system starting from the Independence period until 2013 was 

on a communal base.  This system encourages the divide and rule tactics from the Colonial period.  

Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to state that in fact, the old system prolonged the national division and 

lack of essential developments like health, education and infrastructure.  Had the SVT or SODELPA 

or anyone would have done that at that time, we would not be doing that.  That fund could have been 

</span><span>used and utilised somewhere else but you have failed, so we need to do it and we are doing it.  It is 

</span><span>well documented that during that era, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the national development was compromised 

</span></p>

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>973 

</span></p>
<p><span>because politics  favoured province-based handouts rather than sustainable development due to the 

votes along racial lines held in the constituencies.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  I  reaffirm  that the  present  electoral  system  looks  after the  welfare  of  all 

Fijians and leads to parliamentary representations that results in mature and fair decisions to build a 

better Fiji.  This is very clear, Sir, under the FijiFirst Government and its election victories in the past 

two General Elections and the law made for a better Fiji for all Fijians to continue.  Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    I  give  the  floor  to  Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Tuisawau, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the debate 

at hand on the Review of the Fijian Electoral Commission Annual Report 2014.  I note in the Report 

there  is  an  issue  on  independence,  accountability  and  budgetary  independence.    There  are  eight 

Recommendations there in the report but they do not mention any issue on the independence.  So, I 

will briefly touch on that based on the submissions already made by this side of the House. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Fijian Electoral Commission (FEC) must be independent as the Constitution provides, it 

</span><span>must also be adequately resourced to effectively discharge its constitutional responsibility to deliver 

free and fair elections.  The Electoral Act provides the performance of its functions, exercise of its 

powers.  It is not subject to the direction or control of any person or authority.  However, section 4(2) 

provides notwithstanding section 1, the FEC may consult the Minister on any matter. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It also provides the Commission  must make an  Annual Report to the President concerning 

the operations of the Commission and must submit a copy to Parliament as we have received.  We 

wish to highlight that the Multinational Observer Group (MOG) makes specific recommendation to 

ensure the independence of the Electoral Commission as well as the Elections Office on page 9 of 

the Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The division of responsibilities between the FEC and the Fijian Elections Office (FEO) should 

be clarified.  The FEC in 2014 expressed to the Attorney-General and the MOG that it lacks sufficient 

staff.    It  saw  itself  under  the  Electoral  Act  in  Section  75  of  the  Constitution,  as  a  separate office 

therefore, with its own complement of staff independent of the Supervisor of Elections Office.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Report  also  states  to  ensure  that  its  complete  independence  the  FEC  must  have  a 

</span><span>completely separate budget allocation.  It must have an independent legal advisor, as already stated, 

</span><span>repeated request for an independent legal consultant to the Minister remains unanswered. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Annual Report 2014 further recommended amendments to the Electoral Decree 2014 to 

clearly  reflect  how  the  two  institutions  should  be  functioning  to  actualise  their  respective 

responsibilities under the Constitution.  The FEC further stated that there is lack of good governance 

structure between the FEC and the SOE.  It further hoped with the help from development partners 

that rules of engagement, electoral policies and other corporate operating guidelines and regulations 

would be completed by mid-2006. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In its conclusion in the Annual Report 2014, the short period of separation within a six-month 

period  meant  that  certain  areas  such  as  policies  and  clarity  on  government  issues  between  the 

institutions of the FEC and the Office of the Supervisor of Elections were not given the attention they 

deserved.  To report further, while Section 76(2) of the Constitution clearly enables the FEC to direct 

</span><span>the Supervisor of Elections on matters concerning his or her performance, the current Government’s 

</span><span>arrangement limits the FEC’s role. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 37</a></p>
<p><span>974 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The FEC remained understaffed in 2015 and donor partners were concerned about this, which 

is  also  quoted  in  the  MOG  Report  -  paragraph  4  on  page  15.    This  was  further  clarified  by  the 

November 15th Court of Appeal Judgement against the SOE. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The independence of the FEC under the Electoral law, the Electoral Act 2014 in section 4 and 

section 8 elaborate on the independence.  The SOE has the same independence but must comply with 

the directions or instructions of the FEC gives him or her as an officer or clarifies that as a subordinate 

to the Commission. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 14 of the Electoral Act outlines the requirement for transparency in 

all activities of the FEO, including the requirement to meet with political party candidates, observers, 

and  media  to  update  and  discuss  matters relating  to the  administration  of  elections  and  campaign 

process.  The MOG made specific recommendation to ensure the independence of the FEC, as well 

as the FEO on page 9 as outlined earlier. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We do support the recommendation on the following reason, that Opposition political parties 

and  civil  society  organisation  had  in  2014  expressed  to  the  MOG  the  lack  of  confidence  in  the 

independence and impartiality of the FEC and the FEO, which is borne out again in the MOG and 

</span><span>the FEC Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Further, a meeting of the FEC and Opposition Parties on 3rd April, 2017, the Political Parties 

were promised the data and statistics, and I believe that there has been an improvement in this.  The 

new  members of the  FEC should gain experience and confidence to independently carry out their 

critical responsibility for the 2018 Elections as envisaged under the provisions of the Constitution.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The new Chairperson of the FEC, Mr. Suresh Chandra, publicly stated that the Commission 

will  follow  the  law  as  it  is  and  not  what  it  should  be,  which  maintains  the  status  quo  which  is  a 

concern.  The political parties hoped to be convinced that the FEC will fully effect a wide-ranging 

powers given to them under section 3 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2017.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The separate functions, as already mentioned, are also clarified under Sections 75 and 76 of 

the Constitution.  The Government’s response to the above recommendation of MOG Report is the 

new subsection in section 5 of the Principal Act, the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2017 reads: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The Supervisor shall act as Secretary of the Electoral Commission and must attend 

</span></p>
<p><span>all meetings of the Commission.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Again that is a positive improvement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>“The directions and instructions that the Electoral Commission gives him or her of the 

</span></p>
<p><span>performance of his or her functions.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>I believe this  is an  improvement  from the set up from 2014.  This was  further clarified as 

</span></p>
<p><span>mentioned by the Court of Appeal.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of under staffing, the Electoral Commission Report said the consequence of under 

staffing, the Commission had to review and attend to electoral  matters that could only  be done  in 

their  private  time.    So,  the  issue  remained  under  staffed,  even  in  25  and  donor  partners  were 

concerned about this.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, that is expressed in the MOG Report.  It is unclear why the SOE or the Honourable 

</span><span>Attorney-General could not have allocated the budget of FEC from the $21 million it had received 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 38</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>975 

</span></p>
<p><span>from  donors  for  the  election.    After  the  Election,  about  $15  million  or  40  percent  of  the  budget 

remained unspent and the FEO has been surviving on that since.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Electoral Commissioners also recognised in the 2014 Report, to ensure it is completely 

independent as  mentioned,  it must have a, again I reiterate, separate budget allocation and a  legal 

advisor.  We, on this side of the House, support the recommendations of the MOG, specifically the 

recommendations of the FEC in the 2014 Annual Report, that the Electoral Act be amended to reflect 

clearly how the two institutions - FEC and FEO should be functioning to actualise their respective 

responsibilities  under  the  Constitution.      As  mentioned,  allocate  separate  budget to  determine  the 

number  of  staff,  setting  up  of  the  office,  securing  legal  advice  and  representation  as  and  when  it 

deems necessary.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again,  I  am  referring  here  to  the  situation  then,  as  explained  by  the  Chairman  of  the 

Committee, we have moved forward now, it is 2021 and there could be improvements in this with 

the Bills which are coming before us.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The other issue, which I would like to express today, which was also a concern.  The dual 

role of Attorney-General as the Minister for Elections and also the General Secretary for FijiFirst, 

</span><span>political parties and their supporters also perceived a conflict of interest because of the dual roles.  

</span><span>Even though the MOG and Electoral Commission did not make any specific recommendation on this, 

we feel and believe and recommend that the Honourable Attorney-General should not be the Minister 

responsible for the elections.  The Minister responsible for the elections should be the Honourable 

Prime Minister in accordance with past legal precedent.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition  to  that,  as  a  conclusion,  from  2014  up  to  now,  we  note  that  the  2014  Annual 

Report,  we  are  just  discussing  it  now,  it  would  be  prudent  to  discuss  it  before  the  next  General 

Elections, for example, 2014 Report, we should discuss it in 2015 and 2016, and the 2018 Report, 

we should be discussing it now and implement its recommendations before the next elections in 2022.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When we come into Government in 2022, that is what we will be doing.  Also to make the 

work of Parliament easier, I would like to request the Committee to draw up a matrix on all the issues 

from  2014  up  to  now.    There  are  so  many  recommendations  and  also  submissions  from  various 

political  parties  which  are  good  submissions  and  which  have  made  very  substantive  and  credible 

recommendations.  Do up a matrix on what was recommended by the Commission,  by the Supervisor 

of Elections, by MOG and what has been actioned since 2014 and 2018 and also the submissions 

from the political parties on what has been actioned, what needs to be done.  In that way, if we had 

</span><span>that book, we can trace the  improvements as we go along.  And even before the next elections  in 

</span><span>2022, we will know, “Okay, this has been decided, these are the recommendations, these have not 

been done” so that we can take over the implementation on the recommendations when we become 

the Government. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other issue mentioned by Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial 

Relations and Youth and Sports, Sir, he went on a whole  lot of things which was  not even  in the 

Report  on  condemning  the  past  governments,  condemning  the  past  elections  and  one  point  he 

mentioned was that the current electoral system ensures equal vote for equal value.  I would like to 

clarify to you today that what is happening today is the total opposite of what he is saying  because 

before you used to vote for your constituency candidate and the one person and your vote is attributed 

to you.  But here the Honourable Prime Minister with 180,000 votes is able to take with him about 

half of FijiFirst into Parliament.  That is not one vote of equal value, that is totally the opposite of 

that concept.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you, Sir, I would like to commend the Committee for their work and also commend 

them for the Bills which are coming up on the consultations being done around the country and we 

look forward to their report for 2018. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Honourable  Tabuya,  you  have  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.  I  rise  to  make  a  small  yet  important 

</span></p>
<p><span>contribution to the debate before the House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, as noted in the 2014 General Elections Joint Report, there have been numerous 

concerns raised and my colleagues have highlighted these concerns and complaints raised with the 

then  Electoral  Commission  regarding  the  2014  General  Elections  process.    There  were  legal 

challenges that came to court including a  legal challenge against the Supervisor of Elections, Mr. 

Mohammed  Saneem  which  I  was  involved  in  when  we  objected  to  the  candidacy  of  the  current 

Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations and Youth and Sports, who, 

at the time  of  nomination,  was  a  public  officer.    If  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  had  respected the 

Electoral Commission and their decision, he might not be sitting here.   

</span></p>
<p><span>By the way, the Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations and 

Youth and Sports berates the provincial administration (just responding to him) set up by previous 

Governments,  yet  this  Government  is  using  that  same  administration.    Honourable  Minister  for 

Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations and Youth and Sports is politicising the Provincial 

Council’s appointments and the like.             

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Do not converse with the other side.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- He is the one conversing with me, Mr. Speaker.  I am disregarding 

</span></p>
<p><span>him. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Forget about him. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- I will speak to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.     

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- You just address the Speaker.  I am a better looking guy than him.    

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  never  ending  complaints  against  the 

Supervisor of Elections.  This include what has been raised as questions of conflict of interest being 

the Secretary to the Electoral Commission and also the Registrar of Political Parties.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this has been criticised several times by political parties and also the voters. 

But, Mr. Speaker, I wish to refer to a recent event and this shows the extent of the Supervisor of 

Elections and his disregard for authority as was evident by the Fiji Court of Appeal’s decision when 

he  disregarded  the  Electoral  Commission.    This  is  important,  Mr.  Speaker.    The  Supervisor  of 

</span><span>Elections has now taken a step further and impeded the work of Parliament. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>977 

</span></p>
<p><span>I refer to the recent incident, Mr. Speaker, where a citizen was participating in a hearing of 

the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights  in  Wailotua. She was expressing  her 

concerns about the conduct of the last two elections and this was reported in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>, who were 

also present at the hearing.  The Supervisor of Elections got wind of this from the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>, took it 

to the media to condemn this citizen and even to the extent to report her to FICAC and berating the 

</span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> for printing it.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the very article he condemns, he relies on to make his decision to report this 

citizen.  Now, Mr. Speaker, this is very concerning, yes.  What the Supervisor of Elections should 

have rightly done, Mr. Speaker, as a lawyer that he is, he should have sought out first what actually 

happened in that hearing. He should have contacted Parliament, who would have put him in touch 

with the Chair of the Standing Committee and the Members, and then referred to the proceedings in 

the verbatim or the evidence of what transpired.  Instead, Mr. Speaker, what did he do - he went to 

the media. 

</span></p>
<p><span> Mr. Speaker, the Standing Committee of Parliament has requested further consultations on 

the  proposed  amendments to the  laws,  and  this  is the  very  parliamentary  work that  had taken  the 

Committee to that village and yet the Supervisor of Elections, acting on his volition has undermined 

</span><span>this important parliamentary process and the public consultations normally conducted where there is 

</span><span>protection of parliamentary privilege.     

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  need  the  public  to  attend  these  hearings  and  with  it  comes  the  trust  and 

confidence for members of the public to be candid and forthcoming, and this premature, disrespectful 

behaviour by the Supervisor of Elections, by crucifying a citizen for being candid and for being frank 

for giving her view, Mr. Speaker. This creates mistrust and a lack of confidence from the voters and 

non-attendance at these hearings.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I am defending the parliamentary process. This concerns all of us here in this House including 

yourself, Mr. Speaker. Yes, we all work hard so that the voters can have confidence in us. We work 

for them, so Mr. Speaker, we recommend that this Parliament should condemn the behaviour of the 

Supervisor of Elections.  

</span></p>
<p><span>How dare he interfere with this process? How dare he crucify a member of the public? He 

needs to follow the right channel, come to Parliament and consult the Chair of the Committee, Mr. 

Speaker. He is there to serve the public, not the other way around.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- Point of Order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- He should withdraw his complaint.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Point of Order.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- Mr. Speaker, you have already stated that we need to stick to the 

subject matter at hand and she  is attacking the Supervisor of Elections, who is  not here to defend 

himself. That in itself is unfair.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Member, you have heard the Point of Order so just stick to what we are supposed 

</span></p>
<p><span>to discuss.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the Minister for Women, who is 

also a lawyer, that the Supervisor of Elections is the subject matter of these reports whether it is 2014 

or 2018, it was his behaviour.  It shows a consistent blatant disrespectful behaviour for the voters and 

for the political parties and for all of us who sit here, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you are starting to repeat yourself. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In conclusion, I would just like to say, Mr. 

Speaker, that the Supervisor of Elections needs to stay in his lane and let us do our jobs for the people. 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport, you 

</span></p>
<p><span>have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I have not started yet.  You are already scared, Honourable Gavoka. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak and I want to thank the Standing 

Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights with respect to this  particular Review of the 2014 

</span><span>General Elections’ Joint Report by the Fijian Electoral Commission and Supervisor of Elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Just to let the Honourable Tabuya know the Report is on the Review of the 2014 General 

Elections Joint Report by the Fijian Electoral Commission and the Supervisor of Elections.  It is not 

about the Supervisor of Elections </span><span>per se</span><span> so attacking him personally with respect to something that 

happened.... 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  Forget about the other side, just continue. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  I  think  we  have  all  heard,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  with  respect  to  staying 

</span></p>
<p><span>relevant.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to address a few things with respect to today’s motion.   The 2014 

General Elections marked the country’s return to parliamentary governance but more than that, Sir, 

it actually invigorated the custom of voting and electing representatives into the highest office of the 

land. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In 2014, Fiji not only had to prepare its citizens to vote, it also had to prepare itself.  We had 

</span><span>to  prepare  ourselves  to  hold  an  election  under  a  new  electoral  system  to  implement  processes  to 

</span><span>register thousands of voters and ensure the dissemination of information that would not only enable 

but also motivate a voter to cast his or her ballot in a non-compulsory voting system.  That is quite a 

phenomenal  task  when  you  have  to  motivate,  especially  against  the  time  of  non-motivation  that 

comes  from  SODELPA  when  it  comes  to  election  time,  Sir.  They  go  through  this  process  of 

discouraging people, et cetera, and then they come here and complain that the voter turnout was not 

good enough. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Fijian Elections Office, Mr Speaker, Sir, is an independent body.  It was established on 

28th March, 2014 and it was given six months since its formation to prepare and take the country 

into  a  General  Election  in  the  new  electoral  system,  the  modified,  open  list  proportional 

representation system.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  I  hear  Honourable  Members  on  the other  side  mocking  this  particular  system  but this 

</span><span>system has given you 21 seats.  Why are you mocking it?  It has given you an opportunity to sit there 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 42</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>979 

</span></p>
<p><span>and make your voices heard, why are you mocking it?  The point is, if you want thirty, you might 

have to work hard enough, you have to beat us first. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Sir, the point is that just for a moment, if it is so happen and God forbid 

it does, if it is so happen that they were sitting on this side of the House, they would not utter one 

word about this; they will not do that, not at all.   

</span></p>
<p><span>One of the most important elections in the history of this country was the 2014 Elections, and 

I will tell you why this 2014 Elections was such a historical elections for our country, Sir.  The whole 

country formed a single constituency and it was based on the principle of one person, one vote, one 

value, and that was what was adopted, Sir, and that is the freest, fairest elections that this country has 

ever had.  There was actually groundwork that was needed particularly to streamline the elections 

operations to reflect this new voting system. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The FEO, Mr Speaker, Sir, in 2014 registered 591,101 voters and recorded a turnout of 84.6 

percent and Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations and Youth and 

</span><span>Sports is correct, Sir, - only 0.75 percent of the votes cast were actually invalid, which was a record 

</span><span>low for any elections in Fiji, we did it correctly, Sir.  Over 10,000 Fijians were actually involved and 

delivered that particular Elections, and we need to take our hat off to all of those people who gave us 

that election.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  2014  General  Election  was  deemed  a  credible  election  by  the  Multinational  Observer 

Group  (MOG).    It  was  the  MOG  that  declared  and  I  quote:  “The  outcome  of  the  2014  General 

Election broadly represented the will of the Fijian voters.  The conditions were in place for Fijians to 

exercise their vote freely.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>You cannot tell me that, that is not enough for us - it is.  And of course, there are things that 

they  will  ask  us  to  change,  that  we  will  do.    There  are  recommendations  that  have  already  been 

attended to and I will address those, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Following the 2014 General Election, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time in Fiji, the election 

management body had remained operational in between elections which meant that voter registration 

was continuously done right up until the day the Writ  for the 2018 General Elections was  issued.   

Because  of  that  Sir,  we  had  637,527  Fijians  who  were registered to  vote  in  2018.   The  FEO  was 

</span><span>adequately funded also since 2014 to take on new innovations and further streamline its processes as 

</span><span>per international best practices in elections to be implemented in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In line with international best practices, Sir, the FEO actually developed its five year strategic 

plan  (2015-2019)  and  this  plan  presented  a  comprehensive  operational  plan  that  resulted  in  a 

realisation of all the innovations that we currently experience when it comes to elections in Fiji.  We 

took it to a new level, Sir, amongst its top innovations was the FEO results app; a first of its kind 

which allowed the public direct access to the 2018 General Elections  in real times.  The app was 

developed in house and showed the results by party, by candidate and polling venue.  In fact, the app 

is still available and comes in very handy.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover  Sir,  the  FEO  launched  its  website  in  2017  and  that  was  actually  to  improve 

information dissemination to stakeholders and the most significant change was the introduction of 

disability friendly features to promote inclusivity and greater engagement.  First of its kind, Sir, the 

</span><span>users with visual impairments can actually increase the size of the font or even enable an automated 

</span><span>readout of the text on the particular page, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 43</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>In 2018, Sir, the FEO introduced its ten year election module.  This module introduces high 

school students to elections and gives them a hands on experience on the voting process.  This is the 

first comprehensive program at school  level  in the region and will definitely deliver results  in the 

upcoming general election, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to make it easier for votes, the FEO had launched the 1500 call centre in 

2018 and this is a free platform which voters could call to ask questions relating to elections and call 

centre staff were actually trained to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs).  There was also the 

1500 SMS text platform which was activated in February, 2018.  The service was available free of 

cost and it helped voters find their particular voting venue. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it is  my  firm  belief that the  foresight of the Government to invest in the 

continuous operations of the Fijian Elections Office has actually produced noteworthy results.  One 

just  has  to  take  out  the  2006  General  Election  Observer  Mission  Reports  to  draw  some  simple 

analogies on the vast improvement in the capabilities of the office and now, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, in its report following the 2018 General Elections, the MOG actually noted that the Fijian 

Elections  Office  prepared  for  the  election  thoroughly,  implementing  a  long  term  strategy  of 

</span><span>improvement through the electoral cycles.  The 2018 process was actually transparent and a credible 

</span><span>overall and the outcome broadly represented the will of the Fijian voters.  That is exactly what has 

been expressed Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  keep  talking  about  that.    They  somehow  seem  to  insinuate  that 

everything  is skewered towards  FijiFirst.  It is not, Sir, there is a level playing  field  for everyone.  

The rules that they are talking about and no use laughing about it, Honourable Gavoka, it is not a 

different set of rules for us and a different set of rules for you.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is absolutely not, it is the same set of rules that we are governed by.  It is the same set of 

rules that we are actually live by, it is the will of the people that has put us here and it is the will of 

the people that actually come out because we have got a phenomenal system.  So, you cannot stand 

here and actually complained and say that ’oh, you know this is unrepresentative, it is not right and 

everything is secured’.   

</span></p>
<p><span> I want to correct some of the numbers that have actually come out, Honourable Gavoka has 

actually said that the percentages were wrong. The voter turnout in 2018, Mr. Speaker, was 71.92 

percent. The voter turnout in 2014 was 84.6 percent. The voter turnout in 2006 was 64 percent. It is 

</span><span>wrong.  If I could also break down the numbers for you, in 2018, the total votes cast was 458,532.  

</span><span>In 2014, the total votes cast was 500,078 and I will tell you why in minute.  In 2006, it was 307,004.  

Of that, Sir, if you go back to 2018, the registration, as I said earlier, was 637,527, the registration in 

2014 was 591,000.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, if they say that there was less voter count and we can see that there is, they have to also 

look back at their own process, they are the ones who actually go and discourage people at the end 

of the day with respect to when voting comes out. We do not, there is a proper process that goes on, 

there is educational programme in the Elections Office, et cetera, they go out to the communities, we 

do it if they seem to see that there are numbers for them, is that our fault?   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is not, it is their own problem. You create the monster at the end of the day when you are 

asking people certain things and  you are not telling them the truth. This  is actually what happens.  

You cannot turn around just because you are sitting on the other side and blame us, we are not to be 

</span><span>blamed.  Let us be real, we are not to  be blamed.  It is  you, it is  your policy that puts you in that 

</span><span>particular seat. What policies? Go and look at your own policies, do not ask me.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>981 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, there is a lot of work that actually gets done.  We have the FEO doing community visits. 

So in terms of education, FEO has actually gone and done a lot of community visits so that people 

can be aware.  

</span></p>
<p><span> Honourable  Adi  Litia  Qionibaravi  also  raised  some  issues  regarding  fake  news,  et  cetera. 

They have been amended, the SOE actually has amendments in place and to remove fake news and 

breaches during the blackout. This is actually good, we do realise when there are issues that needs to 

be resolved and taken care of we do.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In  conclusion,  Sir,  in  its  report  following  the  2018  General  Elections,  the  Multinational 

Observer  Group,  again,  said  that the  Fijian  Elections  Office  prepared  for the  election  thoroughly, 

implementing a long-term strategy of improvement throughout the electoral sites. The 2018 process 

was transparent and credible overall and the outcome broadly represented the will of the Fijian voters.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, once the Multinational Observer Group gives you a tick off, I think everyone should take 

note. You have to take note, that is an independent body, it is completely independent, we have no 

influence, nothing over it.  But, obviously, it is not good enough for them because it does not align 

with the way they think.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Also  note,  Sir,  we  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  acknowledge  and  thank  all  our  donor 

partners who are actually supported Fiji during the 2014 General Elections, I also extend our sincere 

gratitude to the  leader  of the  MOG  and  indeed  it was  one of  the  largest observer  missions  at  any 

elections.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Also I want to thank all the Election officials and the Electoral Commission and also I want 

to  join  Honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity,  Industrial  Relations  and  Youth  and 

Sports in thanking the Supervisor of Elections for the extremely hard work that he has actually put 

in and the entire Elections Team for 2014 and 2018, have actually done the nation proud.  They put 

a firm footing, they make sure that they have done a lot of hard work and we acknowledge the work 

that they have done. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I want to acknowledge the Committee also, Sir.  They have found no contentious   issues to 

report and I hope that this Parliamentary Report will put to rest the many unsubstantiated, politically 

motivated rumours and claims about the 2014 General Elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I just want to point  out briefly too that this particular report, Sir, is a bipartisan report and 

</span><span>they have come up and say there is no qualifications and the signatures  here are not just FijiFirst 

</span><span>members, the signatures are also from the other side. So, they have sanctioned it.  So, no use coming 

here and saying things contrary to this report at the end of the day, nothing came out. There are no 

recommendation as such.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There are members of the Opposition on this particular report who have signed off.  It is a 

bipartisan report.  I do not understand how they actually think.  So, again, Sir, it is what everyone 

needs to be reminded though it is everyone’s duty to build confidence in the constitutional offices. 

We do it on a daily basis.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  findings  by the Standing  Committee actually vindicates any claims and  allegations of 

wrong doing by any person.  I think it is not fair that we start raising things that are not in this report 

like the Honourable Tabuya has done.  She ought not to do that. It is for another forum, maybe, she 

should write to him and ask.

<p><span>Review Report – 2014General Election Joint Report By FEC &amp; SOE 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I want to thank, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to stand here and support the motion on the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, Honourable Minister, Honourable Prime Minister, you have 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support on the motion before the House by the Honourable 

Maharaj and I commend the work of the Chairperson and the members of the Standing Committee 

on Justice, Law and Human Rights, in their deliberations over the joint report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I also commend the Supervisor of Elections, staff of the Fiji Elections Office and the Electoral 

Commission, for the successful management of the 2014 General Elections. We cannot thank them 

enough for that effort.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, I just want to add on to say that Fiji is ratifying the International Covenant on 

Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on 16th August, 2018.  This happened after the last Committee 

completed its work on the report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I make this point, Mr. Speaker, because, all nine core Conventions have been ratified by the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fijian Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I just want to add on, that there has been a lot of complaints from Honourable Gavoka about 

their money. He wants to know how we spend our money but I want to tell him that it is none of his 

business.  He should be worried about their money which is stuck because of Mr. Sitiveni Rabuka.  

He knows that.  Everyone in that group knows that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Their internal dispute, Mr. Speaker, is the cause of them not having money. He should ask 

his leader.  Honourable Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu told the Party he will not give Parliament funds to 

the Party, so he should not be talking to us about our money.  We know how to spend our money.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Well,  I  see  Honourable  Tuisawau  holding  up  and  I  am  very  surprised  to  see  him  here  in 

</span></p>
<p><span>Parliament this morning because it shows to me he is a hypocrite. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  talked  about  the 

figures that Honourable Gavoka had come up with but I just want to say again Mr. Speaker, Sir, how 

</span><span>Honourable Gavoka always bring up these sorts of lies in Parliament.  It is not right.  We are talking 

</span><span>about the turnout, he keeps harping about the turnout in 2006 was 89 percent when it really was 64 

percent.  I do not know where he plucked that figure from but it was the lowest turnout in Fiji elections 

and then again, it was a compulsory voting, so there you go. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Elections Office, and the Supervisor of Elections have established 

the  standard  of  fairness,  impartiality,  and  transparency  that  will  stand  for  generations  as  we 

guaranteed the right of free and fair elections for every citizen. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the free, fair, and credible elections required by the Fijian Constitution are 

the  foundation  of  the  genuine  democracy  that  our  people  cherish.    The  Electoral  Commission  is 

mandated under the Fijian Constitution as an independent authority responsible for the registration 

of voters and the conduct of elections in accordance with relevant laws. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There are extensive preparations ahead of the Elections in 2014 as you have heard, mentioned, 

</span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ushered in our genuine democracy and established the Commission  as a credible

</span></p>
<p><span>and impartial institution capable of managing our 2018 Elections that is largely responsible for the 

fact that each of us  is serving this Parliament today. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As we know, one election does not make a democracy.  The democracy is strengthened and 

solidified with its subsequent election as the people choose their leaders and state their views through 

their vote.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is clear from the Committee’s deliberations on the report that there 

were  no  contentious  matters  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  House.    Let  me  say  that  again,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, there were no as in zero contentious matters to bring to the attention of the House, with 

regard to the conduct of the 2014 Elections.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Simply  put,  the  capable  implementation  of  Fiji’s  electoral  process  ensured  that  the  2014 

Elections was free, fair and credible.  It was declared as such by the Multinational Observer Group 

that oversaw it.  Thanks to those strong and independent institutions that managed it, it was the most 

successful  elections  that  was  ever  conducted  in  Fiji  at that time.    It  was  in  fact, the  first  genuine 

elections in the Fijian history. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is because our Fijian Constitution which some people do not seem to 

accept,  enshrines  true  democracy  and  not  the  pay  limitation  we  once  suffered  as  a  nation.    It 

</span><span>guarantees equal votes of equal value without any form of discrimination along the lines of gender, 

</span><span>religion  or  ethnicity.    Without those  protections,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  past  political  system  fell 

short  of  genuine  representation,  well  short  in  fact,  instead  they  were  shackled  by  their  backward 

notions of ethnic supremacy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It was undemocratic, it was unjust, it entrenched class and privilege of a truly representatives 

system.  With the 2014 Elections, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we finally brought an end to that era by delivering 

the new and true democracy that Fijians had long sought and always deserved. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this report represents a bipartisan assessment of the facts once and for all.  

It has casts into the rubbish bin the ridiculous claims that the 2014 Elections was not fair or lacked 

credibility.  That election was indeed a true reflection of the will of the Fijian people and today, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, every  Member of this House,  have to recognise what was obvious to the rest of the 

world seven years ago because as I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the credible, free and fair 2014 Elections 

brought us more than a genuine parliamentary system and it helped propel Fiji on to the world stage 

like never before.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is important, especially for the other side of the House to know.  Not only did we re-join 

</span><span>the Pacific Islands Forum and Commonwealth, we went on to assume global roles such as the Chair 

</span><span>of  G77  plus  China,  UN  Oceans  Conference  Co-Chair,  MSG  Chairmanship  role,  UNJ  presidency, 

COP23  presidency,  the  current  UN  Human  Rights  Council  presidency  and  there  is  the  incoming 

Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum as well as a host of other regional and international positions of 

leadership.   

</span></p>
<p><span>None of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would have been possible had the other democratic nations of 

the world believed that our elections were credible and Fiji was permanently on a true democratic 

path.  This shows the level of trust other neighbouring Pacific Island countries and the world leaders 

placed in Fiji and the institutions that managed and supported our elections and in this Government.  

The nations of the world have not only worked with us, they have looked to us to lead on issues like 

climate  change,  oceans  preservation,  biodiversity  protection,  disaster  resilience,  human  rights, 

energy, food security and sustainable development.  None of these would have happened if the world 

believed one word of the discredited claims of other fairness of the 2014 Election.

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>But for me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most important way to gauge trust in a democracy and in 

our elections, is the faith that lies in the hearts of the Fijian people.  Fijians know that they have the 

right to vote, they have faith that their votes and their voices matter equally and they have used both 

to choose their Government twice, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They have chosen the Government I lead and 

the only genuine parliamentary elections in Fijian history.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Preparations are now underway, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the next election, the third consecutive 

election  that  will  give  all  Fijians  equal  representation.    Again  we  will  entrust  the  Electoral 

Commission and the Fijian Elections Office with ensuring that the writs are returned and receipted, 

voter registration is updated and maintained, candidates are registered, electoral disputes are settled 

and other electoral elements that need to be addressed are addressed fairly. That includes monitoring 

and compliance with any written law governing elections and political parties.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2014 was only seven short years ago.  With every election, our democracy 

grows  stronger  because  people’s  faith  in  their  system  grows  stronger  when  they  know  that  their 

voices  and  their  votes  matter.    So  we  must  guide  this  democracy  of  ours.    We  must  guard  our 

democracy as the precious treasure that it is.  It must never be taken for granted, not today, not 10 

years from now, not ever.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Government  will  continue  to  financially  and  legally  support  the 

Electoral Commission to pursue its independent function.  In addition, the Government will allocate 

resources  to  enable  the  Commission  to  perform  its  constitutional  roles  ably  and  carry  out  its 

responsibilities  professionally.    They  must  have  the  staff,  they  must  have  the  training  and  the 

technical capability and capacity to conduct these kinds of elections that the Fijian people deserve 

and trust.  Based on these remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I therefore support the motion.  Thank you.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    Right  of  reply,  you  have  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor, Chairman.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will try to make it short.  The whole 

concept about the 2014 General Elections  has been  very well-explained  by the Honourable Prime 

Minister and I do not need to elaborate any further but just a few comments that were made and I 

would like to actually elaborate on.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Gavoka  rightfully  mentioned  about  the  decline  in  the  number  of  voters.  The 

Committee under the current review of the Electoral Bills, we have come across that and discussed 

</span><span>this at length. We cannot blame anyone with regards to the number of voters going down. It is the 

</span><span>choice of individuals; if they do not want to vote, they do not turn up to vote.  But what we need to 

do is, we need to work together with the Supervisor of Elections, Electoral Commission, political 

parties because the interest is going down. People are not interested in voting and that is a concern.  

How do we increase the interest of our people in the electoral system itself?  That is very important 

for us to actually work together with the Supervisor of Elections. He has also called in for the political 

parties to work with them to ensure that this interest improves in the near future.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I also want to elaborate on the figures of 2006 but it has been taken care of by Honourable 

Koya, so I will not touch on that. With regards to some of the comments that came from Honourable 

Professor Prasad, I need to inform him that we actually give progressive reporting and scrutiny. That 

is why when we actually did this particular scrutiny of the 2014 General Election Joint Report, we 

did not have the Electoral Commission Report at that point in time. They came  before the Committee 

and informed us that there are recommendations on which they are working on, so after a couple of 

</span><span>years when we kept getting the annual reports, after discussions, that is when those recommendations 

</span><span>will come into place.

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>The  other  thing,  I  believe  you  also  mentioned  and  I  stand  to  be  corrected  was  the 

recommendations in this particular Joint Report from the Committee does not have, because of the 

change  in  the  Commission  members.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  that  because  there  are 

recommendations in the Joint Report itself but it is the Committee’s Report which does not have any 

recommendation, so that is another one. 

.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Qionibaravi has called to recall the Bills. I would just like to inform that most of 

these changes that I mentioned were not under the jurisdiction of the Electoral Commission, are part 

of that particular Bill. Most of the suggestions they have taken on board but just because they do not 

have the jurisdiction, it has come before the Parliament and we are trying to scrutinise at the moment.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There  have  been  political  parties  that  have  come  before  the  Committee  to  present  their 

submissions with regards to those three Bills. We had  individual SODELPA Members, thank  you 

very much for coming before the Committee and doing your submission. I urge other Members as 

well, if you have anything to do with regards to those three Electoral Bills, please come forward and 

give your submission. We are still collecting submissions. We are doing that on a bipartisan approach.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Justice, Law and Human Rights Committee consists of three Government Members and 

</span><span>two Opposition Members and we are scrutinising this Bill along with the Joint Report so that we can 

</span><span>present a more comprehensive report back to the Parliament for us to debate. With these few words, 

I would also like to thank the Supervisor of Elections and the Electoral Commission for conducting 

a credible General Election in 2014. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your time.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Chairperson for his right of reply. Parliament will 

</span></p>
<p><span>now vote.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Question put.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Motion agreed to.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, on that note we will break for lunch and during the 

lunch break, the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians (CWP) Fiji Group will have a meeting in 

the Big Committee Room straight after this. Only the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians (Fiji 

Group), not others. We break for lunch.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament adjourned at 1.14 p.m.
