<h3>POINT OF CLARIFICATION</h3>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This  morning I was berated by the 

Honourable  Acting  Attorney-General  and  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  for  providing  wrong 

figures on the election results for 2006.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I have here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Election Guide.org which gives us the rundown of all 

the election results in Fiji since 1999, and it says that in 2006, 87.87 percent turned out to vote.  You 

can see that on the graph here, where 2006 is higher in terms of voter turnout compared to 2014 and 

2018.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, they have another website.  I think the Honourable Prime Minister 

said 64 percent and the Acting Attorney-General said 66 percent - maybe you have something else 

that you got your figures from, but people of Fiji heard this today and I was given hell by my wife 

</span><span>when I went home for lunch, but this is the figure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I shared today and in my 

</span><span>view, it is absolutely correct.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members an explanation  is an explanation and  you do not 

</span></p>
<p><span>have to hand anything over. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is a clarification, it is done and that is it.  Honourable Members, we will now adjourn until 

tomorrow morning.  I apologise  for working a bit hard today, but I have an appointment between 

6.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. - the virtual conference with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, 

which I have to fulfil so we adjourn until tomorrow morning. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament adjourned at 5.10 p.m.
