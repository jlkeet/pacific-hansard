<p><span>New Subsidised Rates for Kidney Dialysis 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  On 23</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2020, the 

Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, through an extraordinary gazette, legislated 

new  subsidised  rates  for  kidney  dialysis  by  amending  the  Public  Hospitals  and  Dispensaries 

Regulations.  Is this a fact providing real benefit to our kidney patients requiring dialysis or is it a 

fallacy designed to hoodwink the people, especially our dialysis patients. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The new prescribed rates were $137.62 for Fijians and $68.81 for those below the income tax 

threshold.  These would be patients from families earning a combined income of less than $30,000 

per annum.  Now Fijians are being asked to pay $275.24 for each session. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the question that I am asking today is, how beneficial has this reduction been, 

and the answer is this - negligible.  Apart from the Colonial War Memorial Hospital which is limited 

and I have cited documentary evidence of this in the form of receipts for payments to the Kidney 

Foundation of even patients admitted at the CWM and Labasa Hospitals, I do not know of any other 

public medical facility that provides this essential service. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  want  to  know  who  actually  operates  the  Dialysis  Centre  at  Labasa  Hospital,  is  it  the 

Ministry of Health or someone else?  In every Parliamentary sitting period, we are subjected, Mr. 

Speaker, to what the reality of the matter is, but, Mr. Speaker, the harsh reality and facts speak for 

themselves.  Our kidney patients are suffering, struggling to get dialysis treatment at private centres 

in Suva and Lautoka.  Those with kidney ailments in the Eastern Division hope for a miracle because 

of the exorbitantly high charges of between $200 and $250 per session. 

</span></p>
<p><span>A kidney patient on dialysis, as we all know, needs three treatments per week.  It would cost 

him or her between $600 and $750 per week.  This cost is beyond the reach of a decent salary earner.  

It is beyond the reach of us ordinary Members of Parliament.  So the patients cut back on the treatment 

to  one  or  two  treatments  a  week  until  they  and  their  families  as  well  as  assistance  from  Good 

Samaritans come to an end. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The financial inability to meet dialysis is quite literally the final nail in their coffins.  Why 

has  it  come  to  this  painful  and  tragic  end?    The  fact  and  reality  of  the  matter  is  the  FijiFirst 

Government’s repeated broken promises about subsidised dialysis.  A cardinal sin as far as we are 

concerned.  How have we come to his point?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  29th  July,  2017,  following  the  Government’s  continued  rejection  of 

NFP’s motions from years 2015 to 2017, to please increase dialysis subsidy to at least $3 million, my 

party  announced  that  an  NFP  Government  would  provide  free  dialysis  for  patients  from  families 

whose annual family income was less than $30,000 as well as subsidised treatment for those earning 

more than the income tax threshold.

<p><span>12th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  This  was,  is  and  will  continue  to  be  the  correct  way 

forward.  A year later in 2018, Mr. Speaker, less than five months from the general elections, the 

FijiFirst Government having early announced the establishment of a National Kidney Dialysis and 

Research Centre allocated $3.5 million for subsidised dialysis saying that patients below the income 

tax threshold of families would only pay $75 per session.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, we know this was hogwash, to quote the Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, 

Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources, because this promise did not apply to private 

facilities  providing  dialysis.    The  Government  had  promised  in  2017  to  equip  our  hospitals  with 

dialysis  machines.    A  Kidney  and  Research  Centre  is  gathering  dust  in  Nadera;  no  research,  no 

dialysis despite the assurance in Parliament during the 2020/2021 budget deliberations in July last 

year that it would be operational by November 2020.  If this is not a broken promise, Mr. Speaker, 

than what is?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, COVID-19 cannot be blamed because the Honourable Minister for Health 

provided a very comprehensive answer as to the timeline of the arrival of these dialysis machines.  In 

response to my motion during the debate on the 2020/2021 Budget in July of last year to have the 

subsidised dialysis allocation significantly increased, the Honourable Minister said the Centre would 

be operational by the end of November last year.  The </span><span>Hansard Report</span><span> of 29 July, 2020 would prove 

what I am saying.   

</span></p>
<p><span>He also scoffed at the suggestion of providing subsidies to the overwhelming majority of our 

people visiting privately-owned centres, saying the Government was going to ease the burden as the 

new dialysis machines had been purchased and the nephrologist had already identified 40 patients 

who needed dialysis treatment urgently.  We wonder now, Mr. Speaker, what has become of those 

40 patients who were identified?  Was this a pre-election gimmick?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we believe it 

was because the allocation fell from their pre-election promise of $3.5 million to $200,000 in 2019 

and further reduced to $100,000 in 2020.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Going back in time so to speak, the Honourable Minister for Economy on 29th June, 2017 

</span></p>
<p><span>while delivering the 2017/2018 Budget announced as follows, and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“We will allocate, Madam Speaker, $1 million to establish and equip the National 

Kidney Research and Treatment Centre in Suva to be directed by Dr. Amrish Krishna, the 

only Fijian nephrologist in Fiji.  This Treatment and Research Centre will advocate the 

treatment of kidney diseases in Fiji by operating 10 new kidney dialysis machines and 

offering a range of other therapies as well as diagnostics and counselling to its patients.  

Four new kidney dialysis machines will also become operational at the Lautoka Hospital 

in the next few months.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>These  next  few  months  are  still  coming.    Patients  are  being  denied  subsidised  dialysis  in 

hospitals.    I  repeat,  the  so-called  Dialysis  and  Research  Centre  is  gathering  dust.    None  of  the 

promises and assurances made in Parliament by both the Honourable Economy Minister in 2017 and 

the Honourable Health Minister in 2020 has come to fruition.  It reminds me, Mr. Speaker, of a song 

that I am sure you will be familiar with from Fleetwood Mac, “Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies” 

- the pain and suffering of dialysis patients, struggling to make ends meet and to survive. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The FijiFirst Government’s broken promises is tragically captured by the death of a man early 

yesterday morning at the Lautoka Hospital.  This gentleman will be accorded his final rites on the 

date of his birthday (tomorrow).  He did all he could to be able to have two dialysis sessions per week 

instead of three at a private facility in Lautoka.  He could not even afford to rest because he had to

</span></p>
<p><span>operate a stall at the Lautoka Market until recently to earn enough money to meet his dialysis cost of 

$400 per week plus other medical costs.            

</span></p>
<p><span>I  am  told  today  of  another  case  that  happened  this  week  where  a  patient  went  to  receive 

treatment  at  the  Lautoka  Hospital  only  to  be  told  that  the  dialysis  treatment  is  available  only  for 

emergency cases.  Why are people being restricted from receiving lifesaving treatment, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir?  Again, I ask, why?  Is it because:  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>of this Government’s lack of empathy and support for those receiving dialysis at privately- 

</span></p>
<p><span>operated facilities due to the inability of hospitals to provide dialysis: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>10 new dialysis machines did not become operational within a few months as announced by 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>the Honourable Minister of Economy in June, 2017; and 

the late patient was denied the right to subsidise dialysis of $75 per session and $68.81 per 

treatment post-December 2020, instead paying $200 per session. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, throughout this week, the Honourable Leader of the National Federation 

Party has emphasised that politics is not about winning elections and arguments, it is about doing 

good to the people that we serve.  Government must now come to grips with the reality.  The reality 

of the matter is, it has failed to equip public hospitals with the dialysis machines as promised both in 

2017 and 2020.  It has failed to even remotely make operational the National Kidney Dialysis and 

Research Centre. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, Government should extend such subsidised dialysis to 

patient predominantly using private facilities.  Our people need compassion and the compliance of 

Government’s social responsibility to the population especially during these very difficult times.  If 

Government can hire overseas consultants and recruit Permanent Secretaries from abroad saying it 

needs  expertise,  there  is  simply  no  reason  why  it  should  deny  our  citizens  their  fundamental 

Constitutional right to health and without any hesitation whatsoever provide subsidised dialysis to 

patients receiving treatment privately due to the acute lack of dialysis in hospitals. This is all we are 

asking for, Mr. Speaker, fairness and adherence to the Constitutional rights of our people. </span><span>Vinaka. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua for her End of the Week 

Statement.  I now give the floor to the Minister for Health and Medical Services.  You have the floor, 

Sir.
