<p>Payment of Obligatory Contribution (Grant) to USP  

(Question No. 43/2021)</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service and 

Communications update Parliament on the status of payment of Fiji’s obligatory contribution 

(Grant) to USP?</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM (Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service 

and Communications).- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in the discussions we had yesterday afternoon, this 

matter had already been addressed.</p>
<p>As highlighted yesterday, the allocation of $27.7 million in this year’s Budget (2020-2021) 

has not been given to USP because of the governance issues that had been raised.  We had requested 

an independent investigation into allegations raised by the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Audit 

Risk Committee and we said  that upon the independent investigations, we would then release the 

funds, which of course has not happened.</p>
<p>As I also highlighted yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of the Pacific Island Countries</p>
<p>said that they would talk to us bilaterally but that has not happened either.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on to the sixth Oral Question for today and I 

call upon the Honourable Assistant Minister for Health and Medical Services.  You have the floor, 

Sir.</p>
