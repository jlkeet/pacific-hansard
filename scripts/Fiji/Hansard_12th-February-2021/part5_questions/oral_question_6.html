<p>International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation (INBAR) 

(Question No. 44/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I take this opportunity firstly to thank you</p>
<p>for acknowledging my coming of age.</p>
<p>My question is:</p>
<p>Page 14</p>
<p>12th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>621</p>
<p>Given that Fiji is now a member of the International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation 

(INBAR), can the Honourable Minister for Forestry advise Parliament on what this means for 

the Ministry, industry and country?</p>
<p>HON.  O.  NAIQAMU  (Minister  for  Forestry).-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the 

question raised by Honourable Member and I am grateful to provide an update to this august House 

on Fiji’s membership to the INBAR and its contribution to the Ministry, industry and the country.</p>
<p>The INBAR is an inter-governmental organisation with a total membership of 47 countries 

dedicated to the promotion of bamboo and rattan for sustainable development.  Fiji became a member 

of INBAR on 1st September, 2020, immediately following Cabinet’s approval to explore the benefits 

of bamboo as an ecological conducive high value and short rotation crop.  In other words, a crop that 

is both environmentally friendly and can generate economic activity within a shorter period of time 

compared to the traditional timber trees.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, civil engineers around the world consider bamboo to be the new steel of the 

21st Century.  Many countries, especially those in Asia that have developed bamboo over decades 

use this non-timber forest product for multi-storey buildings, inartistically-enhanced structures and 

home decorations.  They are in addition to all manner of high quality furniture and even for food 

where bamboo shoots are a healthy ingredient to sumptuous meals.</p>
<p>Importantly, bamboo is known to have a remarkable ability to absorb high amounts of carbon 

from the air than many other trees.  It could very easily be part of the nature based solution to climate 

change.  Research and development on bamboo and rattan in Fiji started as a project in the late 1970s 

in Vunidawa, Naitasiri and in Somosomo, Taveuni with funding from the Government of the People’s 

Republic of China.  This was small scale with the occasional publication, international collaboration 

with China and Indonesia for capacity building as well as joint workshops for bamboo research and 

training.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this membership with International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation 

(INBAR), we now have a solid framework for systematic collaboration that has potential to lead to 

more  concrete  results.    This  strengthens  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  as  Fiji’s 

designated focal point.  It will strengthen local capacity on the uses of bamboo, landscape restoration, 

income generation, protecting biodiversity and eco-system and addressing climate change.  Today, 

bamboo and rattan are already amongst the world’s most valuable non-timber forest products with 

an estimated market value of USD$60 billion or more than FJD$120 billion.</p>
<p>In 2017, the total import and export value of bamboo and rattan quotas for Fiji amounted to 

USD$397,925 of which imports occupied over 99 percent.  This suggests that bamboo and rattan 

have the potential to  contribute more to  Fiji’s economic development  and the intent is  to support 

interested persons at  communities to effectively develop their  resources, including investments in 

appropriate technologies.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry recognises the potential of bamboo in terms of economic gain 

and improving livelihoods for the rural communities, and is currently in talks with potential partners 

such as the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF) and INBAR, to establish a bamboo centre in 

Fiji to help develop the bamboo industry in the Pacific.  The project is estimated to cost US$2million 

and will be based at the Ministry of Forestry facility in Nasinu.</p>
<p>The  Fiji  Bamboo  Centre  will  serve  as  a  national  focal  point  for  bamboo  related  activities 

including scientific research, mapping of bamboo habitats, advocacy work, research and innovative 

application such as paper making and cloth making for example, training in propagation and also in</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>12th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>the skills required in its many applications and establishing policy that is conducive to the growth of 

the industry.</p>
<p>In the past, a number of training workshops have been provided in bamboo propagation and 

utilisation.  These trainings are important and can be strengthened with training in business principles 

and  financial  management.    The  trainees  will  also  require  a  support  system  to  provide  assistance 

when they are faced with challenges in their endeavours.  The Bamboo Centre will undertake this 

task by supporting the efforts of individuals that want to take this work seriously.</p>
<p>Having said that, my Ministry is not just waiting for the completion of the bamboo centre, 

but has already started the groundwork by including bamboo in the list of species to be covered in 

the  National  Forest  Inventory  (NFI)  that  will  commence  later  this  month.    This  will  help  us  in 

identifying and mapping allocation of bamboo across the country including identifying the species 

by location.  In terms of research, my Ministry has completed a test to determine the best treatment 

for local bamboo species.  The result which will be published by the Fiji Agriculture Journal under 

the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p>As we speak, my Ministry is also working with the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Fiji 

National  University  to  test  the  properties  of  bamboo  for  use  by  the  local  building  industry.    The 

development of bamboo is crucial for our fight against Climate Change by reducing emission from 

deforestation and forest degradation, protection of soil and water sheds and land restoration due to 

its rapid growth and strong root system. Realising the full potential of bamboo will move Fiji closer 

to achieving its ambitious development, climate and environmental aims including the Sustainable 

Development  Goals,  REDD+  targets,  Paris  Agreement  commitments  and  the  Aichi  Biodiversity 

Targets.</p>
<p>In summary bamboo  and rattan are  among  the  fastest  growing plant  species that have the 

unique potential to contribute to livelihood support, carbon sequestration, land restoration and the 

provision of sustainable bioenergy. Bamboo can be regarded as a kind of cash tree with a great return 

on investment such as for food, fibre, fuel and fine arts.  I am hopeful that this cooperation through 

our  membership  with  INBAR  will  also  leverage  additional  partnership  in  bamboo,  including  the 

private sector to contribute fully to better production, better utilisation, a cleaner environment and a 

reaffirmation of our commitment to renewable, nature-based solution for sustainable development.</p>

<p>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON. O. NAIQAMU.- Mr. Speaker, I think I have clearly articulated in this august House 

that the planning that will be carried out, we will try to  increase the production of bamboo in our 

country.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Nawaikula.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- When can we expect the Ministry to identify the areas to plant this</p>
<p>product? When can we expect planting and when can we expect harvesting?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. O. NAIQAMU.- Mr. Speaker, I think the Honourable Member is not listening. I have 

clearly  mentioned  that  this  year,  next  month,  we  will  have  our  National  Forestry  Inventory  and 

bamboo is included to cover specifically all issues of bamboo.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will move on.</p>
