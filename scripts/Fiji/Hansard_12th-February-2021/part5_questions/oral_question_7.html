<p>Appointment of Provincial Council Chairpersons 

(Question No. 45/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A. JALE asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Sugar Industry 

and  Foreign  Affairs  inform  Parliament  if  there  is  any  reconsideration  for  the  provincial 

councils to appoint respective Chairpersons?</p>
<p>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  (Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  Sugar 

Industry  and  Foreign  Affairs).-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  posed  by 

Honourable Jale.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I want to remind the Honourable Member that the Chairpersons of Fiji’s 

14 Provincial Councils are appointed based on law, as dictated by amendments to the iTaukei Affairs 

Regulations 1996.  The Honourable Member can refer to Legal Notice No. 35/2012 of the iTaukei 

Affairs Provincial Council Regulations, if he cares to read the Fijian law.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we appoint a chairperson based on their ties to the Province, their ability to 

navigate today’s economic landscape and their potential to bring prosperity and accountability to the 

community  they  preside  over.    These  appointments  have  helped  bring  new  leadership  styles  to 

Provincial Council Meetings throughout the country.   The proven leadership skills of those who now 

serve  as  chairpersons  has  brought  fresh  blood  and  new  energy  to  the  way  these  Meetings  are 

conducted.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>12th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I know that Honourable Jale may still be bitter over his  own lost bid to 

become the Chairperson of the Lau Provincial Council, but we are seeking out fresh new ideas and 

visionary leadership.  We know we certainly will not find it with him, or with any other Member of 

his Party.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to fill the role of Provincial Council Chairpersons with 

candidates  who  will  act  not  with  self-interest,  but  in  the  interest  of  the  iTaukei  people  and  the 

communities they serve.  I want to note, Mr. Speaker, that this question would have already  been 

answered last year, had the Opposition not walked out of that session back in February as well.  That 

is what they chose to do - they drag us back into old business while we should be looking ahead.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  this  week,  the  people  have  heard  from  my  Government  serious  strategies  to 

confront the gravest challenges we have faced as a country.   Rather than listen to how we plan to 

act,  the  Honourable  Members  on  the  other  side  started  the  week,  as  you  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  by 

walking out of Parliament yet again at the behest of one man, I must say.  And they stumbled back 

in, just as ignorant as they left.  It reminded me of the three stooges when they walked into a closet 

and they found out that they were in the wrong place, and they quickly ran out.  But the person that 

took them into the closet is standing in the passage, clapping his hands and laughing as they brought 

themselves back into the House, I mean, the SODELPA, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have tried to educate them before.  Year after year, we have invited them 

to join us at Budget workshops to explain Fiji’s fiscal situation.   And do you know how many times 

they have actually showed up, Mr. Speaker?  One time, I think, Mr. Speaker, one time with perhaps, 

five of them.  In all those years, they have never showed up once to actually learn anything and when 

we hear the pathetic quality of their contributions throughout this week, Mr. Speaker, it shows.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I still do not know who is leading SODELPA right now, seriously.  I was once 

asked by the former Leader of the Opposition (Hon. T.V. Kepa) to always keep a close watch on 

what Honourable Bulanauca says because he is a liar through and through.  The former Leader of the 

Opposition told me that she cannot even understand Honourable Bulanauca because it seems like he 

has got five marbles in his mouth when he speaks.</p>
<p>(Honourable Opposition Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, what is your Point of Order?</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- I  just want to find out what is the relevant of this banter  from the</p>
<p>Honourable Prime Minister and if he can just answer the question.</p>
