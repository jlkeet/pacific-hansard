<p>Fiji Corrections Service Job Evaluation Exercise 

(Question No. 41/2021)</p>
<p>HON. RATU T. NAVURELEVU asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service and 

Communications  update  Parliament  whether  a  Job  Evaluation  Exercise  (JEE)  will  be 

undertaken for the Fiji Corrections Service, given that the last JEE was undertaken in 2003 

by  Mercer  Human  Resource  Consultancy  (Mercer)  NZ,  through  the  Public  Service 

Commission?</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM (Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service 

and  Communications).-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  his 

question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just by way of background, the PSC  (I think Honourable Jale would be 

aware of this) had engaged the Mercer Human Resource Consulting Company, an Australian firm, 

to  undertake  a  review  of  the  existing  qualifications,  grading,  salaries,  scale  structures,  minimum 

qualification requirements  and work related  allowances for the  whole of the  Fijian Civil  Service, 

including  all  the  Disciplined  Forces,  not  just  the  Corrections  Service.    It  included  the  Police,  the 

Corrections Service and Republic of the Fiji Military Forces.</p>
<p>It was decided by the then SDL Government at that time via a Cabinet decision made on 13th 

December, 2004, that the implementation of the recommendation by the Mercer Report with respect 

to the three Disciplined Services will be implemented in five phases, given budgetary concerns at 

that point in time.  So rather than giving them a lump sum increment, they said they will spread it 

over five phases.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>619</p>
<p>By 2008, Phases 1 to 3 of the implementation process had been completed and from 2009, 

Government embarked on Phases 4 and 5 of the implementation process.  Since then, Phases 4 and 

5  have  been  completed  whereby  officers  from  all  the  three  Disciplined  Services  received  their 

recommendation for the remuneration under the Mercer Report.  So any future assessments would 

not be done only for Correction Services, it has to be done for all the three Disciplined Forces across 

the board.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will have to be done, taking into account the new changes, 

et cetera.</p>
<p>One of the issues the Honourable Member may be seized of is that, currently a number of 

legislation reviews is taking place, one is for the Police Act and also for the RFMF.  So it is more 

prudent to actually have those laws approved by Parliament, once they implement it.  Some of them 

have actually budgetary implications, some of them actually have structural implications in terms of 

the position requirements, the job descriptions that will be required under the new law.  So once the 

new laws have been implemented and put in place, then we can do a review and it will be a lot more 

prudent to do so and obviously it makes a lot more sense to do so.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on to the fourth Oral Question for today and I call 

on the Honourable Assistant Minister for Environment and Rural Development to ask his question.  You 

have the floor, Sir.</p>
