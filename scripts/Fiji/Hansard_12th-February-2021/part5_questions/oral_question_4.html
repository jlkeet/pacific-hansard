<p>Youth Initiative Farming Programme - Progress of 

(Question No. 42/2021)</p>
<p>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity,  Industrial  Relations, 

Youth  and  Sports  update  Parliament  on  the  progress  of  the  Youth  Initiative  Farming 

Programme?</p>
<p>HON. P.K. BALA (Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations, Youth and 

Sports).- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Viam Pillay.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, let 

me re-state that these initiatives which we have embarked on as a Ministry is known as Youth Farm 

Programme which was launched at Nasau Youth Training Centre in Sigatoka in July last year (2020).  

Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Programme is meant to deal with unutilised land which is given to youths for 

agricultural purposes.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Programme  focuses  on  improving  the  livelihood  in  the  community, 

strengthen  food  security  and  providing  employment.    This  is  an  area  of  challenge  but  as  an  all-

government approach, we are turning into areas of opportunities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, till today we have assisted 2,416 youths throughout the country and at this 

juncture,    I  wish  to  thank  the  staff  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Forests  and  the 

Ministry  of  Fisheries  and,  of  course,  staff  of  my  Ministry  for  the  success  and  progress  of  this 

Programme.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also started our monitoring and evaluation to ascertain the benefits 

of these programmes.    In this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have  witnessed firsthand the impact  of these 

projects  in  terms  of  improving  livelihood,  increasing  food  security  and  commitment  of  youths  to 

sustaining their respective projects. This Programme is a partnership between the landowners, youth 

clubs and my Ministry.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.</p>

<p>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for the brief on 

the Youth Initiative Farming Programme.  I would like to thank the Ministry for supporting the 1,273 

youths all over Fiji and I thank the assistance for Kadavu - 159 youths.</p>
<p>I would just like to ask the Minister, since the inception of youth farming initiative, has the 

Ministry monitored the success of the farms of various youths and youth groups who have received 

this assistance since July last year?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
