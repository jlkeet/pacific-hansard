<p>Accountability and Transparency Commission (ATC) 

(Question No. 39/2021)</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service and 

Communications  update Parliament on the Accountability and Transparency Commission, 

given that there is budgetary provisions for its establishment each year?</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM (Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service 

and Communications.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to thank the Honourable Member 

for the question.</p>
<p>The answer is quite simple, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Code of Conduct Bill actually has not been 

approved  by  Parliament  and  if  you  read  Section  121  of  the  Constitution,  it  says  that  the 

Accountability  and  Transparency  Commission  is  established  under  Section  121  of  the  Fijian 

Constitution.  It says also that the authority and functions and responsibility of the Commission shall 

be prescribed by written law.</p>
<p>Sections 121(8) and 121(9) state that a written law shall provide the Commission with the 

jurisdiction, authority and powers to receive and investigate complaints against permanent secretaries 

and all persons holding a public office.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Code of Conduct Bill which I hold up in my hand is with the Committee, 

so  in  the  past  couple  of  years  we  have  been  making  budgetary  allocations  in  the  hope  that  the 

Committee will bring the Code of Conduct Bill to Parliament.  And in the event it gets approved, 

then  actually  we  will  have  the  budgetary  allocation  for  the  Commission  to  start  its  work.  The 

Committee has not brought up the Code of Conduct Bill before Parliament for debate, that is the 

problem. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Tikoduadua, your supplementary question?</p>
<p>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    We  understand  the 

reasons  that  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  has  given,  but  it  cannot  be  established  under  the 

Constitution unless there is a code of conduct.  He is also giving the excuse that the report of the 

Justice, Law and Human Rights Committee has been sitting in Parliament since April 2019.  This is 

an urgent matter and perhaps, the question would be, why is it taking so long for the Committee to 

deliberate on this, and it is already 2021?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister?</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, anyone with a pedestrian knowledge of the 

Standing  Orders  would  know  that  this  floor  of  Parliament  does  not  have  any  authority  over  the 

Committees.  The Committees have their own jurisdiction, if you like.  They determine their own 

work schedule and it is  upon them to  determine what  is  deemed priority  or not.   This  is why we 

sometimes  bring  things  under  Standing  Order  51,  it  is  precisely  the  reason,  to  get  those  things 

elevated on the order list.</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>This, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time we are going to have a Code of Conduct 

Bill.  The 1997 Constitution actually made a reference to the code of conduct buy no Government 

has put that in place.  We have now put this in place, widespread consultations and it affects all of 

you also, and this is why it was put before the Committee.</p>
<p>We would assume that the Committee would give this priority because actually, it sets new 

benchmarks for transparency and accountability by ensuring, amongst other things, that Members of 

Parliament, members of the Executive, senior civil servants and civil servants must actually, on a 

yearly basis, provide their assets and liabilities, not in a manner that the NFP does – change it halfway 

through, but on a yearly basis and it rests with the Commission.  The Commission, of course, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, can do what is necessary, as stipulated under Section 121 of the Constitution.  Thank 

you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Nawaikula , you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  The  concern  is  that,  when  you  have  something  written  in  the 

Constitution, it is imperative and it must be done.  As he says, he does not have any control over the 

Committee, so what option do we have?  What option does the nation have to be waiting for seven 

years  when  you  cannot  control  the  Committee?    We  cannot  be  waiting  and  waiting  and  waiting.  

Where is the law that requires you even to formulate the law for transparency that should be tabled 

here already?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister?</p>
<p>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Honourable  Nawaikula’s  pugnacious 

behaviour makes him look really obtuse.  He is pugnacious and he is quite argumentative every time, 

without rhyme or reason.</p>
<p>I  have  just  highlighted,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  even  in  the  1997  Constitution,  there  was  a 

provision there for a Code of Conduct Bill but no-one did it!  Now, in this 2013 Constitution, we 

have actually put a Code of Conduct Bill.  It is there, have you read it?  You have not read it.</p>
<p>(Hon. N. Nawaikula interjects)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p>
<p>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  was  already  tabled  with  the 

Committee.  I do not know whether he understands it or not.  We have already tabled it on the floor 

of this Parliament.  Parliament has ceased this Bill.</p>
<p>(Hon. N. Nawaikula interjects)</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That is a moronic behaviour.  Do not accuse the Speaker of</p>
<p>that!  That means he is blaming you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>(Honourable Member interjects)</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Why are you blaming the Speaker?  You got nothing to do</p>
<p>with the Speaker.  What has that got to do with the Speaker?  Nothing!</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>12th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>It has already gone before the Committee and was ceased by the Committee as a Committee’s 

work.  You do not even know that, that was tabled in Parliament.  What sort of imbecilic behaviour 

is that?</p>
<p>(Honourable Member interjects)</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You have absolutely no idea of what you are talking about.  

Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been tabled on the floor of Parliament and the Committee  has ceased the 

matter.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- We will leave it at that, we will move on to the second Oral Question for</p>
<p>today and I call on the Honourable Nath.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
