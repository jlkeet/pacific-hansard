<p>Government Shipping Franchise Scheme – Progress of 

(Question No. 40/2021)</p>
<p>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice;</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport inform</p>
<p>Parliament on the progress of the Government Shipping Franchise Scheme?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA (Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport).- Mr. Speaker,</p>
<p>Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for the question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a maritime economy, Fiji’s shipping sector plays a critical and vital role 

in  trade,  economic  development  and  sustaining  everyday  livelihood.    Our  re-export  figures  are 

evidence that a large majority of products actually go through Fiji and Fijian Ports to reach other 

parts of the region, especially in Pacific Island Countries.</p>
<p>Domestically,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  actually  rely  on  our  inter-island  shipping  as  our  main 

transport in connecting outer islands to the main ports, towns and cities, to  ensure that every Fijian 

has reasonable access to transportation which is well defined in our Constitution.  This is where the 

Government Shipping Franchise Scheme actually takes a lead role.  In recent years, the Scheme has 

evolved in terms of vessel capacity, scheduling and routes, meaning that we are connecting more 

islands and serving more Fijians.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the Scheme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to:</p>
<p>service uneconomical sea routes to maritime islands which would, otherwise, be un-serviced;promote private shipping operators and inter-island traders for movement of goods and cargo;encourage transport of the maritime public between outer islands and major urban centres;</p>
<p>incentivise  transport  operators  through  the  support  of  Government  subsidy  to  service 

uneconomical route.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I updated this august House last year, we were serving about 70 ports 

and nine routes. Today, we actually are serving 80 ports with and without jetties for 10 routes with 

an  average  of  about  15  trips  a  month.  The  routes  which  are  serviced  are:    Lower  Southern  Lau, 

Rotuma, Lomaiviti, Northern Lau, Kadavu, Upper Southern Lau, Yasayasa Moala, Yasawa, North-

East Vanua Levu, Beqa, Yanuca and Vatulele. The newly introduced tenth route - Beqa, Yanuca and 

Vatulele, opened up opportunities for additional 10 ports to be serviced, following an assessment that 

was actually undertaken by the Ministry from 2017 to 2019.</p>
<p>Page 8</p>
<p>12th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>615</p>
<p>The Beqa, Yanuca and Vatulele route franchise commenced its services around 11th January, 

2021, Mr. Speaker Sir, and we will continue to provide  the monthly service to 14 villages.   That 

basically  means  that  2,050  Fijians  in  these  island  communities  now  have  safer  and  more  reliable 

access to transport services for movement of both, passengers and cargo.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we look back about five years or so under this Scheme, we have completed 

a total of 1,023 trips with the total of 84,004 travellers utilising the service. That is also a total of 

36,255.89 tonnes of cargo transported to and from our main ports to the islands, including building 

materials, groceries, retail shops, supplies and fuel and oil whilst return trips actually carry copra, 

coconut, seafood,dalo,mats and personal belongings as the main cargo.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on average, we have had a 7 percent increase in both, passenger and cargo 

movement  between  2015  and  2020,  and  that  is  about  13,743  passengers  movement  and  5,957.59 

tonnes of cargo transported annually.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has conducted a comprehensive analysis of each of the routes 

from 2018 to 2020.  I can confirm that the different types of ships moving to and from the islands, 

there is only an average of 40 percent capacity utilisation for both, passenger and cargo.  For example, 

for a 200 tonne cargo capacity vessel, on average there is only 40 percent usage which is only about 

80 tonnes of cargo.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our analysis, we also identified ports that are maximising 

their services, for example, in the Northern Lau which includes; the ports of Yacata, Vanuabalavu, 

Cikobia,  Tuvuca,  and  Cicia,  maximising  the  use  of  vessels  registering  more  than  about  800 

passengers and more than 300 tonnes of cargo annually.  This can be attributed to the two villages 

having jetties.</p>
<p>Another  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that,  Kadavu  has  about  14  ports  -  Dravuni,  Bulia, 

Naqara, Matasawalevu, Nukuvou, Lavidi, Kadavu Koro, Vukavu, Soso, Dravuwalu, Muani, Levuka, 

Vacalea and Daviqele.  The people of Dravuni, Nukuvou, Bulia and Daviqele mainly travel using 

vessels under this particular Scheme, as well as for cargo movement through the ports of Daviqele, 

Levuka, Vacalea and Vukavu maximise the use of ships.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the role of Government Shipping Services (GSS) in the Franchise Scheme 

actually  extends  way  beyond  just  the  movement  of  persons  and  goods.    When  we  connect  these 

islands, we are actually providing them access to justice, health and education, right to economic 

participation and the opportunity to integrate into the supply chain by selling their crops and fish and 

trade in goods and services with the urban centres.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday I spoke briefly about the work undertaken by GSS, so apart from 

ensuring  safe  and  navigation  assistance  post-disaster,  they  are  also  a  key  part  of  the  Scheme, 

providing services to communities in the Yasawas and North East Vanua Levu, Sir.  These are highly 

uneconomical routes that private vessel operators are not able to service.</p>
<p>These services, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were not available in the past and it is this Government that 

has made it happen.  Had it not been for the continued investment in the particular Scheme, it would 

be impossible for services to be provided to these islands.  Even though servicing these routes make 

essentially no profit, for us, we will continue to serve them, as our obligation in our duty of care to 

our people. To further strengthen the capacity utilisation, the Ministry is actually working closely 

with other Government agencies, to ensure collaboration and increase in activities so as to maximise 

the provision of services to the islands.</p>

<p>616</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>12th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>I  reiterate,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government  is  actually  committed  in  taking  the  services  to  the 

people of Fiji, ensuring their most basic needs such as food and medical supplies are consistently 

provided.  Just to allay any fear from the other side of the House, please be reminded that I pay close 

attention to GSS at all times, so that we actually provide these services to our people in the maritime 

areas.  I thank you, Sir.  I hope that is a good answer.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Lal, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Can  the  Honourable  Minister  inform  the</p>
<p>House, how many vessel operators service the Scheme?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There are five vessel operators that service 

the  GSS  Scheme.  We  have  Brighton  Holdings  Fiji  Limited,  Gounder  Shipping,  Valesasa 

Transportation  Limited,  Victoria  Marine  Limited  and  Miller  Shipping  Services.  These  operators 

provide franchise services to 80 ports for 10 routes with 15 trips conducted in one month and the 

routes service the Lower Southern Lau, Rotuma, Lomaiviti, Northern Lau, Kadavu, Upper Southern 

Lau, Yasayasa Moala, Yasawa, North-East Vanua Levu, Beqa, Yanuca and Vatulele.  Thank you, 

Sir.  I hope that answers your question.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Jale, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. A. JALE.- A supplementary question to the Honourable Minister.   The length of time 

that the boat takes to travel to destinations and some of the routes under Franchise is a concern to the 

travelling public because it means a lot of costs to them and feeding time during the period they spend 

in travel.</p>
<p>There is a significant length of time from what it used to be in the past. For example, a boat 

that normally takes 18 hours or 24 hours to travel from Ono-i-Lau to Suva is taking 33 hours now.  

The boat that services the lower route to the Southern Lau is taking 33 hours to reach Suva.  What is 

your  Ministry  doing,  in  terms  of  the  franchise  regarding  the  time  that  it  takes  to  reach  their 

destination?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- You better remember to order the takeaway lunch, that is the reminder.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I think he wants to sing happy birthday to the Honourable O’Connor.  

There is a request from the Honourable O’Connor that Honourable Professor Prasad sings Happy 

Birthday during the break, Sir.</p>
<p>Sir, I think this is a pertinent question and there are some common issues that we need to 

address,  to  improve  those  services.    Basically,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  five  Shipping 

Franchise Observers (SFO), to ensure the contracted vessels are fully serviced and, of course, safety 

is paramount.  We all know when you are out at sea, at the end of the day, sometimes the trips may 

take a little longer and we must ensure that safety is paramount on board.  These particular observers 

report on unidentified issues for actual improvement for the vessel operators, so we are actually doing 

something about it.</p>
<p>At  the  end  of  each  particular  trip,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  SFOs  provide  detailed  reports, 

highlighting the passenger and cargo movement, including customer service survey.  To name a few 

common issues that have been addressed to date, Sir, it is really to do with the vessel capacity:</p>
<p>Page 10</p>
<p>12th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>617</p>
<p>what improvements can be done in terms of the vessel quality;public information awareness;efficiency in  service delivery through increased competition; andobviously,  we  have  emergence  of    small  business  enterprises  being  developed  in  our</p>
<p>islands, et cetera.</p>
<p>Lastly,  Sir,  one  of  the  most  important  components  in  all  of  these  is  what  the  Honourable 

Member was referring to, the improvement in turnaround time.  For example, Kadavu, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, has now improved from five days to three days. Similarly,  for  Lomaiviti,  Yasayasa  Moala  and 

Northern Lau.  But we must remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the most important thing is that, this is 

travel by sea and safety is paramount.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we may think that we can do it in 24 hours but it is the sea, you do not play with 

the sea.   Sometimes it takes longer but safety is paramount, that is what is important to us.  However, 

we are doing something about it to ensure that we actually do have more regular trips in terms of the 

time but we do have SFOs on board who report back to us.  I hope that suffices.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Salote Radrodro, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you Honourable Minister 

for  those  commitments  and  those  of  us  from  the  maritime  islands  are,  indeed,  grateful  for  those 

franchise shipping routes.</p>
<p>You mentioned your commitment on duty of care and safety, so what kind of partnership do 

you  have  with  the  Ministry  responsible  for  jetties  and  ship  owners  with  regards  to  the  safety  of 

passengers, in the upgrading of jetties and passenger shelters?  For example, it is chaotic at the Natovi 

Jetty, particularly for those midnight trips whereby I have to reverse into the boat. There is also very 

limited lighting.  Also, at the Nabouwalu Jetty when we get off in the early hours of the morning.  

Even if it is not franchise, what about the others in Vanuabalavu, where there is no passenger shelter, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think if the Honourable Member have some issues 

down at Natovi, she has to call and tell  me straightaway.  Nevertheless, the opportunity is always 

there for you to call, instead of coming here and telling us six months later.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Sir, MSAF has the safety issues under control with respect to every single jetty 

that is there.  Sometimes, if something is lacking, I urge all members of the public and Honourable 

Members of this House, please, let us know because they get on top of it straightaway.  We have had 

to reverse on to vehicles and we have not had an issue.  I do not think reversing is actually a safety 

issue, Sir.  There are people who actually guide you on to the boat very carefully.</p>
<p>I have travelled quite extensively on these boats.  The Honourable Prime Minister only travels 

by boat and he will tell you first-hand, Sir, that they are safe and we do as much as we can in terms 

of safety at every single port and jetty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Honourable Prime Minister does not want to fly, that is why he travels by 

boat.  The collaboration that exists, it is a whole of Government approach when we look at these 

jetties and safety.  It is not just one Ministry, it is to do with NDMO, the Ministry of Infrastructure 

and all of those.  We do look at it holistically, so it is something that we take very seriously but I urge 

members of the public if there is an issue, please, let us know as quickly as possible.  Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- The last supplementary question, Honourable Rasova, you have the floor.</p>
<p>Page 11</p>
<p>618</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>12th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Minister for the update on 

the franchise all over Fiji.  Last year, we approved a Bill whereby Government can extend the contract 

to all franchise companies to give a 20-year contract and I think it is now reduced to 15 years.  Given 

that, to allow them confidence to the banks so that they can give a new boat.  One year later, the boats 

are still the same.  Can he update the people when will you bring new boats to these companies to 

franchise all over Fiji?Vinaka.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we did think of this, they were good times and at 

the moment, I think the Honourable Member does know that the times are not very good and in terms 

of the banks dishing out money very quickly, it is a bit tough but I think we just need to ride the 

storm.  I do not think it should be an issue at a later stage but most of the operators are doing the best 

that they can with what they have.</p>
<p>We must realise, Sir, that Government subsidises it.  The travelling public actually pays for 

this.  Also, there is a lesser number of the travelling public purely because of economic downturn, et 

cetera, so we have to put all of that into perspective.  However, it is not something that is off the 

cards.  I think the economic climate at the moment would tell you that that would probably be a little 

later rather than just now.  I hope that suffices.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  We  will  move  to  the  third  Oral  Question  for  today  and  I  call  on  the</p>
<p>Honourable Navurelevu to ask his question.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
