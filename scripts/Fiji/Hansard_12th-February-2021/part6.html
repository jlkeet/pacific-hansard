<h3>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.-</h3>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- But Provincial Councils that is the relevance of the question. He is 

</span></p>
<p><span>going off topic and he needs to stick to the question.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  it  is  all  part  of  the  leadership  of  the  Provincial 

</span></p>
<p><span>Council.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Abuse of Point of Order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor, Honourable Prime Minister.

<p><span>625 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  But as I said, I still do not know 

who  is  leading  SODELPA  right  now.    But  they  should  be  embarrassed  to  allow  Honourable 

Nawaikula,  to  talk  about  things  he  clearly  does  not  understand.    As  the  Honourable  Koya  said 

yesterday, he is one man who spews garbage on this floor.  He even wants to bring in the military to 

remove the Government from this House.  That is very embarrassing for everyone.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, there is a Point of Order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  May  I  ask  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister  to  read  the  </span><span>Daily 

</span></p>
<p><span>Hansard</span><span>, instead of misrepresenting statements here.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Prime Minister, you have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  said  “we  need  a  new  Minister  for  Economy”.    Who  is  Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>` 

Nawaikula to tell me who my Minister for Economy should be?  Who is he? 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Chorus of interjections) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- If our economy was running like SODELPA that runs its own 

</span></p>
<p><span>party, we would not have won anymore.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Chorus of interjections) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Fijians  would  be  left  exposed  to  the  full  brunt    of  this 

pandemic and the climate crisis while they backstab each other who does what and burn every bridge 

of friendship we have built around the world.  I have said it before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I say it 

again  my  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy  has  my  total  support  and  the  support  of 

everyone on this side of the House. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- I would like to tell him that they should not forget who we 

</span></p>
<p><span>are.  My Government set the record for the longest period of growth for our economy ever.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  In  nine  straight  years.    We  dropped  unemployment  (they 

</span></p>
<p><span>should know that), we reduced inequality, we expanded social protections… 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- ...which they have never heard before in their lives.  We set 

our nation on the path to modernisation and it is that same strong and united leadership that will guide 

Fiji through the crisis we face today.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!

<p><span>Questions 

</span></p>
<p><span>12th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Again, I saw Honourable Professor Prasad in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>

saying “ The Bainimarama Boom is no more” that is the Bainimarama Boom I have just talked to 

you about.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Not the fake unity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we see across the room.  

Honourable Nawaikula said this week “we do not listen to the experts” you have said it, we have 

heard about it and everyone heard about it.  Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on his own </span><span>Facebook</span><span> he 

calls the United Nations and World Bank “useless”.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  That  is  a  direct  quote.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  same 

organisations that are staffed by thousands of the world’s leading  economic experts and trusted by 

countries around the globe to cultivate prosperity are in the eyes of Honourable Nawaikula , useless.   

</span></p>
<p><span> And  you said  “we do not  listen to  experts around the world’.  The bodies that uplift 100 

million from poverty and steer the world’s sustainable development are, to Honourable Nawaikula, 

useless.  He said Australia and New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States should not work 

with Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, right now Australia and New Zealand are giving 

direct budgetary support to Fiji. You know what that means, Honourable Niko Nawaikula, for your 

information and your ears only that means they are giving money to the Government directly and 

nations only do that when they have trust in how we managed our financial system. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- They only do that when they trust our measures of financial 

</span></p>
<p><span>accountability and transparency and those measures meet high international standards.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Hear, hear! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- These nations, Mr. Speaker, I have never done this before for 

Fiji. They are doing it now. They are doing it because they have confidence in how we managed the 

economy.   

</span></p>
<p><span>And  these  nations,  Mr.  Speaker,  are  not  useless  but  Honourable  Nawaikula  is.    His 

contribution certainly are useless and he needs to shut his mouth and open his eyes to the facts and 

to what our nation is up against.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the Opposition only attacks multilateral organisations like the World Bank when 

</span></p>
<p><span>it suits them. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order. Yes, you have the floor, Honourable Tuisawau. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order. The Honourable Member should not refer to 

</span></p>
<p><span>other Honourable Members in a derogatory and demeaning manner.   

</span></p>

<p><span>Questions 

</span></p>
<p><span>627 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. Government Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- As the Honourable Prime Minister has referred to Honourable 

Nawaikula useless and those kinds of words should not be used on another Honourable Member in 

this august House, thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor, Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- He says I am useless.  I think I have some views, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Opposition  only  attacks  multilateral 

organisations,  like  the  World  Bank,  when  it  suits  them  and  that  of  course,  includes  Honourable 

Professor Prasad.  When the World Bank endorsed Fiji’s economic growth rate, they dismissed it.  

But when they report anything remotely critical about Fiji they cannot shut up about it. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Beside that you are the liar, you know that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Standing Order 45(4), it says very clearly that ” the 

Minister must reply to a question unless it would be inconsistent with the public interest to do so.  A 

reply must be relevant, concise and confined to the subject-matter of the question asked.  It must not 

contain: (a) statements of facts and names of any persons unless they are strictly ….” 

</span></p>
<p><span>For the Honourable Prime Minister for the last minutes has fade away from the question. This 

is gross .abuse of Standing Orders, Mr. Speaker, and I think you should remind the Honourable Prime 

Minister to stick to the question. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Ask him about the leadership.. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Chorus of interjections) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Member,  the  question  is  when  they  are  asked  and  they  are  answered  by  the 

Honourable Minister, the answers are so extensive. You all know that. This is not the first time it has 

taken place and is to do with leadership.  It is leadership that was the question asked by Honourable 

Jale. It is all part of that.  You have the floor, Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, I said it is opportunism  and nothing more.  One 

day the World Bank is credible, the next it is not.  It reminded me of a taxi driver called Munsami 

but  that  story  is  a  bit  uncouth,  I  cannot  mention  it,  unlike  the  Honourable  Qereqeretabua  who 

mentioned uncouth words on this floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>One day the World Bank is credible the next it is not, because it will settle for any chance it 

can to attack the government.  It is intellectual dishonesty, it lacks principles and he does it to cover 

its ignorance of economic fundamentals we have been told because he does not really understand 

how  budgets  work  and  how  they  sparked  growth  for  the  economy.  He  does  not  see  day-to-day 

commercial and financial realities.

</span></p>
<p><span>Questions 

</span></p>
<p><span>12th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he does not even understand how the private sector operates, it is clear the 

</span></p>
<p><span>professor has never left the classroom to learn how the real world actually works.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Government does.  We understand how our policies impact businesses. 

We understand how it affects families, we have talks with the experts they expect that Honourable 

Nawaikula runs down and we have a plan comprised alongside some of our nation’s top health and 

economic  minds  to  a  secure  Fiji’s  place  in  the  most  important  global  economic  recovery  of  our 

lifetime.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That plan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is backed by the whole of Government’s effort, by every Ministry 

and Department I lead, but at the end of the day, it is my plan because this is my duty as the Leader 

of this Government.  I support it and so does every member of my Party and I have every confidence 

in our vision in the Honourable Attorney-General, as the Minister for Economy and the team that I 

lead to see it done.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Prime Minister.  I give the floor to the Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Niko Nawaikula.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Can  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  change  the  law,  to  allow 

Provincial  Council  to  select  their  own  Chairman  instead  of  the  Government  treating  them  like 

children and electing it for them? 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- That is not going to happen, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is similar to what the Honourable Nawaikula was 

asking because in his statement, the Honourable Prime Minister said , “we appoint”.  We believe the 

vast majority of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> want to be empowered.  When can the Honourable Prime Minister make 

up his mind to hear the wishes of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and say “we empower you to do what you need to do, 

not we appoint”.  When can you do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Prime Minister, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- What is your question? I never heard your question. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.V.R. GAVOKA.- In his statement he said, “we appoint”.  What we want to hear is for 

him to say one day, “we empower you” that is what the people want.  So, when can he empower the 

</span><span>iTaukei</span><span> to run their own Provincial Administration?  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- The Honourable Prime Minister, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- I really do not see why I have to say “empower” just for his 

</span></p>
<p><span>sake, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you very much. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- The Honourable Bulanauca, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good to hear that the Honourable Prime 

Minister  and  the  Honourable  Ro  Teimumu  Kepa  are  gossiping  about  me.    The  question  is,  Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  with  regards  to  the  reconsideration  of  Provincial  Council  to  appoint  respective 

Chairperson.   

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 22</a></p>
<p><span>12th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Questions 

</span></p>
<p><span>629 

</span></p>
<p><span>My question is, where is the FijiFirst Government Party’s’ policy on empowering the People 

or </span><span>itaukei</span><span>?  Empowering the people means giving them the opportunity to decide which is correlated 

to the dictatorial attitude they have just to appoint a Chairperson.  Even though the Honourable Prime 

Minister have explained that there are laws and processes to follow but they just dictate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Do not make a statement! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- The question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is how do you correlate the policy 

</span></p>
<p><span>on empowering people with dictator ruling?   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I have to look after Lau connection here, so please, you have the floor, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Let us go down to the basics, 

empowering the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> means not lying to the people, especially in this House.  He does not realise 

the man sitting in front of him, the Honourable Niko Nawaikula has a bad record in iTLTB for not 

empowering the </span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Point of Order.  Can I ask, Mr. Speaker, to direct  the Honourable 

Prime Minister to retract that because it is demeaning, it is unparliamentary, it is not based on any 

fact and it is not based on any substance and can he just please answer the question, and not drag me 

into it.  I am here, I am not part of the question.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will move on now to the eighth Oral Question 

</span></p>
<p><span>for today, and I give the floor to Honourable Lal.  You have the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I beg your pardon, I have been told that this question has been withdrawn.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Question No. 46/2021 withdrawn) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- We  move on to  Written Questions.  I  give the floor to  the Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Bulanauca. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Written Question 

</span></p>
<p><span>Rehabilitation Programme for Roads and Bridges 

(Question No. 47/2021) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA asked the Government, upon notice:  

</span></p>
<p><span>Can the Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 

Mineral  Resources  update  Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s  programme  to  rehabilitate  and 

maintain roads and bridges damaged by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>?

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE  (Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and 

Mineral Resources).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I did address some of these issues in an earlier 

response, but I will table my response at a later sitting date as permitted under Standing Order.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Members, that is the end of Question time.
