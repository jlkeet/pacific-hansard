<h3>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2021</h3>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament 

on Monday, 8th February, 2021, I move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 (Bill No. 2/2021) be debated, 

</span></p>
<p><span>voted upon and be passed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  pursuant  to  a  resolution  of  Parliament,  debate 

will  be  limited  to  one  hour.    I  call  on  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  to  speak  on  his  motion.  

You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    As  highlighted  in  the 

introduction  of  the  Bill  on  Monday,  8th  February,  2021,  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  2009 

effectively seeks to modernise the former Criminal Procedure Code 1944, which was then adjunct 

to the Penal Code, the precursor to the Crimes Act.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There were some archaic provisions that were still left over and one of them, of course, Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  was  the  issue  of  lay  assessors.    The  lay  assessors  was  introduced  into  the  criminal 

justice  system  through  the  Criminal  Procedure  Ordinance  1875.    Under  the  Colonial  rule,  the 

procedure for trials in the criminal justice system was heavily influenced by ethnic considerations.  

The  Europeans  had  their  cases  tried  before  an  exclusively  European  jury,  however,  other  ethnic 

groups  of  non-European  descent  had  their  cases  tried  before  lay  assessors  who,  until  1950,  were 

also exclusively European.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In this manner, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the jury system and the assessor system ran in parallel to 

each other.  The most significant difference, of course, between the jury system and the lay assessor 

System was that although the decision of the jury was final, the decision of lay assessors could be 

overturned by the presiding judge.  The rationale for that was because, even though the assessors in 

those days in the Colonial times, were listening to cases of non-European people, all the assessors 

had to be European.  So the thinking was that, if we have an all European assessor, maybe they will 

have certain prejudices against non-European accused persons.  Therefore, the judge could actually 

intervene and overrule the assessment of the assessors.  That was obviously the Colonial mindset 

when  it  was  introduced  and,  unfortunately,  those  things  still  have  a  legacy  till  today  which 

perpetuated.   

</span></p>
<p><span>However, in 1950, those Fijians of ethnicities other than Europeans, were also then included 

in  the  list  of  assessors.    In  1961,  the  all  European  jury  system  was  abolished.    However,  Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  the  lay  assessor  system  for  the  most  part  since  then  has  actually  not  changed.    The 

Judges still have the powers to overturn the decisions of assessors.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Of  course,  in  the  meantime,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Judiciary  has  expanded.    It  has  gone 

through  revamping.    The  Supreme  Court  is  now  truly  the  Supreme  Court.    Before  it  was  the 

equivalent  of the High  Court, et  cetera, and  we now have things like the Small  Claims Tribunal.  

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 50</a></p>
<p><span>548 

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>We have different tribunals, different divisions of courts, et cetera, but the archaic assessor system 

is still, in a way, quite dissonant from the changes in the Judiciary.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  by  way  of  information,  in  the  1950s,  the  list  of  assessors  for  Suva 

contained over 100 published names.  In 1988, the list of assessors in the Western district contained 

almost  600  published  names.    However,  by  the  late  1990s,  the  assessor  list  was  reduced  to 

handwritten unpublished names in the Judiciary binder. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore,  at  present,  Lautoka only utilises  around 50 active assessors  and the  assessor 

systems for Suva and Labasa have each been known to utilise approximately 30 to 40 persons in 

constant  rotation.    There  is  a  clear  indication  of  the  decline  in  the  efficacy  and  reliability  of  the 

assessor system but also very few people are willing to sit as assessors.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of 

assessors,  of  course,  feel  that  their  time  could  be  wasted  because  their  decisions  would  be 

overturned  by  the  judges  themselves,  and  of  course,  it  becomes  an  added  layer  of  administrative 

process. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  order to  greatly  facilitate the timely access  to  justice, it is  imperative 

that  a  more  streamlined  process  be  developed.    Cases  are  often  delayed  also,  sometimes  to  find 

suitable assessors within available time slots for all the interested parties.  These delays, of course, 

are non-justifiable and the final decision rests with the judge and not the assessors.  Furthermore, a 

lot of lay assessors are sourced from members of the public without specific legal training on a lot 

of sophisticated matters, as we have discussed earlier on.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these views may  also be subject to economic peer and political pressure 

and, indeed, influence, and may not be tampered by the changes in society, changes in technology, 

sensitisation  of  gender  issues  and  we  all  admit  that  we  have  predominantly  been  in  a  patriarchal 

society and many people would argue that the remnants, or indeed there is quite active notions of 

patriarchy  in  our  society.    Of  course,  we  are  a  very  small  community  and  we  have  very  much 

intrinsically interconnected relationships. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, this is not a normal problem nor is it an unspoken concern, it is, 

in fact, the very reason why judges were given the power to overturn the decisions of lay assessors 

in the first place, precisely because the Colonial system then recognised that these were some of the 

unfortunate problems with the society such as ours. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the potential for unconscious bias in persons who are not legally trained to 

approach matters through the lens of the justice system is a fundamental flaw within the assessor 

system  itself.    The  societal  views  of  lay  assessors  may  often  be  in  direct  competition  with  the 

progressive views of modern law, which is most often seen in sexual assault or what is commonly 

known as rape cases.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In practice, certain judges are not willing to overturn decisions of lay assessors, even though 

when  those  decisions  are  clearly  uninformed  or  heavily  influenced  by  patriarchal  ideals,  and  we 

have  seen  that.    We  have  seen  that  also.    You  can  pick  up  previous  media  releases  by  various 

NGOs,  in  particular,  women’s  organisations  where  they  have  expressed  their  concern  in  some  of 

these decisions that have come about. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this leads to inconsistencies in rulings where the strength of a 

judge’s personality actually  may end up  being the determining  factor for whether the values of 

the law are to be upheld or to be made subject to the principle of the patriarchy still prevalent today.  

These  inconsistencies  illustrate  the  danger  of  a  dual  decision-making  system  and,  therefore,  it  is 

imperative that a more streamlined system be developed. 

</span></p>

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>549 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  also  important  to  note  that  lay  assessors  are  not  common  in  the 

region.  Fiji and Vanuatu are the only countries that utilise mandatory assessors under  the British 

model,  and  some  of  the  other  Pacific  Island  Countries  have  different  ways  of  dealing  with  it, 

including some who have a full on jury system. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  had  a  number  of  consultations  in  respect  of  this.    We  had,  of 

course,  consultations  with  the  Office  of  the  DPP,  FICAC,  Legal  Aid,  Office  of  the  Solicitor-

General, the Judiciary and the Office of the Prime Minister. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Waqanika  had  raised  the  issue  about  how  the  DPP  had  raised  an  issue  of 

whether the assessors should be in place or not and his position was, they should be still in place 

and she referred to the AG’s Conference in 2017 where we had precisely this topic of discussion.  

And in that, we had some people who had very strong views about maintaining the assessor system, 

some were actually ambivalent about it, they did not know and they were open to ideas.  You can 

go to the newspapers and find that we had practitioners like Devanesh Sharma, a lot of you know, 

who practice a lot in the criminal justice system.  I believe that the assessor system actually should 

be got rid of. It should no longer exist, precisely for some of the reasons that we have stated.  

</span></p>
<p><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will also reserve my comments for other comments that may come 

from  the  floor.    But  I  do  not  want  to  pre-empt  it,  unless  Honourable  Professor  Prasad  wants  to, 

again, quote the letter from the Fiji Law Society, but we have also got responses to that too. Thank 

you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  debate  on  this  Bill  as  you  are  aware,  is  limited  to  one  hour.  That 

means  there  are  time  limitations,  and  I  will  leave  it  to  you  to  judge  your  time  limitation.  Keep 

within your speaking time and we will play it from there.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I will give the floor first to the Honourable Professor Prasad. You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  PROFESSOR  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.  I  do  not  want  to  make  a 

long presentation but as I have said before, it would have been nice, good and acceptable if we had 

this Bill go through the Standing Committee because I think people who make their views known 

publicly, should be taken more seriously.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  know  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  said  some  of  the  other  senior  lawyers  have  told 

him that the assessor system probably is not the best system, it needs to go, but I will just confine 

myself to some of the public statements that have been made by some of the learned lawyers and 

those who hold very important positions in the country.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  want  to,  sort  of,  repeat  what  the  learned  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  (DPP)  himself 

said, because I think it is important to do that for our record, if not for anything else, Mr. Speaker.  

He  said,  and  I  quote  from  the  presentation  he  made,  as  alluded  to  by  the  Honourable  Attorney-

General at his own conference in 2017:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“In my view, the assessor system manages to capture the best features of a jury 

system  whilst  avoiding  many  of  the  disadvantages  of  the  jury  system.  Instead  of 

abolishing  the  assessor  system  we  should  be  strengthening  it  and  providing  more 

opportunities  for  cases  to  be  heard  before  assessors,  including  in  the  Magistrates’ 

Court”. 

</span></p>

<p><span>550 

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, Sir, I move to the Fiji Law Society and this is quoting from the open letter that they 

wrote to the Honourable Attorney-General and to yourself, Mr. Speaker. This is what they said, and 

I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“Assessors have played a critical part in High Court criminal trials for over 120 

years,  their  fundamental  protection  of  an  accused  person’s  right  to  a  fair  trial.  The 

bedrock of our criminal justice system is that an accused person’s guilt or innocence is 

determined by his or her peers by members of the community.  This is in a tradition we 

share  with  nearly  all  other  common  law  countries  including  Australia,  New  Zealand 

and the United Kingdom who used the jury system in the same manner.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Assessor participation sustains public confidence in our judicial system because it provides 

transparency,  it  operates  as  both,  support  for  and  a  check  and  balance  on  judges,  and  a  fair  trial 

through  public  participation.    Removing  public  participation  from  criminal  justice  system  will 

reduce  transparency  and  erode  public  confidence.    Living  the  question  of  guilt  or  innocence  in 

serious cases to a single judge without an accused having a choice in the matter is neither fair nor 

just.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  refer  to  an  Article  in  the  </span><span>Fiji  Times</span><span>  today  where  Mr. 

Graeme Leung, a former President of the Fiji Law Society, he is a senior lawyer who has also been 

a prosecutor, said and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The  assessor  system  is  not  perfect.    Neither  is  a  trial  by  jury.    In  most  cases 

(but not all), despite the shortcomings and possible “failings” of some assessors, Fiji’s 

experience is that assessors have gotten it right most of the time.  

</span></p>
<p><span>They  take  their  roles  seriously  after  careful  reviews  of  the  evidence.    In  most 

</span></p>
<p><span>cases, the judge agrees with their opinions.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Historically,  the  number  of  cases  where  the  judge  has  disagreed  with  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>majority of the assessors’ opinions is relatively small.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Citizen participation in assessor criminal trials is an important aspect of criminal 

justice in this country.  It allows ordinary men and women to participate in the trial of 

their compatriots. It lends greater transparency to the process.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The collective wisdom of lay persons in a criminal trial is of great assistance to 

</span></p>
<p><span>the judge.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The removal of criminal trials with assessors takes away that assistance. In my 

</span></p>
<p><span>view that would be a retrograde step.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  know  that  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  did  say  yesterday  in  his 

presentation earlier that there are not enough assessors.  That is not a very good reason. We need to 

facilitate,  there  would  be  opportunities  and  there  would  be  processes  to  facilitate  that  better,  but 

something that has worked.  If it is having problems we need to improve that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  other  claim  that  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  made,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the 

assessors conspired with court clerks and defence lawyers, and that may be so in isolated cases.  I 

do not know how widespread it was.  What is the statistics on it?  

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 53</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>551 

</span></p>
<p><span>To our knowledge, no assessor, in my view, has been charged for acting in this manner.  So, 

perhaps,  we  need  more  discussion  on  this.    If  we  had  a  public  submission  through  a  Standing 

Committee, we might have had more people coming out, telling us what the problems are and what 

the advantages of assessor system is and what  we can do to strengthen  the system.  That is why, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, the way in which this Bill is going to be approved today or voted into a law does 

not allow all these facts, circumstances,  and a proper assessment of why there is a need to change 

the system that in the view of senior lawyers and important position holders, is working very well.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question we have to ask is, what is the urgency?  What is the 

Government up to?  I mean, I would have rather use this time to talk about how we can help our 

people in Vanua Levu.   How we can look at our recovery plan?  How we can have more discussion 

on it?  These are things that I think are more urgent and more appropriate, probably in this session 

of Parliament than to  be talking about  this Bill and changing a law which has worked very, very 

well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Professor  Prasad.  I  give  the  floor  to  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Waqanika. You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.-  Thank  you, Mr. Speaker. The  removal  of lay  assessors, this is  a 

big  change,  a  change  that  has  been  existing  in  our  country  for  120  years.  Now,  the  Honourable 

Attorney-General said that they had consulted with the DPP, FICAC, Legal Aid and Judiciary and I 

am glad he has because all those institutions are all Government bodies.  He has not consulted with 

the Fiji Law Society, he has not consulted with the wider public, who will one day come before this 

criminal system. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  have  all  heard  on  mainstream  media  the  reasons  why  late  assessors  should  not  be 

removed.  I reiterate the sentiments raised or the opinion of the DPP.  He wholeheartedly supported 

that removal of lay assessors, to the effect, must never be done and this is what he said, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Undoubtedly, indictable offences should be decided either with a jury or with 

assessors  and  a  judge.  I  have  not  discussed  the  advantages  of  the  judge  alone  trial 

because in my opinion the advantages of a jury or assessor system outweigh arguments 

for judge alone trials, even in complex fraud trials.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>This  is  the  opinion  made  back  in  the  Attorney-General’s  Conference  in  December  2017.  

This  is  the  opinion  of  our  nation’s  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  and  that  is  an  opinion  that  is 

recorded.   I have not  seen him issue another opinion engaging his  opinion.  That,  being said,  his 

opinion stands.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There are also other lawyers that have come on social media.  One is my learned colleague, 

who is  also  a  criminal  lawyer, Mr.  Filimoni  Vosarogo, who has  been dealing with  criminal  trials 

over the past 20 years.  This is what he said, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Assessor  trials  in  the  High  Court  is  essential.  They  are  essential  because  they 

</span></p>
<p><span>bring community wisdom, expectations, standards and experience.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not practice a lot of criminal cases in the High Court, but what I do 

know  that  we  have  local  judges  and  we  have  expatriate  judges,  and  I  believe  only  two  are  local 

Judges  in  the  Suva  Bench  but  I  stand  to  be  corrected.    Now,  the  others  are  expatriates.  The 

inclusion of the assessors, if anything, assists the expatriate judges. They assist because they know 

the local landscape.   

</span></p>

<p><span>552 

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>We must remember that when this Bill is passed, if for anything, any one of us, I mean, we 

have nothing to worry about.  Not one of us has to worry about our personal integrity.  If you have 

not committed any corruption, do not worry about it.  If it comes, let it come, you defend, but one 

day,  just like Hayman, this very law that you are going to pass  you will hang on it and you will 

wish that you did not pass this Bill today.  You will wish that the assessors knew your side of the 

story because  your life,  your livelihood and  your family’s stake is  hanging in the balance of one 

judge.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I have already mentioned that in Indonesia alone in anti-corruption specialised cases, judges 

who sat on those Benches were indicted.  One day, it will turn.  I am asking, please, Government 

consult - you need to consult. You are ticking away the simple liberties of our people.  It can be any 

one’s child, it can be any one’s spouse, it can be any one of us here today, and I am praying that, 

that day does not come when you live to regret that the Bill you pass today will hang you again.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, Honourable Professor Prasad talked about economic reasons and he is true.  Running 

trials, if for anything, is  quite expensive because it goes for a week, two weeks,  and  you pay the 

assessors and you have judges running cases concurrently. Whatever happens, do not take away the 

civil liberty of a person purely based on economic reasons.  Do not do that, it will come back and 

bite you.  That is all I want to say Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.-  I thank the Honourable Waqanika for her contribution  to  the debate. I 

</span></p>
<p><span>now give the floor to the Honourable Koya.  You have the floor Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will be very brief because most of the 

things  I  wanted  to  cover  have  actually  been  canvassed  already  by  the  Honourable  Attorney-

General.      Just  in  short,  historically  speaking,  if  we  look  at  the  beginning  and  I  think  this  was 

mentioned  by  the  Honourable  Attorney-General,  the  origin  of  assessors  were  actually  racially 

motivated and a practice of the old colonial days, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  introduction  of  assessors  was  passed  by  the  Legislative  Council  on  29th  December, 

1875,  and  the  Ordinance  then  basically  stated  that  in  a  trial  before  the  court,  with  the  aid  of 

assessors,  the  opinion  of  each  assessor,  et  cetera,  shall  be  given  orally  and  shall  be  recorded  in 

writing by the court but the decision shall be vested exclusively with the Judge. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of assessors in Europe also and its introduction clearly emphasises 

that there actually needs to be a change and this is what this Bill is doing.  Fiji needs to move with 

the  time  and  establish  more  firm  jurisprudence  and  to,  at  best,  consistently  deal  with  our  legal 

issues.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  what  I  understand  and  subject  to  correction,  I  think  it  was  about 

2010 when there was a case where the assessors with no obvious legal expertise, came up with an 

opinion of guilty and this was actually overturned by a Judge after the defence raised the issue of 

insanity.  The Judge had to overturn it because that was actually the correct verdict.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if Judges do not actually overturn these assessments, we would probably 

end up with a lot of innocent people having to serve sentences.  In terms of consistency the legal 

system  needs  to  maintain  consistent  decisions  and  alternatively,  develop  modern  and  good  laws.  

This is why this particular Bill has come about. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  administratively  and  practically  speaking,  it  saves  taxpayers’  money 

where the need to pay allowances to assessors to attend court cases would no longer be required.  It 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 55</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>553 

</span></p>
<p><span>is anticipated that all these time would be saved - the normal procedure relating to assessors and the 

lengthy opinions, et cetera, as well as the summing up, so all those can actually be done by a Judge. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Just as an example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1990, there was a Commission of Inquiry into the 

Fiji Courts and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) at that particular time had opposed the 

assessor  system.    He  suggested  to  the  Commission  that  it  should  be  abolished  because  assessors 

tend to lose their grasp of fraud trial evidence or to be easily swayed by racial undertones.  Later 

on, they did make some submissions to the Commission and it was found that it was more to do 

with the fraud trial and a little less on racial undertones but nevertheless, that was the actual opinion 

of the DPP then. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In several cases where the Judge had felt been forced to overrule the assessors and others 

involved, the DPP’s Office obviously thought there were unsatisfactory acquittals where the Judge 

had chosen not to intervene.  So, for those reasons, Sir, just in short, I stand in support of the Bill.  

Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  Koya.    I  now  give  the  floor  to  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Nawaikula.  You have the floor Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I am standing now to oppose the 

motion.  The motion seeks to pass an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act that will result in 

the  removal  or  the  no  longer  use  of  the  assessors  -  something  that  has  been  in  existence  for  125 

years.  Imagine after 1 hour of debate today, we will remove something that has been in existence 

all this time and that begs the question and we will ask why?  Why did you do this? Why did you 

remove something that has been there all this time, without consulting widely?   

</span></p>
<p><span>That leads me to condemn in the strongest sense again, the process that is being used by the 

government  to  bring  this  legislation  in  to  deny  the  right  of  the  public  to  participate  in  the  law 

making process, which is a value of democracy;  understanding of course, that this came in under 

Standing Order 51 on Monday, precisely to do that.  I wish to recommend now that sooner or later, 

we  must  make  some  serious  amendments  to  Standing  Order  51,  because  of  its  abuse  by  the 

Government  side  in  all  these  cases.    I  will  assume  that  about  90  percent  of  their  Bills  are  now 

coming in under Standing Order 51, precisely to deny the public their fundamental right.  It is their 

human right to participate in the law making process.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To go back to the proposed amendment, something that we must accept and be clear on is 

that assessors are not decision makers - they are not even the Judge, they are not the Jury to decide 

the  outcome  of  a  case.    They  are  only  there  to  assist.    I  assume  the  Government  is  probably 

embarrassed  by  the  number  of  cases  they  have  prosecuted  where  the  assessors  differ  with  the 

Judge, but that is exactly part of the process.  It allows transparency in judicial making process, and 

the  Privy  Council  is  very  clear.    The  Judge  reserves  the  right  to  decide  ultimately,  but  when  he 

differs from the assessors, he must explain in a very cogent terms, why he did so.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Going back to the reasons that were outlined by the Honourable Attorney-General, going 

back to the explanation, referring to the changes in the Criminal Procedure Code, 2009, he says, 

this was an anomaly that they forgot.  However, some archaic provisions such as a framework 

providing for the use of lay assessors in the High Court for criminal trials, were not addressed.   

That is totally wrong.  It is wrong to say that they failed to address it, because it has been there 

for a very good reason.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The presence of assessors has not been without debate.  A lot of people have expressed 

their  opinion  on  it,  including  the  current  Director  of  Public  Prosecution,  Christopher  Pryde, 

</span></p>

<p><span>554 

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>whom we are all referring now to the paper that he presented in 2017.  He did not recommend 

the removal, he recommended its maintenance for the same reason why they removed the Jury 

System  -  for  the  reason  why  it  applies  well  to  a  community  of  different  ethnic  grounds.  

Remembering of course that in 1961, they removed the Jury System and this was left there for 

very good reasons.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The reason why it is there (and I would suggest that the Honourable Attorney-General is 

wrong) is precisely for the reason why they are trying to push it out.  It does not have a place 

where you have people of different ethnicity.  No!  It has been there for that reason.  Let me just 

quote the DPP in relation to that: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“In  my  view  the  assessors  system  manages  to  capture  the  best  features  of  a 

jury system whilst avoiding many of the disadvantages in the jury system.  Instead of 

abolishing the assessor system, we would be strengthening it and providing for more 

opportunity for cases to be heard before assessor, including the Magistrates.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>So  he  is  recommending  that  we  maintain  this,  and  in  my  view,  maintaining  it  allows  for 

transparency, understanding of course, they are not Judges, they do not decide the outcome.  They 

only  sit  there  to  assist  the  Judge,  and  maybe  with  some  amendments  where  the  amendments 

probably  say  for  them  not  to  announce  their  reasons  publicly  so  that  there  is  no  embarrassment 

when they say something and then the Judges differ.  Maybe some amendments there, but to cancel 

it entirely, I think it is totally wrong.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Understanding of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that one of the values of the Common Law Jury 

System is trial by peers.  I would expect that the projection of our justice system is that, we remove 

the assessor, but then we enter into the Jury System.  I think the provision of assessors has served 

us  well  where  we  have  not  reached  different  ethnicities  have  not  reached  this  educational  or 

literacy.  Now, that we are at this stage, it is probably the right time to take a step further where, 

instead of removing it totally, we introduce the Jury System.  So, totally wrong.  The reason why it 

has been there is precisely because (and this is from all the commentators) it serves well where you 

have a community like ours from different communities. That is the reason why it has been there, 

and this is the reason the other side is saying, why we should throw it out.  It is totally wrong and I 

oppose the motion entirely. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Nawaikula for his contribution to the debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor for your Right of Reply. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Just  a  few  comments  in 

respect of the matters that have been raised, in particular from the other side.  If I could just address 

the issue about the matters raised by the Fiji Law Society that Honourable Professor Prasad quoted 

where they say, “this is a tradition assessor system we share with nearly all other Commonwealth 

countries, including Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom (UK), who use the jury system in 

the same manner.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>Actually,  that  is  not  true  because  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  the  UK  utilise  the  jury 

system, not the assessor system.  In Australia, New Zealand and the UK, the jury verdicts cannot be 

overturned.    In  Fiji’s  case,  it  is  a  marked  difference  that  the  assessors’  “not  guilty”  or  “guilty” 

assessment can be overturned by the judge.  In Australia and New Zealand, it cannot be overturned, 

a huge difference.

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>555 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  You quoted them!  The Fiji Law Society quoted that, they 

</span></p>
<p><span>said we have a similar system.  I am telling you, we do not. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Honourable  Nawaikula  cannot  extricate  himself  from 

ethnic  thinking.    Essentially,  what  he  is  saying,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  the  Colonial  system  of 

ethnic way thinking we should continue with that.  That is what he is saying.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  the  modern  day  world,  a  person’s  guilt  or  innocence  should  not  be  determined  by 

assessors who are going to look at the person on an ethnic basis, nor should a judge for that matter.  

It is a very sad day and I think some people in these Chambers think that way, that a person’s guilt 

or  innocence  should  be  determined  by  their  ethnicity.    This  is  what  leads  to  stereotypes  and  it  is 

very wrong for an officer of the court to be even insinuating that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the letter talks  about  public participation  but, of course, in  practice it is 

only a handful of people.  More and more people do not want to participate in the assessor system, 

in  particular  when  we  have  people  who  they  may  know  or  if  you,  for  example,  have  matters 

pertaining to crime that is now on an upturn in certain areas.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As we know, the law has been changed in  respect of sexual offences where those women 

who previously did not, for example, report matters now feel a lot more confident to come and do 

so because the protections in the law are given and Honourable Tabuya would know this.  Before 

when  you  did  not  have  a  provision  on  domestic  violence,  if  you  go  to  the  Magistrate  when  you 

have an assault case where the husband would beat up his wife, the first thing the Magistrate will 

ask you is, “Do you want to reconcile?”  They were all reconcilable offences, so they are no longer 

reconcilable offences. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you have that kind of culture of being perpetuated, 

then obviously your ability to extricate yourselves from that is very limited.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that the Fiji Law Society raised and Honourable Professor 

Prasad, kind of, gleefully quoted and said,  “Leaving the question of guilt or innocence in serious 

cases to  a single Judge without an accused having a choice in the matter is neither fair nor just.” 

Does  that  mean  that  all the  Magistrates  Courts  where  you  do  not  have  assessors,  that  the  rulings 

there are unfair?  

</span></p>
<p><span>Under section 7(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2009, a Magistrate may pass a sentence of 

imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years. They are sending people in for seven, eight, nine 

and up to 10 years - no assessors.  Does that mean it is unfair because you do not have assessors? 

This is the lack of logic that we are talking about in respect of the arguments being perpetuated here 

today, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They can fine up to $15,000.   

</span></p>
<p><span>For  consecutive  sentences,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  Code,  a  Magistrate  may  sentence 

someone for a term not exceeding 14 years and, in fact, 12 years is seen to be a life sentence.  So 

here we are, a tribunal or a magistracy that can sentence people up to 14 years potentially and we 

are saying that it is unfair because it does not have an assessor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Waqanika and others have commented and Honourable Nawaikula quoted from 

that  AG’s  Conference  and  I  would  also  like  to  quote,  again,  highlight  what  Devanesh  Sharma 

talked  about.  He  has  probably  done  more  criminal  cases  than  the  supposed  learned  lawyers 

Honourable Professor Prasad has quoted.  He said, and I quote:   

</span></p>
<p><span>“In my opinion there are compelling reasons why the practice of having assessors 

assist the Judge in trials should be abolished. Now the assessor system is justified on the 

basis that it allows community involvement in the criminal justice system.  However, the 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 58</a></p>
<p><span>556 

</span></p>
<p><span>Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>reason why the assessor system was first introduced in Fiji was based on the assumption 

that the jury of Europeans could not be relied upon to determine cases involving others 

(people of other ethnicities) in a fair and impartial manner is no longer valid.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly,  where  a  Judge  does  not  accept  the  assessors’  opinions,  the  question 

</span></p>
<p><span>arises whether the assessors are competent to sit as judges of facts.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Thirdly,  why  do  Judges  need  assistance  from  assessors  when  ultimately  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>decision to convict or acquit an accused person lies with the Judge?”  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is that, let us face it.  If we have some well-known 

persons  and  we  have  had  this  in  recent  past,  whether  they  be  a  sportsperson,  a  well-known 

personality, some corporate person, some politician (former or current), et cetera, who may appear 

before  a  group  of  assessors,  how  many  of  those  assessors  will  actually  look  at  the  facts,  the 

evidence and the law and make decisions objectively or will they be influenced by the position that, 

that person holds?  Will they be influenced by the fear perhaps, or the repercussions that they may 

suffer when they go back into the community and if they found someone guilty, others may look 

down upon them?  We know that, that is a fact. We know that, that is what happens, particularly, in 

high profile cases.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In a way, what we are talking about is a kind of elitism, the protection of the elites. That is 

what  is  happening.  What  we  are  saying,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  having  these  changes  now,  we  are 

getting to get uniformity and the Judges will be a lot more accountable. They will need to do a lot 

more work. They do not simply say, “Well, the assessors found them guilty or not guilty, therefore 

let us go away.” The development of jurisprudence does not happen.  Honourable Waqanika said, 

“one day”, and she kind of quoted it like, “one day Mafatu”, one day it will happen.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the beauty of Mafatu is that, you have the ability to change laws as society 

changes,  you  have  the  ability  in  this  legislature  to  change  laws  as  technology  changes  or  change 

laws  as  demographics  change  and  change  laws  when  international  jurisprudence  develops.  

Honourable Nawaikula said, it has been there for 100-odd years, why change it now.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If we use the same compelling argument, we would not have changed the Trade Marks Act 

which  all  of  you  supported,  it  goes  back  to  the  1840s,  or  we  would  not  have  changed  the 

Companies Act, we not have brought in the Crimes Act, the Penal Code would not have gone, so it 

is not a very cogent argument and, Honourable Waqanika, you have the ability to change laws as 

and when things change within society.  At this point in time, we are trying to get our laws up-to-

date with the changes that have taken place.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would, again, urge and I think a lot of people do not actually realise that 

by bringing in the system now as proposed, we will get a lot of consistency in decision- making.  

We  will  also  get  a  lot  of  sensitisation  within  the  Judiciary,  we  will  also  be  able  to  remove  the 

prejudices  that  arise  in  the  decision-making  process  through  the  assessor  system,  in  particular, 

when  we  try  to  modernise  our  laws  and  particularly  in  relation  to  patriarchy  sexual  offences,  et 

cetera.  It does help us in that respect. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these amendments have been made with a lot of thought in process, with a 

</span></p>
<p><span>lot of consultations and if anything, it will enhance the rights of ordinary Fijians.  

</span></p>
