<h3>HIGH COURT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2021</h3>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament 

on Monday, 8th February, 2021,  I move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That  the  High  Court  (Amendment)  Bill  2021  (Bill  No.  1/2021)  be  debated,  voted 

</span></p>
<p><span>upon and be passed.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Attorney-

General,  I remind  you that  pursuant  to  the  resolution of  Parliament, the  debate will be limited to 

one hour.   

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 32</a></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I now call on the Honourable Attorney-General to speak on his motion. You have the floor 

</span></p>
<p><span>530 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I had highlighted some of 

the reasons  for the  amendment to  the High Court Act, and if I could  reiterate some of them, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir. Essentially, the gist of the Bill is to set up an Anti-Corruption Division of the High 

Court and Anti-Corruption Division in the Magistracy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  way  of  background,  we,  of  course,  had  ratified  the  United  Nations 

Convention  Against  Corruption  in  2008.    We  also  then  set  up  the  Fiji  Independent  Commission 

Against Corruption (FICAC) with the task of effectively combatting corruption, in order to promote 

transparency and accountability for good governance in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to prosecuting cases relating to corruption that are reported and 

investigated by FICAC, FICAC institutes proceedings in the Magistrates Court and High Court of 

Fiji.    However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  seen,  it  has  created  a  lot  of  inefficiencies,  lengthy 

litigation and, of course, there is a backlog of cases.   

</span></p>
<p><span>However, Mr. Speaker,  Sir, we have seen a lot of inconsistency,  given that anticorruption 

measures or laws pertaining to corruption is, in fact, quite modern or new in Fiji.  Even if you look  

at  the  Penal  Code  when  you  had  offences  like  abuses  of  office,  there  is  hardly  any  prosecution 

under those systems, there is hardly any jurisprudence that are developed.  Similarly, we have seen, 

of course, the inconsistency in the decisions that are being handed out by the different jurisdictions 

within Fiji itself.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make from a legal perspective is that, 

FICAC  has  the  ability  to,  of  course,  take  over  any  corruption  cases  that  are  with  the  Director  of 

Prosecution’s Office or with the Police.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the specialised courts, of course, are not new to Fiji’s judicial system.  We 

</span></p>
<p><span>have examples, such as the: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Family Division of the High Court and the Family Division of the Magistrates Court;  

Court  of  Review  that  was  established  to  look  at  specifically  offences  on  matters 

pertaining to the Customs Act;  

</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Court that was established under the Tax Administration Act; and 

</span></p>
<p><span>Employment  Relations  Court  established  under  section  219  to  section  225  of  the 

Employment Relations Act. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  the  United  Kingdom,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  where  we  have  the  common  law,  having  its 

genesis  from,  the  Queen’s  Bench  includes  a  specialised  court,  for  example,  Commercial  Court, 

Admiralty Court and the Administrative Court.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Worldwide,  there  has  been  an  emergence,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  specialised  courts  in 

particular  in  relation  to  anticorruption  measures.    There  is  about  17  countries  to  date  that  have 

specific anticorruption courts that have been established. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst others, the main objective of establishing an anticorruption court 

</span><span>within  the  High  Court  and  Magistrates  Court  is  to  achieve  the  consistent  application  of  anti-

</span><span>corruption  jurisprudence  in  relation  to  corruption  cases,  the  specialisation  of  Judges  and 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 33</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>531 

</span></p>
<p><span>Magistrates in anticorruption law and the adherence to international norms and standards in relation 

to anticorruption. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The inconsistent application, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of anticorruption jurisprudence has become a 

cause where different Judges and Magistrates who are presiding  over anticorruption measures are 

also operating in isolation, whilst at the same time, presiding over a large number of other criminal 

cases.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the creation of the specialised anti-corruption courts will ensure that the 

designated  Judges  and  Magistrates  who  become  specialised  in  that  area  are  familiar  with  the 

development of the jurisprudence offshore, unlike some who are claiming that it is a very simple 

area  of  the  law.    It  is  actually  not,  it  is  a  very  complex  area  of  the  law,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    This 

amendment to the Bill also has to partially be read in conjunction with the other amendment, which 

is to the Criminal Procedure Act, to remove the uncertainties. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will of course, create effective expeditious mechanisms dealing with 

anticorruption  processes  and  methods.    It  may  be  lost  on  some  people,  that  by  having  these 

specialist  divisions,  you  are  creating  certainty  not  just  for  the  prosecution  or  the  development  of 

jurisprudence but also for accused persons, because they and their lawyers will know exactly  what 

is the jurisprudence, what is the tariff rate that is going and the application of the law itself.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the absence of specialised courts, of course, as we have highlighted, can 

lead  to  delays.    In  the  past,  we  have  seen  that  because  of  delays,  you  have  unavailability  of 

witnesses  due  to  intimidation,  some  have  left  the  country,  witnesses  were  being  approached  by 

defendants  to  influence  their  testimony,  and  in  Fiji  fundamentally  and  philosophically,  we  have 

always seen the approach to anticorruption measures where people seek restitution as a means of 

overcoming matters where there is finance involved.  So if a person comes into your house, breaks 

your  window  and  steals  the  television  set  and  other  things,  it  is  seen  as  a  far  more  detrimental 

impact  on society than a person who is  well  educated, perhaps university degree, well  connected 

and steals money equivalent to that amount or even larger amounts.  People still think that the latter 

person  should  be,  kind  of,  wrapped  on  the  knuckles  and  say,  “Don’t  do  it  again,  pay  back  the 

money, go away.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>However, corruption actually has a huge and deleterious effect  on society.   It  has  a huge 

and deleterious effect on our ability, for example, to go and talk to a donor partner, go and talk to 

international agencies because they will say, “Your system actually will leak the funds we will give 

to  you.”    So  it  leaves  an  indelible  mark  on  the  financial  system  within  our  country  and  we  have 

seen that happening on numerous occasions, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have said that, the jurisprudence is developing a lot overseas and we 

need  that  to  be  put  into  the  jurisprudence  development  in  Fiji.    So,  I  would  like  to  give  those 

introductory remarks as I am sure there will be comments that I would like to respond to later on.  

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General.  Honourable Members, I now 

</span></p>
<p><span>give the floor to the Honourable Niko Nawaikula.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  think  it  must  be  stated  at  the 

outset  that  we  have  cautioned  this  House  and  the  nation  of  the  abuse  by  Government,  of 

independent  bodies  and  the  judicial  system,  including  the  Police,  FICAC  and  even  the  DPP,  and 

how  this  Government  has  used  those  institutions  to  protect  itself  and  to  protect  its  personnel, 

instead of them being independent.  That, in my view, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not a democracy.  That is 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 34</a></p>
<p><span>532 

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>fascism, tyrannical and it is dictatorship, and that is the shape and form of the country we live in 

and  the  Government  we  live  in,  where  there  exists  fascism,  tyrannicalism,  dictatorship  but  we 

clothe  ourselves  with  a  Parliament  and  with  these  institutions,  to  show  the  world  that  we  are 

democratic.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It must be stated at the outset that this is another way of the executive arm of Government, 

manipulating the judicial system.  In saying that, we have this year acknowledged the appointment 

of one of our members of this country to be the President of the Human Rights, when we are not 

living the principles of democracy, as I have said.  We are abusing human rights.  We are doing all 

these, we are basically a dictatorship but we have currently a person from this country who is the 

President of the Human Rights Commission.  That is sad!  And even very lately, the abuse, again, 

of this human rights  by  sending Professor Pal  away  from  Fiji.   Even now as we speak, there has 

been no statement from the Human Rights Commission locally, nor from the local who holds the 

presidency.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If I can now turn to the proposed amendment and note here that there has been objections 

from many members of the public, including the Fiji Law Society and also the Indigenous Lawyers 

Association  to  this  end,  with  a  good  reason.    Basically,  the  intention  of  this  amendment  is  to 

threaten and intimidate those who oppose and criticise the Government and that must be stated at 

the  outset.    And  what  the  amendment  does  is  that,  it  seeks  to  amend  the  High  Court  Act  by 

establishing a new division which it calls the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Before  I  touch  on  that,  let  me  first  discuss  the  process, 

remembering,  of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  about  how  we  process  Bills  in  this  House.    We  do  so, 

acknowledging again the principle of democracy, that the law-making process should be inclusive 

but this amendment came on Monday under Standing Order 51.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Standing  Order  51  has  the  intention  of  denying  the  public,  denying  those  who  know, 

denying the experts their right to participate in the law-making process and we passed that.  You 

can remember, Mr. Speaker, when this motion was put up for debate on Monday.  I did not stand 

up because it is a waste of time.  We are sick and tired of this abuse. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As I have said, we are not a democracy, we are a dictatorship because we are abusing the 

very process of democracy.  We are not living the value of democracy.  That is how it is here.  We 

have  denied  all  these  people  their  rights  to  participate  and  that  is  the  reason  why  the  Fiji  Law 

Society is writing, that is the reason why the whole public is complaining.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- So here we are at this stage and we are being given one hour to 

</span></p>
<p><span>debate this. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me go to the intricacies of this amendment.  That is basically what this amendment is 

seeking to do, so that soon after this, all the cases that we current have, including ours (there are six 

of us who are now also part of that) will be channelled to the single court.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 35</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>533 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- That is where the interference that I am saying with the judicial 

system is.  I am sure it will even extend, even interfering with judicial personnel as well because 

once you have that, the Government will be assured that all those people will be intimidated, that 

no one will stand up and criticise the Government, something that democracy guarantees.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There is something wrong here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it says, “Anti-Corruption Division of the 

High Court”.  It will not be the Anti-Corruption Division because if you look at the jurisdiction, it 

will  not  be  just  charges  for  corruption,  it  will  include  all  proceedings  that  are  started  by  FICAC, 

even if it starts with criminal charges, so it is wrong to say that it will be limited to corruption.  It 

basically means, we will totally have a FICAC court.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Attorney-General justifies himself that this will be a specialised court and 

it is common overseas.  It is wrong!  Specialist courts are usually determined by the volume.  That 

is  why  we  have  the  Family  Court,  and  the  Tax  Court  and  there  is  another  court  they  have  not 

included here which is the Agricultural Tribunal.  We usually do that where we have large volumes 

of cases that require speciality.  That is the not the case here.  We do not have that much cases or 

FICAC cases that will justify spending millions of dollars or a very substantial sum to establish a 

special court by itself, so he is wrong on that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Another point that he said is, “consistency of application of the principles of jurisprudence”.  

Again wrong!  We have the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court to do exactly that.  This Judge 

can make his own interpretation, that other Judge can make his own interpretation, but consistency 

will come from the right of appeal and that is the very reason why we appeal.  You appeal so that 

the  appellate  court  can  see  to  that  consistency,  so  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  is  wrong  on 

that point.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Another point that he said was certainty.  He said, “We are doing this because it will allow 

Judges to know exactly what is the law and the tariff.”  Again, totally wrong!  That is the reason 

why we have the appellate jurisdiction, it is for that, but the motive is clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The 

motive is very, very clear.  This Government is interfering with the separation  of powers and we 

have stated that before. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- It is interfering with the Judiciary.  It is interfering, even with the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Legislature.  We know that, but we are not mentioning it. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- And this is another, so it is manipulating the court system so that 

</span></p>
<p><span>it will threaten and intimidate those who oppose and criticise you.  That is the very reason.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We need to change this Government, we need to remove it.  There are two ways, I am told; 

one, is the way they came in, for the Army to come in, but I am not going to talk about that.  The 

other way that I wish to recommend to the people is by election.  We have next year for the election 

and we have suffered enough…

<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  …  by  the  abuse  and  the  mismanagement  of  this  Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The whole country has suffered, individuals have suffered and we have had enough.  So, I 

recommend to every individual, please, next year, when you go to vote, remove this Government.  

They have destroyed the economy and now they are manipulating the judicial system for the very 

reason to keep them there and for the very reason to threaten and intimidate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>They have done that.  The FICAC and other constitutionally established independent bodies 

are not independent, and the sad thing for us is that, we cannot rely on our friends - the UN to help 

us.  The US will not help us, New Zealand will not help us, Australia will not help us.  We have to 

rely  on  ourselves  and  the  only  legal  way  that  is  there  before  us,  is  to  vote  and  I  beg  everyone, 

please, vote this Government out.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Nawaikula for his contribution to the debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I will take the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport first, and 

</span></p>
<p><span>then Honourable Waqanika.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I find it quite rich that someone who has been a part 

of some anti-democratic things that have gone on in this country, someone who has just been a part 

of threats and intimidation to a particular part of the population can stand here in this House and 

say  that  we  are  threatening  and  we  are  not  being  democratic.    Now,  is  that  not  lovely,  Sir,  that 

someone who actually flouted the law, threatened and intimidated people and because of him, was 

the root cause of some of our problems because there are lot of people that left Vanua Levu because 

of him, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- No! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Because  of  the  threats  and  intimidation  caused  by  him.    Yet,  it  is  so 

rich, Sir, that he can stand here and proudly say that we are being undemocratic and threatening and 

intimidating.    Well,  let  me  give  you  a  one-word  answer,  Honourable  Member,  garbage,  absolute 

garbage! That is the whole point.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this actual proposed Bill intends to create a specialised court within Fiji’s 

judicial system. That is not new, Sir, it is not new, it has been done with the Family Court and the 

other  Courts  that  are  actually  in  the  land  and  it  has  been  done  all  over  the  world.  We  are  not 

creating  a  court  of  our  own  that  we  can  actually  intimidate  a  judge  to  do  it,  no,  Sir,  absolutely 

further from the truth! That is what, maybe, they do but we have not, and we are not going to do 

such things.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  has  been  inconsistent  applications  and  decisions  on  a  number  of 

corruption-related  cases,  from  what  I  understand,  and  sometimes  the  law  is  actually  applied 

differently  to  anti-corruption  cases  across  the  judicial  system,  and  the  Honourable  Attorney-

General is 100 percent correct. The development of the jurisprudence is actually important to this 

particular area.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, corruption cases are actually very complicated and in the words of what 

FICAC  has  actually  published  just  recently  as  of  yesterday,  it  is  actually  a  gateway  -  corruption 

leads to many other crimes.  It is a gateway to drug-related offences and terrorism. Maybe, the stuff 

that  has  actually  been  published  by  Fiji  Independent  Commission  Against  Corruption  (FICAC), 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 37</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>535 

</span></p>
<p><span>everyone should read it because it is actually very important.  So it is important for us to keep it in 

check.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Just  for  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the  more  lenient  sentences,  while  others 

actually find a much higher one in particular circumstances, acquittals and guilt  also for the very 

same  offence.    There  needs  to  be  some  consistency  in  the  decision-making  processes  so  we  can 

actually have a level playing field, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a  beggars  belief  by  certain  Fijians  to  think  that  corruption  is  not 

prevalent in Fiji.  It is very far from the truth, Sir.  It is unfortunate, but it actually exists, and I wish 

to  remind  this  august  House  that  this  Government  has  actually  been  bold  enough  to  set  up  the 

FICAC.  We are the ones that took the step to actually do something about it.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the very same people who would say that Fiji has a high rate of 

corruption  and  yet,  when  we  are  actually  doing  something  about  it,  they  suddenly  say  it  is  not 

prevalent or it is not needed.  Sir, that is actually absurd, absolutely absurd!  

</span></p>
<p><span>Let  me  remind  them  and  everyone  else  in  terms  of  what  corruption  does.  Corruption 

actually lowers public confidence.  It wastes taxpayers’ funds and honest businesses actually miss 

out on contracts. We do not want this. We do not want to live in a society such as that. We want 

cases  related  to  corruption  to  be  dealt  with  efficiently  and  most  importantly,  Sir,  we  want  these 

cases dealt with integrity.  Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the House sometimes 

actually fail to see that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this particular reform,  it  also  sends a confidence message to  all 

Fijians that corruption-related cases will be dealt with effectively and in a much timely manner, just 

as we do now with Family Court cases.  In fact, it is an important part of the judicial process. They 

can also have confidence that their cases will be dealt with justly. This will bring a relief also to the 

business community who may have been unfairly dealt with in corruption-related cases, who may 

have actually missed out on cases due to corruption.  

</span></p>
<p><span>This  is  very  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  This  reform  is  actually  in  line  with  best 

international practices.  It is understood to date, Sir, there are over 17 jurisdictions worldwide that 

have actually established anti-corruption courts in countries and this actually sends a positive signal 

… 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Which countries – Burundi, Afghanistan, and who else? 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- So, what is wrong with Burundi and what is wrong with Afghanistan? 

</span></p>
<p><span>You tell me.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order!  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable V.R. Gavoka interjects)  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Do  not  carry  on  a  conversation.  Leave  it  to  the  Speaker  to  speak.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Interject, but do not carry on a conversation.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  You should not pour scorn on African countries and Asian countries, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Member.

<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the other things that this actually does is, it sends a positive signal 

to our international community and also specifically to our foreign investors that for a developing 

country like Fiji, our justice system actually takes corruption very seriously.  This means that they 

will  be  confident  enough  with  respect  to  their  investments  in  Fiji,  that  it  is  safe  and  secure,  and 

disputes also will be efficiently handled by our system.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Having dedicated courts, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for specific issues, as  I have said earlier on, is 

not something new for Fiji.  We have, as I have said, the Family Division, the Tax Court, the Court 

of  Review,  Customs  Act  1986  and  Employment  Relations  Court.    We  have  specialised  quasi-

judicial  bodies,  such  as  the  Co-operative  Tribunal,  Land  Transport  Appeals  Tribunal,  and  these 

have  been  established  to  deal  specifically  with  issues  of  law  in  these  particular  areas,  this  is  no 

different.  The  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  now  gives  Fiji  an  opportunity  to  develop  and  actually 

specialise in anti-corruption skills.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  conclude,  Sir,  the  frustrations  of  ordinary  Fijians  on  how 

corruption-related  cases  are  dealt  with  would  be  a  thing  of  the  past.    This  is  a  step  in  the  right 

direction, Sir, and I fully support the amendments to the Bill.  I thank you for giving me the floor, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Honourable Waqanika.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  discouraging  to  see  that  Section  51  is 

</span></p>
<p><span>invoked to push through these two Bills, but it is what it is. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of specialised courts, yes, I agree, it is not new. I am just 

wondering whether the lawyers in this House are in practice.  There are only two of us who actually 

practice - myself and Honourable Nawaikula, we are the practicing practitioners in this House.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Employment Magistrates in the Employment Court, you have the judicial officers who 

preside over those cases and they also presided over other cases, likewise for the Family Court.  If 

we are going to talk about specialised courts, make sure that whoever  you appoint stick solely to 

that because right now the system that you have in place with the specialised courts, they are doing 

both.  I tell you, I take my hat off to our judicial officers, they are overworked. Case in point is the 

Nasinu Court, with the biggest municipality in Fiji, the two judicial officers are rotating over one 

court to preside over matters. So we already have existing issues but then we are bringing in this 

Anti-Corruption Division.  , I am there for it but we have to look at the priority.  It is relevant but 

the priority.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I heard my learned colleague, the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and 

Transport talk about best international practices. There has been a mention of 17 jurisdictions. Yes, 

Afghanistan is one of them. What is wrong with Afghanistan? The pressure came from the US and 

UK  who  are  financial  donors  to  that  country,  to  put  in  place  an  anti-corruption  specialised  court 

because the money that was going into that country was misappropriated by that Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, is corruption in our country that high that we need to establish a court?  If it is, I am 

all for it but remember, the increase has piled during the tenure of this Government since 2006 till 

now.    We  were  told  the  </span><span>coup</span><span>  happened  to  get  rid  of  corruption  in  2006.    I  remember  because  it 

came on the news so now we are establishing these courts.

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>537 

</span></p>
<p><span>There  was  also  mention  of  the  integrity  of  the  courts.  Indonesia  is  also  one  of  the  17 

countries  that  have  established  a  specialised  anti-corruption  court.    What  happened  was  this,  the 

judges  that  were  on  those  courts  were  indicted  for  corruption.    So,  what  integrity  are  we  talking 

about? We are all humans here. We need to look at this Bill carefully, take it back, it needs to be 

discussed and it needs to be thrashed out.  Who is going to fund it?   

</span></p>
<p><span>We already have existing challenges in the legal system.  There are cases that are coming 

out.    I  am  appearing  before  court,  a  hearing  date  was  vacated  on  a  Saturday  because  the  Chief 

Registrar  said,  “No  sitting  on  Saturdays”,  and  that  is  fair  enough.    Now,  we  are  getting  dates  in 

November  for  mention  to  set  hearings  for  next  year.    We  already  have  exiting  issues  with  non-

specialised courts.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There  was  also  mention,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  the  lay  assessors.    The  practice  has  always 

been of almost 20 years in Fiji that we have the assessors who participate in criminal trials and their 

participation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  very  important.    In  fact,  I  quote  from  page  8  of  the  DPP,  Mr. 

Christopher Pryde’s, address at the AG’s Conference held in December 2017, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Undoubtedly,  indictable  offences  should  be  decided  either  with  a  jury  or  with 

assessors  and  a  judge.  I  have  not  discussed  the  advantages  of  the  judge  alone  trial 

because in my opinion the advantages of a jury or assessor system outweighs arguments 

for judge alone trials, even in complex fraud trials.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, that is from the DPP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I am not talking about the next Bill.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We need the presence, Mr. Speaker, of public assessors in criminal trials.  Number one, it 

</span></p>
<p><span>keeps checks and balances in place. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I will talk now on the next Bill, yes.  I apologise, Mr. Speaker.  I 

</span></p>
<p><span>will now address the next Bill.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The presence of the assessors keep the judges at bay. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I apologise, I withdraw my statement on that, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, if there is a specialised court that we need now in Fiji, it is the 

sexual  offences  court.    The  reason  is  this,  I  commend  what  the  DPP  has  put  up  which  is  the 

monthly and yearly summary of their cases.   

</span></p>

<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  Now,  in  2020  alone,  there  were  246  people  who  were  charged 

with  a  total  of  531  counts  of  serious  sexual  offences  -  373  charges  alone  were  for  rape;  20 

attempted rape and 99 on sexual assault.  If there is a specialised court that we need, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, I am sure we can all agree because this is happening in our society, it is a sexual offences court. 

This is something that is repulsive to our nation and it is repulsive to our society. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, I have also checked up the FICAC Annual Report.  Their only Annual Report that I 

saw, Mr. Speaker, was for the financial year from 1st August, 2017 and 31st July, 2018.  I could 

not  find  any  other  Annual  Report  but  the  statistics  that  was  published  does  not  warrant  an  anti-

corruption specialised court.  The number of cases that are being reported, the number of cases that 

are  being  charged,  the  number  of  convictions,  acquittals  and  </span><span>nolle  prosequi  </span><span>does  not  add  up  or 

support the motion  of an anti-corruption court.  Sexual  offences and drugs,  yes, but  not  this, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Waqanika for her contribution to the debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Leader of the National Federation Party.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I have always said this in 

Parliament  since  2014,  that  the  use  of  Standing  Order  51  in  rushing  laws  through  is  not  the  best 

way of making laws.  There are obvious reasons where we need urgent consideration of Bills under 

Standing Order 51, but I think what we have seen in the last six years is that, this Government has 

used Standing Order 51 to rush through Bills when they do not have to.  I think this particular one, 

Mr. Speaker, falls into that category as well.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  was  just  wondering  how  many  people  in  Fiji  actually  know  how  the  laws  are  made.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes people are confused.  I meet people and they say, “Hey! You know, you people push 

this law, half the people do not understand this.  The people who are supposed to implement that 

law do not understand it.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>It  creates  a  lot  of  confusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  the  idea  of  putting,  draft  laws  or  laws 

introduced in Parliament to Committees is precisely to give those who might have issues with the 

law,  those  who  might  have  suggestions,  but  ultimately  it  is  the  Parliament,  it  is  the  Government 

which has the numbers and they are going to  approve or make amendments to that law based on 

what we hear.  So, the use of Standing Order 51 to ram through these two pieces of law is bad and I 

would urge the Government to actually reconsider it.  There is no harm in going back and... 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Well, you wait, I am coming to that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I wonder, Mr. Speaker, how many Parliaments are there in the world where the Members of 

Parliament  arrive  on  the  first  day  of  one-week  sitting  and  have  no  idea  what  Bills  are  going  to 

come.  When we came here on Monday morning we had no idea, no idea of what the Honourable 

Attorney-General was planning or what Bills was the Government planning to bring? 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject)

<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>539 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  PROFESSOR  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Some  decency  would  tell  them  that,  at  least,  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Members of Parliament are informed in the Business Committee on the Bills that would come.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Then suddenly in the middle of the day, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, you get the Bills under urgency, everything must be rushed and also within an hour’s debate.  

The Government Members, of course, just nod their heads and vote it through.  This includes, Mr. 

Speaker,  what  I  call  “the  silent  25”  -  the  Members  who  say  nothing  when  Government  actually 

tampers on proper parliamentary procedures.  They all keep quiet.  We have a pointless one hour 

debate after all  these,  and the  Government,  everyone knows, will vote it through.  So, that is  the 

point I am making. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- But before that, when you have the numbers and you 

know, why do you not give the opportunity to the people and to those who might be concerned to 

have their say?  That  is  what  we  are asking.  We are not  asking  for too  much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

That is why it is important to put the Bills through the Parliamentary Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Last  year,  for  example  we  passed  laws  on  the  media,  the  professional  sector,  taxation, 

immigration, citizenship;  all these laws  were passed under urgency  and  all under Standing Order 

51.  I told this Parliament in the last Session, a lot of people still have difficulty understanding some 

of  those  laws.    The  public  out  there  have  no  idea  about  the  changes  in  the  passport  laws  or  the 

citizenship  laws?    People  who  are  actually  in  the  Immigration  Department  have  no  idea.  They 

cannot give proper information to people and that is why it is important, Mr. Speaker, that we have 

some  discussion  through  these  committees  so that  people,  at  least,  have  an  idea  of  what  the  new 

law is going to be. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition,  we  know  that  the  Government  knows  that  very  few,  or  if  any,  of  these  Bills 

require  the  level  of  urgency.    They  know  that,  that  it  is  not  urgent  and  you  can  put  it  into  the 

Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but again, the Standing Order, is used.  I know the former Clerk to 

Parliament (Mary Chapman) in one of the seminars made that point very well.  She said that during 

their time and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you were the Speaker in the previous Parliament as well and I am 

sure you can see the difference yourself in how we are actually enacting laws.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The repeated use of Standing Order 51, in my view, Mr. Speaker, makes a mockery of how 

we make laws in this House.  It is important that we raise this as part of this discussion on the Bill.  

It also shows that the Government is disorganised, I mean, they do not have this idea of taking Bills 

through a process, through the Committees and have a timeline.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  it  is  really  unreasonable  for  anyone  to  expect  the  Opposition,  I 

</span></p>
<p><span>mean, I have had so many calls about these Bills from Monday.  People want to look at it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  PROFESSOR  B.C.  PRASAD.-  You  are  laughing,  it  is  not  a  laughing  matter, 

Honourable Attorney- General.  It is a very important matter.  I am not a lawyer but I know what 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 42</a></p>
<p><span>540 

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>laws  are.    I  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  economic  cost  of  corruption.    I  wrote  a  paper  about 

economic cost of corruption about a few years back.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But  more  importantly,  Sir,  it  is  the  Government  corruption  that  is  costing  the  societies 

everywhere  big  amounts  and  that  is  why  I  think  it  is  important  to  have  laws,  so  that  all  of  us  as 

legislators can actually understand and ensure that it is applied.  So it is not a laughing matter, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- People are asking, “What is the Government up to?”  

I  mean,  here  we  have  two  cyclones  that  have  just  hit  us,  people  are  asking  questions  about  the 

Government  package  and  what  the  Government  is  going  to  do  about  the  workers  who  have  lost 

jobs, and those who are suffering in Vanua Levu.  But here is a Government bent on rushing laws, 

and all the “Silent 25” are sitting there and not saying anything. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Why  do  we  want  this  Anti-Corruption  Division  in  the  High  Court  so  urgently?      Is  the 

system not working?  Do we have enough Judges?  Do we have enough people in the courtrooms 

and the support staff?  We need to probably look at all those issues rather than assuming that once 

you have a specialised court and I know we have an Employment Court, a Family Court, but the 

problems are still there, the delays  are still there and the efficiency of the court system is still an 

issue.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we understand the importance of making the laws 

and  how  the  laws  are  made.    If  you  look  at  the  notes  to  the  Bill,  it  says  there  are  17  countries 

around the world which have specialised Anti-Corruption Courts.  That means that there are about 

180 countries which do not have such courts.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  know  that  the  Honourable  Member  who  spoke  before  me  actually  talked  about  the 

countries  with  a  little  bit  of  research,  so  180  countries  around  the  world  do  not  have  a  separate 

division, only 17.   I think she was naming some of these countries and she is right, countries like 

Philippines,  Malaysia,  Thailand,  Slovakia,  Pakistan,  Afghanistan  and  Kenya  have  specialised 

courts and if you look at the corruption indices and the research that shows the economic cost of 

corruption in some of those countries, it is actually quite high.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  incidence  of  corruption  is  very  high,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  agree  with  what  the 

Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport was saying, that the economic 

cost  of corruption is  huge in  many of these countries, so I am  not  sure whether we have reached 

that point where we want to identify ourselves with those countries.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The other justification for the new Anti-Corruption Division is that, there are fewer Judges, 

they will deliver more consistent rulings.  I heard the Attorney-General talking about consistency.  

If  you  have  a  separate  division,  even  if  you  have  two  or  three  Judges,  there  is  no  guarantee  that 

there will be consistent judgments.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  my  understanding  of  how  cases  are  dealt  with,  there  are  a  lot  of  other  factors  that 

determine it at the end of the day, so I think the question really is about the efficiency.  I think if we 

are not getting the Courts to deal with corruption cases expeditiously and efficiently, it is to do with 

the  efficiency  of  our  Court  system.    We  need  to  look  at  that  more  than  trying  to  create  another 

division.

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>541 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to quote the Fiji Law Society President, an individual that I have a 

</span></p>
<p><span>lot of respect for in the law fraternity,  Mr. Clark.  He said the following and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“…the  notion  that  only  specialist  judges  are  competent  to  preside  over 

</span></p>
<p><span>corruption cases is open to challenge.  

</span></p>
<p><span>…corruption  is  a  criminal  offence,  and  Judges,  and  Magistrates  are  by  definition 

learned in the law, including criminal law.  That is why they are appointed in the first 

place.   

</span></p>
<p><span>…  a  diverse  bench,  offering  different  perspectives  and  viewpoints,  is  an  important 

strength in criminal justice.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Specialisation  drives  the  bench  of  that  diversity.    Corruption  is  not  so  complex,  also 

widespread as to justify a specialised court.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>That  is  what  I  was  saying  earlier.    In  their  view,  we  cannot  compare  ourselves  with 

</span></p>
<p><span>countries that I listed earlier.  They are, perhaps, right in that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I kind of endorse, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the views expressed by Mr. Clark.  He is a former 

Prosecutor, a practising lawyer and I see that the Honourable Attorney-General (I heard his press 

conference) is accusing the Law Society of siding or conspiring with the Opposition. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Yes. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  PROFESSOR  B.C.  PRASAD.-  You  know,  this  is  the  reference  that  Honourable 

Nawaikula made that somehow this Government thinks that, if I am seen with Richard Naidu or if I 

am seen with Wylie Clark, they are all conspiring with me in the Opposition, or if I am seen with 

Pal Ahluwalia in a </span><span>Gurdwara</span><span>, I am suddenly politicising this.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- This is the kind of connection or conspiracy theories 

</span></p>
<p><span>that they develop.  These guys are people with reputation in the area of law. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As  I  have  said,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  politics  is  not  about  winning  all  the  arguments,  nor  is 

politics just about putting the Government on one side and the Opposition on the other side.  I think 

we all have differences of opinion, we can disagree, but we can talk about these things and we can 

agree.  We do not have an Upper House in this Parliament.  We have a single Chamber Parliament 

and that is why, when we try and ram through Bills under Standing Order 51, there is no recourse.  

In a parliamentary system where  you have a Senate where Bills can be reviewed, there is always 

this  option  of  taking  it  to  the  people  and  the  people  will  have  a  better  opportunity  to  understand 

this. 

</span></p>
<p><span>When you have a single Chamber Parliament, it is absolutely necessary, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  just  stick  to  what  is  being  debated.    You  have 

</span></p>
<p><span>already gone over time.

<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>If there is a need for an Anti-Corruption Division of the Court, then we have not explained 

this to the people and the only way we could have explained the need for a separate division or an 

Anti-Corruption  Court  is  for  us  to  take  this  Bill  to  the  Committees  and  let  the  Committee  come 

back with its report, so that we can have a better debate, an informed debate and the people have a 

better information about the Bill.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, Honourable Leader of the National Federation.  Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Tikoduadua, you have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I am not making an intervention on this 

</span></p>
<p><span>particular Bill and the next one, my apology.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, your right of reply.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I found it rather amusing but quite saddening, Honourable Nawaikula, if I 

could just get that off my chest, in his address on this Bill, talked about how the Military perhaps, 

should remove this Government and he and the Opposition have been talking about it.  Honourable 

Professor Prasad always talks about, “We do not support military intervention”, not a peep out of 

him.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- We will never. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  You  did  not  say  anything  to  him  because  you  are 

</span></p>
<p><span>obsequious to that side.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The other point is that, this Opposition continuously talk about military intervention, saying 

it  is  bad,  yet  none  of  them  said  anything  whilst  their  now  Shadow  Minister  for  Economy  talked 

about military intervention. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight a number of issues and there 

is a lot of obfuscation that has taken place.  I am actually quite agitated about it, frankly, and I will 

start off with the Honourable Professor Prasad.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad  said  that  I  said  that  the  Fiji  Law  Society  (FLS)  submission 

was in cahoots with the Opposition. I said that only in reference (if you listened and he was honest 

intellectually) to the second last paragraph by the FLS where they accused you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

and I will read it out: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The changes being proposed in both Bills are so profound that it must certainly 

be carefully considered. With respect to restrict matters of such great public importance 

in  one  hour’s  parliamentary  debate  as  suggested  by  the  Speaker,  would  be  a  serious 

failure of leadership.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>That is the bit that I said you were in cahoots with. Please, be intellectually honest.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who knows the law, including the FLS should know that the time given for debate 

under Standing Order 51 is not set by the Speaker, it is set by the person moving the motion.  It is 

an affront to the Office of the Speaker to suggest that, and this is the FLS on whose submissions 

you are basing your whole argument on.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is that, they chose to firstly get the law wrong and 

they chose to formally through this letter, be in cahoots with their political position. That is why I 

</span></p>

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>543 

</span></p>
<p><span>said  that.    In  respect  of  all  other  submissions  they  made  regarding  the  separate  division  and  jury 

system or assessor system, I made comments on that specifically.  Please, do not obfuscate matters.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will start off with Honourable Professor Prasad.  He says that he relies 

on  the  FLS  saying  that  it  is  not  a  serious  matter,  it  is  not  complex.  Let  me  read  from  what  the 

FICAC statement said in relation to that, and I quote from their response to FLS on 10th February, 

2021:  

</span></p>
<p><span> “…FLS  states  “corruption  is  not  so  complex  -  or  so  widespread.”  This 

</span></p>
<p><span>statement by FLS is misconceived and delusional.  

</span></p>
<p><span>To allude that corruption is not widespread is a barren opinion, which obviously 

neglects the ground reality of the seriousness of corruption that the country is fighting.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Corruption is polycentric and multifaceted.  It is the gateway for the occurrences 

of  many  other  serious  crimes  including  illegal  drug  importation,  tax  and  customs 

breaches, fraud and serious financial crimes, money laundering, human trafficking (we 

talked  about),  terrorism  and  terrorist  financing.    The  impact  of  corruption  to  the 

economy and society at large is irreversibly detrimental.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Corruption  cases  can  also  become  complex  and  often  require  lengthy  and 

cumbersome processes to bring the culprits before the Court of Law. Realization of this 

important factor has made several countries to change their traditional response to fight 

economic crimes including fraud and corruption. The introduction of the Serious Fraud 

Office and the National Economic Crime Centre is the United Kingdom’s response to 

white-collar  crimes  and  corruption.    Likewise,  in  the  United  States  (I  know  you  are 

obsessed  with  first-world  countries)  the  National  Institute  on  Economic  Crime  is 

responsible  for  providing  specialized  training  and  advice  to  the  relevant  law 

enforcement agencies.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In  Fiji,  there  have  been  and  are  many  complex  corruption  cases  before  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>courts to which the Fiji Law Society seems oblivious to”.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Then it goes on.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  also  pick  on  the  point  made  by  Honourable  Nawaikula.  He 

turned this whole matter into some personal  matter.  He thinks that this Division is being created 

because they have been charged, relating to whatever offences they have been charged with. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also remind him that it was not only Members from SODELPA that 

were charged, there was also a member from the FijiFirst side that was also charged. If there was 

any political ostraciation, political targeting, vindictiveness then no one from this side would have 

been charged.  In fact, he did the honourable thing by resigning.  There is absolutely no nexus been 

shown between the creation of this Division and any form of political victimisation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, secondly, no one from the other side of the House has stood up and given 

one iota of logic to draw any inference or direct or indirect inference to say that the rights of any 

individual will anyway be deprived.  Not a single iota of argument has been put forward, not one. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember I used to be a member of Transparency International when I 

was  in  the  private  sector.    When  it  was  the  International  Year  of  Corruption  when  the  then  SDL 

Government was here, I remember going with two other members from Transparency International 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 46</a></p>
<p><span>544 

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>to  the Office of the Prime Minister to  urge them  to  ratify the United Nations Convention against 

Corruption  (UNCAC),  they  refused  to  do  so.    When  the  Bainimarama-led  Government  was 

appointed, that was one of the first Conventions they ratified.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Today, Fiji is part of the peer review group under UNCAC. We volunteered ourselves to be 

part  of  the  peer  review  programme,  so  other  countries,  including  first  world  countries,  can  come 

and review our compliance with UNCAC, which means, are we using it for political purposes? Not 

a single peer review has said that has happened.  Absolutely, no evidence to suggest that.  We only 

have these kind of comedy of errors being made from the other side of the House.  People stand up 

make all sorts of ridiculous comments with clapping coming from Honourable Rasova, who’s got 

the loudest clap, and everyone cheering which is a mob mentality, with no logic. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Honourable  Professor  Prasad  did  acknowledge  this.    The  reality  of  the 

matter  is  that,  the  World  Bank  Report  said  in  2006  that  one-third  of  Fijian  economy  was  in  the 

black, in other words, illegal dealings going on.  How does that happen? It means, someone is on 

the take!  At the border, Police, Biosecurity, wherever it may be, is it  not better to get that black 

economy back into mainstream economy?  Should we not be serious about that? You want to pull 

out Afghanistan, just as some kind of scapegoat?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Waqanika talked about, “Oh, how many cases will they hear?” So she is using 

frequency of cases as an argument not to have a separate division.  How many cases does the Tax 

Court  hear?    How  many  cases  does  the  Court  of  Review  hear?    You  have  not  gone  into  those 

statistics.  Sometimes the Tax Court hardly hears any cases, yet, we have a specialised court.  The 

logic does not follow through.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Honourable Professor Prasad said that we did not inform that these Bills 

will be coming.  We mentioned in the Business Committee, if you dare to attend, you always send 

your representatives and we told them, we read out the Bills that will be presented.  Get it right!  

Yes, we did not tell the content but we said that these Bills will be presented.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is, Honourable Professor Prasad then went on and 

said,  “Oh,  you  know,  we  should  have  public  consultations”.    Earlier  on  this  morning,  the 

Honourable  Member  sitting  behind  him  complained  about  the  Climate  Change  Bill  having  too 

much  public  consultations.  He  said,  “We  know  why  they  are  doing  public  consultations  because 

they are going to fast-track it within the Committee stage.” So he is lamenting the fact that we have 

got too much public consultations, which one is it?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reality  of  the  matter  is  that,  in  the  second  Bill  that  we  are  going  to 

discuss if you look at the rationale, Honourable Waqanika, touched on that particular Bill.  But we 

have  actually  talked  about  sexual  offences  and  the  nature  of  patriarchy  in  respect  of  how  it 

infiltrates in the thinking of the assessors. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  had  widespread  discussions  with  the  Honourable  Chief  Justice 

about  this  very  issue  of  our  specialised  courts.    What  we  are  saying  and  what  the  discussion  has 

been,  at  the  moment,  because  of  the  volume  of  the  cases  and  the  jurisprudence  that  has  already 

developed, the judges and the magistrates have a lot of capacity in hearing these cases. And there 

has  been  a  lot  of  judicial  training  in  that  respect.    The  DPP’s  Office  has  got  a  specialised  office 

regarding that.  So, it does not, in any way, negate or derogate away from giving emphasis to those 

types of offences.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  Honourable  Nawaikula  has  got  a  very  warped  understanding  of 

jurisprudence.    He  thinks  the  jurisprudence  can  only  be  developed  by  the  Appeals  Court.    Not 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 47</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>545 

</span></p>
<p><span>necessarily! Even the High Court develops jurisprudence.  In fact, most cases do not go beyond the 

High Court, and jurisprudence set by the High Court actually is followed by the Magistrates Court.  

He knows that. To simply every step of the way, he argued three times, “Oh, the Appeal Court is 

there.  Oh the Appeal Court is there!”  No!  Jurisprudence are also developed by the lower Courts, 

other than the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is  a couple of other issues  that  I also  wanted to  highlight.   Again, 

there was this argument that by having a separate division that there will be interference with the 

Judiciary.  How does that logically work?  Does this amendment say that Government will have an 

input into it?  Does it alter the way the judges will apply the law?  Does it, in any way, say that the 

selection of those judges and magistrates who will be sitting in this new Division will be selected 

by  someone  else,  other  than  the  Chief  Magistrate  or  the  Chief  Justice?    Not  a  single  shred  of 

evidence, yet we have lawyers,   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Waqanika  said  that  she  and  Honourable  Nawaikula  are  the  only  practising 

lawyers  here  in  private  practice.    I  did  not  know,  Honourable  Nawaikula  is,  again,  practicing 

because I thought he was suspended, he is probably back in.  But the point of the matter is that, it 

does not, in any way, mean that the Judiciary is going to be interfered with. Absolutely not!  Not a 

single shred of evidence.  They  said that it will have enormous impact on the budget, no!  It is a 

Division created, we do not physically go and create a Division that requires money, it is in the law. 

Again, without any verification of facts and there is going to be consistency in decision making.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In one of the earlier things that the Bainimarama-led Government also did, Mr Speaker, Sir, 

was that, it set up a Commission of Inquiry into the Magistracy in Fiji.  And those of you who have 

been practicing for quite some time will know that there were a couple of Magistrates who actually 

were on the tape.  And when the complaint in one particular town or city got too much, they just 

simply moved him around.  The last town that he was in was in Nadi. The Commission of Inquiry 

found  out  that  the  going  rate  for  him  for  careless  driving  was  $1,500;  dangerous  driving  was 

$2,500; rape was $5,000 in those days.  He had an agent in the market where you pay the money 

and then the Magistrate  dealt  with  him.    After the Commission  of Inquiry  ended, that  Magistrate 

lost his job, based on the findings of that particular Commission of Inquiry.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Those  are  real  issues  pertaining  to  the  Judiciary.    Recently,  the  Honourable  Chief  Justice 

found out that there were certain Court Clerks in Lautoka where evidence has gone missing in the 

Exhibits Room.  Files do not get appeared before particular lawyers or files disappear.   These are 

the real issues that need to be addressed.  Not a single Member has spoken about that, nor have they 

drawn any cause or link between this amendment and the practice of the Judiciary.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I think the FLS, of course, can write any letter, it represents about 

19.9 percent of all the lawyers in Fiji. I have got the statistics here.  There are about 894 lawyers 

with  practising  certificates  of  which  178,  are  members  of  the  FLS.    The  other  80  percent  of  the 

lawyers are not members of the FLS.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously it is not representative of all 

the lawyers in Fiji, in fact, it is a representation of a minority of lawyers in Fiji.  It is not to say, of 

course,  that  minorities  cannot  make  worthwhile  comments,  unfortunately,  in  this  particular 

instance, they did not make a worthwhile comment. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  we  would  like  to  urge  all  Honourable  Members  of  Parliament  to 

essentially  look  at  the  intent  of  the  law,  which  is  to  create  a  specialised  division  that  will  deal 

specifically with these cases that will develop the jurisprudence.  We have seen cases where some 

Magistrates  or  Judges  who  are  versed  with  while  collar  crime,  knocks  off  something  on  what  is 

called overseas as “non-material technicality”.  Honourable Waqanika should tell us that as well as 

Honourable  Nawaikula,  that  there  are  material  technical  glitches  and  there  are  non-material 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>technical glitches, where things can actually be rectified, and it is only on those cases that they are 

getting knocked-off. 

</span></p>
<p><span>People  with  similar  offences,  the  Labasa  Magistrate  may  actually  send  someone  for  three 

years, the Nadi Magistrate decides to do it on a similar offence, commission of the offence, three 

months or suspended sentence.  These things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do not lead to certainty in law, it 

actually undermines the rule of law and it continues on a long-term basis.  What we are seeking is a 

specialisation and we are demonstrating our commitment to eradicating systemic corruption in Fiji.  

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.
