<p><span>Fiji’s National Ocean Policy 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  rise  to  inform  at  this 

February  session  about  Fiji’s  National  Ocean  Policy  (NOP),  a  guiding  blueprint  designed  to 

holistically protect and govern all of Fiji’s ocean and marine resources.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As an archipelagic nation, our ocean defines us, and not just our borders. For thousands of 

years,  the  ocean  has  provide  a  sustenance  and  fill  the  livelihoods  of  our  people  and  in  doing  so, 

helped our economy thrive. Today, we are able to put a number on that immense impact.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Studies indicate that in 2014, Fiji’s  marine ecosystem services would have been valued at 

approximately FJ$2.4 billion.  Anecdotal evidence which suggest that had the world’s economy not 

been crippled by COVID-19, these numbers would have been much higher still in 2020.  But as we 

note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to continue to tap into this bounty that nature provides us, our ocean must 

not be raided and pillaged for the economic benefit of a single generation.  Above all else, we must 

ensure that any and all investments in the ocean space are sustainable.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Ocean-based  development  needs  do  not  only  be  aligned  to  our  national  development 

aspirations  but  also  operate  within  our  international  climate  commitments  and  promote  the 

protection and restoration of marine resources in a way that will boost the regenerative capacity of 

our 1.3 million square kilometres of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  ocean  is  intrinsically  linked  to  our  identity  as  a  Small  Island 

Developing State, but we cannot let that name fool us.  When it comes to our ocean space under 

which we have a complete jurisdiction, nothing is small about Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Our EEZ is 70 percent larger than our landmass and when it comes to the size of the EEZ, 

Fiji has the 26th most expensive patch of planet under our protection.  With these statistics in mind, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must see our true potential as a big ocean State, one with significant potential 

for a very big, very vibrant and very blue economy.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the massive socioeconomic  prosperities being held in the depths of our ocean, our 

marine  biosphere  is  under  constant  threat  due  to  global  warming  -  a  global  emergency  threat,  as 

vulnerable  people  on  its  frontlines  know  too  well,  is  resulting  in  rising  sea  levels,  ocean 

acidification  and  mass  coral  bleaching.    Unregulated  mining  activities,  land  development  and 

pollution are major threats as well.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji’s ocean has also been subject to trans-border crime, overfishing, illegal, unreported and 

unregulated fishing and many other forms of mismanagement, contributing to the decline in marine 

and an increase in border security threats.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, such threats underscore the diverse spectrum of complex ocean issues that 

our  development    agenda must address,  if  we  are to  create  a sustainable, inclusive,  resilient and 

low  carbon  future  for  all  Fijians.    That  is  why,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government  has  not 

been resting on its laurels and is taking decisive action to these pressing threats to our ocean.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Back  in  2017,  Fiji  recognised  the  importance  of  mainstreaming  oceans  into  global 

discussions  on  climate  change  and  launched  the  Ocean  Pathway  Partnership  during  the  first  ever 

United Nations Ocean Conference in New York.  This is reinforced by Fiji’s COP 23 Presidency to 

the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2017 and showed the 

world that we are pioneers when it comes to protecting our oceans.

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji  went  on to  reemphasise the need to  strengthen the nexus between oceans and  climate 

during COP 25 in Madrid, where climate negotiators successfully garnered international support to 

include  oceans  as  part  of  the  UNFCCC  agenda.  But  here  at  home,  we  recognise  the  obstacles  to 

effective and congruent oceans management.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Historically,  Fiji’s  marine  sector  has  long  operated  in  policy  silos.    Multiple  Government 

agencies  are  mandated  to  administer  and  regulate  piecemeal  segment  of  Fiji’s  marine  ecosystem 

through  numerous  plans,  policies  and  strategies.    There  has  been  no  overarching  national  policy 

that provides a similar coordination point to effectively plan, allocate and manage resources for the 

broader sustainable management of Fiji’s ocean space.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The need for an overarching domestic policy that holistically guides the ocean action and is 

well aligned to Fiji’s international climate commitments made it clear that we needed to develop a 

national  policy  as  our  blueprint.    So,  following  indepth  discussions  with  relevant  Government 

agencies, the Ministry of Economy commenced the comprehensive drafting process of the NOP  in 

2019.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formulation of the NOP took over a year to complete, as it took many 

rounds  of  inclusive  comprehensive  consultations  between  and  among  Government  and  Non-

Government  stakeholders  -  11  rounds  of  stakeholder  consultations,  comprising  the  three  open 

public consultations, and these took place from October 2019 to November 2020.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To  ensure  that  our  eventual  Policy  would  complement,  not  compete  with  the  existing 

policies and legislation, the overall development of the NOP was guided by a steering committee 

consisting  of  key  Government  agencies,  selected  from  the  following  existing  Marine  Affairs 

Committees, the:   

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Protected Areas Committee through the National Environment Council of the Ministry 

of Environment;  

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Maritime Affairs Coordinating Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; 

(3)</span><span> </span><span>Marine Protected Areas Technical Committee of the Ministry of Fisheries; and 

(4)</span><span> </span><span>Marine  Spill  Pollution  Advisory  Committee  of  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Tourism and Transport. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while many minds and voices went into the policies formulation, I would 

like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  and  remember  one  in  particular,  the  late  Lieutenant 

Commander Silipa Tagicaki Kubuabola, who passed away earlier this month as the highest ranking 

female officer in the Fijian Navy.  Her input towards the formulation of the NOP was invaluable 

and  I  am  sure  she  would  have  been  delighted  to  operationalise  it.    Lieutenant  Commander 

Kubuabola will be sorely missed in this process.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  having  elaborated  the  development  of  the  NOP,  please  allow  me  to 

highlight the key features of the NOP.  The vision and mission of NOP are respectively to achieve a 

healthy ocean that sustains the livelihoods and aspirations of Fiji’s current and future generations, 

and to secure and sustainably manage Fiji’s ocean and its marine resources. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NOP will achieve its vision and mission through seven strategic goals.  

</span></p>
<p><span>These are: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Cooperation  -  to  harmonise  and  promote  an  integrated  and  cooperative  national 

approach  to  managing  the  ocean  in  a  manner  that  promotes  security,  strive  to 

sustainability and ensures prosperity for all Fijians.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>509 

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sustainability  -  to  protect,  restore  and  improve  ocean  ecosystems,  climate  services 

and  biodiversity  so  these  benefits  contribute  towards  a  fair  and  equitable 

participation  in  sharing  of  benefits  for  current  and  future  generations  through  the 

sustainable  management  of  100  percent  of  Fiji’s  ocean  within  the  national 

jurisdiction. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)  

</span></p>
<p><span>Security  -  to  safeguard  assets  and  ensure  regulatory  compliance  for  the  multi-

dimensional  maritime  security  of  100  percent  for  Fiji’s  ocean  within  its  national 

jurisdiction. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(4)  

</span></p>
<p><span>People  -  to  promote  a  people-centred  approach  to  ocean  management  by  sharing 

benefits in an equitable and inclusive manner that respects all rights. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(5)   Development  -  to  establish  a  solid  foundation  for  sustainable  development  that 

includes  facilitating  ocean-based  opportunities  and  innovations  to  ensure  healthy 

ecosystems and secure economic livelihoods. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(6)   Knowledge - to integrate traditional knowledge, heritage and cultural practices with 

scientific knowledge to provide a holistic platform that can meet the contemporary 

challenges of the ocean. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(7) 

</span></p>
<p><span>Advocacy  -  recognising  both,  the  connectivity  of  oceans,  the  need  for  ambitious 

management of the ocean and deepened understanding of the ocean climate nexus.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  NOP  lays  out  how  Fiji  can  engage  in  regional  and  global  advocacy  that  aligns  with  and 

fortifies the ongoing seven endeavours.  Those are the seven key issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Each  of  these  goals  has  an  inter-dependent  set  of  activities  and  a  10-year  implementation 

plan which identifies co-ordinating agencies that will effectively carry out these activities through 

their respective mandates. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  implementation  plan  is  the  operational  backbone  of  NOP  and  will  be  the  proxy  for 

multiple  Government  agencies  to  coherently  implement  sustainable  ocean  actions  through  33 

outcomes and 86 indicators allocated across key implementation Government agencies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Given that 20 percent of the Fijian population live within one kilometre of the coastline and 

76  percent  within  five  kilometres  not  recognising  the  intrinsic  connection  Fijians  have  with  their 

marine biosphere, in doing so, it places consistent community engagement and collaboration at the 

heart of this implementation plan.  This is exemplified by the establishment of the annual Talanoa 

Dialogue on oceans, which will be a forum to discuss matters of importance in the ocean sector and 

provide accountability to the public on progress to operationalize NOP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two flagship outcomes of NOP are to declare 30 percent of Fiji’s EEZ 

as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), with 100 percent sustainable management of our EEZ by 2030.  

These targets are consistent with Fiji’s global commitment, such as SDG 14 - Life below water, and 

the 30by30 Initiative led by the Government of the United Kingdom. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NOP has a government structure.  In recognising the complexities of our 

ocean sector and underscoring the importance of a whole of government approach to achieve Fiji’s 

blue  economy  ambitions,  NOP  creates  a  robust  governance  and  institutional  arrangement  that 

brings together existing national committees working across the seven strategic goals.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The NOP will be overseen by the National Ocean Policy Steering Committee made up of 14 

Permanent Secretaries.  The Steering Committee will also include senior technical representatives 

of  selected  agencies,  including  non-government  organisations  from  the  private  sector,  academia 

and civil society, as needed with an observer status. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Existing  national  committees  that  address  marine-related  activities  will  be  requested  to 

deliver specific outputs and updates to the steering committee in order to facilitate the delivery of 

the  activities  set  out  in  the  10-year  implementation  plan.    The  implementation  plan  will  be 

monitored  and  evaluated  through  an  annual  progress  report,  and  a  five-year  review  report  to  be 

developed by the Ministry of Economy, on behalf of the Steering Committee, in its capacity as the 

Steering Committee Secretariat and custodian of NOP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s NOP will be enshrined into law also through the upcoming Climate 

Change  Bill,  as  we  merge  the  ocean  climate  nexus,  and  create  an  enabling  environment  to  boost 

ocean health and curb the growing impact of climate change on our fragile marine biosphere.   In 

particular,  Part  13  of  the  upcoming  Climate  Change  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Oceans  and  Climate, 

emphasises the need to protect Fiji’s existing maritime boundaries and marine resources, including 

blue  carbon  stocks,  such  as  mangroves  and  seagrass  meadows.    This  section  creates  the  legal 

mandate  for  Fiji  to  designate  30  percent  of  its  EEZ  as  MPAs  by  2030  and  achieve  100  percent 

sustainable management of our EEZ, as we had mentioned earlier on.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  economic  standstill  that  has 

followed in its wake, makes the need for sustainable economic management even more clear.  Fiji’s 

ocean health simply cannot be compromised.  For the preservation of our economy, our livelihoods 

and our culture and heritage, we must protect this vitality and the bounty it provides. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look ahead in kick-starting the 2021  UN Decade of Ocean Science, 

Fiji’s new national initiatives, such as the ban of single use plastic bags,  our 10-Year Moratorium 

on Seabed Mining and the recent ban on polystyrene or Styrofoam, are more significant steps in the 

right direction to achieving a blue recovery. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  this  respect  also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  currently  talking  to  the  UK  Government  in 

furthering  talks  regarding  issuance  of  blue  bonds.    I  would  like  to  just  hold  up  this  particular 

Oceans Policy, it will be available on the website and I urge all Honourable Members of Parliament 

to, please, go and read this.  You can have an input, as you know that we will be having widespread 

consultations,  as  I  have  just  highlighted,  on  a  yearly  basis  and  this  is  an  effort  that  requires  a 

national approach to preserve this much valuable asset of ours.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General for his Ministerial Statement.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I now call upon the Honourable Rasova to speak in reply.  You have the floor, Sir.
