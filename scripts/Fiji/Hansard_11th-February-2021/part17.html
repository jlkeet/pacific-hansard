<h3>HON. R.S. AKBAR.-</h3>
<p><span>Then there are calls from people for the Minister of Education, ‘we have a complaint,’ the 

Ministry nor the Government interferes with the internal governance issues with the USP.  We do 

not  deal  with  what  the  VC  is  doing  we  do  not  dictate  what  the  PC  is  going  to  do  or  whom  they 

appoint  and  whom  they  terminate.    All  we  want  is  whoever  is  in  that  position  to  practice  good 

governance.  That has been always our stand.

<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>If  I  can  inform  the  House  for  the  last  Special  Council  Meeting  we  had,  we  said  that, 

whatever the Council decides, it has to be within the ambits of the statutes.  The Council also has 

processes to follow, whether they want to give Professor Ahluwalia a new contract, whether they 

want to give him an amended contract or whether they want him to be in Samoa, Tonga or Nauru, it 

has to be within the statutes of the USP Council.  So that is the fact, Honourable Members. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Here we are going about accusing the Fijian Government or accusing the representatives of 

the Fijian Government of doing things which is not even within our powers.  If you read the BDO 

Report, I do not know what reports  you are reading.  Honourable Leawere  said, “Make the BDO 

Report known,” Honourable Tuisawau says, ‘He is quoting from the BDO report.’  It is already on 

line,  it  was  leaked  the  very  day  the  Council  had  it,  even  when  the  Council  told  its  members  this 

report is not to be released, but it was leaked so what is there to hide.  Whatever you are quoting is 

from the BDO Report and it is a national report, there is nothing to hide. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to that.   A lot of these countries who are trying to say that 

the  University  should  be  shifted  to  Samoa,  we  must  not  forget,  Solomon  Islands  has  its  own 

university, Samoa has its own University, we have our own University but  I have never seen the 

Honourable Members on the other side talk with the same passion for the Fiji National University, 

never.    And  here  we  are  talking  about  regionalism.    Yes,  we  want  our  University  because  our 

students benefit from that, whether it is USP, whether it is FNU or whether it is the University of 

Fiji, we want good governance.  Whoever is appointed and whoever is terminated, the process has 

to be followed, that is all we are asking for.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Two days ago, I was asked about a complaint that was received regarding the appointment 

of a new person at USP. I said, “Look as a Minister, I have no say in that, if you have complaints 

about someone’s appointment go to the PC.”  The USP has its own grievance process mechanism, 

so  to  come  here  and  say  that  the  Fijian  Government  is  usurping  the  powers  of  the  University 

Council is such a rubbish.  It is not a right place to say it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  am  not  here  protected  by  the  parliamentary  privileges,  but  people  let  us  talk  about  the 

truth, and that is the truth about the USP Council.  So should that the Council on Tuesday, we are 

meeting again, say this is going to happen: Professor Ahluwalia will be given a new contract, but it 

has to be with the concurrence of the Council and followed the process.  If it is alright to give well 

that  is  the  Council’s  decision.    We  need  to  know  how  the  Council  operates.    It  operates  on  a 

different platform with its own rules and sets of regulation that guides our work.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  issue  that  caught  my  attention  was,  accommodation  for  USP 

students.  It is not only accommodation for USP students, our FNU students always struggle to find 

accommodation here so the recommendation is for the University to work ways where the students 

could  be  provided  with  a  reasonable  accommodation,  and  of  course,  you  and  I  both  know  that 

accommodation in Suva is very expensive.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The need for more academic staff,  I think this is 2021, the Report is 2017, a lot of things 

have happened, a lot of progress must have been made that will be when we see the Report being 

tabled for the coming 2019 and 2020. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that, I take my seat and thank you very much. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister,  Honourable  Attorney-General,  you 

</span></p>
<p><span>have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>583 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  for  her 

comments.  I just wanted to very quickly highlight a few things and one aspect that the Honourable 

Minister  highlighted  which  is  very  important  is  student  accommodation.    Unfortunately,  none  of 

the Honourable Members from the other side actually spoke about student accommodation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think SODELPA is saying that they will make everything free right up to university.  They 

did not talk about university accommodation and that is one of the greatest prohibition in respect to 

allowing students to travel to universities, of course, now with digital access but nonetheless, face-

to-face education is critically important.  There has been some talks with FNU to be able to engage 

the private sector to provide university accommodation.  Honourable Professor Prasad and others 

who obviously have properties around USP know that providing student accommodation can be an 

extremely lucrative business. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is  that,  there was  some analogy drawn  between 

the  Pacific  Island’s  Forum’s  (PIF)  withdrawal  at  USP  and  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  has  addressed  that.  

Obviously, we have got nothing to do with it.  I do not know how many Honourable Members from 

the  other  side  actually  bothered  to  look  at  the  USP  Charter.    This  was  actually  set  up  during  the 

British days, towards the end of our Colonial era.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if  you look  at  the  composition  of the Council, it still remains the same.  

The  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  will  tell  you  that  at  one 

point in time, there was some talk about reviewing the membership of the Council right from those 

days  in  1969  when  it  was  formed.    We  have  the  one  person  appointed  as  Pro-Chancellor,  Vice-

Chancellor,  Deputy  Vice-Chancellor,  one  person  will  be  appointed  by  the  Government  of  the 

Commonwealth of Australia, one from  the British Solomon Islands, one from the Government of 

Cook  Islands  and  five  persons  to  be  appointed  by  the  Government  of  Fiji,  one  person  will  be 

appointed by the Government of Gilbert  and Ellice Islands, of course, this is Kiribati and Tuvalu 

now, Nauru, the British Resident Commissioner in New Hebrides, of course, that is now Vanuatu – 

all    these  things,  of  course,  would  change;  one  person  appointed  by  the  Government  of  New 

Zealand, but the composition still remains the same, notwithstanding the fact, as you find in most 

types  of  organisations  where  the  countries  that  actually  give  very  large  contributions  have  some 

form of say or a much more significant say because of the contributions they make. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  Fiji’s  case,  of  course,  we  are  the  largest  contributor,  anywhere  between  $32  million  to 

$36 million, we give as a grant.  The next highest grant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is Solomon Islands at $2 

million.  So a difference of about $34 million between the grants that we give and the grant that the 

next largest country gives on the Council at USP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is that, these are the hard core changes in the 21st 

century that have not been taken into account.  Student population at the University is comprised as 

follows: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Fiji 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Solomon Islands 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Vanuatu 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Kiribati 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Tonga  

</span></p>
<p><span>- 

- 

</span><span>- 

</span><span>- 

- 

</span></p>
<p><span>55 percent; 

19 percent; 

</span><span>8 percent; 

</span><span>6 percent; and 

5 percent. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The others are quite minimal, Samoa and all the others.  A lot of the Samoans go to New Zealand 

</span><span>because of their relationship, they have formed a colony of New Zealand. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  to  very  quickly  highlight  and  just  to  add  to  what  the  Honourable 

Minister for Education has highlighted.  Someone said that I had sneaked my way into the Council.  

The Fijian Government has five positions in the Council and they can send whoever they like.  We 

have had money issues and the Permanent Secretary for Economy goes and sometimes I go.  The 

Honourable  Minister  for  Education  goes  and  her  Permanent  Secretary  goes.    We  have  appointed 

other  people  on  the  Council  that  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  recommends.    We  have 

Fay Yee and Mahmood Khan on the Council, so there are five members.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On  Friday  the  other  day,  when  the  Permanent  Secretary  (PS)  for  Education  and  I  had  to 

leave, there was talk that we had fled the meeting apparently because we had to go to a PS meeting, 

we were replaced by someone from the Ministry of Education, the Assistant Minister and someone 

from  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-General,  so  there  is  nothing  untoward  about  it.  It  is  all  very 

conspiratorial type of theories that are coming out.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is that, the USP Council, at the moment, is deeply 

divided, there is no doubt about that, in the manner in which the University should progress. The 

USP Council is deeply divided in the way forward and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the deportation of 

the former Vice-Chancellor, it is quite clearly stated in his contract that should his work permit be 

cancelled or no longer be in place, the contract automatically comes to an end.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  discussion  on  Friday,  unfortunately  for  five  hours,  went  on  whether  the  contract  was 

still  in  place  because  Nauru  wanted  to  amend  the  contract.    So  our  argument  was,  “You  cannot 

amend  a  contract  that  has  already  been  terminated.”  You  can  only  amend  something  that  is  in 

existence.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The USP’s lawyers are Munro Leys and they gave a legal opinion that said that 95 percent 

they thought the contract was terminated because of the revocation of the work permit. That was 

the  position.  All  we  argued  on  Friday,  because  some  members  wanted  him  to  be  immediately 

brought  back,  all  we  said  was  that  there  are  various  standard  operating  procedures,  the  various 

regulations that should be followed.   We  actually,  as  Council  members  representing  Fiji,  do  not 

want to prejudice who was going to be appointed the Vice-Chancellor. We simply said, “Follow the 

process. Contract is terminated.  You want to appoint a new Vice-Chancellor, follow the process. 

Advertise  whatever  you  need  to  do  as  stated  in  the  various  procedures.”  The  Council  has  a 

committee that they can appoint and they may recommend to short circuit the process.  It is up to 

them, as long as everything is above board.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In respect of the University moving to somewhere else, obviously the statute here is in Fiji.  

But we note that Samoa has in place a USP Act of 1977. That is probably because they have got 

one  of  the  Campuses  and  I  understand  Honourable  Professor  Prasad  and  Honourable  Dr.  Reddy 

may have been the students over there.  That is why they are so close to each other as they spent 

time together in Samoa.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why they probably have it, but the creation of the Charter itself is 

under Fijian law and there are various parameters to that, that needs to be adhered to.  Bulk of the 

assets of the University of the South Pacific is at Laucala Bay Campus.  A number of the assets of 

the  Laucala  Bay  Campus  have  been  put  up  because  of  the  bilateral  relationships  that  the  Fijian 

Government  has  had  with  other  countries  and  have  asked  them  to  put  up  various  infrastructure 

within the Campus too. That is the reality on the ground. That is the legal position, and that is what 

we have been doing.

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>585 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can be here for the next two hours to tell you exactly what the saga has 

been. Now, I was berated for saying that there is no saga. I was asked in the context, again, about 

the deportation and  I said that as a result  of the deportation, there is  no saga.  There is  no crisis.  

That has a life of its own.  But the actual saga and crisis at USP is actually about good governance.  

That is why when Honourable Tabuya, on the other day, said that they were wearing green which is 

about good governance, I said, “Well great, because there are governance issues.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee is not appointed by me or the Minister 

for  Education  or  by  Fiji,  he  was  actually  appointed  by  the  Council.    Mahmood  Khan  has  been 

practicing in New Zealand for nearly 40 years.  He is a former Fijian citizen.  He has got back his 

citizenship and based on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they appointed him the  Chairperson  of the Audit 

and  Risk  Committee,  very  simple,  and  he  worked  together  with  the  lady  from  Tonga,  whom  I 

forgot her name.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reality  of  the  matter  is  that,  the  Pro-Chancellor,  Mr.  Winston 

Thompson,  has  raised  a  number  of  issues  that  have  been  not  congruous  with  the  practices  of  the 

past  in  the way the  governance structure has been in  place  and the  relationship between the Pro-

Chancellor  and  the  Vice-Chancellor.    As  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  highlighted,  the 

BDO Report was proceeded by a report that was done by Professor Ahluwalia himself. And one of 

the protagonists that the BDO actually highlighted, who had a sum of about $1.4 million, one of the 

academics  that  Honourable  Ro  Tuisawau  failed  to  mention,  when  BDO  actually  asked  Professor 

Ahluwalia why was not he included in that, he said, “he helped me write the report.” I was there at 

the Council Meeting when he said that - Arvin Patel.  He said, “He helped me write the report.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad  knows  him  very  well.  This  is  to  do  with  consultancy  fees.  

Honourable Professor Prasad used to do consultancy too and the share of fees with the Academic, 

why should we pay it to the University.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Chorus of interjections) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reason  why  the  USP  Council  was 

concerned about the release of the Report initially was because Professor Ahluwalia’s report was 

written and accusations were made without the supposedly accused persons being given a right of 

reply.  That is natural justice.  If we are going to accuse someone by saying, “you were paid this 

much  consultancy  fees  of  $40,000”,  that  person  should  be  given  the  right  to  explain;  very  basic.  

They were never done.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when that report was done and the BDO Report came out and this is the 

report that was in fact written in respect of the BDO Report. The BDO Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

contrary  to  the  hype  created    by  the  VCP,  no  fraud  was  discovered  and  most  of  the  supposed 

mismanagement was within  their delegated powers of the then Professor Chandra.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  BDO  recommended  that  the  policies  and  procedures  around  finance  and  human 

resources management must be updated and strengthened. The Council resolved to appoint a three-

Minister Committee which the Honourable Minister for Education alluded to, to in turn appoint a 

three-member Commission.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The three-member Committee was the former Prime Minister of Cook Islands, now the new 

incoming  Secretary-General  of  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum;  the  former  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of 

Samoa, who has resigned since then; and myself.  And then we appointed a Commission and the 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Commission  of  late,  has  handed  down  their  report  and  they  have  identified  gaps  as  to  how  they 

could be addressed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is in relation to the BDO Report which everyone is going on about it.  

Honourable Tuisawau knows full well, he was talking about Hasmukh Lal in respect of the matters 

that he raised. This is the CEO of Pacific TAFE. I understand Honourable Tuisawau applied for a 

job there, probably he was not shortlisted, and maybe that is why he is a bit concerned about that.  

He knows full well also that the matter is before the courts.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  make  one  point;  I  am  personally  aggrieved  by  the  manner  in 

which, without any proprietary, the name of Winston Thompson has been berated in  all of these. 

He was a former Ambassador of Fiji, he was the Chair of the University Grants Committee from 

2006 to 2015.  Subsequently, the Council unanimously appointed him twice as the Pro-Chancellor 

of USP.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  remember  when  all  of  the  shenanigans  took  place  when  this  BDO  Report  came  out,  et 

cetera, we were in the Nadi Council Meeting, and the way that the former Vice-Chancellor carried 

on, Winston Thompson said to me, “I want to resign because I have never seen such behaviour.  I 

want  to  resign.”  I asked  him and said, “Please, stay on board because there is  no one else.”  We 

were more concerned about the University in terms of the funding we were giving in excess of $30 

million.  He was the only gentleman at that point in time, whom we could actually put some trust in 

because he knew the system. He was also the Chairman of the Grants Committee, which is made up 

of all the different countries that contribute towards the University’s funding. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  subsequently  also,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee 

raised  with  the  Council  a  number  of  anomalies  that  were  taking  place  under  Vice-Chancellor 

Ahluwalia.    Various  appointments  were  taking  place,  not  adhering  to  the  requirements  and 

regulations. These are individuals’ names, Sir, which I am not going to read out. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Despite  conflicts  of  interest,  again,  people  who  did  not  meet  the  requirements  were 

appointed,  contracts  were  renewed.    People  who  were  appointed  to  new  positions  which  is  for  a 

three-year contract should have been advertised externally, meaning outside the University, but it 

was only advertised internally and people were appointed. The basic MQRs were not met.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  no  direct  appointments  are  allowed  for  non-academic  staff,  however, 

DHR ignored this and contravened this process and has appointed staff.  It has nothing to do with 

Vice-Chancellor Ahluwalia but the DHR.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Policy followed by Dean to select and recommend a candidate to fill a vacancy of Head of 

</span></p>
<p><span>School, Vice-Chancellor Ahluwalia refused to follow the process. The list goes on.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Our position, Mr. Speaker, was that the Pro- Chancellor and the Chairperson of the Audit 

and Risk Committee have raised these issues.  All we simply said, “Please, like we appointed BDO, 

appoint an independent group of persons or a company or an organisation or professional outfit, to 

look at issues raised by the Audit and Risk Committee Chairperson.”  It is a very simple request. 

This happens all the time. The Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee reports directly to the 

Board.    If  you  are  in  a  company,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  will  report 

directly to the Managing Director because of the role that they play. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because there is a lot of cajoling going on, refused to do that.  

That  is  all  we  wanted,  independent  group  appointed.    Please,  whatever  the  findings  is,  we  will 

follow it.  We said, “Unless and until this is done, we are not going to give the grant.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>587 

</span></p>
<p><span>Then,  of  course,  some  of  the  members,  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  will 

highlight,  that  Nauru,  Tonga  and  Samoa  said,  “We  will  have  a  bilateral  meeting  with  Fiji  on  the 

side to discuss this.” We said, “We are quite open, please let us do that.”  To-date, they have not 

done  it.    There  are  some  very  unhealthy  relationships  between  people  on  the  Council  and  the 

former Vice-Chancellor - very unhealthy relationships.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the position.  The position pertaining to the governance structures 

at USP has got nothing in law to do with him and his wife’s deportation.    They are two separate 

matters altogether.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Department of Immigration has already issued a statement on that and the photos are 

actually quite evident of what happened.  They, in fact, assisted with the packing, et cetera.  We did 

not  say  that,  Honourable  Tuisawau.  They  were  checked  in,  et  cetera.  They  went  into  the  VIP 

Lounge.  This is not someone being scuttled away in the middle of the night, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and 

that has got nothing to do with this Report in 2017.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Annual Report 2017 is all about governance, financial accountability and what we are 

saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  that, that is precisely what  we want.   We are not  saying, “Take USP 

away as you have been trying to portray.” All we are simply saying is that wherever the University 

is, whatever form it takes, it must have good governance structures in place.  Otherwise, there will 

be a natural death to it.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General. Last speaker before the Right 

</span></p>
<p><span>of Reply.  Honourable Salote Radrodro, you have the floor. You did ask. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Yes, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I did not forget you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  agree  with  our 

recommendations.  I  belong  to  that  Committee  but  upon  hearing  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Education’s  comments,  I  would  like  to  make  a  request  to  the  Honourable  Minister.  If,  in  your 

position as a Member of the Council ensure that the BDO Report come as part of the next Annual 

Report for the University of the South Pacific and be presented together to Parliament so that the 

BDO Report can go to the Committee and then be scrutinised together with the Annual Report of 

the University of the South Pacific.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In that way, Mr. Speaker, we will be able to really know the content in our official capacity 

as  Members  of  Parliament  and  in  our  official  role  as  member  of  the  Committee  to  scrutinise  the 

BDO  Report,  together  with  the  Annual  Report  of  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  in  the 

upcoming one.  That means that it will be the 2018 Annual Report and if the Honourable Minister 

for Education could make that request to the USP Council to include the BDO Report with the next 

upcoming Annual Report of USP so that it could go to the Committee and we can scrutinise them 

together and make our recommendations to Parliament in our report.   

</span></p>
