<h3>CYBERCRIME BILL 2020</h3>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament 

on Tuesday, 26th May, 2020, I move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That  the  Cybercrime  Bill  2020  (Bill  No.  11/2020)  be  debated,  voted  upon  and  be 

</span></p>
<p><span>passed today.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  remind  Honourable  Members  that  the  debate  is  limited  to  one  hour 

pursuant to the resolution of Parliament. I now call upon the Honourable Attorney-General to speak 

to his motion. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, by way of introduction, the Cybercrime 

Bill 2020 (Bill No. 11 of 2020) was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, 26th May, 2020 and referred 

to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for review under Standing Order 51.  

</span></p>
<p><span>On Thursday, 30th July, 2020 the Standing Committee requested for an extension of time to 

undertake further consultations of the Bill.   We note the recommendations made by the Standing 

Committee’s  Report  amongst  other  things,  the  need  to  have  a  harmonised  mechanism  to  address 

cyber-related issues and this is an opportunity for Fiji to have legislations dedicated to cybercrime 

and related matters.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  essentially  seeks  to  give  effect  to  the  Budapest  Convention  by 

providing a comprehensive and coherent framework on cybercrime and electronic evidence.  The 

Budapest  Convention  is  the  only  binding  international  instrument  that  deals  with  the  issue  of 

cybercrime  and  serves  as  a  framework  for  international  co-operation  between  member  States  to 

access and share information on a wider or global platform.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Budapest  Convention  essentially  requires  the  harmonisation  of  domestic  criminal 

substantive law elements of offences and related provisions in the area of cybercrime, provides for 

domestic  criminal  procedural  law  powers  for  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  cybercrime 

offences  or  computer-related  offences  and  the  setting  up  of  a  fast  and  effective  regime  of 

international cooperation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted in the introduction of this Bill that we also had the benefit 

of the Council of Europe that had, in the days when we could travel, a number of experts including 

some jurors who have actually travelled down to Fiji at that point in time, had a lot of engagement 

in  particular  with  our  law  enforcement  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of 

  Defence, 

Communications,  Office  of  the  DPP  and  various  organisations  like  Vodafone,  the  commercial-

based organisations, Women in Business, BCom IT Solutions, et cetera, and members of the public 

were also invited to give their comments on it.

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>By  coming  on  board  with  this  particular  Budapest  Convention,  Sir,  we  will  also  be  be 

signalling to the rest of the world that it is a lot safer to do business in Fiji itself.  Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, those are my introductory remarks.    

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-    Honourable  Members,  I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable  Mosese 

</span></p>
<p><span>Bulitavu. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a few comments to the motion 

that  is  before  the  House.    I  am  thankful  that  the  Committee  has  completed  this  work  and  has 

reported  back  to  Parliament.  I  thank  Parliament,  Sir,  for  allowing  the  Committee  to  make  public 

consultations  around  the  country  and  also  with  the  various  stakeholders  that  will  be  playing  an 

important role in the Cybercrime Bill when it becomes an Act.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Attorney-General  has  outlined  the  genesis  of  it  through  the  Budapest 

Convention  and  how  we  are  trying  to  domesticate  our  signing  of  that  Convention  and  putting  in 

place  the  regulatory  framework  to  meet  the  current  needs  of  the  sophisticated  world  we  are  in, 

especially in the criminal syndicate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Crime now committed in the internet and use of ICT is getting bigger and also we need to 

broaden our knowledge in terms of capturing this dark web that is there.  Those who will try to use 

the  internet  and  also  other  electronic  means  that  could  threaten  our  national  security,  not  only  in 

terms  of  cyber  terrorism  but  also  other  things  where  people  hide  their  identity  in  their  criminal 

world electronically that could cause a threat to our people. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This Bill, as I have said, it was unanimously agreed through the Committee’s consensus that 

it is now good for us Fiji, given that we are now in a modern era and also need to be in par with our 

measures in place to beef our security in terms of trying to counter things that are coming into our 

country.  Those were some of the major things.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Bill also clearly defines “cybercrime” and also the authorised body that will be looking 

after the Bill when it becomes an Act and also to fall into line with the Fiji Police High-Tech Crime 

Center that is already there and the Cybercrime Unit within the Fiji Police Force which is already in 

place and they are currently doing works in terms of cybercrime.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It  will  also  give  our  investigators  now  at  the  Criminal  Investigation  Department  (CID) 

headquarters a time for them to be qualified with the various standards that will be there for them to 

reach  so  our  capacity  too  within  the  Fiji  Police  Force  will  be  enriched,  especially  in  those 

experiences that will help our nation and also able to contain the various threats that will come in 

especially in the cyber world that we also face.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Just on the other day we were debating on the various forms of child pornography and other 

sophisticated things that are happening now with our children now connected to internet, but I think 

this is the right time to have this kind of measures in place so that we are able to hit the problem at 

the button and also sharpen our responses when we are encountered with such danger.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That is my view, Sir, and also the view of the Committee.  I thank the Honourable Members 

of  the  Committee,  the  Honourable  Chairperson  who  is  away  in  India,  the  Honourable  Deputy 

Chairperson, Honourable Dr. Govind, Honourable Ro Matanitobua, the Committee Secretariat and 

the Drafters at the Solicitor-General’s Office, who were there with us receiving submissions from 

all  the  stakeholders,  including  the  Fiji  Law  Society.    Their  comments  and  recommendation  were 

sent  to  the  Drafters  and  they  had  responded,  which  saw  the  Bill  that  is  before  us  now  in  third 

reading which is best for us at this particular time.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Sir.

</span></p>
<p><span>Cybercrime Bill 2020 

</span></p>
<p><span>559 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Bulitavu  for  his  contribution  to  the  debate.    I 

</span></p>
<p><span>now give the floor to the Honourable Tikoduadua.  You have the floor Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  May I note, from the 

</span></p>
<p><span>outset, that we do not support the Cybercrime Bill 2020 and I will tell you the reason for that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Cybercrime  Bill  gives  the  State  snooping  powers  to  spy  on  citizens 

through  telecommunications  and  internet  service  providers.    Clause  23  of  the  current  Bill  gives 

power to a Police Officer, or any other authorised person, to record and collect real-time traffic data 

and  provide  only  the  traffic  data  to  the  authorised  person.    This  means  that  if  the  State  and  its 

agencies suspect any citizen of breaching provisions of this law or any other criminal law, it has the 

powers to spy on you for a period of up to six months.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Part  1(2)  of  the  Bill  defines  data  as  any  representation  of  facts,  information  or  concepts 

suitable for processing in a computer system, including a programme suitable to cause a computer 

system to perform a function or a series of functions.  Now, what this means, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is 

that any data, message, information,  computer application, voice or email,  is  real  time data.  The 

State,  through  its  agencies,  can  obtain  a  Court  Order  to  do  this.    Furthermore,  the  law  disallows 

unauthorised access to a computer system but exception by way of a defence is also made, in that, 

the State through a Court Order or any other law, take possession of a computer’s content. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Clause 24 empowers the Minister responsible for this Bill, who is the Honourable Attorney-

General,  to  determine  that  a  service  provider  must  implement  the  capability  to  allow  the 

interception.  Essentially, the Bill in its current form, allows the State and its agencies to breach a 

person’s privacy using this law, if he or she is affected of any unlawful activity.  This, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, can last up to six months.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Given  those  current  Acts  that  were  regressive  and  draconian  Decrees  have  not  been 

changed, despite pressure from both, the Opposition and the UN Human Rights Council, this Bill 

will further erode the rights of our citizens. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Bill  in  its  current  form,  is  obviously  a  cut-and-paste  job  with 

legislation  imported  from  other  countries  and  must  not  be  allowed  to  be  enacted  because  in  all 

likelihood, it may be used against those who are vocal in opposing the current Government.  We 

strongly  oppose  it  because  this  Government  does  not  believe  in  being  held  accountable  by 

Parliament and in the separation of powers, they want laws to be passed by Parliament but as the 

highest court on the land, we should not question how the laws are enforced.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst still on draconian laws, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the beliefs by the FijiFirst Government 

that it is not accountable to Parliament and can enforce laws passed by us as it sees fit, we want the 

Honourable  Attorney-General  to  clarify  whether  or  not  Government  was  looking  at  drafting  a 

legislation known as the National Legislation Bill in 2020.  They started with such a draft last year 

and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is frightening to say the least, to comprehend the curtailment of freedom, if 

it were to be enacted together with the Cybercrime Bill 2020.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the draft Bill, we cited that a police officer or the registration 

officer can enter and search any property, including forcing and keeping open doors and windows 

of homes at any time if it suspects a citizen of breaching the provisions of the Bill.  No person can 

use a rank, title or word in his or her name, which means if your current name contains Ratu or Adi, 

you cannot use it in the national identity card.

</span></p>
<p><span>Cybercrime Bill 2020 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>A citizen will be required to provide fingerprints or handprints, facial identity and eye ID 

for  this  purpose.    All  Government  statutory  organisations  will  be  linked  and  can  spy  on  your 

identity.    Ironically,  the  Ministry  of  Health  that  requires  a  patient  number  is  not  included  but 

organisations, such as the Elections Office, were listed in the draft. 

</span></p>
<p><span>All citizens are compelled to register.  There are gaol terms of five and ten years and fines 

of  $5,000,  $10,000  and  $100,000  for  corporate  companies.    No  public  official  or  organisation  is 

liable  for  any  type  of  prosecution  or  legal  action  for  their  commissions  and  failures  that  cause 

losses or damage to citizens. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in simple terms, Government will have all your personal and private data, 

including  all  that  is  in  anyone’s  home,  as  citizens  will  be  required  to  submit  returns  at  whatever 

time the Government requires of their home or property.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  inconceivable  that  such  a  Bill  was  even  being  drafted.    It  did  not 

appear  fake  at  all,  and  we  would  like  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  to  guarantee  in  this 

Parliament that such a draconian piece of legislation will never come before us, because combined 

with  the  Cybercrime  Bill,  it  would  mean  the  brutal  end  to  what  we  understand  as  fundamental 

rights  and  freedoms  that  this  Government  brags  about  as  being  fully  protected  under  the  2013 

Constitution.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Tikoduadua for his contribution to the debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  upon  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  to  speak  on  his 

</span></p>
<p><span>Right of Reply.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  somewhat  baffled  at  Honourable 

Tikoduadua’s (it can only be described as) ramblings.  He needs to, firstly, understand that any law 

that is implemented in Fiji is subject to the 2013 Constitution and any right that is provided for in 

the Constitution.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  have  to  add  this,  I  was  at  the  Law  Society  Convention  and  all  of  them  got  it  all  wrong 

because  when  they  talked  about  the  limitation  of  rights,  they  did  not  have  the  basic  approach  to 

look  at  Section  7  of  the  2013  Constitution,  in  interpreting.    They  got  it  wrong,  even  their  friend 

from USA.  It says, and I quote from Section 7: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“In  addition  to  complying  with  Section  3,  when  interpreting  and  applying  this 

</span></p>
<p><span>Chapter, a court, tribunal or other authority – 

</span></p>
<p><span>(a)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(b)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>must promote the values that underlie a democratic society based on human dignity, 

equality and freedom; and  

may, if relevant, consider international law, applicable to the protection of the rights and 

freedoms in this Chapter.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>Very  basic,  very  fundamental,  and  what  it  essentially  says  is  that,  any  law  contrary  to  that, 

obviously will be deemed to be unconstitutional and, therefore, not applicable. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Tikoduadua  created  this,  sort  of,  very  police-state  approach  as  a  result  of  the 

Cybercrime  Bill.    What  he  actually  failed  to  mention,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  in  getting  all  that 

type of evidence, you actually need to go to a court of law and you need to get a warrant from the 

judge or the magistrate.  For example, at the moment, even if you go to get a phone recording, you 

will  still  need  to  go  to  the  Judiciary  to  get  a  warrant  to  obtain  that  evidence.    It  does  not  give 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 63</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Cybercrime Bill 2020 

</span></p>
<p><span>561 

</span></p>
<p><span>anyone or individual the ability to simply go and order a person to go and get the recording.  Very 

basic, Honourable Tikoduadua!  You worked at the Ministry of Justice, you know should this. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  really  cannot  fathom  why  he  and  his  leader  cannot  understand  the 

separation of powers.  They simply are not getting the separation of powers.  Of course, this is the 

supreme law-making body in the country.  A supreme law-making body means, the supreme law-

making body makes the law, the Executive implements the law, the Judiciary interprets or applies 

the law.  That is why you have separation of powers.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We had, I think, a couple of years back, under the particular law where I think there was a 

particular  Member  of  Parliament  who  wanted  this  Parliament  to  give  a  coral  licence  to  someone 

when the Ministry of Environment had actually rejected that person’s application to go and extract 

wild coral, not grown coral.  The Member of Parliament wanted to bring that motion in Parliament 

to say, “Tell the Ministry of Environment to give the coral licence.”  You cannot do that because 

the  law  is  applied  by  the  Executive,  they  make  decisions.    I  cannot  understand  why  they  cannot 

grasp  that  particular  basic  concept  of  separation  of  powers.    They  are  really  clutching  at  straws, 

nothing concrete to contribute. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reality  of  the  matter  is  that,  this  Bill  will,  in  fact,  bring  us  into 

alignment  with  international  practice.    The  European  Union  has  supported  us  with  that.  

Honourable Tikoduadua is saying that the Europeans are in compliant with the international norms 

and principles.  Again, he is wrong.  The European Court actually deals with matters in relation to 

these  laws.    They  allow  these  laws  to  be  practised  through  the  Budapest  Convention.    It  is  a 

European  Union  Convention,  that  is  why  it  is  called  the  Budapest  Convention.    As  the  name 

suggests, it was decided at Budapest, if you want to get basic about it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Tikoduadua  went  on  about  the  national  ID  card,  I  do  not  know  what  he  was 

going  on  about,  nothing  worth  responding  to.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Honourable 

Bulitavu and I thank all the other Members of the Committee who actually recommended that this 

Parliament  approves  this  Bill  because  it  will  help  modernise  our  laws  and  give,  not  just  investor 

confidence  to  those  coming  to  Fiji,  but  domestic  investor  confidence  and  also  our  own  citizens.  

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General for his Right of Reply. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.

<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  for  the  purposes  of  complying  with  Standing 

</span></p>
<p><span>Orders with respect to sitting times, I will allow a suspension motion to be moved.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move his motion. You have
