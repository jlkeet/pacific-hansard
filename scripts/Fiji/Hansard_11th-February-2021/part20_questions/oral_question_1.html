<p>Provision of Formal Leases - Sakoca Informal Settlement 

(Question No. 29/2021)</p>
<p>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development  inform  Parliament  why  formal  leases  for  the  informal  settlement  of  Sakoca 

have not been provided to residents, despite earlier promises?</p>
<p>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR  (Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development).-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  also  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  her 

question.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  informal  settlement  upgrade  is  one  of  the  key  programme 

implemented by the Ministry of Housing, to improve the quality of life of Fijians living in informal 

settlements around the country.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  prior  to  Government  intervention,  two  land  developers  were  given 

development lease separately by Itltb, to develop the land at Sakoca.  Unfortunately, they failed to 

complete  the  subdivision  and  many  Fijians  lost  substantial  amount  of  money  running  into 

thousands of dollars.  Both development leases were later terminated and the Government decided 

to  step  in  and  take  over  the  responsibility  to  develop  Sakoca.    In  consultation  with  iTLTB,  the 

Ministry acquired the development lease for Sakoca on 1st July, 2017, for 10 years.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  also  important  to  note  at  this  point  that  the  Ministry  acquired  the 

development lease for only one part of Sakoca, covering approximately 17 acres of land and not the 

other part of Sakoca.  So, we can say that Sakoca is in two parts, and the reason why we did not 

acquire the other part of Sakoca is simply because we need 60 percent of landowners to agree.  The 

development lease that the Ministry has, they have proceeded with the development work.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker Sir, the informal settlement upgrade project goes through several stages, such 

as planning, preliminary design, construction and finally, the issuance of 99 year leases, unlike in 

the  past  where  Government  was  only  focusing  on  State  land  and  there  were  very  basic  upgrade 

works  conducted.</p>
<p>Wood & Jepsen Consultants was appointed as the consultant for the project in January 2018 

to design scheme and engineering plans and to manage the capital works.  I am pleased to inform 

the House that Sakoca has been identified as one of the four projects to commence capital works 

during  this  financial  year,  and  I  have  been  meeting  the  residents  of  Sakoca  several  times  and 

discussing  this  particular  project,  sharing  with  them  where  we  have  reached  and  even  consulting 

them on several other matters.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Scheme Plan was approved by the Department of Town and Country 

Planning in April 2020.  The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) consultation for the project 

was held in Sakoca in December 2020, and the Engineering Plan for the project was lodged with 

Town  and  Country  Planning  for  approval  in  January  this  year.    The  consultant  is  currently 

preparing  the  documents  for  tendering  for  capital  works.    Once  a  suitable  contractor  is  selected 

through the tender process, the capital works will commence on site.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  often,  we  are  not  able  to  achieve  the  result  very  quickly  and  the  reason 

being, that residents are living in that area.  It is basically an in-situ development and when it is in-

situ  development,  we  try  to  bring  in  minimum  disruption  to  the  sitting  tenants.    Even  when  the 

development goes ahead, we find many other issues within the settlement which is not in line with 

the scheme plan.  Often, within the settlement, we do find people extending their houses or building 

new houses which is not in line with the scheme plan, so this causes further delay sometimes.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe I have provided explanation to the Honourable Member on her 

question  and  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  commitment  made  by  this  Government  to  the  Fijian 

citizens will always be met.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-    I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    Honourable  Qereqeretabua,  your</p>
<p>supplementary question.</p>
<p>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    My  supplementary 

question  to  the  Honourable  Minister  is  about  the  promises  before  the  Elections.    Sakoca  was 

promised  this  before  the  2014  Elections,  before  the  2018  Elections  and  I  also  received  questions 

from people at the settlement in Navakai in Nadi about the very same issue about being promised 

this  before  the  Elections.    My  questions  is;  is  this  going  to  be  promised  again  before  the  next 

Elections?</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Member fails to understand that all 

these processes takes time, because you have to negotiate with the landowners.  Once they agree, 

then only we can step in to develop the area.  This is one of the problems that we are facing.</p>
<p>We  have  seen  that  there  are  a  number  of  informal  settlements.    When  this  informal 

settlement was created, it was actually between the settler and the landowners.  It is an arrangement 

between  them  but  later  on,  the  settlers  who  live  in  the  informal  settlement  started  looking  at  the 

Government and asked, “When are you going to develop the area?”  Now, our difficulty is that the 

land is owned by the landowners and only through their goodwill.  Once they agree, they give us 

the development lease, then only we can proceed with that and I have already given the assurance 

that in Sakoca, we are moving ahead with this development.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on to the second Oral Question for today.  I</p>
<p>call on the Honourable Sigarara to ask his question.</p>
