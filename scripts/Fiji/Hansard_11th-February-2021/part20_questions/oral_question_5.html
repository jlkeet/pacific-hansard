(Question No. 33/2021)</p>
<p>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Page 104</p>
<p>602</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development  update  Parliament  on  the  current  and  planned  market  stall  developments  in 

the Eastern and Central Divisions?</p>
<p>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR  (Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development).- Mr. Speaker, Sir, market infrastructure plays a key role in economic development 

in all the 13 Municipal Councils around Fiji.  The Ministry of Local Government continues to work 

with  Municipal  Councils  to  build  new  market  infrastructure  and  upgrade  or  extend  the  existing 

permanent markets.</p>
<p>In the Eastern and Central Divisions, there are a total of five Municipal Councils - one in 

the  Eastern  Division  and  four  in  the  Central  Division.    Levuka  Town  Council  is  in  the  Eastern 

Division  whereas  Lami  Town  Council,  Suva  City  Council,  Nasinu  Town  Council  and  Nausori 

Town  Council  are  in  the  Central  Division.    In  addition  to  these,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  two 

satellite towns - Navua and Korovou.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Central Division, Suva City Council has already progressed work 

on the redevelopment of markets at Flagstaff, Raiwaqa and Mead Road.  The redevelopment of the 

markets are currently in the preparatory phase.  The Suva City Council is finalising the contractor 

to start with the Flagstaff Market.  For the other two, that is, Mead Road and Raiwaqa, engineering 

drawings are being finalised before the contractors are assigned to commence work.  These markets 

will have a modern design and build for the future.  There will be proper parking facilities provided 

to the customers as they stop to buy from these vendors.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Nasinu  Town  Council  and  Nausori  Town  Council  are  working  on  the 

plans  to  expand  the  market  infrastructure  at  Laqere  Market  and  Nausori  Market.    Nasinu  Town 

Council has  started preparatory  work on the second phase of development  of the  Laqere Market.  

This  will include the extension of the market  with car parks  and other infrastructure to  boost the 

SME activity in that area.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  construction  of  a  new  Women’s  Accommodation  Centre  is  being 

developed by the Nausori Town Council and this will improve the lives  of rural  women vendors 

who sell at the Nausori Market.  The Centre will accommodate those who travel from rural areas to 

sell their produce, and we have found that women come as far as Rakiraki and Korovou to sell at 

the Nausori Market.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Accommodation  Centre  will  prevent  women  vendors  from  sleeping 

outside  the  market  in  Nausori  Town.    It  will  provide  security  to  the  women  vendors  and  their 

children.    The  Accommodation  Centre  will  enable  these  women  vendors  to  have  a  warm  bed  to 

sleep in with clean washroom and tearoom facilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is immensely grateful to the Fiji Corrections Service for their 

support in agreeing to convert a parcel of land behind RB Patel South Point to assist Nausori Town 

Council to  construct  a new Market  at  Nakasi.   The piece of land is  approximately 2  acres and is 

ideally situated along Adi Davila Road.  It is significant to note that the location of the market will 

complement commercial development around that area.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  as  we  speak, Nausori Town Council is  working with  their surveyor  and 

Ministry of Lands in getting the boundary confirmed.  The Nakasi Market will be constructed with 

modern  facilities  to  create  a  safe  and  clean  environment  for  vendors  to  operate  from.    At  the 

moment, while we are waiting to finalise all the plans for Nakasi Market, we are in the process of 

working on the extension of Veidogo Market to accommodate, at least, 40 more vendors, and that</p>

<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>603</p>
<p>would mean that immediately, we are providing a solution to those vendors who are operating from 

the Nakasi roadside.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  residents  and  vendors  of  Levuka,  the  Levuka  Town  Council  in 

collaboration  with  UN  Women,  is  working  on  the  construction  of  a  new  market  infrastructure  at 

Levuka  Town.    An  architect  has  been  engaged  as  the  Project  Manager  by  the  Levuka  Town 

Council.  The architect  has submitted the drawings to  the Council, which was  discussed with  the 

market  vendors  before  the  concept  drawing  was  endorsed.    The  architect  for  the  project  has  also 

consulted the relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Heritage, to ensure that the market 

drawings maintain the heritage identity.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new Levuka Market will be constructed at the existing site where the 

old  market  is  currently  located.    The  market  will  accommodate  all  the  market  vendors  who  are 

currently selling along the main road in town.  The market will provide an Accommodation Centre 

for rural women vendors from Gau, Batiki, Koro, Nairai and Moturiki, to have a place to stay when 

they come to sell their produce in Levuka Town.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  appreciative  of  the  UN  Women  Market  for  Change 

Programme  that  supports  the  initial  construction  phase  of  the  new  Levuka  Market  and  Women’s 

Accommodation in Nausori.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Qereqeretabua, you have</p>
<p>the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  just  wanted  to  ask  the 

Honourable  Minister  if  there  have  been  any  renovations  done  to  the  Lautoka  Women’s 

Accommodation at the Lautoka Market, since I was last there in October last year?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have that information right now, but I will</p>
<p>be able to provide that information to you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on to the next Oral Question, and I give the</p>
<p>floor to the Honourable Nand.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
