<p>Over-Swelling of Rivers and Drainage 

(Question No. 32/2021)</p>
<p>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Agriculture,  Waterways and Environment inform 

Parliament  on  the  types  of  works  the  Ministry  has  undertaken  in  respect  of  over-swelling 

rivers and drainage systems?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY  (Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment).-  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir,  I  will make  it short;  the three key  programmes that we have within the Ministry of 

Waterways with regards to drainage are drainage for flood protection, drainage to rural residential 

areas and  drainage for farmlands.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  regard  to  the  Drainage  and  Flood  Protection  Programme,  we</p>
<p>undertook eight programmes during this financial year, the:</p>
<p>Nakauvadra Desilting Programme; 

Vunivau River Bank Protection; 

Savu Village, Tailevu;</p>
<p>(1)(2)(3)(4)Wainibuabua/Wainadoi River Clearing; 

(5)Nadaro River Bank Protection; 

(6)Nadakuni River Bank Protection; 

(7)Distilling works adjacent to the Waidamu River; and  

(8)Drainage and Flood Mitigation Works at Nasivi River, Tavua.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these were the works that we undertook with regard to flood protection.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we had advertised at the beginning of last  year, in partnership with the 

private sector, to desilt a number of rivers.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is under the emergency desilting 

work  of  rivers,  creeks  and  waterways.    About  130  creeks  and  rivers  that  require  urgent  desilting 

were advertised.</p>
<p>In  this  Programme,  the  Ministry  of  Waterways  and  Environment  has  done  the  EIA  and  it 

has  worked  with  themataqalito  get  them  to  sign  fishing  rights  waiver.    We  have  engaged  a 

contractor  who  will  undertake  the  desilting  work  under  the  supervision  of  the  Ministry  of 

Waterways, pay the royalty to the Ministry of Lands, take the spoil, sell it and make money.</p>

<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>601</p>
<p>Last  week,  we  had  a  meeting  with  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Lands  and  the  Permanent 

Secretary of Lands as well as the Permanent Secretary for Waterways was there to sort out the finer 

details of it.  As we speak, the first 35 contracts will  probably be given out next week to engage 

these private sector operators to desilt as per the Environmental Management Plan provided by the 

Ministry of Waterways, and they will have to pay the royalty, take the spoil and they can sell it.  In 

this way, we will be able to clean up those 35.  We are looking at getting consent for fishing rights 

waiver and getting contractors to progressively clear the other 30 rivers, creeks and waterways that 

we have on our list. Hopefully by the end of this year or next year, we will be able deal with these 

130 and there are other rivers that require to be cleaned as well.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  second  programme  is  Drainage  for  Rural  Residential  where  we 

provide  drainage  support  for  villages,  residents  and  public  drains.    We  have  undertaken  180 

projects  covering  872  kilometres  of  drainage  work,  40  sites  in  the  Central  Division  totalling  186 

kilometres; 87 sites in the Western Division, totalling 302 kilometres; and 53 sites in the Northern 

Division, totalling 389 kilometres of drainage work.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were able to do these works successfully. We have got the drainage for 

farmland  that  we  were  able  to  do  since  2018  -  64  sites  in  the  Central  Division,  covering  369 

kilometres; 70 sites in the Northern Division, covering 648 kilometres; and 158 sites in the Western 

Division,  covering  489  kilometres.    These  are  public  drains  in  farms  and  agricultural  areas  to 

support the agriculture sector to grow and expand.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are basically cooling off now and we will resume these major capital</p>
<p>works regarding drainage work from the next financial year.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    Honourable  Member,  you  have  the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON.  RATU  T.  NAVURELEVU.-  Can  the  Honourable  Minister  inform  this  House  as  to 

why  there  is  no  proper  drainage  plan  for  Labasa  Town?    If  there  is  any,  can  you  highlight  this, 

please?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  towns  have  their  own  drainage  plan.    I  had  a 

discussion  with  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government  about  a  couple  of  months  ago.  

Unfortunately, Labasa Town does not a have a drainage plan. The drainage plan has been missing, 

so no one knows where those underground drains are because you need to have a drainage plan to 

locate,  clear  and  keep  the  drains  in  a  way  where  water  can  be  released,  so  we  need  to  engage 

someone.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Local  Government  used  to  engage  someone  to  identify  and  develop 

the drainage plan for Labasa Town.  That is one Municipal Council where no one knows where the 

underground  drains  are  and  their  location.    That  needs  to  be  located  by  the  Ministry  of  Local 

Government.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on.</p>
