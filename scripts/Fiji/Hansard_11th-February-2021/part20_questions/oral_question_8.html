<p>Advantages of Digital Radiology 

(Question No. 36/2021)</p>
<p>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament of</p>
<p>the advantages of the recently commissioned digital radiology?</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE (Minister for Health and Medical Services).- Mr. Speaker,</p>
<p>Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for that question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government’s bid to improve patient diagnosis across Fiji, this Fijian 

Government,  the  FijiFirst  Government,  invested  $4.3  million  to  purchase  22  Portable  Digital 

Radiography (DR) machines specifically for Subdivisional hospitals.  We had put these machines 

into the main hospitals – the CWM Hospital, Lautoka Hospital and Labasa Hospital, but then we 

used that as a pilot to be able to see what needs to be done to be able to continue to strengthen our 

imaging diagnostic services.</p>
<p>In saying that, I also take my hat off to our Medical  Imaging Technologists, almost all of 

them graduated with Bachelors from the Fiji National University and they provide a very important 

part of our service.  We wanted to be able to roll out these digital radiology machines and digital X-

rays also to the Subdivisional hospitals.  That is what I am alluding to in my reply to the question.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  launched  officially  by  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  on  27th 

January, 2021 and to give some background, radiology or x-rays have been in Fiji since 1930 and 

ever since then, we have been using, just like in many parts of the world in the middle income and 

low income countries, the old wet film processing method.  This involves the use of a dark room 

and chemicals film processing which has its own issues, such as OHS, and the fact that some of our 

staff did not like being holed up in a dark room for the whole period of time, the whole day if they 

were rostered to be there, and also the issue around the chemical itself and it was time consuming.</p>
<p>In our bid to ensure that we continue to digitalise our services, we had initially started with 

the Laboratory Management Information System that we have for our Laboratory Scientists.  We 

then moved into the Radiology Department and also the Patient Information System that we have 

had from before.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  wants  to  thank  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the 

Government  for  this  investment  in  our  Digital  Radiology  Machines  and  this  is  a  cutting  edge 

technology that complements the digital radiology that we currently have with the CT scanner, the 

MRI machines and  ultrasound machines.  Those 22 new portable radiology machines change the 

landscape of radiology services in Fiji and these are the reasons.  The x-ray images will be analysed 

and  transferred  from  the  detector  to  the  workstation  within  five  seconds.    With  that  quick 

turnaround time, it means a much-reduced waiting time for patients and the general public.</p>
<p>Most of us here would have had, until recently, an x-ray using the old system, which meant 

that  you  had  to  go  and  queue  up,  waited  in  line  and  when  you  finally  had  it,  it  took  about  15 

minutes to 20 minutes to happen.  In some occasions, because the images may be blurred, you may 

be required to have another x-ray to be able to satisfy that diagnostic capability that the doctor may 

need.  This  is  all obliterated by using digital  x-ray  as  opposed to  the wet  room that we have had 

before.</p>
<p>This  Digital  Radiology  is  also  climate  resistant,  so  once  the  Radiology  Department’s 

picture archives and communication system which we are currently installing (we are putting about 

$1 million worth of server and infrastructure at CWM Hospital alone) then all those units will be 

connected into the main facilities at the CWM Hospital, Lautoka Hospital and Labasa Hospital.</p>
<p>The  possibility  and  chances  of  images  being  lost  in  the  file  will  be  greatly  reduced.    The 

17x14 detector is large, there will be no need for different cassette sizes which, at times, seem to be 

body  shading  because  you  might  go  to  a  facility  and  they  may  not  have  the  cassette  size  for</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>someone who might have a need for a bigger size, but that is all taken out because we have a large 

17x14 detector size.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this new digital radiology services will ensure that we now are fumeless, 

where there is no need for filing, so that opens up more space that we used to use before in terms of 

filing physically and also in wet film production because now we can actually use that space and it 

also means there is less radiation compared to the conventional system.  The machine is very cost 

effective  and  it  is  electronic  in  nature.    It  would  mean  a  cessation  of  us  having  to  procure 

consumables and we have discussed that in the past year in this august House on how one particular 

subdivisional hospital was not able to do x-rays at certain times because it did not have films.  It is 

more efficient because the images can be viewed instantly without waiting for it to be processed in 

the dark room.</p>
<p>I can go on and on to highlight its numerous benefits but the general underlining fact is that, 

we  have  now  entered  a  new  area  of  radiology  in  Fiji,  both  in  the  main  hospitals  and  in  the 

subdivisional  hospitals.  We  are  currently  working  on  integrating  our  Patient  Information  System 

and the Radiology Information System and when this is done, the difficulty of information sharing 

and imaging and sharing of radiology across facilities will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>We have also  decided  that  there will be equitable distribution of the resources and to  that 

end, we have put one in Taveuni, Savusavu, Nabouwalu in the North and because of the population 

size, we have installed one at Seaqaqa, Wainikoro and Rabi.  As I speak, we are two-thirds through 

our installation process.</p>
<p>As I have alluded to, we have had these machines in the main hospitals in the past, so our 

Biomedical Engineers, led by Virisila, who is very good, is actually able to know how to be able to 

install  these  machines.    So  they  are  working  from  one  facility  to  the  other.    We  have  one  in 

Sigatoka, Nadi, Ba, Tavua, Rakiraki and the new Navosa Hospital which we will be opening next 

week.  I hear, at this moment, they have gone through two-thirds per installation, as I speak.</p>
<p>Our  digital  radiology  machines  that  are  intended  for  the  Central  Division  have  been 

installed in Korovou, Vunidawa, Makoi, Valelevu and Lami Health Centres, because of the greater 

distribution  of  people  within  the  Lami  and  Nausori  corridor.    Levuka,  Vunisea,  Lakeba  and 

Lomaloma,  mytauvufrom  Lomaloma  will  also  have  one  each.    Our  installation  team  will  head 

down to the East upon completion of the ones on the mainland.</p>
<p>I  have  shared  in  my  first  ever  parliamentary  speech  in  this  august  House  three  years  ago, 

that  our  key  objective  as  a  Government  is  to  continue  to  identify  and  effectively  address  the 

existing system gaps and make it patient-centred.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 

in 

announcing  in  this  august  House  that  when  we  finish  installing  those  22  machines,  our 

Subdivisional Hospitals and major Health Centres would all have gone into digital radiology.</p>
<p>I  have  pleasure</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and thank you Honourable Member for that question.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.</p>
