<br>as part of pre-poll which the Electoral Commission opposed, given the important services provided 
<br>by essential services personnel and that the implications of having to remove them from their place 
<br>of work to join a line to vote either on election day or in pre-poll is potentially disastrous to public 
<br>welfare.

<br>essential services and recognising that these individuals be away from their assigned polling stations 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">on polling day.  Thus, through consultations with the various essential services organisations, it was 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">agreed that their staff, who are also registered voters, apply for postal voting.

<br>main challenges faced by the Electoral Commission during the Election year in 2018 and how these 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">were addressed.  The Committee was advised that one of main challenges faced by the Commission

<br>that  attempted  to  undermine  the  credibility  of  the  Elections.    Futile  attempts  had  been  made  to 
<br>discredit  the  results,  however,  quick  actions  by  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  ensured  that  the 
<br>misinformation  was  quickly  identified  and  clarified.    The  other  main  issue  was  the  bad  weather 
<br>condition on Election day that affected the turnout in the Elections.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:8281px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of deciding the numbers for the ball roll, the Committee noted that 
<br>the Commission believed that applying any of the set of 3-digits numbers from the 2014 General 
<br>Elections in the 2018 General Elections would confuse the voters and thus, to prevent that confusion 
<br>for the 2018 General Elections, the Electoral Commission decided to use a ball draw system, similar 
<br>to the National Candidates Ball draw, to select the first 3-digits in the ballot paper.  The process took 
<br>away any illusion of bias in the selection of the first 3-digit numbers and the draw would be done 
<br>live on television and the internet, and be carried out by a blindfolded person in the presence of a 
<br>Police Officer.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">in the number of voters who did not turn up in the 2018 General Elections.  The Committee saw this 
<br>as an opportunity to focus on the positive aspect of this issue and conducted a comparative analysis 
<br>on a jurisdictional basis, to see how well the voter turnout for Fiji’s Election was when compared to 
<br>other Pacific Island countries with similar electoral system. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:8489px; width:482px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The Committee took note of New Zealand and Kiribati, since these two countries are similar 
<br>to Fiji’s electoral system whereby voting is not compulsory.  It was noted that compared to those two 
<br>countries, Fiji’s voter turnout is reasonable, whereby in New Zealand it was 79.75 percent and in 
<br>Kiribati, it was 75.67 percent. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:8558px; width:482px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the conclusion of the review, the Committee commends the Commission 
<br>for their tremendous achievements in 2018.  However, the Committee believes that it is prudent to 
<br>provide  the  following  recommendation  for  consideration  by  the  Electoral  Commission,  that  the 
<br>Electoral Commission, through the Fijian Elections Office, continues with its advocacy programmes 
<br>on elections which are in line with the Office’s Strategic Plan 2020-2023 whereby one such goal is 
<br>to strengthen electoral participation through effective outreach and engagement programmes.

<br>Resources for their commitment that enabled the Ministry to achieve its key-mandated objectives for 
<br>the periods under review.  During the period under review, the Committee noted that the Ministry of 
<br>Lands and Mineral Resources administrates all State land and regulates all mineral resources in Fiji, 
<br>with the aim to ensure that all State land, minerals and the groundwater sector is sustainable.

<br>the administration, development and management of all State land, including the foreshore, while the 
<br>Mineral  Resources Department  works towards providing access  to  available groundwater sources 
<br>that  are  present  for  human  consumption,  and  are  developed  through  properly-conducted 
<br>hydrogeological  investigation  and  assessment  with  quality  boreholes.  In  addition,  managing

<br>enabled the Ministry to promote and improve their service delivery.  The Committee noted that the 
<br>dedication  of  all  the  staff  of  the  Ministry  in  both  the  years  2014  and  2015,  that  had  enabled  the

V.  NATH.-  The  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is  pleased  to  submit  to 
<br>Parliament the Review Report of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2017-2018 Annual Report.  
<br>During  the  period  under  review,  the  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service  (FRCS)  collected  $2.83 
<br>billion in net tax revenue, recording a growth of $252.8 million, which was about 9.8 percent over 
<br>the previous fiscal year of 2016-2017.

<br>be able to access and understand, especially regarding specific tax policies.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">was conducted by the  OAG.  The Committee fails to  understand that at the height  of COVID-19 
<br>pandemic when agencies were trying to control a pandemic which the world has never seen, the OAG 
<br>was busy in keeping Ministries engaged in the audit process.

<br>Ministry.

<br>Review Report of the Fiji National Provident Fund 2019, 2020 and 2021 which is before Parliament 
<br>this  morning.    I  thank  the  Chairman  of  the  Standing  Committee  and  Members,  as  well  as  the 
<br>Secretariat for this Report.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:15444px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) was formed to ensure that workers 
<br>in Fiji had a decent life at retirement and according to its vision of securing our future and in fact the 
<br>mission statement also reflects what the Fund is supposed to do, that is, to understand its customers, 
<br>offer services and ensure sustainable returns for a meaningful retirement. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:15513px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one must ask, what does this mean?  In reality, come retirement with 
<br>the 70 percent members who have below $10,000 in their accounts, they would have virtually nothing 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">to support them financially.  The Scheme condemns the workers to extreme poverty and, in fact, into 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">the category of destitute. This is a concern for the workers, Sir, as clearly, the richer are getting richer 
<br>while the poor are condemned to poverty. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:15596px; width:482px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Now, with the Government imposing fixed term contracts causing job insecurity, hardship in 
<br>securing bank loans for housing, education and medical treatment, the Government uses FNPF as a 
<br>cash cow to help workers of this country.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:15651px; width:482px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">We see that the Vision Statement is very odd in terms of what FNPF is currently doing.  Mr. 
<br>Speaker, Sir, FNPF needs to walk the talk and make workers their priority rather than using their 
<br>members’ funds for government borrowings and of which they have a right to be informed about.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:15707px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Also of concern, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the changing of the law to suit the Governments’ agenda 
<br>of  choosing  who  they  want  to  be  Board  members.    This  is  a  deviation  from  why  FNPF  was 
<br>established. In the absence of the workers representatives in the Board, Sir, the Government can do 
<br>whatever they want because those making decisions are like pawns in a chess game - you put them 
<br>there and everywhere. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:15790px; width:485px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">This breeds wastage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by poor decision-making when there are no workers 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">representatives to provide the checks and balances and does not reflect proper financial management.  
<br>In  the  case  of  Fiji  Airways  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Board  has  demonstrated  its  total  disregard  for 
<br>workers’ fundamental rights and has shown no sensitivity to those who put money into FNPF. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:15859px; width:483px; height:80px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">On the Committee’s observation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is of concern that the FNPF was not 
<br>able  to  disclose  to  them  the  entities  who  had  defaulted  on  repayments.    The  FNPF  informed  the 
<br>Committee that it was bound by the confidentiality clause of those loan agreements, which further 
<br>assured that all loans went through a vigorous process which were vetted by a three-tiered committee 
<br>system before being tabled to the Board for approval or otherwise.  Of course, in the absence of the 
<br>workers representatives.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:100px; top:15955px; width:447px; height:12px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">A Committee of Parliament has the  necessary  powers to  obtain any information  from  any

<br>FNPF Annual Reports, namely from 2019 to 2021, ending on 30</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:8px">th</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> June,  2021.  The 2022 Annual 
<br>Report has not been released yet, and even if it was, it would not have been reviewed to-date. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:16281px; width:482px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">However, FNPF Reports are released in a timely manner.  One wonders, why? Maybe, it is 
<br>due to the fact that FNPF is not funded by taxpayers, but by the workers of Fiji, and the Government-
<br>control Board of FNPF has no choice…. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:100px; top:16336px; width:212px; height:12px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Nonsense!

<br>announcement  of  dividend  for  members,  as  well  as  the  publication  and  release  of  the  Report  is 
<br>concerned.  At least, Mr. Speaker, we get to know how much debt the Government has, or where the 
<br>bulk of the workers’ money has gone.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:16432px; width:485px; height:96px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">As at 30</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:8px">th</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px"> June, 2021, Government’s debt stock with FNPF stood at $3.5 billion. Undoubtedly, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">it has increased like it does every year, so let us make realistic comparisons.  As of 31</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:8px">st</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> July, 2021, 
<br>the total  Government  debt,  according to  the 2021-2022 Budget  Fiscal  and Economic Update was 
<br>forecasted at $7.6 billion, which means that as of the last financial year, Government’s debt portfolio 
<br>with FNPF was 46 percent of its total forecast debt as of July 2021.  Has this increased or decreased?  
<br>Only the honourable Minister for Economy, the FNPF Board and the Executive Management can 
<br>answer this, Mr. Speaker.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:16543px; width:483px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">But the most alarming fact, Mr. Speaker, is that, 80.5 percent of FNPF members had balances 
<br>of less than $20,000 in their accounts as of 30</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:8px">th</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> June, 2021.  It meant that 359,516 out of a total of 
<br>446,658 members had less than $20,000 as their fund balances.  It is not surprising, therefore, that 
<br>only a little over 4 percent of members opted for the Pension Scheme upon their retirement. This 
<br>means that 96 percent of the total eligible members who have full access to their funds, withdrew 
<br>every cent.  Why?  Because at 9 percent annuity, even a member having a balance of $20,000 will 
<br>receive $1,800 per annum as pension or $150 per month for their survival. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:16654px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Sir, while all honourable Members of Parliament living beyond 30 kilometres of this Chamber 
<br>received $350 per day allowance or the honourable Prime Minister receiving an average of $3,000 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">in daily allowance alone for overseas travel, Mr. Speaker, is this fair? The FNPF can post annual 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">dividends of 7 percent but it does not change the fact that 18.5 percent of its members would receive 
<br>a maximum of $150 per month full pension for their survival.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:16737px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">When  the  late  Mr.  Ambalal  Dahyabhai  Patel  or  Mr.  A.D.  Patel,  the  founder  leader  of  the 
<br>National  Federation  Party  moved  a  motion  in  the  Legislative  Council  in  March  1965,  for  the 
<br>establishment of a social security scheme or a provident fund to lift ordinary workers out of poverty, 
<br>he would have never envisioned that 57 years later, 80.5 percent of workers of such a scheme would 
<br>have savings far below than they desired.

<br>force members who are decreed to a pension rate of less than 9 percent of their savings.  Even if a 
<br>member’s balance upon retirement is  $10,000 and the member withdraws lump sum, the average 
<br>spend per month would be $133.23 and the member will exhaust the funds forever.

<br>that have less than $5,000 contribution is 188,288 and of that amount, there is also those holding zero 
<br>balance, which it is 58,712.  It is interesting to note that the members holding zero balance continue 
<br>to appear in the annual reports and they range between 50,000 and even over 60,000. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:17560px; width:483px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The  total  membership,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  those  holding  zero  balance  to  maximum 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">$40,000,  there  is  a  total  of  406,204  members.    That  is  about  90.9  percent  of  the  total  number  of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">446,658.  For members that hold above $40,000 and taking it up to over $500,000, there is only 40,634 
<br>members and that only accounts to about 9.9 percent of the total membership, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is 
<br>important  for  us  to  note  these  numbers  because  it  could  be  misleading  in  regards  to  their  Mission 
<br>Statement in securing your future because 90.9 percent of this total membership sits only to a maximum 
<br>of $40,000.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:17670px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly after COVID-19, members were encouraged by Government policy 
<br>to dip into their FNPF to be able to help themselves.  Sir, that would mostly affect those who are sitting 
<br>with $5,000 to less than $10,000, or even $40,000 contributions.  With that in mind, a lot of those people 
<br>may still be out of jobs.  How will these people help themselves, to be able to have a secure future, 
<br>according to the Mission Statement of the Fund?   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:17753px; width:483px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Also, there is a requirement by the Department of Social Welfare that if you have been a member 
<br>of FNPF, then you would not be entitled to social welfare. So that picture gives a kind of gloom future 
<br>for those sitting on $40,000 and below, which is 406,024 members, or 90.9 percent of those members.

<br>country, particularly during this economic challenging times brought about by COVID-19.  So we can 
<br>anticipate that a big number of our population sitting at 400,000 would not be benefiting from Social 
<br>Welfare, after they finish from the Fund.  Also, you will note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that a big number of those 
<br>who hold less than $5,000 are sitting on 55 years and above, and that is, 11,212 members.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:18051px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, also with that big number, it kind of reflects an unequal distribution of wealth 
<br>with those sitting with more than $100,000 to over $500,000.  The numbers are smaller, it is only a pocket 
<br>of our population who have that kind of savings in their account.  Also, a question comes to mind in 
<br>regards to investment.  According to the Report, the Fund will explore investment opportunities in the 
<br>agriculture sector, business process outsourcing, healthcare, retail manufacturing, financial and insurance 
<br>sector, infrastructure assets, et cetera.  A question that also comes to mind, Sir, is that in the 2019 Report, 
<br>the Chairman had highlighted the FNPF’s role in assisting members to achieve a better quality of life, 
<br>must strike a balance with the need to save sufficiently for retirement.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:18175px; width:485px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, members can only save for retirement, if they are in gainful employment.  Also, 
<br>members who are retiring have funds.  A question that we can ask is, how can these individual members 
<br>be assisted?  A lot of these members have worked throughout their lives, they have not really done any 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">sort of business or engaged in businesses opportunities, whereby they could invest their FNPF savings.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">So, rather than just the Fund concentrating on the organisational investment, if the Fund could also look 
<br>at individual opportunities for members that have FNPF savings and would like, for example, to invest 
<br>in the agriculture sector.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:18286px; width:483px; height:122px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">How  does  the  FNPF  link  up  with  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  (FDB)  for  small  business  and 
<br>medium enterprises to help members invest their funds into some kind of business opportunity whereby 
<br>they  themselves  can  engage  in  business  rather  than  relying  on  FNPF  to  engage  on  investment 
<br>opportunities that are there?  That is something that comes to mind when reading through the Report if 
<br>individual opportunities for members could also be accorded to them by the FNPF Board, with some kind 
<br>of, maybe hand holding initiative in those sectors that I have already highlighted where the FNPF intends 
<br>to invest in.  That being said, so the members could also be empowered with regards to investing their 
<br>own savings into business opportunities that the Board could assist them access in terms of sustaining 
<br>their retirement and having financial independence.

That is an interesting point because in the

<br>we can add additional information for the sake of the public and also to assist Parliament with further 
<br>information.  So the bipartisanship is working well, it is just at the PM level and AG level that is not 
<br>working, and they need to make it work.  I note from the Report, if you look at recommendation three of 
<br>the Committee, they mentioned Aspen.  I support the call by the NFP leader regarding an investigation 
<br>into that partnership.  Aspen formed a partnership in 2019 and it resulted in the creation of a subsidiary 
<br>company, Health Care (Fiji) Pte. Limited which oversees the running of Ba and Lautoka Hospitals.

<br>recommendations to have worker representatives on the FNPF Board, separation of asset investment 
<br>and management of the Fund from the functions of the Board of Directors.  Regulations and laws 
<br>that govern FNPF stipulates clearly, fiduciary duty, what that means in practice and regulations that 
<br>stipulate how the interest of members are defined and reviewed in consultation with its members.  So 
<br>they note from that that it is important to have a scrutiny on government structures of these provident

<br>and suicides, a failed health services, mass termination of workers in WAF, Fiji Airways 
<br>and ATS like never seen in Fiji’s history and the list goes on.   We have also witnessed 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">and  experienced  the  serious  contraction  in  our  democratic  space  like  the  freedom  of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">speech, assembly, political rights, freedom of association, denial of workers’ rights, press 
<br>freedom, again the list goes on.  Of course, the most important of all is the imposition of 
<br>the Fiji Constitution with so many limitations to rights and which only protects those that 
<br>were responsible for the 2006 coup and any actions taken by them or their supporters until 
<br>2014 without any exceptions.  It is time we did an analysis of our human rights under this 
<br>AG and his Government. This is no time for the AG to lecture as he normally does but to 
<br>listen and learn.

<br>they are union  members or not, very seriously and will continue to  advocate for them 
<br>whenever and wherever the needs arises.  There is no need for sophistication to disguise 
<br>the real issues.  The AG needs to be schooled in trade union advocacy so that Fiji does 
<br>not become an embarrassment in the international arena. An analysis since 2014 of the 
<br>ILO Committee of Experts Reports on Fiji may well serve as a good example.

<br>on Social Affairs on the deliberations of the Annual Reports.  By the same token, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br>the  management  and  staff  of  the  Fiji  National  Provident  Fund  for  their  efforts  in  ensuring  the 
<br>employed  members  and  business  employers’  hard-earned  savings  and  contributions  are  protected

<br>that  they  have  a  meaningful,  comfortable  retirement  supported  by  the  hard-earned  savings  they 
<br>accumulated  during  their  working  life.    My  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  has  been  diligent  in 
<br>developing  robust  divestment,  liquidity  and  preservation  policy  and  regulation.  For  example,  the 
<br>allocation  of  70  percent  of  funds  into  members  preserved  account  for  retirement  purposes.    We 
<br>actively partnered with strong institutions like the FNPF to ensure that members do not have zero 
<br>balances in their savings once they retire or if they become unemployed.

<br>its robust business continuity plan and risk management, the Fund is equipped to address a range of

<br>works with key agencies such as the Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service, Reserve Bank of Fiji, Ministry 
<br>of  Justice,  Real  Estate  Agents  Licensing  Board,  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission  and  other 
<br>government agencies to carry out their duties ensuring that every member benefits from a healthy

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">this does not mean that they have exhausted their total savings. This balance is only a reflection of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">their General Account.  As I mentioned earlier, the Fund’s Preservation Policy means that 70 percent 
<br>of the members’ total contributions are secure and cannot be touched until the person retires.

<br>2015  and  other  laws  of  Fiji.    For  the  finalisation  of  this  partnership  with  Health  Care  (Fiji)  Pte

<br>and implementation of the project, as we wanted to get it done right.  There was a rigorous process 
<br>undertaken by the IFC consultation with my Government, Fiji National University, FNPF, among 
<br>others, to design the transaction structure itself.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:22607px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">An  open  international  competitive  bid  process  was  undertaken  by  IFC  and  all  bids  were 
<br>assessed against the stringent technical and financial criteria for the selection.  Health Care (Fiji) Pte 
<br>Limited has successfully transitioned into the management of Lautoka and Ba Hospitals.  All the 
<br>services available at the two Hospitals are free for the people and more tertiary care services will be 
<br>available in Fiji, including for the first time ever, open heart surgeries, radiotherapy, chemotherapy 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">for cancer and the 24/7 availability of cardiac surgery.

<br>globally,  including  the  supply  of  clinical  equipment  such  as  those  required  for  cardiac  surgery.  
<br>Further, cardiac surgery involves cleaning, selection and stabilisation of patients in order to optimise 
<br>the outcome, including echo-cardiology and the management of comorbidities such as diabetes and 
<br>obesity as undertaken prior to any intricate surgery.

<br>complex and a lot is required prior to commencing procedures.  At the end of the day, I want to make 
<br>it clear, Mr. Speaker, that no amount of hard work, rigorous decision-making or length of time needed 
<br>will be too much for my Government to improve the health and care of the Fijian people.

<br>and higher quality health systems and care services, especially because we are the first Government 
<br>to have prioritised a ‘never-before-seen’ medical care in Fiji.  One only must think of the children’s’ 
<br>heart hospital in Nasese.

<br>important  aspect.    My  Government,  through  the  Fund,  has  made  independent  assessments  on  its 
<br>Financials and Annual Reports where auditors thoroughly produced and make recommendations for 
<br>improvement and actuarialists are doing the work.  Now, my dear colleagues, that is transparency, a 
<br>concept that honourable Professor Prasad knows nothing about. I hope he has been paying attention 
<br>to the facts I have laid them out, so I suspect the Professor will ignore this lecture, despite how sorely 
<br>he needs to hear it.  Sadly, his desperate pursuit of power depends on him painting the most negative

<br>Affairs for the Annual Reports of 2019, 2020 and 2021.  That is a very clear indication of things that 
<br>are moving forward on the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), being very updated on its Annual 
<br>Reports.  That has to be a reflection to all institutions of Government whereby they have to bring to 
<br>par all their Annual Reports and also the review of their Annual Reports to be tabled in Parliament, 
<br>and also reviewed and debated in Parliament as soon as.

<br>Airports Annual Report was presented on Tuesday.  The Ministry of Waterways which has lacked 
<br>with six years report (2017-2018 Annual Reports) has just been tabled.  The Ministry of Employment, 
<br>Productivity and Industrial Relations 2016-2017 Annual Report has been tabled on Monday. This is 
<br>a bad reflection on Government and the institution.  The Ministry of Industrial Relations 2017-2018 
<br>Annual  Report and the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation 2018-2019 Annual 
<br>Reports. We are supposed to be in line with the Reserve Bank of Fiji.

<br>Permanent Secretaries of Government institutions or Departments and Ministries to bring to par the 
<br>submission of their Annual Reports.  I have been here for about four years and we are still discussing 
<br>Annual Reports and their review even before 2018.  The next government will come in and try and 
<br>speed up the Annual Reports and their review.

<br>has to be public knowledge - everyone has to know about this), Vodafone Fiji Limited, HFC Bank and 
<br>fully owns Natadola Bay Resort Limited (InterContinental Fiji Golf Resort &amp; Spa), Holiday Inn Suva, 
<br>Momi Bay Resort (Pte) Limited (Fiji Marriott Resort), Marriott Denarau Properties (Sheraton Fiji and 
<br>Denarau Golf and Racquet Club), and the Grand Pacific Hotel.  I think everyone who works in Fiji should 
<br>know about this, that we should patronise those places if we want our 5 percent shareholding in FNPF, 
<br>without prejudice to other big companies.

<br>data on loans issued by FNPF from 2015 until the present time, the entities of which the loans were given 
<br>and their financial performance.  They also inquired the amount recovered and outstanding loan balance 
<br>for  each  of  these  entities  and  whether  any  entity  had  defaulted  on  loan  repayment.    However  this 
<br>information was not disclosed to the Committee by the Fund as they were informed that it was bound for 
<br>confidentiality clause of the loan agreements.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:24723px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The Committee was assured that all loans went through a vigorous due diligence process, which 
<br>are then vetted by three type Committee systems before they have been tabled to the Board.  I think that 
<br>there is a good vetting system in FNPF and publicly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone goes against Government 
<br>when you touch any funds or without public consultations when the Government is taking funds out of 
<br>FNPF.  I hope that things improve - communications publicly, that we should know in fine detail because 
<br>everything just seems to be a secret with Government.

<br>of where FNPF stands.  I just wish to highlight a couple of issues that were raised by honourable Members 
<br>on  the  other  side.   Firstly, they  talked  about  a Government-controlled  Board.  They  made those very 
<br>flippant comments, but they do not understand that under the FNPF Act, there is a requirement now to 
<br>appoint Board members who have specific skill sets that are required to run a superannuation fund.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:25187px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members also do not talk about the fact, and I see some young 
<br>people in the audience there.  If these young people are working now or they would soon be working, by 
<br>2050 and 2060 when they retire, if we had not reformed the FNPF, they would actually have no pension 
<br>funds  left.    That  was  a  report  by  the  World  Bank,  not  once,  but  twice.    Two  independent  reports 
<br>highlighted that the way the FNPF was being managed, the funds would actually have been completely 
<br>depleted.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:25283px; width:486px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">There were members in FNPF who were receiving a rate of 25 percent.  There was one particular 
<br>trade unionists, I know, Sir, who was receiving a rate of 17 percent to 19 percent.  They do not talk about 
<br>that.  Honourable Jale knows about this.  They need to make inquiries about this.  That was how FNPF 
<br>had been run.  Investments that come to mind, many of us may remember the Malt House near the Golf 
<br>Course.  What happened to that Malt House?  FNPF funds.  Bligh Shipping. PAPI leader was involved 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">in Bligh Shipping, what happened then, Mr. Speaker, Sir?    They do not talk about all of these things.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">They do not talk about Momi and Natadola.  Honourable Rasova, we have actually salvaged it.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:25394px; width:482px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">They were investing with people who were wanted by the law, not in Fiji but in Europe and 
<br>New Zealand.  One was an undischarged bankrupt.  He used to come on a helicopter from Nadi to 
<br>Natadola, with red carpet.  If we had not intervened, Sir, the total investment in Natadola would have 
<br>exceeded a billion dollars of members’ funds.  There is no way they would have got a rate of return 
<br>on that.  Momi – one of the investors has ended up in prison in New Zealand.

<br>December,  2006,  one  of  them  took  off  to  NZ.    I  have  seen  receipts.    When  she  used  to  go  to  a 
<br>hairdresser, drink a cup of coffee, it was paid for by FNPF.  Not from her wallet but by FNPF through 
<br>their credit card.  This was the kind of shenanigans that were taking place in FNPF which they do 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">not talk about, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br>Speaker, Sir, salvaged FNPF.  All the young people sitting here and outside these Chambers would 
<br>know that their FNPF funds, if they are members today, they know at retirement, they will get their 
<br>money.  That was not guaranteed previously, Sir.

<br>use it as a cash  cow.   In fact,  I would  argue that FNPF, in  the past  two  years, used Government 
<br>because there was no other investment opportunity for them to give them that rate of return.  That is 
<br>why, as the honourable Prime Minister read out, the interest rate on the rate of return has been 5 
<br>percent or more.

<br>Airlines stating how retirement savings are being used to prop up dead or life-support government 
<br>statutories and the biggest threat is Fiji Airways.”  Then they go and quote honourable Gavoka saying 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">that Fiji Airways can take the country down.  Then they go and quote Mr. Mahendra Chaudhry.  They 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">used  that  as  the  basis  for  condemning  what  FNPF  is  doing  -  by  quoting  three  people  who  have

<br>there and say things, they make all sorts of statements, correct or not correct, they get published, that 
<br>is what you call ‘freedom of expression’.  So, what we see from the Opposition is basically sarcasm, 
<br>conjecture, obfuscation, obscurantism, speculation, disingenuity, and that is what the Opposition in

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">about Fiji Airways.  Before I say that, Sir, one of the well-known superannuation funds in the world 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">with high levels of contribution, to contribute to the superannuation fundin Singapore, I think, it is 
<br>somewhere like 32 or 38 percent.  Members contribute 18 percent of their salary and the employers 
<br>contribute  (I  think)  10  percent  or  15  percent  of  their  salary.  We  have  flipped  it  around  where 
<br>employers actually contributed more than the employees.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:28111px; width:483px; height:136px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, their superannuation fund has invested in their airports and in other key 
<br>strategic investments that actually help the government and the country to propel themselves.  In the 
<br>same way as the honourable Prime Minister highlighted, about this relationship with Health Care 
<br>(Fiji) Limited.  Sir, Health Care (Fiji) Limited will provide open heart surgeries. Bulk of the FNPF 
<br>members who faced medical problems and those procedures that cannot be provided in Fiji, take out 
<br>their  funds  and  go  to  India  or  those  who  can  afford  it,  to  Australia  and  New  Zealand.    If  those 
<br>procedures are going to be available in Fiji, what is wrong with that?  In fact, it is a benefit to the 
<br>members.  They will be able to actually access those services here.  Money does not leave the country 
<br>and when the Health Care (Fiji) Limited makes money, that money goes as an interest payment to 
<br>their accounts.  Again, they do not think. There is absolutely no thought about it.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">they have made a very smart investment and I will tell you the reason why.  Because the share price 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">which they have paid for at $4.22.  Before COVID-19, the share price in 2019 in Fiji Airways was 
<br>$16 a share. They have now bought it at $4.22 a share.  With Fiji Airways flying the way it is with 
<br>the borders being reopened within two years they will be able to double or triple the share value.  
<br>That is what you call smart investment.  They did not do it as some willy-nilly investment and in the

<br>that FNPF owns.  You know this is what you call smart investment. If you own the hotels you want 
<br>to make sure that the hotels will be filled.  And how do the hotels get filled? When you get tourists.  
<br>And how do the tourists come to Fiji, because this is a maritime country they come by an aeroplane.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">department, immigration and other government departments.

<br>procedures,  with  the  aim  of  making  business  of  film  making  exciting,  stress-free,  and  ultimately 
<br>positioning Fiji as one of the most sought-after film destinations in the world.

<br>directly involved in the film industry, ensuring that production companies have a pleasant experience 
<br>while shooting in Fiji.  From January to July 2016, 32 productions were filmed in Fiji and came from 
<br>various countries such as Australia, United States of America, New Zealand, China et cetera. This 
<br>generated FJ$92.4 million of new economic activity which contributed to Fiji’s economic growth 
<br>and also created employment for our locals.  Moreover, for the period from August 2016 – July 2017, 
<br>57 productions were filmed in Fiji which generated FJ$212.3 million of new economic activity in the 
<br>economy.

<br>productions into the country. As majority of the productions were filmed in rural locations, most of 
<br>the locals were engaged from these local communities and this helped improve the standard of living 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">of these communities.  In anticipation of the new challenges of the post-COVID-19 pandemic era,

<br>opportunities”.  I come from a community where they have been doing a lot of film making.  Since 2018, 
<br>these film makers from overseas are no longer coming to the communities or to the villages to present 
<br>their </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">sevusevu</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> and discuss the reasons and the terms of staying in Fiji.

<br>unskilled labour, security guards, kitchen hands, beach cleaners, weavers, builders all these come from 
<br>the community but we have noticed lately, Sir, that these have not been happening now. It is the Film Fiji 
<br>that has been sourcing all these from other parts of Fiji, overlooking the communities to where they are 
<br>based on which they are supposed to be benefiting from the film money. That is why I said, Sir, it is 
<br>important for the honourable Minister responsible to consider co-opting a member from the province or 
<br>the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Roko Tui</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> to be part of the Board.

<br>That is what I am trying to say, so that the benefits actually is done to the community.  I hope that they 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">will consider that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br>and came here and made allegations against the Board without any basis whatsoever, and he calls them 
<br>“culturally derogatory”.  My honourable friend, I think you ought to go and sit down at Film Fiji and find 
<br>out how culturally sensitive they are, how culturally sensitive the Board is and how culturally sensitive 
<br>this particular side of Parliament is.  We take care of all citizens, we make sure that all our cultures are

<br>not, we must not, we shall not, we will not, we never do in terms of Film Fiji, they are being culturally 
<br>sensitive from day one.  So it is the generalised pie in the sky statements that he makes about culturally

<br>Report.  I am clarifying and noting relevant facts, and this is in particular to the Board of Survey, which 
<br>is  being  carried  out  before  the  end  of  each  financial  year,  following  Film  Fiji’s  change  from  annual 
<br>calendar year to Government financial year, which is August to July each year.  I also take note of the 
<br>recommendations that have been highlighted by the Standing Committee in the review report, whilst time 
<br>is of the essence,  I shall be brief with my response.   It is no secret, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Fijian 
<br>economy was significantly impacted by COVID-19 pandemic one way or the other.  So as businesses 
<br>had to adapt and also to be innovative in the operations to keep afloat, Film Fiji as well has continued to 
<br>persevere with improving their operation in the face of uncertainty.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:31596px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">There is evidence as Film Fiji continues to work in projects in the areas of digitalisation of the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Film Commission’s operations by implementing productions management software, and digitalising of 
<br>paper work related production incentives and also the launch of their new website.  This was actually 
<br>internally  developed  with  goal  of  offering  better  useability  providing  quicker  and  more  complete 
<br>information on available services in Fiji and actually simplifying the access to information related to film 
<br>permit procedures and relevant applications.  Realising the importance also of upskilling and reskilling 
<br>of the staff in any organisation, Film Fiji has actually begun to build staff capacity also in digital skills in 
<br>addition to working with relevant stakeholders in strengthening Film Fiji’s friendly policies.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:31720px; width:483px; height:136px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">On the same note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Film Fiji has actually set a vision of strengthening, training 
<br>and developing in Fiji by launching a couple of things.  One is the School Media Learning Programme, 
<br>and again, this undertakes a training programme for all different parts of the community.  First of all, they 
<br>got a School media Learning Programme with Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts and with the 
<br>support of Australian Film Television and Radio School to bring the key media skills to Year 9 to Year 
<br>11 across the country.  These skills will prepare children for the media and visual skills required by jobs 
<br>in the future.  We also got the professional media learning programme bringing online courses from 
<br>international sources to upskill and train professional local filmmakers in Fiji and also Suva International 
<br>Short Film Festival, Sir, to share international award winning short films with local filmmakers and with 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">schools participating at the social school media learning programme.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:31872px; width:482px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">This  exposure, Mr. Speaker, to these  films, is  meant to  provide  a  benchmark to promote the 
<br>creation and exhibition of local films.  It will be remiss of me also not to add that Film Fiji Commission 
<br>is also strengthening its presence in international markets and trade shows and this is to showcase Fiji to 
<br>major  studios  and  our  readiness  to  attract  film  and  television  productions  and  also  the  available 
<br>infrastructure accessibility, our pristine locations, our English speaking crew and the current film tax 
<br>rebates incentives that are offered by the Fijian Government.

<br>commendable,  I  wish  to,  Mr.  Speaker,  underscore  the  importance  of  the  film  industry  to  our  Fijian 
<br>economy.    During  COVID-19  pandemic  and  with  the  gradual  opening  of  our  borders,  Fiji  actually 
<br>facilitated the famous  reality television show  “US  Survivor”  for seasons  41  and 42,  and through the 
<br>facilitation of the COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce (CRMT) and has generated employment, my 
<br>dear honourable friend, it has generated employment of 408 locals and created $70 million worth of new 
<br>economic activity and that is during COVID-19 and this was across the board for everybody.

<br>created a local employment of 690-odd persons with a new economic activity of about $110.25 million.  
<br>Similarly, we have 55 productions that have also filmed on our shores and generating employment for 99 
<br>locals and creating new economic activity of $4.6 million.  Prior to the pandemic, we had attracted 57-
<br>odd productions which contributed about $43 million to the Fijian economy in 2016.  In the following 
<br>year, Fiji hosted around 73 productions, which in turn, generated an increase of 173.95 percent, which is 
<br>$217.8 million of new economic activity collectively for 2018 and 2019, and we facilitated a total of 203 
<br>productions which contributed about $358 million to our economy.

<br>towards the surrounding communities as a gesture of goodwill and commitment to the development of 
<br>Fiji, so do not tell us that we desensitise it by being, taking some particular part of our community out.  
<br>These donations also ranged from school items, books, desks, household care packs, medical equipment, 
<br>generators, donating cash to women’s funds and education funds, to name a few.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:32446px; width:487px; height:122px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Over the years, Film Fiji has developed new skills and talent in a number of areas that are required 
<br>by production companies and the Film Fiji database, Sir, provides a list of talent and skills that Fiji has to 
<br>offer and are engaged by the production companies.  This is actually quite a specialised skill, the film 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">industry, Sir, so it is not like you can hire anybody in the film industry to do these things.  We are going 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">through the necessary training with all the productions that actually come to Fiji, so local vendors are 
<br>engaged to supply products and services to these particular productions and these actually include hotel 
<br>accommodation, land, air, sea transportation, catering, hardware and building materials, equipment hire, 
<br>financial insurance and professional services and there are also investments, Mr. Speaker, by locals into 
<br>new areas of business that can provide technical support to industry.  For example, certain prop designs.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:32584px; width:483px; height:122px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">In addition, Mr. Speaker, the benefits are not limited to just employment and business but includes 
<br>payment of location fees to landowners where the production is located.  Most productions have been 
<br>undertaken in maritime zones and smaller townships and I will just stop there, pause for a moment, Mr. 
<br>Speaker, you just heard what I said about payment of location fees to landowners.  All of this is done in 
<br>conjunction with iTLTB, so you cannot say that we are leaving somebody out.  Anything and everything 
<br>that happens, they are very sensitive about where they film, what they do within the particular location, 
<br>so please do not mislead the public by saying that we are being desensitised, we are actually, as you said 
<br>“culturally derogatory” in the way we actually operate or the filmmakers operate because they do it in 
<br>conjunction …

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">did not say that it is “culturally derogative”.  What I said is not to be.  I did not say that it is culturally 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">derogative.  I said to make sure that they are not culturally derogatory. You are misleading the Parliament.

<br>you said, do not twist it around honourable Member, you are saying it wrong, you said the wrong thing

<br>highlight the strong focus of the Film Commission with the continuous regaining of the pre-COVID-19 
<br>markets.  The European market used to be Fiji’s second most important market after the USA, when the 
<br>USA used to represent about 60 percent of the film production market in Fiji.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:33297px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Europe at 20 percent, Australia and New Zealand at 30 percent.  So, aside from building a strong 
<br>presence and attendance at the three of the key trade shows that takes place in Europe,  being  European 
<br>film market, the Film Market including  Film Fiji  also work closely with our tourism industry, in finding 
<br>innovative approaches in regaining our European market.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">on the debating of the motion that is before the Parliament and I hope that if it could be taken in the vein 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">in which I am about to present what I have to say, Sir.  I fully endorse the views raised by honourable 
<br>Kuridrani, especially in his concern regarding the involvement of iTLTB and the Roko Tuis’ office, in as 
<br>far as engaging of local landowners, et cetera in the usage of their land and resources as well, Sir. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:33448px; width:483px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">We fully understand the greater benefit that accrued from this filming industry and the amount of 
<br>money that goes to the landowners and here based on experience, Sir, one of the biggest estate in Fiji 
<br>known as “Vunilagi” belongs to my clan.  It has been used quite a lot for shooting of videos and movies 
<br>by the video boards and all I want to highlight regarding what was being said by honourable Kuridrani, 
<br>yes, there are sometimes instead of the payment going to my clan, who are the registered landowners at 
<br>Vunilagi, together with others that are there from Nakobo, et cetera, the payment goes to my village in 
<br>Somosomo.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:33559px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">These are two different issues altogether, Sir, one is the village and the other is the registered 
<br>landowner. I have had a good chance to sit with the chairman of the board and one of their key personnel 
<br>who used to be a hackerman  at the TV One at one time and I shared these views with them in the hope 
<br>is how best we could better this.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:33628px; width:482px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">On top of that, Sir, I only wish to bring to the attention of the honourable Minister as well is that, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">for the last so many years, even though COVID has come in the figure that they usually paid out to the 
<br>resource owners has been the same all the time.  I do not know whether they take it off from the gross 
<br>receipts or gross turnover that the movie make or the film make or that is just the flat rate of cost that has 
<br>been slapped on and paid to resource owners.  I  am  talking  about  beautiful  movie  spots  in  Taveuni, 
<br>Vurevure and especially in Vunilagi. These are the two areas that they have been regularly using to shoot 
<br>whatever they want to shoot, as far as movie is concerned.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:33738px; width:482px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The point that I am trying to drive is perhaps, if the honourable Minister cares to just go over this 
<br>with the officials because we have highlighted to them that even though the payment has come, it has 
<br>gone to the wider circle of people in the village rather than the clan who are the registered owners. On 
<br>top of that, some of the estate owners in Vurevure in Bouma they lived in Sydney. This is from the 
<br>Hennings family and they have been asking me whether this amount is enough for the shooting of the 
<br>movie.  I  said,     as far  as  I  know, we are lucky  that they  are shooting  something there  and they  pay 
<br>something. But as far as whether the amount is enough, I am sorry I cannot help you with that, you need 
<br>to talk with the relevant Minister or the relevant people that runs the board of Film Fiji.

<br>scrutinising the Report. There were permanent findings emanating from the scrutiny of Film Fiji. The 
<br>thing that I would like to thank is that, it was Film Fiji bringing the film to the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Tikina</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> of Ono in Kadavu 
<br>since 2016 to 2018 and it really did a hike in the economy in the Northern part of Kadavu.  I think there 
<br>was the English “</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Survivor</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">” Japanese “</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Survivor” </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">and French “</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Survivor”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">.

<br>activities when the “</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Survivor”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">’ comes in. We are all targeted into making money but our traditional, 
<br>cultural, church and religious callings were kind of neglected at that time. It really suffered for three years. 
<br>Luckily the COVID came and all the “</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Survivor”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> films withdrew from Kadavu and it is unfortunate.  Now 
<br>it is in Mana Island and I hope that if there can be a commission to inquire the effects that it does to these 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">communities especially the villages.  We have our own way of doing business in the village but then we 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">are hoping that Film Fiji will reconsider Ono, I think it is from honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua’s island 
<br>of  Buliya; a  small place  they  call  Tokana that  was given the opportunity  to film most of the  French 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Survivor</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">.

S.R. RASOVA.- The village was Buliya and it involved all the seven villages in the district 
<br>of Ono in Kadavu, that is where I come from, we both come from there.  People were not attending their 
<br>village activities, they were 24/7 in the film industry, they were drinking on Sundays, and it really affected 
<br>the jobs of the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Turaga ni Koro </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">and the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Mata ni Tikina</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">.  That was something that the villages and </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">tikina</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> 
<br>were not prepared for with the influx of people and also of money.  People were getting about $500 a 
<br>week on average salary.

<br>of a person.  The honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs is supposed to look at that and control the 
<br>iTaukei people.  Yes, he is supposed to see it, get a commission to look into that.  We did not say no to 
<br>money, but the side effect, that we have to think of.  It is coming back and I hope that it is coming back 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">soon to Kadavu.

Fiji is a historic 
<br>film production destination that is on the cusp of becoming a global force in television and movie making.  
<br>The pandemic put a hold on production globally, but just like with tourism, we will be fools not to give 
<br>the audio visual industry our full support as a source of jobs for our people and exposure for the country. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:34984px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, thanks to this marketing strategy, Film Fiji has helped us fully resume our film 
<br>industry which is now welcoming massive pent-up demand from overseas producers.  I am told the team 
<br>just wrapped up another season of </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Survivor</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> on Mana Island and well done to the crew.  Fiji is the world’s 
<br>most beautiful backdrop, better than anything you can create on a green screen, but production need more 
<br>than good scenery, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need capacity and Fiji has that as well.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:35067px; width:482px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The  improved  network  of  telecommunications  and  infrastructure  that  my  Government  has 
<br>invested  in,  coupled  with  enormous  wealth  of  skills,  talents,  facilities  and  services  within  Fiji’s  film 
<br>industry makes us a world class production destination.

<br>We have to leverage that access and exposure to attract a new generation of Fijian film makers.  That is 
<br>why I was proud to see that despite the pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this industry still involved our school 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">children through the mobile movie competition.  I was also proud to see a son of the Pacific, Taika Waititi 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">win an Academy Award which I understand is the premier recognition in film for a screenplay he adapted. 
<br>That is a wonderful inspiration for young Pacific people. I hope to see a Fijian with an Academy Award 
<br>in my life time, involving our children in creative arts can make that possible.  That is why Government 
<br>is providing a platform for our children to learn and gain experience in this industry.  This Government 
<br>is the only one that has done anything like this …

<br>I  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  acknowledges  the  Committee’s 
<br>observation  on  the  general  satisfaction  of  the  operation  of  Film  Fiji  and  the  issue  on  hand  has  been 
<br>addressed by Film Fiji. Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do support the motion.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:35398px; width:482px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, just very briefly, a couple of comments.  The reason why 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Government  had  offered  the  incentives  was,  of  course,  we  are  talking  about  diversification  in  the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">economy. There is a lot of what we call a multiplier effect of movie production or any type of production 
<br>to do with film in the country.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:35467px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">When people come to Fiji, they are not only bring equipment but they also bring in people.  People 
<br>need  to  eat,  they  buy  our  food,  they  go  to  the  market,  they  need  to  rent  premises,  they  need  to  hire 
<br>equipment and indeed they need to hire personnel.  So the multiplier effect is enormous, honourable 
<br>Rasova  lamented  the  fact  that  people  are  getting  $500  a  week  which  actually  is  quite  contradictory 
<br>because $500 a week out in the island is actually a lot of money, that is, you are looking at $2,000 a 
<br>month.  There is a movie production for </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Real Life</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> TV Series for six months, we can do the mathematics 
<br>on that ($2,000 x 6 = $12,000) for six months; that is not bad money actually. I think a lot of people forget 
<br>that. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:35591px; width:482px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think some of the comments from the other side, I did not catch all of it appears 
<br>to be only looking at how much span there is in terms of being given only to the landowners for the use 
<br>of the land.  It is not only about that but it is also the multiplier effect. We have seen many of the locations

<br>to do the backdrop paintings, they do joinery and carpentry for the sets and they also hire punts or the 
<br>local boats; a lot of that.  They actually not necessarily hold back on paying.  We have seen our people 
<br>actually demand quite large amounts of money. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:35876px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The other point I also want to make, Sir, is that it is not only about </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Real Life</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> TV Series and also 
<br>full length movies, it is also advertisements. We have seen, for example, there was one production from 
<br>North America, they spent an entire two weeks to shoot I think a one minute or one and half minute TV 
<br>advertisement  on  Natadola.  That  is  the  amount  of  time  and  resources  it  takes  to  shoot  a  very  good 
<br>production. Sir, it is actually a quick win, they have of course used Fiji Airways to come to Fiji, now they 
<br>are flying to Vancouver and various other destinations, it just fulfils the requirement.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:35972px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The last point I would like to make, Sir, as was mentioned by honourable Koya and also the 
<br>honourable Prime Minister is that the opportunities for young Fijians, the talent pool that we have.  We 
<br>have seen, for example, Sir, mushrooming a lot of local talent, we have seen dance groups, Government 
<br>currently, for example, provides the 200 percent or 300 percent tax rebates so hotels that go and hire </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">meke</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> 
<br>groups, hire bands, hire dance groups, restaurants and various other places and they should pay their 
<br>money for that, they actually claim rebates from us at a much higher rate.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:36069px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">So we have seen that local talent feed into that, we also have a requirement as part of getting the 
<br>rebate that  you have to  work  with the  Fiji National University, the  Film  School.  Some of them  are 
<br>working now with lighting, behind the scene we have seen a lot of work with the sound, that is all building 
<br>talent  and  it  provides  a  lot  opportunities  for  young  Fijians  to  be  able  to  step  into  the  arts.    As  the 
<br>honourable Prime Minister said, God willing one of these days we will see a Fijian winning an Academy 
<br>Award and we have a lot of faith in our young people and they have an enormous level of hidden talents 
<br>which we want to tap into.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Chairman and his Committee 
<br>for this recommendation on these two Annual Reports for Film Fiji.

<br>to court.  Were there investigations carried out?  Was FICAC investigations carried out?  What is the 
<br>conclusion of that?  It is important as a Government to ensure that things come to conclusion of what has 
<br>been done.

<br>against a consultant for the structural failure.  What is the status of that now?  Legal action has been taken.  
<br>What is the result of that legal action, particularly for the consultant and the failure of the river bank 
<br>upgrade whether in Sigatoka Town or other villages nearby - Yavulo, Sigatoka, Nayawa and Laselase?

<br>consulting and structural work?  It has failed.  How much has it cost us? Those are what we need to know 
<br>and need to be clarified to the Sigatoka people and the public at large.  So, it is important to conclude 
<br>with those and come out with a status of those projects, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:37839px; width:483px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">On  Nabouwalu,  Keiyasi,  Korovou  and  Seaqaqa  town  developments,  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Government ensures that the development of those satellite towns and major projects be completed by

What was the deadline?  I understand it was 2016, we 
<br>have gone past that.  Again, promised for the 2018 Elections and, again, 2018 has passed.   Now, we are 
<br>still talking about the development of Nabouwalu in 2022, six years or seven years later on.  So it is 
<br>important that when we have a deadline to meet, we must ensure that the funding, resources and expertise 
<br>are spent and done on it to ensure that the projects are completed within that time or a little bit past that 
<br>time.  That is acceptable to the people. So, it is important that the scheduled deadlines are known for the 
<br>Nabouwalu, Keiyasi, Korovou and Seaqaqa town developments.  But if you cannot complete it, do not 
<br>worry, we will come next year and complete it.

For Nabouwalu, it is important to 
<br>encourage economic development in the area to ensure that the township of Nabouwalu is meaningful 
<br>for agricultural purposes, industrial and manufacturing.  We need to open up areas.  Land is available 
<br>there that can be used for agricultural, industrial and commercial purposes.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:38101px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">There needs to be a plan and vision surrounding Nabouwalu to develop economic activities to 
<br>ensure livelihood and meaningful development of such a township.  Before you can have a township like 
<br>that, it is important to have a secure source of energy, particularly in Nabouwalu that has been diesel all 
<br>along. At 10 o’clock at night, you off the generator until morning at about 4 o’clock or 6 o’clock, then 
<br>you switch it on again.  We need the power that can work 24 hours a day for seven days a week, 365 days 
<br>a year all around.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:38198px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">It is important to ensure power is secure and as I have already mentioned and I need to repeat it - 
<br>there are many sources of power around there that you need to connect them to ensure larger sources of 
<br>energy around that area supply power, light, et cetera, to Nabouwalu and the whole of Bua, particularly 
<br>the hydro in Nuku.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:38267px; width:483px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">I just want to repeat that in my village of Navakasali, Nuku, it is important to ensure that hydro is 
<br>completed.    Feasibility  studies  have  been  carried  out  since  2004  and  was  completed.    I  think  the 
<br>honourable Seruiratu was the Commissioner Northern at that time, but I think it was already filed with

<br>I was talking about in Navakasali, Wainunu in Bua.  In that study, it was mentioned that it is bigger than 
<br>the one at Bagata.  It can supply more energy, than the one at Bagata.  The one at Bagata feeds Savusavu, 
<br>up to Botonitoba (I think) and down to Nakorovatu.  It is quite a large area, so if you develop that one 
<br>here  in  Nuku,  Navakasali,  Wainunu,  Bua  with  a  bigger  energy,  you  can  electrify  Dreketi,  Lekutu, 
<br>Wainunu, Kubulau and may be right down to Nabouwalu.  But if you join that hydro with Nasawana, 
<br>Driti and Dama in Lekutu and the pine grid in Wairiki, then we can have a network of power supply there 
<br>that will electrify Nabouwalu Town and all other villages in the Bua Province. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:38662px; width:483px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">If you can have a biomass in Dreketi to make use of all the waste around there in Vanua Levu, 
<br>Macuata, Bua and Cakaudrove, well and fine.  It adds on to the supply of energy or power to Nabouwalu 
<br>and surrounding areas. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are important areas that we need look into it and declare 
<br>fax  free  zone  for  Nabouwalu,  to  encourage  people  to  invest  in  the  industrial  and  manufacturing 
<br>developments that we can go into, and housing for the increase in population.  We need population for a 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">thriving town so we have to develop economic resources, housing and infrastructure to ensure a viable 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">town is to be successful, Mr. Speaker.

<br>will have a lot more energy around Bua itself and we can do that in other areas as well, to be a source of 
<br>development wherever.   So it is important to have that in mind, but if you cannot do it, forget it, we will 
<br>do it next year. Thank you, Sir.

<br>the challenges that we actually face in implementing new town projects post-2018.  In 2019 and 2020, 
<br>we all know we faced the full brunt of COVID-19, which actually resulted in reprioritisation of the budget 
<br>that was allocated for capital projects to assist in the COVID-19 Response.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Project for obvious reasons, as the Fijian Government was investing resources in unemployment support 
<br>and economic recovery initiatives.

<br>engineering studies conducted.  We were required to take some remedial action, specifically with respect 
<br>to Nabouwalu, and worked on redesigning of the stormwater drainage around the proposed town centre

<br>10-acre site next to the market. I have been on the ground myself, Mr. Speaker, and the 40-acre beside 
<br>Tailevu North College.  The Ministry will be able to register and secure the leases in this financial year 
<br>and thereafter, the comprehensive scheme plans for both sites will be prepared by the Ministry in this 
<br>financial year, along with the engineering designs.

Again, we have been left 
<br>with a legacy issue because these towns now sit in rivers. We have to be very careful about what we build 
<br>and what is actually used in terms of the ground work that has actually been done.

<br>the Waibula River to mitigate any future risk of flooding the Town and we may also have to build some 
<br>embankment, like they have done towards Sigatoka, Sir.  At the moment, there is no local expertise in 
<br>that particular field, Mr. Speaker.

<br>grown, but having said this, Sir, we are actually fully focused and committed to completing and delivering 
<br>these particular projects within the set timelines.  But as I have said, there are no excuses.  These are 
<br>practical problems that have been faced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is genuinely a practical problem, and it 
<br>is not an excuse.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I hope that clarifies the issue, and I thank the Committee for

<br>has  improved  the  audit  qualification.  The  Ministry  recruited  five  Accounts  personnel,  including  a

<br>after qualified people were recruited by the Ministry under OMRS.  To-date, Sir, the Ministry continues 
<br>with the in-house capacity building on procedures and processes for effective management of internal

<br>monitor governance in order to be preventative and proactive.

<br>of capital projects, in particular the Lautoka Swimming Pool, Govind Park and Sigatoka River Bank 
<br>Upgrade.  All three projects mentioned in the Committee Report were not completed as scheduled.  The 
<br>Ministry has to make sure that the work is done in accordance to the scope of work, work is of high 
<br>standard and quality is maintained and delivered within the approved cost and time.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:42395px; width:482px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Because of disputes, the projects were delayed.  The initial step is to amicably resolve the issue 
<br>and when this fails, the matter is either filed in the court or peer review option is taken to get the work 
<br>assessed independently on a mutually agreed terms of reference.  Such was the case with these projects 
<br>mentioned in the Standing Committee Report.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:42464px; width:482px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a dispute between Lautoka City Council consultant and contractors 
<br>that caused delay in completing this project.  To resolve the dispute, a peer review exercise was carried 
<br>out by an independent consultant to audit and validate the works carried out by the lead consultant and 
<br>the  contractors  so  far.    The  findings  and  recommendations  in  the  final  report  by  the  consultant  will 
<br>determine the way forward.  We are optimistic that we will be able to complete this project as we go 
<br>along.

<br>understand the difference between public-funded projects and personally when you develop a house or 
<br>any other project that you carry out as in individual.  There is a lot of difference between the two.  If you 
<br>carry out your own project, it is your money, you decide how you are going to use, you will not be calling 
<br>for tender, you will not be calling for other things, you will simply get your plan approved, and if you 
<br>find a good contractor that you think is good, you will give the job to that person.  That is how easy it is.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:42658px; width:485px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">However,  for  the  public-funded  projects,  there  are  financial  regulations  to  be  used,  there  are 
<br>certain other requirements to be met, because we also have to take care of safety and security when it 
<br>comes to any project that we deliver.  There are layers of scrutiny undertaken for that particular project 
<br>because at the end of the day, the Government will be held accountable for it, so we understand that.  
<br>Sometimes,  we  often  actually  depend  on  experts,  whether  it  is  an  architect,  engineer,  consultants, 
<br>plumbers, electricians or whoever they are - they are professionals.  They know the job better.   We rely 
<br>on them.  But if they are not able to deliver the work as expected, what do you expect us to do then?

<br>for example, taking the matter to court and peer review is another way of amicably solving the issue, and 
<br>if we are not able to strike a balance, of course, the matter will go to court.

<br>go into dispute as well and sometimes their project is not completed for one year, two years or even three 
<br>years.  That is the reality on the ground.  So, let us not come here and say that this is the only issue with 
<br>public projects.  It is also an issue with individual projects, but as I have mentioned that we have layers 
<br>and layers of requirements to meet, it is only for good governance that we do that.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">announcement is made, as if we are carrying a magic wand and through this magic wand, we will be able

P.D.  KUMAR.-  Again,  there  is  a  preparatory  phase,  consultation  phase  and  land 
<br>acquisition phase.  Announcement is made, it takes time to complete that, and this is not the case with 
<br>only  local  government  in  Fiji,  it  is  a  case  with  all  local  governments  around  the  world.    For  your 
<br>information,  simple  projects  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand  can  take  30  years  to  complete.    A  good

<br>here we are, we have Opposition Members who do not read, they do not understand how the system 
<br>works but they come here expecting things to be done overnight.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:43439px; width:485px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to correct honourable Qereqeretabua as she has said that the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Special Administrator that we appointed for Sigatoka and Nadi,  Mr. Adish Naidu, we approached him.  
<br>In  fact,  no,  he  applied,  and  when  he  applied  we  did  not  consider  his  political  affiliation.    If  we  had 
<br>considered his political affiliation, probably we would not have appointed him in 2020 but we did because 
<br>we believed in giving any work or putting anyone in a board or as special administrator based on merit - 
<br>that is what we did.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:43536px; width:485px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">But let us look around Sigatoka and Nadi.  Where do you development in Nadi, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  
<br>What new things have come up in Nadi?  So these were the reasons as to why we had to let go the whole 
<br>team for Sigatoka and Nadi so that we can appoint people who can get the job done.  This is as simple as 
<br>that. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:43605px; width:485px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to stress on another point; when the Opposition come to his House, 
<br>they think that there is a lot of money sitting somewhere which can be pulled out as and when needed.  
<br>And  if  you  compare  our  national  budget  of  Fiji,  it  is  around  $3.6  -  $3.8  billion  as  compared  to  just 
<br>Auckland City Council.  Auckland City Council have a budget 10 times more than the national budget

<br>is picking up and you have heard in the last Budget, the Ministry of Economy has given around $2.8

<br>ground or in the river.  It cannot hold, so there was some problem with the design.  When you have a 
<br>problem like this, I would like to ask honourable Qereqeretabua, through you Mr. Speaker, Sir, what do 
<br>you expect us to do?  It was a contract signed by two parties and the service provider did not provide the

<br>the honourable Minister for updating us.  I would like to share some other information on the Sigatoka 
<br>River Bank Project from the audit which was carried out.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:100px; top:44948px; width:450px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size:12px"></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size:12px">  </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The Council had used funds totalling $619,708 from the total grant received of $845,000.  
<br>However,  the  project  was  yet  to  be  completed  due  to  structural  failure  defects  noted,  as 
<br>updated by the honourable Minister.  But some of the interesting issues about that project 
<br>which I feel should have been adequately addressed may be there was not enough monitoring 
<br>and oversight. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:100px; top:45031px; width:447px; height:12px;"><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size:12px"></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size:12px">  </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The Council did not tender the works carried out for landfill upgrade which costs the Council 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:121px; top:45045px; width:69px; height:12px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">over $10,000.

<br>addressed and if the tender works was not carried out, then what disciplinary action has been taken? A 
<br>total payment of $54,086 was made to an Engineer, even though there was no contract in place between 
<br>the Council and the Engineer. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:45142px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Again, who is responsible?  Was there any contract?  Has these funds been recovered? Again, I 
<br>understand it is going through the court. There was no evidence to indicate the basis on which the engineer 
<br>was elected, that the Council sought confirmation or undertook reasonable steps to ascertain the ability 
<br>of the contractor and engineer to undertake such project.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:45211px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">There was a variance of $100,731 was noted between the balance utilised as per the work in 
<br>progress amount and the details of payments provided by the Council.  A payment of $75,651 was made 
<br>to the contractor in 2018 for the second progress payment, even though the Progress Payment Certificate 
<br>provided by the Project Manager for this payment was not signed. Again, how did this happen?  This 
<br>smells like corruption and collusion. Has this money been recovered? 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:45294px; width:485px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The Management of the Council agreed with this findings and also measures to recover. So what 
<br>I  am  asking  is;  what  has  been  done  about  this  because  these  are  major  anomalies?  Here,  we  have 
<br>everything and all sort of things reported to FICAC but this case has not been reported, so there needs to 
<br>be further investigation.  I know that the honourable Minister has updated us but those details point to 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">other things which need to be actioned on and reported - not only exposing anomalies in the process.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">They  did  some  things  in  terms  of  the  tender  process  but  also  the  management  of  the  contract,  the 
<br>monitoring of the performance in terms of the contract, et cetera, even before this stage of payment, but 
<br>payments were made.

<br>commitment, to ensure that we make space for more modern and sophisticated development planning.  
<br>Past Governments in Fiji used to go about urban development as if they will all die the next day, as if 
<br>roads would never needed to be widened, water pipes would never needed to be replaced and buildings 
<br>would  never  needed  to  be  taller  than  palm  trees.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  do  not  work  that  way,  my 
<br>Government considers and plans for development over decades.  We work towards a long term vision 
<br>that accommodates for future needs before they become urgent - life or death matters.  I commend the 
<br>Ministry of Local Government for applying a lens of strategic innovation to the policies that are relevant 
<br>to town and residential planning.

<br>of, and I am quoting her directly here; “…the explosion of informal settlements in our cities and towns 
<br>around the country under this Government.”  That is a lie and there is no surprise.  Lynda has never been 
<br>a leader and has always been disingenuous.  She lied when she stood in this Chamber, and she continues 
<br>to do so ever since she ran out from her voters.  The truth is that, the explosion in informal settlements 
<br>happened during the mass expiry of land leases among farmers during the SDL Government.  That is part 
<br>of the mess they left that we are cleaning up now.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:46620px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Government does not create problems, we solve them.  We are the 
<br>Government that is regularising squatters in informal settlements - to grant them the dignity and stability 
<br>of secure tenure where we can.  We are the Government that is creating solutions to the longstanding 
<br>rural to urban drift and the corresponding need for wider scope of development in peri-urban, rural and 
<br>maritime  areas.    That  work  is  twofold,  we  must  ensure  our  towns  and  cities  can  reliably  serve  their 
<br>residents, and we must ensure that services are readily available in the rural and maritime areas in Fiji so 
<br>that people who want to stay where they live can do so. The revised Act will address how we plan for the 
<br>expansion of our towns and cities and generally, a more equitable Fiji.

<br>made from the other side,  on Page 11 of the Committee’s recommendations,  the first recommendation 
<br>is  that,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Community  Development  complete  the  review  of  the  National 
<br>Housing Policy which is pending  due to COVID-19 pandemic.  None of the speakers actually spoke 
<br>about that.  The honourable Prime Minister, of course, has alluded about the squatter growth and the 
<br>reasons as to why there has been a squatter growth.

In 2019, there was 
<br>a Policy Advisor who was appointed with funding assistance from New Zealand, the Ministry of Foreign 
<br>Affairs and Trade (MFAT), to assist the Ministry.  The National Housing Policy review has reached the 
<br>consultation phase but, of course, was disrupted as a result of the pandemic and which we are going out 
<br>to members of the public and that will continue.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">number of informal settlements throughout Fiji that we are in the process of formalising.  No one spoke 
<br>about this but in respect of the work we have already had, for example, in the lot allocation, these sites 
<br>have already completed: Ledrusasa in Nadi, Cuvu in Nadroga and Waidamudamu in the Central Division 
<br>(near Goat Road), just before you reach Koronivia.

<br>Division and Wakanisila and Sasawira in the Central Division.  We have scheme plans now for Nabara 
<br>and Delaisaweni in the Western Division. There is quite a lot of work going on, Sir.  Of course, we have 
<br>the following projects that have been allocated in the 2022-2023 Budget:  Capital works will commence 
<br>in Sakoca, 30 percent of the works have already been completed; Tavela, as I mentioned; Tore Field 4,

<br>five or seven years of development lease.  Because there are over 40 sites, we are also looking at some 
<br>public private partnerships in respect of developing those sites because if we continue to depend solely

<br>when  you  look  at  various  policy  measures,  you  do  not  do  these  things  in  a  silo.    Honourable 
<br>Qereqeretabua’s comments are very (what I call) “ siloistic”, apart from being pedestrian.  Why was not 
<br>this done?

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">not very conducive.  It is not flat land, there are various creeks and rivers.  The soil texture is so prone to 
<br>landslides.  If you go down further East towards the fish market, you will see it gets inundated by rising 
<br>tides because of inundation of waters due to rising sea levels.  These are challenges.  You do not just flick 
<br>a finger and it all goes away.

<br>sarcasm  and  making  those  comments,  obviously,  do  not  appreciate  the  fact  that  these  are  everyday 
<br>challenges that we face.  What they do not also mention is that, this is the only Government that actually 
<br>said, “Let us build a town in Nabouwalu.”  This is the only Government that said, “Let us build a town 
<br>in Keiyasi, let us build a town in Seaqaqa.  Get some municipality set up.  Let us get streetlights.  Let us 
<br>get water.  Let us get electricity.”  They do not mention that at all.

All their comments this week, 
<br>they stand up and talk about elections.  Of course, this is marked by the large absence from their chairs.  
<br>The  fact  is  that,  we  have  also  called  out  Members  of  Parliament  -  we  have  called  out  honourable 
<br>Tuisawau,  honourable  Bulanauca,  honourable  Gavoka  and  every  one  of  them,  exactly  on  the  same 
<br>matters that honourable Qereqeretabua has made.   Just because we point out to her, she says that we are 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">being misogynistic.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:47926px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">I think that is actually quite derogatory.  Just to hide behind that comment and saying we have 
<br>been misogynistic.  So that means biologically, following through that if we do not pick on anything that 
<br>she says, if we do not point out that the narrative is wrong, if we point out to her that she got the law 
<br>wrong, then it is okay.  That I think is an insult to many other women, who are highly intelligent.  They 
<br>will not mind actually having a useful discussion or constructive discussion, but the moment you point 
<br>out anything to her, it is about misogyny.  She does not pick on the fact that her leader made misogynistic 
<br>comments about journalists in Fiji.  Not a word, not a word about that comment.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think 
<br>it is quite unbecoming to hide behind that.

<br>consultations, honourable Qereqeretabua, like at least honourable Rasova turned up and two or three of 
<br>his other colleagues, we had been inviting them since 2014, they bothered not to come.  They would have

When  you  have  three 
<br>cyclones in one season, we already had a budget approved, you have to divert funds for funds that are not 
<br>being used or funds actually that could be put on hold.  What she is saying is that, “Oh well, do not worry 
<br>about those people whose electricity poles have fallen down and the roads being cut off from their villages 
<br>or the bridges gone away, do not worry about them but continue building the town, because we will stand 
<br>up and criticise you, if you do not build the town.”  That is what she is saying. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:48390px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not understand the fundamentals of running a Government.  You have 
<br>to divert the funds.  We had only one cyclone in the last season, but the road was completely washed out 
<br>at the highway near Maro, Kabisi, the entire highway went.  One lane went near Semo, one lane went 
<br>near Nalawa.  We have to build the highway, and we have to get the money from somewhere, people are 
<br>not going to be disconnected, if we discontinue with the Nabouwalu Project for a period of time but 
<br>people will be disconnected, if we do not build the road.  It just makes logical sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br>and the other point I wish to also make is that, all governments have this issue.  In fact, we recently had, 
<br>a couple of years ago with ADB too.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:48515px; width:482px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">There is a Government Tender Board, if government tenders out work.  A lot of the municipal 
<br>council works for example, goes to the Municipal Tender Board.  They have their own tender process 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">but, as has been highlighted by honourable Tuisawau and I hope he understood what he was reading out 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">that the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) now, from the Ministry of Economy has been called in 
<br>to provide their expertise to the Municipal Councils, to be able to assist them to get across some of these 
<br>difficult situations they have found themselves in, because CIU is a much bigger organisation and they 
<br>handle much bigger contracts.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:48625px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tension is, do you give it to the cheapest tender?  He says no.  Now, if 
<br>tomorrow for example, Sir, this is not an easy issue because sometimes, you may have some who may 
<br>tender for a work that is $7 million.  The next highest could be $11 million or the next cheapest, I should 
<br>say.  There is a weighing of these issues.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:48694px; width:483px; height:122px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">In the same way, we have said to the ADB, we no longer can give the road works to the cheapest 
<br>company  because  they  may  not  have  a  good  outcome,  as  far  as  the  quality  of  the  construction  is 
<br>concerned, as far as the longevity of the project is concerned because you have some companies, they 
<br>may be very cheap but there may be a lot of variations.  Some companies may be very cheap, after they 
<br>have completed the work, there is potholes within three months but ADB told us to give it to the cheapest 
<br>company, so we are stuck, so honourable Rasova drives on the road and said oh government is useless, 
<br>there is a pothole after three months.  But we had actually followed a particular tender process through 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">the ADB and we have said to them we no longer want to do this.  We also need to look at quality.  In the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">same way for government tender works also, we need to look at quality now, not the cheapest.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:48832px; width:483px; height:150px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">I know honourable Tuisawau would pick it up and say I know there was a tender for $7 million, 
<br>why have you not given it to him.  He was the cheapest or must have been underhand dealing, that is why 
<br>you gave it to the other guy.  That is what they all stand here and pontificate.  Honourable Qereqeretabua 
<br>says oh FICAC.  How can you FICAC somebody?  You report the matter to FICAC but before you report 
<br>any matter to FICAC, you need to exhaust, you need to establish whether there is any untoward dealing 
<br>and let me say this again, Sir, this is the only government that has not hesitated to report people to FICAC 
<br>both within government, within the civil service, within the municipal councils.  Honourable Premila 
<br>Kumar will tell you how many people they have reported to FICAC, as far as Municipal Councils are 
<br>concerned.  How many civil servants?  The scam that has been revealed under this government and they 
<br>have the audacity to come here and say that we only are selective or it is a political machination that is in 
<br>place.

<br>this whole conspiracy about we give stuff to people or we do not give stuff to people just because they 
<br>support NFP or support some other party.  There are currently engineers, who through the government 
<br>tender process, have won tenders and they actually are open supporters and donors to NFP.  But they 
<br>have the contracts fair and square.  They do not mention that.  But they and their supporters including 
<br>SODELPA go and harass our people, who are actually legitimate donors.  They belittle them.  They troll 
<br>them.  Yet this is a government that gives people awards or tenders based on merit, not on their political 
<br>affiliation.  If that was the case, then Adish Naidu would have never got that job.

<br>did you select him.  He applied.  See, this is the level of obfuscation that takes place and I can tell you, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">Sir, this article that I am holding up again is a completely perfect example of the amount of obfuscation 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">and disingenuity that comes from the Opposition. Here we have the Leader of NFP saying, “do no pay 
<br>superannuation,  do  not  pay  FNPF”  and  then  he  stands  up  two  days  ago  saying  we  should  have  not 
<br>deducted or reduced FNPF when here he is saying, “take it off completely”.  When he says, “I never said 
<br>that you should have a pay cut”, over here he says “cuts civil servants pay by 30 percent” in your favourite 
<br>tabloid.  That is the culture that exists in that party and I am afraid to say it is creeping into SODELPA 
<br>too. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:49544px; width:482px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last one I want to make, honourable Tuisawau made about how tenders may 
<br>not be called.  As you would know working at USP when those days when USP used to be somewhat 
<br>okay that there are certain thresholds.  As you know, for example honourable Jale will tell you that if you 
<br>have,  for  example,  works that  would be less than  a  particular threshold,  you do not actually  call for 
<br>tenders.    You  do  not  go  and  call  for  tender  for  something  that  is  going  to  be  $5,000,  you  get  three 
<br>quotations.

<br>thresholds.  You did not bother to find out what was the threshold, you said $10,000, maybe the threshold 
<br>was $20,000.  Did you bother to find out if they have got three quotations or not?  But you stand up in 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Parliament and make these comments trying to create disquiet and saying I am just reading the report.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">You have an added responsibility, Sir, to actually get all the facts before you stand up and talk about a 
<br>particular issue.

<br>highlighted the works pertaining to Town and Country Planning and so as the honourable Minister.  I 
<br>would  like  to  commend  the  Committee,  some  of  the  Members  of  the  Opposition  have  said  that  the 
<br>Committee has highlighted and said the work should be completed too.  I also would like to urge the 
<br>Committee to perhaps go deeper and find out exactly why sometimes these works are not completed. 
<br>There are various reasonings behind it, there are very rationale reasons and very good reasons behind the 
<br>non-completion of sites on time or indeed there are supply chain issues.

<br>we will blame this  on  the  Ukraine war.  In fact, it is  a huge insult, there  are people today in various 
<br>countries that do not get access to food as a result of the war in Russia and Ukraine. Women and children

<br>I also wish to acknowledge the executive management and service men and women of the National Fire 
<br>Authority.  Although my contribution will not focus on the Report, for a few reasons I wanted to speak 
<br>on this motion particularly based on the achievements, the progress and maybe the honourable Minister 
<br>responsible will elaborate further on this; the achievements and the progress made by this institution 
<br>since this Report.

<br>their best in terms of debt recovery so that they can sustain their own operations and of course contribute 
<br>to the overall development as well, not only in their specific area of work but of course in the wider 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">development needs of Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is an organisation that we can say has made 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">significant progress particularly in terms of its revenue collection, an institution that used to struggle 
<br>previously. Of course there are challenges, the laws that we have and affordability as well when it comes 
<br>to new rates, insurance and so forth that most of the people that we live within the municipal boundaries 
<br>particularly do face.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:52193px; width:483px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  did  not  contribute  in  the  previous  motion  on  local  government  and 
<br>environment because I would want to speak when we have this motion debated.  But if you can allow me 
<br>just to say are few things, additional to what has been aired here in the previous motion, particularly in 
<br>terms of the delays in the municipal councils about the implementation of projects.  As the honourable 
<br>Prime Minister, the honourable Minister for Economy and the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, 
<br>Tourism and Transport stated that it is not that simple. This is not the only Government that has these 
<br>huge delays in big projects, Sir.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:52303px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">I would recall that in Labasa there has been plans for ages to move Labasa Town to the other side 
<br>of the river, but that has never taken place until 2008.  Now we have Damodar building their new complex 
<br>there, FNU although the project is stalled and that has been discussed already in this Parliament.  We now 
<br>see new investments taking place but that is a typical example of what has been in the pipeline for so long 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">but never implemented, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Of course, there are some self-interest as well in that, that 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">delayed the project but these are typical examples.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:52400px; width:483px; height:108px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Labasa Hospital, I remember when the honourable Prime Minister came in 
<br>one of his earlier visits to Vanua Levu and he was briefed by the Ministry of Health staff then (SDMO) 
<br>about the project, that has taken about 10 years or so but still not completed.  What was projected to be a 
<br>$3 million or $4 million project has reached about $12 million and yet it is not completed. The honourable 
<br>Prime Minister made a promise that within 12 months from this date we will complete this hospital and 
<br>services will be provided to the people.  So that was delivered but delayed.  It is not that simple as seems 
<br>to  be  portrayed  by  are  few  Members  who  probably  have  not  had  enough  experience  in  serving  in 
<br>institutions as such.

<br>improvements in this organisation that probably is worth mentioning in Parliament. Over the last few 
<br>years, the National Fire Authority has constructed nine fire stations throughout the divisions particularly 
<br>the Central, Northern and the Western Divisions.  In the Northern Division, Taveuni, who would imagine

I am 
<br>saying this as the Minister responsible for rural development.  The new Fire Station in Savusavu, one in 
<br>Seaqaqa although we are talking about Seaqaqa being declared as a town but the Fire Station is already 
<br>there.  It brings a lot of confidence and assurance to the communities in Seaqaqa when we have this 
<br>facility there.  We are talking about Nabouwalu becoming a town.  There is already a Fire Station state 
<br>of the art sitting in Nabouwalu as we speak today, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

In the West one in Rakiraki Town, 
<br>one in Korolevu.  In this year’s budget, $1million has been allocated for a new Fire Station in Navua 
<br>Town.  This is an achievement that probably is beyond the imagination of most of our communities but 
<br>of course thankful to this Government and the Executive Management of the National Fire Authority - 
<br>these projects are happening throughout Fiji.

I wish 
<br>to commend them particularly on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HADR).  They play 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">an important role in rescue operations, particularly water rescue in the provision of water for hospitals, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">schools, Government facilities and even in the cleaning up of towns and cities - they play a prominent 
<br>role.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:53057px; width:488px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Provision of manpower:  As I have said this is beyond their areas of responsibilities as they deliver 
<br>rations, they do extra work and also even in the Emergency Operation Centres (EOCs) at the Division or 
<br>at the district level, they form the core of the operations and the planning team in the respective Divisions.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:53112px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">An area that we are also progressing together with the NFA is the possibility of using them as 
<br>well. This is something that we learnt from the Australians and the New Zealand fire fighters, particularly, 
<br>during  </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">TC  Winston</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">  when  they  were  also  able  to  do  structural  damage  assessments  on  buildings.    I 
<br>remember that the school in Vanuabalavu was assessed by the Fire Authority Australia and New Zealand 
<br>and this hopefully will be covered. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:53195px; width:488px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Most recently, just over the weekend the unfortunate incident in Kasavu, we saw the fire fighters 
<br>again doing rescue and trying to do their best but unfortunately we lost two senior citizens as a result of 
<br>that incident but this is something that needs to be acknowledged.  Their presence as I have alluded to in 
<br>the Divisions, particularly in the rural stations has brought a lot of confidence to the local communities 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">and not only that, they are very much part of the national building process in their respective communities.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:53278px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Another benefit that is coming out of these places is the value of the properties has improved 
<br>because of NFA’s presence in those areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Like other Disciplined Forces, the NFA is 
<br>very prominent in sports as well these days, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is our national teams, particularly in rugby 
<br>– Rugby 7s and 15s.  We have members of the NFA in these teams.  Therefore, I feel obliged to express 
<br>our appreciation to an organisation that deserves to be given that, as I have alluded to earlier on, based on 
<br>the progress and the developments that have taken place in the institution over the years.

On 
<br>Recommendation No. 1 - a Community Fire Warden framework be implemented in all communities to 
<br>raise the level of awareness on fire prevention and mitigation.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:53756px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very important recommendation based on the fact that previously, there 
<br>used  to  be  voluntary  services  which  have  now  been  regularised  into  regular  fire  officers.    This 
<br>recommendation was brought about when we asked questions to the Chairman and members of his staff 
<br>that it would be another stepping stone for our community to find a permanent employment in the field 
<br>of NFA.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:53838px; width:485px; height:80px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Recommendation  No.  2  -  recognise  the  importance  of  taking  the  NFA  services  to  the  rural 
<br>communities  and  recommend  that  future  plan  establishment  be  prioritised  and  implemented.    The 
<br>honourable Minister for Defence has alluded to that - the opening of the new NFA Station in Nabouwalu.  
<br>With regards to the budget, I am sure we were told that there would be a sub-station coming up in Matei 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">in the near future, and we look forward to that.  It is important that fire services is centralised to the rural 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">communities as well.

<br>vehicle fleet that are conducive to all road conditions and comply with international standards.  I am sure 
<br>this is important recommendation as well and hope that the NFA will take that on board, based on the 
<br>fact that they need the vehicles to transport water and Fire Officers to the various parts where they are 
<br>needed and in doing so that the vehicle itself has to be conducive to the road conditions, especially the 
<br>hilly parts for where they serve.  That is my contribution Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I wish the NFA well in 
<br>their service to the country.  </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Vinaka.

<br>Keeping our people safe is of utmost importance to my Government and NFA plays a crucial part in 
<br>ensuring that we are able to do so.

<br>risk reduction and fire response and suppression services, significantly minimising the effects of fire and 
<br>related life-threatening emergencies.  Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 21 Fire Stations in the country, 
<br>eight of which were commissioned in the last five years.

<br>we continue to invest in improving our emergency services.  My Government recognises the critical need 
<br>for access to efficient and effective emergency services for all Fijians.  Additionally, by investing in this 
<br>critical sector, we also increase business and homeowner confidence, and reassure investors that Fiji can 
<br>provide the safe environment they are looking for.

<br>mainly electrical-related.  This has continued to be a concern as NFA reported that they responded to 687 
<br>structural fires across the country from 2017 to 2021.  Fire safety should be of paramount concern and 
<br>priority for all Fijians and I urge everyone to be vigilant.

<br>settlements around Fiji to implement the Community Fire Warden Framework in the next five years.  The 
<br>Authority  received  positive  feedbacks  from  the  communities  where  Community  Fire  Warden  is

<br>Community Fire Wardens in 23 communities.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these Community Fire Wardens were 
<br>trained  in  the  area  of  fire  safety  surveillance  so  that  fire  safety  compliance  are  met  within  their 
<br>communities or villages.  And at this point, I want to respond to honourable Dr. Lalabalavu’s question.  
<br>He was asking whether these Community Fire Wardens will be absorbed in the service and whether they 
<br>will find an employment.  This is a volunteer programme which is launched by NFA and this is only to 
<br>protect the village and communities. So, when these wardens are trained, particularly in the surveillance 
<br>work and compliance, they will be able to check the village to see that people meet that compliance.

<br>services to rural communities.  Even though is legally mandated to operate within the boundaries, they

<br>This is in accordance with the Government mandate to provide same level of services received by urban

<br>Programme in all Divisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Programme includes daily activities in all Fire Stations 
<br>around the country, involving house to house visits, business house visits and school visits.  For general 
<br>awareness, radio and television advertisement on fire safety messages are used. Radio Talk Back Shows, 
<br>Buses carrying fire safety messages and fire safety tips on billboards are placed.  In addition, the Authority 
<br>conducts  Fire  Safety  Training  for  relevant  businesses.  This  training  in  designed  after  Fire  Safety 
<br>Compliance Inspections are carried out in the building premises.

<br>apparatus training, fire safety at work training and fire evacuation drills.  And as we have heard from the 
<br>honourable Prime Minister, the Authority attended to 687 structural fires across the country where Fijians 
<br>lost $288 million.  Further to the fire safety training, the Authority is in the process of developing its 
<br>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">current fleet includes; 21 twin cabs, 53 fire and specialised appliances, 9 emergency ambulances and 3 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">executive vehicles for 21 Fire Stations around the country.  Sir, NFA will be procuring another 2 x 3,000 
<br>litre fire trucks and 2 ambulances in this financial year with the Government grant.  And recently with 
<br>Government funding, NFA procured two 4 x 4 300 litre fire appliances at a cost of $900,000 which are 
<br>designed for rugged roads.

<br>Fiji (WAF) on fire hydrants and GIS mapping of water mains.  Such information will assist NFA to 
<br>demarcate areas which will need support in boosting the water, a water pressure during a fire emergency.  
<br>Discussion is going on with WAF to link GIS to NFA’s command centre.  This will help officers to liaise 
<br>with WAF contacts to boost water pressure where pressure is low during fire emergency.

<br>highlighted by the Committee.  I also take this opportunity to respond to honourable Saukuru, he raised 
<br>his concern that NFA is not collecting the debts.  This debt is related to uninsured properties so if the 
<br>property is uninsured when NFA provides services, then the property owners are charged.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:56390px; width:485px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Sir, NFA is working on a Cabinet Paper to amend section 22(e) because we realise that only 10 
<br>percent of properties in Fiji are insured and the chances are that fire can occur anywhere and when fire 
<br>occurs, people lose their properties, belongings and on top of that, they have to pay NFA and it is not fair.  
<br>We will be developing a Cabinet Paper on that Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br>available  to  NFA.    As  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  highlighted  and  also  the  honourable  Minister 
<br>highlighted, there has been a record number of outlets (I could say for one of the better word) for NFA 
<br>throughout Fiji.  In the past five years the allocation of $3.85 million for capital projects and also $2.3

<br>were provided the pathway to local work attachment that provides our young people with the opportunity

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:58381px; width:324px; height:12px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">and I want to thank the honourable Member for asking this question.

<br>export  agenda  up  until  the  early  1990s.    So  up  until  the  early  1990s,  non-sugar  primary  agricultural 
<br>produce (fresh and chilled) was never on the export agenda and there was no export strategy as well.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:58464px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, it prominence was never brought to the forefront for two reasons.  Firstly, sugar 
<br>exports from sugarcane, given its volume, value, number of farmers and households involved in it and a 
<br>historical significance, always overshadowed the small volume and value of primary produce exports that 
<br>was undertaken at that particular point in time.  The entire discourse was in terms of agricultural exports 
<br>and from sugarcane to sugar manufacturing and export, it was basically sugar.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:58546px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Secondly, because most of the primary produce was domestically sold and consumed, the surplus 
<br>was low, so mostly at that particular point in time, most of the non-sugar primary produce, such as </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">dalo</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">, 
<br>cassava or whatever, were mostly consumed domestically and that is how, at that particular time, the 
<br>target was with the Government and the Ministry.  So the surplus was a very small amount and that 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">surplus then was exported by a few exporters at that particular point in time.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:58629px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, all along, the strategy for non-sugar agricultural export was pretty much only 
<br>for food security at that particular point in time up until 1990s to feed the nation - food security.  So all 
<br>discussions  uptil  then,  resources  and  strategies  were  focused  on  sugarcane  production,  sugar 
<br>manufacturing, milling, exports, preferential price, subsidies and grants to the sugar industry.  Later on, 
<br>two other extractive sectors joined sugar – forest and fisheries.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:58712px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, over the last 25 years, we have seen the exports of non-sugar primary 
<br>produce emerging as a potential export sector, to reckon with.  Initially, it was driven by private sector 
<br>players  and  exporters.    So,  initially,  there  were  a  dozen  or  so  of  private  sector  exporters,  who  were 
<br>basically exporting at that particular point in time from the 1990s to early 2000, horticultural crops, fruits 
<br>and vegetables mostly from Sigatoka right up to Nadi and to some extent, Lautoka.

<br>landscape in Fiji.  Now, non-sugar agricultural exports (fresh and chilled) in 2021 stands at $121.3 million 
<br>whereas the traditional sugar export came down to $66.6 million.  The entire ball game has changed now.  
<br>It is the non-sugar agricultural exports.

Last year, kava alone, after consumption locally, is now $41.9 million 
<br>in export earnings, from $5.7 million in 2000 (21 years).     </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Dalo,</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> last year was $30.2 million from $12

<br>million.  The third most important export crop is turmeric.  From $0.1 million in 2000, so it was basically 
<br>a non-existence 21 years ago.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:59204px; width:483px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Ginger - $6.4 million now.  Ginger was a high export earner sometime back but due to complete 
<br>ban by Australia and all kinds of restrictions, the ginger exports have come down to $6.4 million and we 
<br>are working on that, together with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:59259px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Fruits  and  vegetables  is  now  $7.9  million  from  $4.7  million  about  eight  years  ago.    Poultry 
<br>products, one of the livestock sector that we are 100 percent self-sufficient is poultry products - $4.7 
<br>million export after feeding the entire nation.  It was $0.7 million about eight years ago.  So, Mr. Speaker, 
<br>Sir, this export income received is then shared amongst all the players in the supply chain. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:59328px; width:483px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Now, one must understand how important the agriculture sector is when they get to have a good 
<br>grasp of the entire supply chain.  Who are the players in the supply chain?  The landowners, farmers, 
<br>farm households, labourers, the financial sector players who are financing, the other input suppliers, the 
<br>hardware  shops,  fertilizer  companies,  exporters  and  middle  supply  chain  operators.    There  is  an  old 
<br>terminology that they use called “middlemen”, which is really not very sensitive in terms of gender.  So 
<br>I say that they are the middle supply chain operators.  Then we have Government coming in to facilitate 
<br>the various Ministries, including Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF) as well. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:59438px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those players sharing the proceeds, the country also benefits and grows 
<br>because the money then multiplies.  From the primary sector, the money is pushed to the non-urban area 
<br>for investment, the spending on supermarkets for the financial sector, et cetera.  So those have massive 
<br>multiplier effect.  From those  days,  we  now  see 375 active operators,  exporting our fresh  and chilled 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">produce from Fiji, surpassing our traditional sugar export. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:59507px; width:482px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the 2020 Census data, we have a total area of 194,768 hectare in a 
<br>rounded figure, 195 hectares of land under agriculture.  Of this, 54 percent of agriculture is undertaken 
<br>on  </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">mataqali  </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">land,  23.7  percent  agriculture  is  undertaken  on  land  lease  from  iTLTB,  13.9  percent  of 
<br>agriculture is undertaken on freehold land, 6 percent on State Land lease, 2.1 percent through informal 
<br>arrangement and 0.2 percent with no arrangement and the farmers are doing work on a small scale. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:59590px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, so agriculture sector directly employs more than 83,395 farmers, along with 
<br>additional labourers from the area.  Of these 83,395 farmers, 14 percent are female and 85 percent are 
<br>male.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Fiji no other sector contributes to interior rural development, as much as the 
<br>agriculture sector does, no other sector including tourism.

<br>areas,  I  am  using AMA  as  an  example.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2017-2018  AMA’s  total sale was $2.3 
<br>million, of these, 762,000 was exported.  Most of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is transferred to the rural area.  In

<br>particularly given what we are going through, is not that easy and it is very relevant as we progress in the 
<br>cases of handling hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine.

<br>Australia, New Zealand and even very closely Tonga; one of our closest neighbour is having serious 
<br>issues with hard drugs.  For us being the hub in the region, we are vulnerable and of course, we continue 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">to see the influx of illicit substances from within the region and of course, from outside the region as well.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">The recent discovery of drugs washed ashore in the Lau Group, is an indication of the movement of drugs 
<br>within the region.

<br>Out  of the 6,282,  302  are on methamphetamine, 22 cocaine and  5,958  cases are on marijuana.   The 
<br>honourable Member included heroine as well, there was no heroin confiscated in Fiji during this period.  
<br>But again, most of the cases are on marijuana but probably, we will focus more on the methamphetamine 
<br>(302) and the 22 cocaine cases.

<br>the question, which is very relevant as well.  Of course, we have had some cases but the majority of the 
<br>methamphetamine, the 302 cases are coming from offshore. I was told by the Police that the price is really 
<br>lucrative, it is about a million dollar to a kilogram now.  But we had instances where the ingredients, 
<br>materials were sourced locally and this is why we are going on the Illicit Substance Drug Act that we are 
<br>now trying to finalise with SG’s Office.  Because most of the materials or the ingredients can be available 
<br>in the local pharmacists, you can just Google, see how to cook it.

<br>is not with the Fiji Navy but with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport.  Both have links to the 
<br>IMO.  I wish to clarify as well the issues relating to this project.  At the outset, I wish to again extend our 
<br>profound appreciation to the Government of Australia for its continued partnership with Fiji, particularly 
<br>in supporting Fiji’s defence and security capabilities.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:62647px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the Maritime Essential Services Centre (MESC) as we 
<br>commonly refer to is being funded by the Australian Government as part of Fiji’s ever growing </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">Vuvale</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> 
<br>partnership with  Australia.   The MESC project  comes  at  a  cost of  around  AUS$38 million which is 
<br>equivalent to FJ$56.2million and will also create around 445 jobs depending on the various stages of the 
<br>project.  We all know that Black Rock has been completed and this is the next big project that has been 
<br>agreed between Australia and Fiji.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:62744px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Again, MESC will be an inter-agency facility which will essentially house the command element 
<br>of the Republic of Fiji Navy who are currently based at Stanley Brown Naval Base, Walu Bay; the Fiji 
<br>Hydrographic Office; the Fiji Maritime Surveillance and Rescue Coordination Centre and the 3DP Suva 
<br>Coastal Radio Station, and other normal facilities like gymnasium, mess hall, et cetera.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:62813px; width:483px; height:122px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, again we are thankful to the honourable Minister for Transport.  I need to clarify 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">this because the land is already a State land under MSAF.  We had other options, but, unfortunately, the 
<br>geotechnical survey ruled out the use of </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">RFNS Viti</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> in Togalevu and even in Walu Bay itself.  The ideal 
<br>location for us is in Lami.  For those who are not aware of this site, this is where the lower leading light 
<br>is located.  There are two that the ships use when they want to come into the harbour, the lower light and 
<br>the upper light.  So, once the two are aligned then you enter.  The facility is where the lower light is and 
<br>that is or was previously owned by MSAF.  We are thankful to the honourable Minister because we are 
<br>desperate to have the project proceed, and the honourable Minister came to our rescue and we are indeed 
<br>grateful for that.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:62951px; width:485px; height:150px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">There has been some issues raised lately but I must assure the general public that the consultations 
<br>began way back in 2019.  We started having consultations with the local communities.  Most recently, 
<br>because of some concerned  citizens, we have  again,  I  personally  tasked the Permanent Secretary  for 
<br>Defence to go and lead those discussions rather than the Australians who are there providing the project 
<br>management team because this is a national project belonging to the Ministry of Defence. We are to be 
<br>in the frontline and my Permanent Secretary is having discussions now with the communities in Lami 
<br>but the benefits are huge, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  An investment of approximately FJ$50 million, creation of 
<br>jobs and most importantly our roles as we have committed to under the IMO, particularly on hydrography.  
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">As you are well aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have an issue of unsurveyed waters and of course the need 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">for us to resurvey our waters as well.  So, when they have, with the ships available now and with a better 
<br>facility, we should be able to fast track all the outstanding works.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:63116px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">When we move up to that station as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to coastal radio  – 
<br>coastal radio monitors all the movement of the ships within the local waters.  We will have 100 percent 
<br>coverage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we move up to that location.  And of course, search and rescue, we 
<br>have that responsibility not only for Fiji but for our neighbouring islands as well – Kiribati and are few 
<br>others, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so we have that responsibility.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:63199px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we have this project in Lami, definitely the real estate value in the 
<br>surrounding areas will improve and most importantly that base alone will provide security to the area and 
<br>this is probably something that we need to assure our people that the base itself will bring security to the 
<br>people in there.  I will stop there for now, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:63622px; width:482px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, with farm roads, it is not only about accessing the market from the farm.  It 
<br>is from the village to the farm as well.  There are a number of places, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are still 
<br>organising our work to ensure that farmers have access to the farm, they can take machineries so that 
<br>they can take large scale work there, land clearing with machines.  Without a farm road, machinery 
<br>use is not possible.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:63705px; width:482px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">Directly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be opening up these farming areas to market and that again 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">gives incentives and boosts the moral for these farmers to expand their area, expand the production 
<br>and contribute to not only their development but national development as well.  It also, Mr. Speaker, 
<br>Sir, boosts the moral of the farming households who stay there, the children to go to school, go to 
<br>health centres, a lot of places.  Farm roads are used for more than farming activities and communities 
<br>do understand and appreciate the investment that we are making to construct these farm roads because 
<br>it immediately enhances the value of them staying in that particular area.

<br>On an average, 30 kilometres per year. We have got on our books now 243 kilometres of farm roads

<br>Now it is  not because suddenly  there  are these is  new  farm  roads that needs to be  established.   Mr. 
<br>Speaker, Sir, we have inherited these places where farmers have been struggling for so long and now over 
<br>the last 10 years started to construct farm roads then these requests are coming because Government is 
<br>now establishing these farm roads for them. Before Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no allocation for farm 
<br>road establishment, it is this Government who has decided that we will establish farm roads. So, Mr. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Speaker, Sir, 101 roads of a total of 243 kilometres needs to be established as now in our books.

Nukulau in 
<br>Ra, farm road work has started for this financial year, Lomaivuna in Naitasiri, farm road work started on 
<br>Monday for this financial year and Vunivau in Bua, farm road establishment started from today.

<br>take us years.  For that reason we have decided to have a combination of outsourcing using contractors 
<br>who have got a separate allocation for farm roads in the Budget as well using the machinery we have, as 
<br>well as the $7 million that has been allocated will also be utilised.  With the combination of these three 
<br>approaches, we are looking at, at least this financial year undertaking close to 80 kilometres of farm roads.

<br>roads that we have on our books now – 243 kilometres. The Central Division has 60 kilometres, Western 
<br>Division  has  38  kilometres,  Northern  Division  has  133  kilometres  (largest),  Eastern  Division  has  12

CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    I  thank  honourable  Kirpal  for  the 
<br>question.  The announcement made during the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting by the US Vice 
<br>President is significant for many reasons.  The US Treaty was first negotiated in 1983 and finalised in 
<br>1988.  It is a Treaty between Pacific Island nations and the US and has been the platform for collective 
<br>collaboration and partnership in which assistance and funding is channelled to the region.  The increase 
<br>to US$60 million represents a jump of 153.8 percent which will generate a total of $600 million during 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">the term of the agreement. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:64873px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the overall management and sustainable use of the Pacific region’s tuna stock 
<br>is accredited to the assistance of the US Tuna Treaty.  As a matter of fact, the Treaty led to the recognition 
<br>of  Pacific  Island’s  sovereign  rights  over  its  many  Exclusive  Economic  Zones  (EEZ).    This  was  a 
<br>milestone achievement given the fact that tuna stocks are highly in migratory and move across different 
<br>maritime boundaries. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:64956px; width:482px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2016 the US Government’s annual contribution under the Treaty was at 
<br>US$21 million.  These funds which are kept and administered by the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) are 
<br>equally divided between the 15 FFA members which includes Fiji.

<br>the  collective partnership under the Treaty  and meets the needs of the broader  FFA  membership.   It 
<br>reaffirms the commitment from the US to address the growing concern of tuna politics in the region and 
<br>brings about balance in the wider membership.

The increase 
<br>allows  for  countries  to  channel  additional  funds  towards  the  development  and  realisation  of  national 
<br>fisheries aspirations. This includes providing funds for fisheries projects, access to innovative science 
<br>within the fisheries sub-sector and boost self-reliance, market access and economic progress.

<br>capacity building initiatives.  The increase will help in the development of fit-for-purpose training and 
<br>technical assistance that there will be more options available as funding is available. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:65364px; width:483px; height:81px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in US$60 million will provide significant support towards 
<br>broader cooperation in addressing illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  Through the US, there will 
<br>be more support from surveillance asset providers which includes partners such as France, Australia and 
<br>New Zealand.  All these developments will serve as a deterrent to illegal distant-water fishing fleets that 
<br>would otherwise target areas of less surveillance.  It solidifies our rights as sovereign nations and enable 
<br>us to set management measures to sustainable harvest and protect the region’s tuna stock.

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">available to cater for national fisheries programme initiatives and needs.  The fund is given after it has 
<br>been divided among the 12 members of Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and then each country dictates 
<br>what the funds will be used for.

<br>that  is  provided  to  them,  channelled  through  the  Ministry  of  Economy  as  priorities  are  given  by  the 
<br>Ministry  of  Fisheries.    It  also  provides  scientific  assistance  from  other  agencies,  so  this  fund  is  also 
<br>allocated to fund that.

I think the fisheries associations that are

<br>Fisheries Association.  They have been given a fiberglass boat with a 75 horsepower.  They generated 
<br>funds and they have been one of the most successful fisheries association and at the moment, they have

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">transported to our maritime islands.  This was only made possible through some private vessel operators, 
<br>such as Brighton Holdings and Valeisasa Shipping who, despite the hard times, Mr. Speaker, they faced 
<br>through the increase in the price of fuel and cost, et cetera, they withstood the hardship and continued 
<br>they contracted services and more.

<br>Sir, and so for the same period, about 15,000 odd passengers and 13,000 odd tonnes of cargo to the 
<br>maritime islands.  Some of these services are actually wholly and solely funded by Government to provide 
<br>only supplies to the maritime islands, particularly for items for our cooperatives and our shops, fuel for 
<br>generators, fibreglass boats and general cargo.  For example, in July, Sir, the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">MV Vunilagi</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> had to deliver

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">the use of the services provided.  For example, in the lower Southern Lau route which consists of Kabara, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Fulaga, Ogea, Vatoa and Ono-i-Lau, a total of 12 trips must be deployment in any given year.

<br>impact of the pandemic and seven trips in 2022 up to last month.  And in all trips, Sir, an average of 60 
<br>percent of the capacity of the vessel is utilised in each service, meaning passenger and freight.  Therefore, 
<br>our maritime islands are actually encouraged to increase their utilisation capacity to ensure that we get 
<br>maximum delivery of those services.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:67645px; width:485px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">This is also an indication, Sir, that we are actually catering for the entire maritime travelling public 
<br>and we still have capacity to increase the numbers.  The team in the Ministry is in collaboration with other 
<br>Ministries and we will continue to provide the services to our maritime islands efficiently and effectively.

<br>six honourable Members from the Opposition who have decided to remain in Parliament.  I think we 
<br>should acknowledge your presence for having the perseverance to stay on.  The others, of course, have 
<br>chosen to leave which, I think, is quite an abomination in respect of their respect for Parliament and, 
<br>indeed,  the  respect  for  the  taxpayers  of  Fiji,  who  are  actually  paying  for  their  salaries.    The  Nadi-
<br>Vancouver  flight  officially  commences  on  25</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:8px">th</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">  November.    Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  offers  a

<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Surrey in Canada and Seattle and Portland in the United States.  Currently, the closest connecting flights 
<br>for them are Los Angeles and San Francisco for these two American cities, both of which are over 1,000 
<br>kilometres away.  Seattle is only a couple of hours away from Vancouver, Sir.  So, it is a huge catchment 
<br>area, not just for Canada from a Canadian perspective but also from American perspective.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:68247px; width:483px; height:39px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">I will be brief, Sir.  We also inform that Seattle and Portland not only has Fijians but also Tongans 
<br>and Samoans, who reside in those two cities.  For them, it will be a lot easier to come to the Pacific and, 
<br>indeed, further creating Nadi as a transit hub for the Pacific.

<br>overnight, as honourable Gavoka seems to imply in his statement.  I think he sometimes seeks relevance 
<br>and  that  is  why  I  make  statements  willy-nilly.    Similarly,  people  like  Mahendra  Chaudhry  made 
<br>statements on it calling it a junket.

We left Fiji on Tuesday.  
<br>We were on the promotional flight in the evening.  We arrived there on Tuesday morning, their time, 
<br>round about midday and then we spent about three or four hours at the airport.  There were a lot of 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">celebrations.  We would like to publicly acknowledge and thank the Fijian diaspora who turned up at the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">airport.  They were very, very excited about the fact that we will have direct flights.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:68454px; width:482px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">There were flights, Sir,  a number of years back, where Fiji Airways used to fly a 737 that used 
<br>to go from here to Hawaii, and then on to Vancouver.  This is a completely different product, Sir.  It is a 
<br>one flight, there is no stopovers, and it is obviously going to be A330 and God willing, if we are able to 
<br>get a bigger aircraft, we could fly the A350 to Vancouver and that will depend on the loads that we will 
<br>see.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:68537px; width:483px; height:53px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the idea is not only to tap into the 100,000–odd Fijians that live on the Northwest 
<br>Coast of Canada, but also Fijians on the Eastern Seaboard of Canada, including Canadians themselves 
<br>because  many  Canadians  do  fly  to  Hawaii  and  to  Mexico  as  holiday  opportunities  but  Fiji  is  a  new 
<br>destination for them where they will have direct connectivity.

They went to Toronto and San Francisco which included, of course, Fiji Airways, Tourism Fiji and 
<br>other hotel operators, including someone we saw who was from the Pearl Resort in Pacific Harbour.  A 
<br>number  of  other  operators,  Sir,  were  also  there  and  they  spent  a  couple  of  weeks  there  in  terms  of

<br>Agriculture mentioned, is the potential for trade and also export of Fijian products and produce with direct 
<br>flights.  The current forecast is that, we expect about 15 tonnes of cargo per flight, which will be made 
<br>up of fresh and frozen vegetables, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">dalo</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">, cassava, frozen seafood such as fish, crabs, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">kai</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px"> and not forgetting, 
<br>of course, kava.  Sir, even things like eggplants and </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Italic; font-size:12px">bhindi</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">, and you would be surprised how the Fijian 
<br>diaspora want to eat things from Fiji.  I mean, we have people coming from Australia and buying Bongo 
<br>and Twisties from Fiji because they think it has a different taste and then it reminds them of home.  So, 
<br>there  are  a  lot  of  Fijians  there  and  this  will  create  opportunities  for  them  and  also  for  the  Fiji  Agro 
<br>Marketing Authority, and they will be pursuing that.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:69015px; width:483px; height:67px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, the Fiji Airways is in discussions with Biosecurity Authority of Fiji 
<br>(BAF) to ensure that a regulatory pathway is open for our exports with BAF’s counterpart in Canada 
<br>because we have to overcome the quarantine issues.  Some former Fijians in Vancouver are also tapping 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">into this opportunity, a lot of them actually did talk about it.  Some of them have stores, they want to be 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">able to sell things.   
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:69098px; width:483px; height:136px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">On the flip side, of course, Sir, is that, we can bring in fruits and various other produce from 
<br>Canada.  When we were there, this is only a couple of weeks ago, they were selling cherries, strawberries 
<br>and various other  stone fruits because they were in season and are really, really inexpensive.  Cherries 
<br>were $2 a punnet in Canada.  Of course, it is off-season in Australia and New Zealand, so we have the 
<br>opportunity. So when it is on-season in Canada, we can have the fruits coming in from Canada and when 
<br>it is off-season in Canada, we have the on-season fruits from Australia and New Zealand because they 
<br>are in the Southern Hemisphere.  So, those kind of synergies and opportunities do exist and, indeed, we 
<br>have spoken to them.  It will also mean that in our hotels, they may be paying top dollars to just serve 
<br>strawberries  in  their  restaurants  or  in  their  hotels  now,  but  they  can  get  much  affordable  fruits  and 
<br>vegetables which they want from overseas, Sir.

<br>flights are bringing in a lot of transit cargo that are going onward to Auckland or to Sydney or Melbourne 
<br>and various other places.  So, again, this is another opportunity for Nadi to act as a transit hub, as far as 
<br>airfreight is concerned.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:69319px; width:483px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that we also wish to make is that the connectivity we are currently 
<br>seeing a lot of people who fly from Australia to go to West Coast of North America are again transiting 
<br>through Nadi they come on the Sydney flight arrive here at 7.00 p.m. and then the 10.00 p.m. flight to 
<br>Los Angeles.  As we know Sir that the Fijian Government has recently amended the laws where you can 
<br>stay in Fiji for five days or less you actually do not pay departure tax. We know we want to use that 
<br>opportunity, we may have Canadians wanting to go to Australia, they come to Nadi spend three-four days 
<br>jump on the next plane to Sydney - these are the opportunities. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:64px; top:69429px; width:485px; height:94px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:12px">Sir, we had an interesting discussion too where we met with the Vancouver Airport CEO and we 
<br>met a lot of former Fijians who work at the airport - the number of opportunities in that way. We also met 
<br>up with two British Columbian Ministers.  British Columbia is equivalent to State that is over Canada.  
<br>We met honourable Ravi Kahlon who is the Minister for Jobs, Economic Recovery and Innovation.  The 
<br>Minister for Labour, honourable Harry Bains and we also discussed with them about opportunities in 
<br>industrial hemp because we have been informed by the United Nations (UN) that Canada has some of 
<br>the best industrial hemp seeds.

<br>industrial hemp as a back door bringing marijuana” which is really quite obtuse too for him to say that.  I 
<br>do not know again probably desperate to get some publications printed under his name but industrial 
<br>hemp is obviously quite different to normal marijuana that you smoke with the THC levels that is higher 
<br>than 1 percent and they were quite keen to assist us in respect of helping us getting industrial hemp seeds 
<br>in collaboration with the Fiji National University Agriculture School and of course through the Ministry 
<br>of Agriculture once we are able to roll that out and there is quite a lot of work been done in that respect.

<br>as we have said fly to San Francisco to LA from November to Vancouver fly to Narita, Hong Kong when 
<br>it opens up, we fly to Singapore, Eastern Sea Board of Australia and now including Adelaide and of 
<br>course  Auckland,  Wellington  and  Christchurch  and  not  forgetting  the  other  Pacific  Island  country 
<br>destinations.  The only continent that Fiji Airways does not fly to is South America.  We fly to every 
<br>other single continent that are the rims of the Pacific Ocean except South America and we need to be all 
<br>very proud about this.

<br>to fly to some England places and USA and again those are the opportunities we are looking at to be able 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11px">to tap into what we call middle-America and the east coast of USA.  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.
