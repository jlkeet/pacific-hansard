<div><span>QUESTION TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker for giving me time to propose my 

question  in  this  Honourable  House.    I  have  five  questions,  but  I  will  ask  my  first 

question.   

</span></div><div><span>The question is to the Minister of Culture, if he could explain to this Honourable House, 

I believe not many Members are aware of what is happening.  In town, there are some 

new houses being constructed, in an area well known to us, the Constitution Park.  I 

want  to  ask  the  actual  purpose  of  this  house  and  if  there  is  any  approval  from  the 

Government for the construction of this house.  That is my question to you Honourable 

Member, thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Before  the  Minister  answers  the  question,  I  would  like  to 

</span><span>acknowledge the Mama in the Public Gallery for your presence in Parliament, you are 

</span><span>most welcome.  Now I would like to ask the Minister for a reply. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Kia Orana everyone in the Name of our Lord, our Prime Minister 

and  your  Deputy,  Ministers  and  everyone  here  today,  Mr  Speaker,  thank  you  very 

much.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Member for Matavera, thank you for your question.  I believe your question 

is not to intimidate me but rather a very good question directly for me.  Thank you also 

to one of my special guest who is in the Gallery here today, it is good that you are here 

today so you can witness what goes on in here today. 

</span></div><div><span>The actual question being asked is, what exactly is this house that I am building on the 

grounds,  namely  the  Constitution  Park?    This  is  not  the  Constitution  Honourable 

Member, and because I am the Minister of Culture, Maori traditions, the name of the 

place is called Ta’ua Terevete.  Mr Speaker, I was known as Mr Action Man, but it is 

now changed to Mr Terevete, hence why this place is called Ta’ua Terevete, a place for 

the people to enjoy. 

</span></div><div><span>The purpose of this house is for the people to use when it comes to special celebrations.  

Firstly, when the time comes for the parade (float), we all know we get squeezed under 

marquees and it is very hot, this is why it was built for. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, anybody in the Cook Islands can do their Prayer Service here, they can bring 

their  Church  here.    Otherwise,  anybody  wanting  to  use  it  for  wedding  purposes, 

birthday, Zumba, and it would be suitable for ladies like Selina and other Members of 

Parliament for them to use.  Whoever wishes to plan any activities for the people, it is 

the reason why this house is being built, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  Government,  our  Prime  Minister  and  Ministers  who  had 

supported this request, because this place is not ours, it is for the VIP and for the people.  

That is why the Government of today supported this, because it would be given to the

</span></div><div><span>people for free.  But for any activities at night where the use of power is required, there 

will be a fee charge.  This is my explanation for that place, thank you very much and 

thank you to the Honourable Member for the question.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister,  now  I  can  see  the  Honourable 

Member, Deputy Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to our Prime Minister, 

Minister  of  Police.    Mr  Speaker,  in  the  past  few  days,  we  have  seen  a  tremendous 

increase of pills or drugs, because one of my children was jailed for taking one of these 

drugs.  They went out at night to enjoy themselves and were caught up with the wrong 

crowd and were given some unknown substances to take, in which they took without 

realising the ramifications behind it.  This is a concern to the family.  This is a concern 

to the people of the village that I speak of.   

</span></div><div><span>So I would like to ask you, the Prime Minister, what is happening at the borders?  Are 

these being controlled and if there is any investigations in place to how these pills or 

drugs are being imported into the country? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker, thank you very much to the Honourable 

Member for this question. 

</span></div><div><span>I  know  Mr  Speaker  that  our  Police,  working  with  our  border  agencies,  have  a  very 

comprehensive  programme  to  try  to  combat  illegal  substance,  illegal  drugs  and 

contraband coming into our country.  Over the last year, the number of flights and the 

number of ships that  were  coming into our  country, the number of  yachts  that  were 

coming into our country has been drastically reduced.  I think this would have gone 

some way to reduce any avenue for these illegal substances to be able to come into our 

country.  However, Mr Speaker, with the opening now of our borders again, we can see 

that there will be an increase, not only in the flights, but also in the number of people 

coming into our country.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  we  need  to  make  sure  that  our  border  agencies,  our  law  enforcement 

agencies are up to  speed and with  their enforcement and with  their detection of any 

illegal substances coming into our country.  I have no doubt Mr Speaker, that this will 

be something that I will be discussing with our new Police Commissioner who have 

just arrived into our country over the weekend.  May I take this time to congratulate Mr 

James Keenan who has taken on the role of Police Commissioner of the Cook Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  not  aware  of  the  personal  circumstances  of  the  Honourable  Member  with  his 

family member but it will be something that I will follow up with the Police to find out 

what the situation is with this person.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Prime Minister. I can see the Honourable Member 

</span><span>Selina Napa.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 31 May, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 12 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for this opportunity.  Firstly, I would like to 

congratulate the Honourable MP Akaiti Puna for a well-deserved run in Parliament and 

to be admitted into our House.   

</span></div><div><span>My question is  actually  going out  to  the Minister of Justice.  Just  recently,  a  young 

couple were denied the right by the Ministry of Justice to have their newborn baby to 

be given a hyphenated name.  A combination of both the mothers and fathers name.  

The  couple  were  forced  to  seek  legal  advice  because  the  Ministry  of  Justice  was 

unbending in their issue of hyphenated names and then the couple have been forced to 

pay a considerable amount of money to engage a lawyer to fight for their rights.  The 

right that they have has been outlined in our Constitution.  So, my question here is, what 

steps had been taken by you as Minister and also the Ministry of Justice to change this 

outdated practice that is not even supported by law in this country? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> I can see the Minister Rose Brown. You have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON  R.  TOKI-BROWN:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  everyone  and  Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker.    Our 

Honourable House, Kia Orana to all Honourable Members and a special greetings to 

</span><span>our new Member of Parliament for Manihiki who has been sworn in today. 

</span></div><div><span>In response to the question by the Honourable Member from Titikaveka, yes, we have 

seen on television and in our local newspaper too, questions raised by the Leader of the 

Opposition.   

</span></div><div><span>The Head of Ministry of Justice is looking into the Birth and Registration at ways in 

which such problems can be rectified.  There are processes in place 

</span></div><div><span>The  Head  of  Ministry  of  Justice  is  trying  to  sort  this  out  because  we  have  our  own 

process when we register names for our children.  This has been on for so long, so it is 

time that this process is carefully looked at and is dealt with properly so that it may 

accommodate some of the weaknesses that our people are experiencing.  We all know 

that we have processes when it comes to registering your child, and you can have them 

registered under your parents’ name, or a combination of both your mother and father, 

but there is a process as outlined in our laws.  However, this is being reviewed in order 

to alleviate the burdens our people are faced with.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I can see the Honourable Member Selina Napa. You have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, this is a Supplementary Question and is directed to the 

Minister of Justice.  When I read the explanations, interpreted by the Lawyers, just as 

you had explained that the Act does not include this, this can be dealt with outside the 

Act,  what  are  your  thoughts  in  reviewing  this  and  be  brought  to  Parliament  as  an 

amendment to the Act which will take a long time or can it be done in this short period 

of time?   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I can see the Honourable Prime Minister. You have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>   Thank  you, Mr Speaker.   Perhaps,  I can answer the question, 

little bit easier for the Honourable Member.  There is nothing to stop these people from 

having a hyphenated name, my own new born grand-daughter has a hyphenated name.  

</span></div><div><span>5 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 31 May, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 12 

</span></div><div><span>Her surname is her mother’s name and her father’s name.  There is a legal process that 

you undertake if want to have a hyphenated name and that is to do it by deed-poll.   

</span></div><div><span>I have asked the Ministry of Justice if there is another process by which we can have a 

hyphenated name without going through the current legal process and I understand it 

will require changes to legislation.  That is being reviewed now but I was also cautioned 

that a person’s name and their identity are very important pieces of information.  If we 

are to change many many years of legal authority in identifying a person when they are 

born, we have to be very very careful that we do not make a mistake.  

</span></div><div><span>I understand the Ministry of Justice is looking at how we can make this easier without 

losing  the  importance  of  a  person’s  identity  and  how  easily  it  may  be  taken  on  by 

somebody else if it is not enshrined in proper legislation.  But right now there is nothing 

to stop parents of a child from getting their child the hyphenated name of the mother 

and the father. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I can see the Honourable 

</span><span>Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  all  Members  in  this 

Honourable House this afternoon.  Firstly, I would like to give a special congratulation 

to our new Honourable Member, Mrs Akaiti Puna, for her swearing-in today.  It is a 

day that every women should celebrate since the number of women represented in this 

House has increased to six.  And we the Cook Islands Parliament has the highest of 

women represented in the House.  I have been corrected by the Members that instead 

of six there are seven of us women.  That is correct, there are four of us and three across 

the floor.   

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, one reason I wanted today to be honoured for our women, it seems all the 

guests for the new Member, I only counted three, are all women.  To me, this is a good 

sign for our women. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Appointments  you  had  announced  Mr 

Speaker, you had announced an appointment of a new Clerk, this is not a new Clerk, it 

is a new old Clerk.  Congratulations also to the Acting Deputy-Clerk, Mrs Manavaroa, 

there we go again, another woman.  Also, the appointment of Mrs Rakera Herman, and 

also  to  the  appointment  of  Nooroa  Numanga  as  an  Interpreter/Translator  in  our 

Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I want  to  extend my thank  you to  those who have moved on from  Parliament.  The 

previous Deputy-Clerk and our previous Acting Finance Manager, Mrs Tangi Mataio 

and also to Mrs Trish Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand to  give a clear question to  the Minister of Justice, perhaps this question will 

</span><span>affect our women.  The question is, we have discussed the appointment of the two JP’s 

</span><span>for  Rakahanga.    I  have  asked  my  fellow  MP  colleagues  for  their  opinion,  as  to  the 

duration of waiting for someone to be appointed.  I was told three to four months and 

that is good.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 31 May, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 12 

</span></div><div><span>This  came  about  in  July  of  last  year  and  then  in  December,  I  submitted  the  profile 

application  and  CVs  of  these  two  women.    Both  JPs  were  women.    Their  CV  were 

composed of two pages. 

</span></div><div><span>The question, Honourable Minister, is how long shall I wait for a confirmation of the 

appointment of these two ladies as JPs for Rakahanga? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I now see the Honourable Minister, Rose Brown.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member for Rakahanga for this 

good  question  because  you  are  not  the  only  one  who  had  asked,  there  were  other 

Honourable Members from the Government side who had also asked the same question.  

Please do bear with me Honourable Member, this is entirely in the hands of the Head 

of Ministry for Justice and I am still waiting for a confirmation for the appointments of 

our JPs. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister and I see the Honourable Member 

</span><span>for Matavera and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUPA:</span><span>  My question is to the Minister of Culture.  I noticed some trees had 

been cut in the villages  of Ngatangiia and Titikaveka and  I also heard that there are 

trees  getting  cut  in  Tupapa  today.    My  concern  it  went  from  Ngatangiia,  skipped 

Matavera and then jumped over to Tupapa.  My question to you Honourable Minister, 

are you not troubled with this practise? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Honourable  Members,  we  have  come  to  the  end  of  the  Question 

Time.  Honourable Minister, you may reply on the 8</span><span>th</span><span> May 2021. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Members, Parliament is hereby notified that the following Bills 

may be tabled at the next Sitting of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members I have an apology to give you.  There is no Orders of the Day. 

</span></div><div><span>We go back to Presentation of Papers, Standing Orders 72.
