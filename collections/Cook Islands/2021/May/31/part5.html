<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>You will notice that there is nothing for the Orders of the Day, so we will move forward. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members,  Parliament is  hereby notified that the following  Bills  may be 

tabled at the next Sitting of Parliament: 

</span></div><div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Constitution Amendment (No.29) Bill 

2.</span><span> </span><span>Appropriation 2021/2022 Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Again,  Honourable  Members,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  65  (l),  I  seek  leave  of 

Parliament  to  re-order  our  arrangements  of  business  at  this  time  to  allow  for  the 

Consideration  of  Papers  that  are  already  on  the  Order  and  the  five  newly  presented 

Papers of today.   

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Selina Napa, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me the opportunity to speak on the 

Consideration  of  Papers.    There  are  many  Papers  that  we  will  be  discussing  for  the 

Consideration of Papers, and we have checked them all.  We have a request  that we 

would like to put forward and for the Government and all of us to consider.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to put a move: 

</span></div><div><span>For Parliament to postpone these Papers of Consideration 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member, I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Prime Minister, Mark Brown 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Members, you will see in our Consideration of Papers, 

</span><span>there are Papers underlined, those have to go.  Those without an underline, we can re-

</span><span>schedule that for the next Sitting.  That is the Motion we just agreed to.  For example, 

you will see that in 71, 72, 73 and so on.

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 31 May, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 12 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member for Pukapuka/Nassau. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I agree with the Motion however, I need some clarity 

around Papers 80 and 81, especially Paper 80.  As Chairperson of the Crimes Bill, my 

intention was to move a Motion for an extension of time for that Paper, because the 

Crown  Law  Office  is  still  considering  making  the  changes  that  the  Committee  has 

agreed, the redrafting of the Crimes Bill as an Amendment to the current Crimes Bill, 

before finalising that work.  And then, the Crimes Bill will be reported to Parliament in 

a final form. 

</span></div><div><span>If I can just make mention to the previous Motion to suggest particularly for Paper 80, 

the extension of six months for the Crimes Bill, so Crown Law can complete the work.  

And we will be able to present that Paper to Parliament in its final format, and I believe 

the Chairperson for the TTV Paper will move a similar, but we can deal with the Crimes 

Bill first and then we move forward. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, we will deal with this now and can you move 

a Motion for the extension? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you.  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the time allocated to the Crimes Bill Select Committee to provide a Report 

be extended for six months to allow the Crown Law Office and the New Zealand 

Pacific Desk Parliamentary Council Office to co-ordinate the final drafting of the 

Crimes Bill 2019 Amendment as approved by the Select Committee.</span><span>

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Can I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Selina Napa 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Members.  I call upon the Prime Minister to move a Motion to 

No. 81 please? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Members will be aware that the To Tatou Vai Select Committee 

is conducting further consultation with the public after review of the proposed Bill.  I 

therefore move Mr Speaker: 

</span></div><div><span>For an extension of the time to submit the Report before  

Parliament on its completion 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Can I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Selina Napa

</span></div><div><span>It is okay, you are surely excused. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question:   

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to</span><span>

</span></div><div><span>So for your information, all those Papers without underline, all of them will move to 

the next Sitting.  Honourable Members, that includes the other five Papers we have just 

gone through.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Members.  That completes the Consideration of Papers.  I now 

call the Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House do now adjourn until Tuesday, 8</span><span>th</span><span> June 2021 at 1.00 p.m.
