<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Let us give some smiles.  Orders of the Day, Agriculture Bill 2020. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before we continue on Mr Speaker, I 

seek clarification also now that the Constitution Amendment has been defeated by the 

Opposition that the Bill itself is now defeated and no longer in the House.  If that is the 

case Mr Speaker, then I would leave it up to the Members of the Opposition to explain 

to the public of this country why the months and tens of thousands of dollars that you 

enjoyed travelling up to the Northern Group and all of the Outer Islands was wasted on 

a mere technicality as advised by the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>As I quote, the Leader of the Opposition agreed that this was a difference on a point of 

law that they think affected the process of this Bill through the House despite the advice 

that we have received from the likes of Crown Law and from our advisers in the New 

Zealand Parliament that the process that we have adopted was lawful.   

</span></div><div><span>I  know  there  was  a  total  agreement  in  this  House  on  the  content  of  the  Bill,  total 

</span><span>agreement in the House in September on the amendments that we have proposed.  If 

</span><span>there was a true spirit of trying to get this Bill through the House today, the process 

outlined was quite correct and proper.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, we will leave it in the hands of the Opposition to explain to our people why 

this Bill has been defeated and why it needs to go back through its process again for 

nothing more than what appears to be political posturing.  Thank you very much Mr 

Speaker.
