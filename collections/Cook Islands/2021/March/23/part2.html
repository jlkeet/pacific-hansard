</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER (T. TURA): </span><span> Please be seated Honourable Members.  Greetings to all 

of us this morning.  Firstly, I would like to commend our Chaplain for his beautiful 

message this morning.  His message is that we are all one and we should retain the same 

spirit through our deliberations today. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  all  our  people  listening  or  watching  our  sitting  on  livestream  in  the 

Northern Group and the Southern Group and all our people here in Rarotonga.  I also 

extend my appreciation to all the staff of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a few announcements to make before we proceed with our business today.  First, 

we have a new staff as the Sub-Editor of Debates, Mr Papaterai Williams.  I would like 

to  acknowledge  the  former  Sub-Editor  of  Debates,  Miss  Kimiora  Vogel  who  is 

undergoing medical treatment in New Zealand and we pray that the Good Lord take 

care of her and heal her medical condition. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  second  new  staff  in  Parliament,  I  introduce  our  new  Interpreter.    Welcome  on 

behalf  of  Parliament  to  the  service  Mr  Teuira  Ka,  and  I  wish  you  well  in  your 

interpretation responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>At this point, I wish to touch on a few bereavements that have recently happened in our 

country.  Firstly, to the late Tararo Temaeva Arii e te Pou Ae Karati Ariki our words of

known  as  Mama  Ngai  Tupa  who  was  a  former  Member  of  Parliament  of  this 

Honourable House.  I also acknowledge one of her sons, Honourable Vaitoti Tupa who 

is currently a Member of this House of Parliament.  I am sure that we have all visited 

Mama Ngaiâ€™s shop to buy doughnuts. 

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, we acknowledge the passing away of the late Metuakore Teremoana Ngametua 

</span><span>Tutakiao  Kora,  known  as  Papa  Motu  Kora.    He  was  a  former  staff  member  of  this
