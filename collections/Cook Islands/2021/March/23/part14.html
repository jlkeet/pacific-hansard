<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Second Reading of the COVID-19 Cook Islands National Superannuation Bill.  I call 

the Minister to move for the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I now move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the COVID-19 Cook Islands National Superannuation Bill  

be read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You may speak Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    The  Members  will  be  aware  of  the 

Governmentâ€™s  Economic  Response  Plan  in  trying  to  support  businesses  and  also 

employees who are seriously affected by the closure of our borders since March.  One 

of the measures that were put into effect Mr Speaker was to reduce the Superannuation 

contributions  from  both  employees  and  employers  in  those  businesses  that  were 

affected by the down-turn of tourism. 

</span></div><div><span>Initially, those reductions applied across the board to all employees in the Cook Islands 

including Government workers and public servants, subsequently those reductions were 

amended to only apply to those people who were eligible to collect the Government 

Economic Response Plan.  

</span></div><div><span>The  last  COVID-19  Superannuation  Act  that  we  passed  Mr  Speaker  made  these 

reductions in contributions valid up until 31</span><span>st</span><span> March this year. This amendment that is 

before us Mr Speaker seeks to extend the time for those reductions to still take place to 

the end of June with an additional provision that through the Executive Order, it can be 

extended again into September.  

</span></div><div><span>The Bill Mr Speaker does not do away with contributions to Superannuation entirely, 

it does reduce those contributions from five percent down to one percent and this is to 

ensure  there  is  continuity  of  this  fund  during  this  period  even  though  we  are  going 

through difficult times that there is still some contributions by those who are receiving 

</span><span>the Government Support package.  

</span></div><div><span>There is provision in this Bill Mr Speaker that with the consent of both the employer 

and the employee, both can still make higher contributions than the one percent up to 

</span></div><div><span>24 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>five percent but it must be at the agreement of both parties. Again, this is a Bill Mr 

Speaker that is quite specific and related to a single issue aimed alleviating a burden on 

both  employers  and  employees  during  this  time.  Those  who  are  not  collecting  the 

Government Support package will not be eligible for this reduction in contributions.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker those are about the only words that I have in regards to this particular Bill. 

I would like to commend this Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Prime Minister. I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span> Mr Speaker I rise to second the Motion and I do not wish to speak 

on the Bill as the Prime Minister has already explained the necessity for this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I propose: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Is there any Member who wants to speak on the Bill?  I can see the Honourable Tina 

Browne? You have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span>Greetings Mr Speaker. I rise in support of this Bill. 

This Bill is part of our Economic Response to COVID-19. From the short history of 

both sides of the House in dealing with COVID-19 is to be supportive.  

</span></div><div><span>Prime Minister, I am the only speaker from this side of the House. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>The Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING CLERK AT THE TABLE</span><span>: Long Title: An Act to mitigate the economic 

</span><span>hardship resulting from measures taken to protect the Cook Islands from COVID-19 

(Coronavirus  Disease  2019)  by  temporary  lowering  the  rate  for  contributions  to  the 

National  Superannuation  Fund  for  employers  who  receive  a  business  grant  or  wage 

subsidy under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan after 31st March 2020 and their 

employees.
