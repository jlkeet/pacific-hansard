<div><span>QUESTION TIME 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, before we ended the Question Time yesterday, there was a question raised by 

the Member of Parliament for Ngatangiia, Honourable Tamaiva Tuavera to the Prime 

</span><span>Minister.  Honourable Prime Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  In responding to the question 

raised by the Member for Ngatangiia, let me refresh our minds as to what his concern 

was.    He  asked  if  we  are  going  to  play  Russian  roulette  with  our  people.    Russian 

roulette is when you put a gun to your head and pull the trigger. 

</span></div><div><span>I think the Member tends to exaggerate and be a bit dramatic.  There is no need to be a 

drama queen in these situations.  The question on opening our borders to allow tourism 

to occur and linking it to be like Russian roulette, I think is in correct.  It is just another 

case of needlessly scaring and providing scare mongering among our people.  Purely 

for political gains.  However, we are all above that Mr Speaker and we are here to look 

at the welfare of our people and the welfare of our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>We only have to look at the past year Mr Speaker when we closed our borders, not one 

case of COVID-19 has entered our country.  This is because we took a very measured 

and a very deliberate response into how we will deal with COVID-19.  We did not run 

around like that little chicken that says, the sky is falling down, the sky is falling down. 

</span></div><div><span>We  relied  on  specialist  medical  advice  both  from  our  people  and  also  from  New 

Zealand.  Like New Zealand, we learned about this virus from one year ago, we learned 

how its outbreaks occurred, and we learned how it has been contained.  We learned Mr 

Speaker what we need to improve, we learned what areas of our health we need to invest 

in to ensure our health preparedness. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, when a Member says that we only have two machines in the hospital and we 

are not ready, that is totally incorrect because he is looking at the end of the problem 

and  not  at  the  beginning.    Our  experience  has  shown  us  Mr  Speaker  that  the  most 

</span><span>important  part of protecting ourselves is  preventing COVID-19 from coming in  and 

</span><span>having in place measures to contain it, if it does. 

</span></div><div><span>2 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>This is exactly the approach that New Zealand has taken which has resulted in them 

eliminating  COVID-19  from  within  their  community.    We  have  been  able  to  Mr 

Speaker  work  closely  with  our  authorities  in  New  Zealand  to  be  included  in  their 

protective bubble, and we have been very successful in the first stage of our strategy 

and that is to prevent COVID-19.  As I said, one year later we still managed to do that. 

Hand in hand with the prevention, Mr Speaker is the measures that we have put in place 

to contain COVID in the event it does occur. 

</span></div><div><span>In the study of epidemiology, Mr Speaker you look at probabilities.  These are statistics 

or numbers that help guide your decision making.  We do not base our decision making 

on hysteria or claims of scaremongering but we base it on science, evidence, facts, and 

the probabilities.  That shows Mr Speaker that before the case would occur in the Cook 

Islands,  it  would  show  up  first  in  New  Zealand  and  when  a  case  show  up  in  New 

Zealand  as  we  saw  over  the  last  couple  of  months  Mr  Speaker,  we  responded 

appropriately to ensure our people are protected. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  when  I  say  that  our  health  readiness  is  at  a  stage  where  we  are  ready  to 

commence business again, that is based on solid evidence and solid facts.  We have a 

</span><span>number of factors in our favour Mr Speaker that are to our advantage as opposed to a 

</span><span>country like New Zealand.  One is our country is fragmented and has natural isolations 

because of our communities that live on different islands.  That allows us, Mr Speaker 

to put in place isolation and containment measures very, very quickly and very, very 

effectively if and when we choose to do so. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, Mr Speaker we only have one port of entry into our country and that port of 

entry  comes  from  one  single  destination.    Therefore,  anybody  who  comes  into  our 

country must come through Auckland and as we know New Zealand’s own measures 

mean  that  anyone  in  Auckland  or  anyone  in  New  Zealand  at  this  stage  is  in  an 

environment where it is COVID free. 

</span></div><div><span>We do not intend Mr Speaker to open up our tourism to any other countries at this stage.  

Therefore, New Zealand’s ability to eliminate COVID within its community provides 

us an opportunity now to step up the two-way quarantine that in effect we are already 

using right now.  Right now, our people can fly to New Zealand without the need for 

quarantine and return to our country without the need for quarantine. 

</span></div><div><span>The next logical step Mr Speaker is to extend those same travel provisions to the wider 

New Zealand tourist public, and as I mentioned previously, it does not need to be a fast 

track opening of our tourism borders.  We can continue with the same level of travel 

now and gradually increase the number of flights as we gain more assurance and more 

comfort in what we are doing. 

</span></div><div><span>In closing, Mr Speaker I believe that some of the initiatives that we have undertaken 

over the last year have added to our health readiness.  These include the investments 

that we have made in our hospital with the installation of a CT scanner, with the opening 

of  our  PCR  lab,  the  establishment  of  a  dedicated  ward  for  any  in  the  event  of  any 

</span><span>COVID cases, the establishment of negative pressure rooms which help contain any 

</span><span>sort of contagious disease.  The huge public awareness that has resulted from the revival 

of our Puna Health teams, the growing awareness of the vaccination that is available to 

our people that we hope to roll out very, very shortly.  All of these Mr Speaker have

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>added to our preparedness in response to any COVID and has built the ability of our 

country to move forward with confidence. 

</span></div><div><span>So far from playing Russian roulette or gambling with our people’s lives, Mr Speaker 

we have taken a very measured response to ensure the protection of our people first and 

foremost whilst we try to save our economy.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  see  the  Member  of 

Parliament for RAPPA, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  good  morning  to  all  colleagues 

within the House.  I just have a question for the Honourable Member from Ngatangiia, 

Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>I am just curious, Honourable Member for Ngatangiia, are you aware of any individual 

or  any  citizen  in  your  community  or  in  this  wonderful  country  of  ours  that  has 

contracted COVID-19 virus?  A yes or no would suffice. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member 

</span><span>Tamaiva Tuavera. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>It looks like he asked the question and he wants me to answer it.  

How he wants me to answer it, because I have a supplementary question for the Prime 

Minister.  Now he had asked me a question and said he wants a yes or no answer.  I 

want everybody to know there are two ports of entry into this country, this is by plane 

and by ship. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Point of Order Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>My question is quite simple and I am only asking for a yes or 

no answer and not a history lesson. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You may answer the question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>The Member’s question, yes or no?  Well before I say yes or no, 

I  would  like  him  to  know  what  my  opinion  is  on  that  question.    If  we  go  back  Mr 

Speaker when there was a case in Auckland and there was a panic down there… 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Excuse me Honourable Member, there is  a Point of Order on the 

Floor.  What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>My Point of Order Mr Speaker is, I consider the Honourable 

Member from Ngatangiia a very intelligent individual and I am a bit confused whether 

he understood my question that I put to the Floor, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  Can the Honourable Member answer the question yes 

or no so we can have more questions later?

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>The answer is no, Mr Speaker but I must point out that there was 

panic down here when there was a case in Auckland because two of our people were 

found to have been in a spot where the people that contracted COVID was.  There was 

a big panic down here.  They were running around looking where these are and that 

panic pointed out that we were short of 72 health workers. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>My Point of Order is he has answered the question and I have a 

Supplementary Question as well, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Before I allow you to add your Supplementary Question, I will deal 

with your Point of Order first.  I think the question has been answered and we will leave 

it there.  We will continue with your Supplementary Question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  my  Supplementary  Question  to  the  Honourable 

Member, since he wholeheartedly agrees that there is no COVID case in the country, 

for  over  a  year  since  the  outbreak,  would  the  Honourable  Member  agree  that  the 

</span><span>Government of the Day 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAMAIVA:</span><span>  Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAMAIVA:</span><span>  The Honourable Member would not let me elaborate on my yes 

and no answer, now he had got up again to ask me more questions on the same thing. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, he has not finished his question yet. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>   Mr Speaker,  I  am  entitled to  ask a Supplementary  Question, 

under the Standing Orders. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Since  the  Honourable  Member  wholeheartedly  believes  that 

there  has  not  been  any  case  of  COVID  infection  here  in  his  community  and  in  this 

country, would he agree that the Government with the Officials responsible to protect 

all the citizens of this country against the COVID-19 pandemic since the outbreak a 

year  ago,  thus  far,  that  these  Officials  and  the  Government  had  done  an  extremely 

excellent job in protecting this nation and its citizens. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your question? 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Simple yes or no. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I can see the Leader of the Opposition, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  I may be able to answer the question raised by the 

Honourable Member for RAPPA.   

</span></div><div><span>5 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>I want to make some comments to the reply made by the Honourable Prime Minister.  

When I listened to the way he explained his views, it felt as if they are on a different 

planet and we are on a different planet.   

</span></div><div><span>It is important if everything is explained properly with every events since the beginning 

of  COVID-19,  to  ensure  it  is  recorded  correctly  in  the  Hansard  Report  in  this 

Parliament.  I have to answer this question; it is not a simple yes or no.  We will recall 

that  when  the  COVID-19  Bill  was  introduced,  it  was  explained  by  MFEM  through 

workshops. The Opposition supported the Bill because we saw the importance of the 

Bill to our people.  When we returned to Parliament, the Opposition raised their concern 

to close the border due to issues with COVID-19. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  G.  ANGENE:</span><span>    My  Point  of  Order  Mr  Speaker,  concerning  this  issue,  the 

Honourable Member should leave her story when we debate the principles and merits 

</span><span>of the Bill because this is now Question Time and she should just answer the question. 

</span><span>Do not bring these matters during Question Time, leave your story during the principles 

and merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This is the response from the Government during that 

time.  You don’t understand Honourable Member because I was the one who made the 

request.  The  Lawyers  explained  to  us  at  the  Dome  that  we  have  no  jurisdiction  in 

closing our borders because our people have the  right  currently  residing overseas to 

return to our country.  We all know that the advice given to us by Crown Law at the 

Dome was that this is not to stop them from entering our country but rather to delay 

their entry.  Less than two weeks after this consultation, Parliament was called and it 

was recommended for us to amend the Covid-19 Act and to close our border. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker.  I feel neglected Mr Speaker because 

I  asked  a  simple  question.    The  question  Mr  Speaker  is,  whether  the  Honourable 

Member  agrees  or  not  that  the  Officials  tasked  to  protect  this  country  had  done  a 

wonderful job or not.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member,  I  think  you  are  right.    To  the 

Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  can  I  please  take  us  back  to  the  teachings 

delivered  by  our  Chaplin  this  morning,  he  said,  let  us  be  together.    Can  you  please 

answer the question and make it short. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  The answer is no because, and I was trying to explain 

</span><span>the  “because”  part,  the  decision  was  made  by  New  Zealand  first.    We  have  been 

</span><span>fortunate that New Zealand had made decisions that is favourable to us.

you more time afterwards.  We have exhausted our Question Time.
