<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>That completes the Third reading of the Agriculture Bill.  Thank you 

so much for that. 

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>For the Hansard, I would like to say that it’s the Agriculture Amendment Bill.  That 

comes to the completion of the Agriculture Amendment Bill.  Thank you everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>Can I call upon the former Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, the Honourable Henry 

Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>MR H. PUNA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  To you, all the Honourable Members of the 

House, our people listening in this afternoon, Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to present some words of farewell to our Nation because I am retiring 

from this Honourable House today. 

</span></div><div><span>I have just returned from Manihiki with my beloved wife to bid them farewell as well 

as to prepare them for the days ahead.  I have already expressed my words of farewell 

to this Nation on the 30</span><span>th</span><span> September last year when I resigned as the Prime Minister of 

this country and I felt that it was only proper that before I resign from this Honourable 

House, to express words of farewell to our Nation. 

</span></div><div><span>First of all, to all of us in this Honourable House, I am grateful and happy in the last 10 

years I have sat in this House to see all the faces, some have left, some have come in 

and this has served to educate me and encourage me in considering that time waits for 

no man and we have to chase time.  I feel that it is appropriate that we change with the 

times and make changes appropriate for the time.  Therefore, it was not difficult for me 

to step down from the position of Prime Minister and to promote our new leaders. 

</span></div><div><span>However, it has been a privilege serving in this House and while we might have had 

some disagreements today, I can honestly say that the atmosphere and the conduct of 

proceedings in this House now is so much more relaxed and so much better than when 

I first entered the House.  My request is, let us continue like that.  Let us show respect 

to one another.  The truth is we are all very special in our own ways.  Our people, your 

people  have  placed  their  confidence  in  you,  each  of  us  and  therefore  that  deserves 

respect. 

</span></div><div><span>I have already given my valedictory speech Mr Speaker, so I will be brief.  I just want 

</span><span>to acknowledge at this point in time the many friends that we have made over the 10 

years that I was Prime Minister of this country.  These friends have readily come to our 

assistance in our times of difficulties.  New Zealand has always been there.  Australia

</span></div><div><a>Page 38</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>is now here with us, I want to acknowledge the Australian High Commissioner, and I 

know he has done a dutiful job since his arrival in our country.   

</span></div><div><span>However,  there  are  many  others.    You  would  not  believe  that  we  are  very  close  to 

Iceland. I had the privilege of leading a Pacific Delegation to Iceland, that can teach us 

some  very  important  lessons  in  economic  development,  particularly  to  do  with 

fisheries. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker and Honourable Members, there are many friends out there who 

are  standing  ready  to  help  us,  and  let  us  not  hesitate  to  go  out  and  make  friends 

throughout the world community.   

</span></div><div><span>I had accepted the challenge to be in Suva to lead out the Forum Secretariat and I believe 

it  is  a  high  honour  particularly  for  our  country.    While  the  circumstances  of  my 

appointment might have been controversial, I believe we can get down to business soon 

and address all the many urgent and pressing issues confronting the Pacific.  With our 

many friends by my side, I am sure that we can do a good job.  However, I first love 

will always be our country and that is where my heart will always be. 

</span></div><div><span>Right now, I would like to thank the people of our country.  I thank you for your prayers, 

for your thoughts and for your assistance during all these times.  I do realise that there 

are those that do not like me but that is how it is.  You just have to take the good with 

the bad.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, there are so many people to acknowledge, our Religious Sector, 

the Traditional leaders of our Nation, I ask us not to leave the foundation of our country, 

which is our Parliamentary system, our Religious side and our Traditional system.  Our 

country has always been strong and will continue to be strong always because of that 

and that is our solid foundation. 

</span></div><div><span>I also want to thank all the public servants of this country. I am sure we will all agree 

that there are some really hard working public servants out there serving this country 

and  they  make  a  lot  of  difference  for  our  little  paradise.    However,  I  will  urge 

Honourable Members to never forget that we are public servants too.  We are not here 

for ourselves, we are here for our people. Time march is on and so it should and the 

challenge for us is to adapt and keep up with the changing times.  I am sure we have 

leadership in this House to do that for our beautiful country.     

</span></div><div><span>The Daily Bread for the Seventh Day Adventist says; </span><span>“Life is what?” </span><span>There is a blank 

there and we complete that blank ourselves.  The Daily Bread also says in John 14:6, 

</span><span>“I am the way the truth and the life”.</span><span>  This is a Christian response, that Jesus is life.  

However, our people depend on us in this House for their life and it is up to us to nurture 

that and to make sure that we do look after that life the best possible way. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to conclude by sighting this verse from the Book of Mathew 5:5, </span><span>“Blessed are 

the meek for they shall inherit the earth”.  </span><span>I tried to be meek in the last 10 years, I tried 

</span><span>to be humble, and I tried to be strong too.  If I have succeeded, I certainly have not 

</span><span>inherited the earth but I can sleep at night trying.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>This is my request to us, for those of us that will take this country forward, let us be 

humble. Let us carry out our duties with humbleness and humility and being respectful 

with everybody that we deal with.  I wish you all wee and God bless our little country. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Let us all be seated. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you so much for your speech which was very emotional.  We wish you all the 

best in the future.   

</span></div><div><span>I am pleased to acknowledge the presence of His Excellency, the High Commissioner 

of Australia in the Chamber today and also the lady boss of the former Prime Minister, 

Mrs Akaiti Puna.  You must remember that she is boss, not you.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>To suspend Standing Order 54 (2) to allow Parliament to adjourn </span><span>Sine Die 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member, can I have a Seconder please.   

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, before  I  give my support,  I thought  this  is  the perfect 

moment for me to say a few encouraging words to the Member for Manihiki, for the 

new post he will be taking in the Pacific.  I also extend our regards and support from 

the Opposition side and also from all the Members of Parliament to you Honourable 

Member, Henry Puna.   

</span></div><div><span>Also, remember us the Members of the Opposition on occasions when we travel to Fiji, 

do prepare a place to accommodate us.  We would also like to show our full support for 

Mr Henry Puna, I believe he is the first Cook Islander to take over on this new post in 

the Pacific.  Regardless of the news we have heard, we are grateful that a Cook Islander 

had taken this new role.  When I used to attend forum meetings, I know the people who 

have held these positions.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, it is only right that we show our support to Mr Henry Puna for 

taking this post. I am so proud and I believe the entire Cook Islands is proud of him as 

well.  May God give you the wisdom and blessings upon you and may God help you.   

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, I give my full support to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I put the Question:
