<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Second Reading of the Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill.  Can I ask the Minister to 

move for the Second Reading of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I now move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill be read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You may speak Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Kia Orana again and before I start, Mr Speaker just let me extend 

a warm welcome to everybody here today in Parliament and also to our people listening 

in.  To  our people on Rarotonga, our people in  the Pa Enua and our people in  New 

Zealand, Australia, wherever you may be listening in, Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>It is my privilege today to present to this House the Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill 

2021.   

</span></div><div><span>From the outset, Mr Speaker let me say that as an ocean nation, we take our role as 

Ocean Stewards very seriously.  We are living in unprecedented times and face multiple 

challenges  as  a  country  from  our  COVID-19  pandemic  to  the  prevailing  threat  of 

climate change and these are challenges, Mr Speaker not just for today but for our future 

generations. 

</span></div><div><span>Our 15 stars make up our 15 islands, Mr Speaker with a total land area of 240 square 

</span><span>kilometres but we are blessed with an EEZ of some two million square kilometres.  That 

means Mr Speaker that 0.01 percent of our country is land while 99.99 percent is ocean.   

We are a large ocean State so it is inevitable that we will turn to the ocean for solutions 

and for our survival. 

</span></div><div><span>In order to continue enjoying the support of our ocean, we must be good ocean stewards 

and protect it from serious harm and this is when ocean governance becomes important. 

By  striking  the  right  balance  we  can  show  that  there  does  not  need  to  be  conflict 

between marine protection and seabed minerals harvesting.  It does not have to be one 

or  the  other  –  it  certainly  can  be  both  and  this  is  consistent  with  the  principles  of 

sustainable use.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>Our strong relationship with our Marae Moana will maintain that balance.  It is what 

sets us apart.  We have a Marae Moana Act which is a world leading piece of legislation.  

I guess you can say the best of the best.   

</span></div><div><span>This  is  a  piece  of  legislation  that  provides  a  system  of  ocean  governance  aimed  at 

protecting our ocean.  We also have a Seabed Minerals Regime that when complete is 

shaping up to also be world leading and I will come to that later. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, 2021 will be a historic year in our country’s seabed minerals journey, an 

exciting time.  The start of a new voyage of discovery for our people, a voyage not 

across our ocean but rather into the depth of our ocean.  We are finally entering the 

Exploration Phase under our Seabed Minerals Regime. 

</span></div><div><span>Exploration will allow for the collection of essential environment data and information 

to allow the Government to make informed decisions about whether to permit future 

commercial harvesting.        

</span></div><div><span>Explorations  activities  will  lead  to  more  knowledge  and  information  on  our  Marae 

</span><span>Moana, more training opportunities for our people, and the use of our local businesses 

</span><span>to supply goods and services connected to the exploration activities.  Let me be clear 

Mr Speaker we are only entering the Exploration Phase, we are not contemplating the 

Harvesting  Phase  at  this  stage,  that  decision  is  sometime  away.    As  I  have  said 

repeatedly, we will not allow the commercial recovery of our nodules without sufficient 

research on how to address and minimise potential environmental impacts.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  want  to  touch  on  the  fact  that  there  is  bipartisan  political  support  for 

exploration  activities.  It  is  rare  but  not  unheard  of  for  both  parties  to  agree  on 

something. Therefore, I want to commend the Leader of the Opposition for recognising 

the  need  to  see  the  bigger  picture.  We  may  have  different  views  on  how  to  run  the 

country but on this, we can agree exploration activities are a good thing for our country.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we did not get to this stage overnight, it has taken us many years of careful 

planning  and  preparation  to  reach  this  Exploration  Phase.  We  are  building  a  world 

leading seabed mineral based best principles and practices with an effective robust legal 

framework to benefit the Cook Islands and all of our people. We passed our Seabed 

Mineral  Act  in  2019 and made the necessary  amendments  to  ensure that it is  fit for 

purpose.  

</span></div><div><span>We passed our Exploration Regulations last year to set out the rules and procedures for 

exploration  activities.  We  released  our  draft  Mining  Regulations  and  Environment 

Regulations  for  consultation.  The  Regulations  received  inputs  from  the  likes  of  the 

Commonwealth  Secretariat  and  experts  who  has  worked  at  the  International  Seabed 

Authority, the New Zealand Environment Protection and the New Zealand Petroleum 

and Minerals Department, these people have the relevant experience in this area.  

</span></div><div><span>When  those  Regulations  are  passed  Mr  Speaker,  the  Cook  Islands  will  be  the  only 

</span><span>country in the world with a comprehensive Seabed Minerals legal regime. Then there 

</span><span>are the processes through standards and guidelines underpinning that legal framework. 

Our Government officials are currently working on these as well and this is well before 

we  even  expect  any  exploratory  vessels  to  enter  our  waters.    As  we  entered  the 

</span></div><div><span>18 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>Exploratory Phase Mr Speaker, the Government will continue to proceed with caution 

taking  actions  based  on  the  best  available  science  to  manage  our  seabed  mineral 

resources while ensuring that the marine environment is protected. 

</span></div><div><span>The Cook Islands will control all aspects of activities in our EEZ Mr Speaker including 

the  data  and  samples  taken  through  exploration  in  our  water.  It  is  our  intention  Mr 

Speaker to continue to engage with our community and stakeholders which I believe 

will lead to a sustainable long term beneficial national seabed minerals sector. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I now move to discussing the Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill. This is a 

simple straight forward Bill, it has one specific purpose to make clear that only Cook 

Islands  registered  companies  can  operate  in  our  water  as  has  always  been  the 

Government’s intent.  During the development of the Seabed Minerals Act 2019, one 

significant  change  made  by  the  Government  was  to  ensure  that  only  Cook  Islands 

companies could apply for licences in our waters.  

</span></div><div><span>The reason for this was to allow the Government more control and oversight over the 

activities of these companies as they would not only be subjected to our Seabed laws 

</span><span>but  also  our  Tax  and  Company  laws.  The  intent  of  the  Seabed  Minerals  Act  and 

</span><span>Regulations is very clear on this, however, there is some ambiguity in the language of 

certain provisions of the Act which might allow a limited liability company or an LLC 

to apply for a licence.  

</span></div><div><span>An LLC has special rules and exemptions which means that some tax and reporting 

requirements do not apply to it compared to the requirements that a limited company 

would  have  to  abide  by.  If  we  allow  this,  we  create  an  uneven  playing  field  which 

potentially allows a company to apply as an LLC and therefore not have to comply with 

certain tax and reporting requirements.  

</span></div><div><span>We cannot allow that Mr Speaker and this is why this Seabed Minerals Amendment 

Bill is necessary. It sends a message to companies wanting to operate in our waters that 

they have to play by the rules and that we will not hesitate to take actions if we perceive 

that any company is trying to take advantage of possible loop holes. It sends a message 

Mr Speaker to our people in the wider community that again we take our role as ocean 

stewards very seriously.  

</span></div><div><span>In terms of the next step Mr Speaker, it is anticipated that should this Bill meet with the 

approval of this House and be passed, it would apply to the four applications currently 

being processed. Any application that does not comply with this requirement will have 

a small grace period by which to change their application so that they are in compliance. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Seabed  Minerals  Authority  manages  the  exploration  licensing  process  and  is 

currently processing the four applications received.  I am pleased to advise the House 

that we have secured assistance from the Australian Government in our due diligence 

process  with  our  Government  Officials  exploring  further  avenues  of  support  and 

technical assistance.   

</span></div><div><span>On  that  note,  we  are  continuing  to  build  our  institutional  capacity  through  our 

relationships with Australian and New Zealand agencies and other stakeholders with a 

view to further capacity building and training of our government Officials.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>On the licensing process, I understand the authority will provide further updates to the 

public shortly.  In making decisions on these applications we are clear that only those 

who have the financial and technical capacity will get through our due diligence process 

and then only the best applicants will be offered a license to explorer in our waters. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  we  have  put  in  place  systems  to  ensure  that  the  contractors  this 

Government allows into the Cook Islands waters are reputable and the best and with a 

long term vision to work with the Cook Islands and its people to build a responsible 

and beneficial mineral sector. 

</span></div><div><span>In summary Mr Speaker, this Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill is another step in our 

journey towards setting up a transformational  future for the Cook  Islands.  This  has 

been a long and careful process for us and this year 2021 in particular is going to be 

defining time for our country.   

</span></div><div><span>To my fellow Members of Parliament across the Floor and all of us in this House, I 

invite you to show your support for this Seabed Minerals Amendment which is the next 

step in our journey towards realising a long held aspiration of our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I now commend this Bill before the House.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member, Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Bill is now open for debate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Greetings to you Mr Speaker and everyone present 

in the House today.  I rise to share our comments on this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I first want to talk about the purpose of this Bill and then I want to talk secondary about 

the  process  of  this  Bill,  and  then  finally  make  some  comments  with  regard  to  the 

Opposition’s approach to the exploratory stage. 

</span></div><div><span>The purpose of the Bill is very clear.  We know from the workshop and the explanation 

and the presentations that we have had way back in 2019.  It was explained as I recall 

very clear by the MFEM, that the intention of the Bill is to ensure that every applicant 

for any of the licenses is subject to our tax resume.  That certainly was the understanding 

of  the  Opposition  Members  and  we  had  to  admit  that  when  the  Bill  came  through 

Parliament the ambiguity in the language was not detected.   

</span></div><div><span>This is of course notwithstanding there are three lawyers in this Parliament.  This Bill 

</span><span>now  is  to  address  that  concern  because  it  seems  that  the  2019  Act,  there  is  a  little 

</span><span>loophole in there.  Some clever lawyer has picked up the fact that the applicant need 

not  restricted  to  companies  registered  under  the  2017  Cook  Islands  Companies  Act 

</span></div><div><span>20 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>which  makes  the  playing  field  a  little  uneven  for  the  applicants.    Therefore,  this 

legislation as I understand it is to go back and fix that loophole. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I want to explain or I want to share the process with regards to this Bill.  I see the 

head of the Seabed Authority is here in this Parliament House.  I want to commend her 

for the steps that she took to ensure that the Opposition had seen this amendment as 

early as possible.  In our first meeting to discuss this amendment, I indicated to her to 

send us the draft so that I have an early indication of what is in the draft so that I can 

then discuss this with my Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I am aware that she had asked Cabinet if this could be done and as a result, I received 

the draft even though it is in the draft form.  This enabled me to have discussions with 

the Members of Parliament in the Opposition.   The end result is that we understand 

what the amendment is about and we understand that it is to ensure that what the initial 

intension of the Act was is complied with. 

</span></div><div><span>I talk about this process because I believe we should adopt this process going forward.  

The earlier that the Opposition is aware of what is happening the better it is.  Why, 

</span><span>because if we have any queries we have an opportunity to come back through the Head 

</span><span>of the Ministry to the Minister to Cabinet to query those concerns.  I am pleased to say 

that after discussions with my Members of Parliament, and the Head of the Ministry 

made herself available to come and explain if they needed to but that was not necessary. 

</span></div><div><span>We understood what the Bill is all about and you are not going to get any opposition 

from us on this Bill.  The only part of the Ministers statement that I am not sure that I 

agree  with.    It  is  not  going  forward;  we  are  already  forward  it  is  going  back  to  fix 

something that should have been detected earlier. 

</span></div><div><span>I should however mention that in the discussions that I had, I did put forward an option.  

Well if they do not comply or they are not a registered company in the Cook Islands, 

just turn their application down because we understand that there is discretion within 

the Minister to approve or decline applications. 

</span></div><div><span>However,</span><span> </span><span>rethinking about it, I did not think that was a good suggestion because we are 

trying to collect data so the more Companies that apply to collect data, the more data 

that we will have.  So making this amendment is the better option and the better answer 

to our problem. 

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  briefly  mention,  although  not  directly  related  to  the  Bill,  but  I  think  the 

Minister has made a statement on it and I think I should comment on it.    

</span></div><div><span>The Opposition’s approach to exploration is consistent with the Policy that Government 

has adopted.  It makes sense to the Opposition that if we are going to collect data to 

enable us at some later stage determine as to whether we enter into the Second Phase, 

then we need to do that very carefully and be very sensitive about our environment and 

to make sure that the technology that we at the end of the day will approve is one that 

</span><span>is  able to  extract  these nodules with  minimum  damage to  our environment.   And of 

</span><span>course we do not know, both sides of the House how long this exploration stage is going 

to take and if it is going to be a few years or many years, we do not know.  We are 

supportive of collecting that data so long as we cause no damage to our environment.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>On the Marae Moana, with regard to the Marae Moana Act, I just want to make the 

point that I do not think that the Marae Moana has had a meeting for the last three years.  

I  mention  this  only  because  we  rely  heavily  on  that  legislation  to  assist  us  with 

protecting our environment and yet the Board or the Committee or the Body there, is 

non-functional and maybe it is time that we run the two together as we are talking they 

need to run parallel.  On that note, and I am the only speaker from this side, we support 

this Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    I  now  put  the 

Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING  CLERK  AT  THE  TABLE:    </span><span>Long  Title:  An  Act  to  amend  the  Seabed 

Minerals Act 2019 (a) Clarify that only Companies incorporated in the Cook Islands 

and  that  are  registered  under  the  Companies  Act  2017  may  apply  for  a  Prospecting
