</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Clause 1: Short Title 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>I can see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, I thought I might rise early to indicate 

the Opposition’s views with regards to the process of the Constitution Amendment Bill.  

Our view has been discussed with all as we do not believe that the process which we 

are embarking on right now is the correct process and for that reason when you have 

finished  going  through  the  Clauses  and  the  Question  is  put  to  the  House,  we  have 

</span><span>indicated  that  we  will  not  support  the  Report  and  that  has  been  communicated  to 

</span><span>Government and also to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Again, I will put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>There is some confusion, I can’t hear properly.  I think we will go for a division.  So let 

me put it again.   

</span></div><div><span>Short Title: I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Those in favour please can you stand, and I will ask the Acting Clerk to do her part. 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING CLERK AT THE TABLE:  </span><span>For the Motion:

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Here is the result.  Those in favour of the Motion 13 and those 

against 11.   The ayes have it.   

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 2: 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, I wanted clarification while the Crown 

Law Officials are in Parliament.  I refer to Article 34 (3).  My interpretation of that 

Article is, Mr Chairman you do not have a vote, not a deliberative vote.  That is what 

34  (3)  says.    The  person  presiding  over  any  sitting  of  Parliament  shall  not  have  a 

deliberative vote but in case of an equality of votes have a casting vote. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Honourable Tingika Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  ELIKANA:    </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  was  wondering  whether  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition is aware of the Amendment in 2001 inserted No.24 which according to my 

copy reads, </span><span>“A person presiding over a Sitting of Parliament shall if the person is a 

Member has a deliberate vote and in case of equality of votes have a casting vote”.</span><span>

</span></div><div><span>I think the Acting Clerk is bringing a copy across. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>I concede that, that is correct. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Clause  2:  Commencement.    I  will  put  the  Question  –  Prime 

Minister we are on Clause 2. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Pursuant  to  Standing  Order  243, 

Amendment to or comment on Clauses, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 the Commencement is amended to read “this Act comes into force 

on the day after the date it is assented to by the Queen’s Representative” 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Can I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member, Tingika Elikana

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question:  

</span></div><div><span>That the amendment be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>(Opposition opposed) 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 as amended stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>(Opposition opposed) 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 3: Constitution amended. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>(Opposition opposed) 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 4: Article 76 (a) amended.   

</span></div><div><span>I see Mr Prime Minister on the Floor.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 (1A) will be removed and replaced with the below; 

(1A) Subclause (1B) applies to a person –  

</span></div><div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>born before the commencement of the Constitution  

</span></div><div><span>Amendment (No. 29) Act 2021 (the 2021 Amendment Act); and 

</span></div><div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>who was entitled to permanent residence under subclause (1) as it read 

</span></div><div><span>immediately before the commencement of the 2021 Amendment Act 

“(1B) A person described in subclause (1A) continues to be entitled to 

permanent residence”

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>(Opposition opposed) 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 as amended stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>(Opposition opposed) 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is now resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>I call upon the Minister in Charge of the Report of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I report on the progress of the 

Bill through the Committee, I note the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition 

</span><span>in questioning due process on the progress of this Bill.  I note that we do have a different 

</span><span>sort of opinion on a point of law that in no way affects the progress of this Bill to its 

current  stages  other  than  to  apply  the  constitutionally  required  90  days  sitting  to 

commence at its correct commencement date. 

</span></div><div><span>A  mistaken  belief  that  two  third  majority  was  required  in  the  vote  of  the  Second 

Reading  of  the  Bill  in  September  instead  of  a  simple  majority  does  not  in  any  way 

negate the voting outcome but rather strengthens it.  The requirement for the two third 

majority is after the amendments that all Members did support previously through this 

stage of Committee and that is when the Bill will then require to sit for 90 days. 

</span></div><div><span>I urge the Members of the Opposition to consider very carefully the lengthy process 

this Bill has taken in terms of consultations with all of our people, the trips that we have 

taken to all of the Outer Islands which will now be put in jeopardy without the support 

of the Members of the Opposition because of a difference of opinion on how the process 

of this Bill has progressed through Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>The amendments we seek in this House Mr Speaker firstly, the commencement date 

was  due  because  of  the  time  taken  for  the  Bill  to  progress  this  far  and  the  second 

amendment  Mr  Speaker  is  something  that  the  Whole  House  agreed  to  back  in 

September.    Therefore,  the  fate  of  this  particular  Bill  Mr  Speaker  rest  squarely  and 

entirely  in  the  hands  of  the  Opposition  whose  numbers  this  House  requires  for  it  to 

progress to its next stage.  

</span></div><div><span>I therefore, am pleased to report Mr Speaker: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill has passed through the Committee Stage with amendments 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  I  see  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>31 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span>Mr Speaker, yes there is a difference of opinion and I 

want to explain what that difference of opinion is.</span><span> </span><span>That came out on Tuesday the 29</span><span>th</span><span>

of September 2020.  We all know if we had read the Hansard that when the Motion was 

moved  for  the  Second  Reading,  that  Motion  was  not  seconded.    Under  113,  111 

sorry…I’m sorry, I am relating here to the Immigration Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>When the Second Reading was moved by the Honourable Henry Puna, it was seconded 

by the Honourable Vaine Mokoroa.  The Speaker then referred to Standing Orders 149 

for the authority for conducting a division.  The votes were taken, and that was the first 

problem because Article 41 (1) (a), that vote was not the preceding vote under Article 

41 (1) (a).  It was an incorrect procedure to have been adopted.  The Bill then went to 

sit for 90 days.  We know from an interpretation of 41 (1) (a) that that was not correct. 

</span></div><div><span>We have made it very clear to Government that we are as keen as them to have the 

Constitution Amendment put through but put through the correct way and that is where 

we differ in our opinion.  We do not want to be part of a process where you start and 

then an error is committed and then you try to fix it by voting again, it just doesn’t work 

like that and there is nothing in the Standing Orders that support that. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  keenness  to  see  the  Constitution  go  through  Parliament  is  such  that we  made  a 

suggestion of an alternative approach.  We thought that the approach that we suggested 

will actually then ensure that from the start to the end, there is nothing wrong with the 

process.  That is something obviously Government is not prepared to do and so we are 

locker heads because we do not want to participate in a process, which we think it was 

incorrect at one stage during that process. 

</span></div><div><span>We made it quite clear and we made that statement and I make that statement again that 

we are more than willing to support the passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill so 

long as we do it correct from the start to the end.  That is where we are today. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Tina Browne.  May I advise the Honourable 

Members that there is no more debate on this Bill as it has already been debated but I 

will give the Floor to the Honourable Member from Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>MR H. PUNA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I make the comment that I want to 

make in response to the comments by the Leader of the Opposition, let me associate 

myself with the messages of bereavement and sympathy that you expressed before at 

the beginning of our sitting.  We have indeed come through a time when a lot of our 

</span><span>‘Metua’</span><span> just passed away, and I notice the difference especially in Manihiki where we 

have only one </span><span>Metua</span><span> left.  Our condolences to all the families that have gone through 

those bereavements. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am very interested in the comments from the Leader of the Opposition 

but I have a question to pose.  What if she is wrong?  Because she raised an objection 

to the comments from the Prime Minister immediately before she spoke again and in 

fact she was shown to be incorrect according to the Constitution.  We have had legal 

</span><span>advice from the Crown Law office; legal advices to Government and to this Parliament.  

</span><span>That in fact the course of actions suggested by the Prime Minister is in fact the correct 

one.

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>We  are  obliged  to  listen  to  that  advice  not  to  the  advice  from  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition and yet it has become a major issue in this House this afternoon because it 

is capable of leading to a substantial delay in the passing of the amendment that we 

have already have before this House since September last year.   

</span></div><div><span>This is not an issue that is worth arguing and fighting over.  This is a procedural issue 

and I wonder what the Solicitor General or indeed the Leader of the Opposition have to 

say about Article 36.1 of the Constitution.  Where it appears in my view to give this 

House  the  authority  to  correct  any  mistakes  or  irregularities  that  might  arise  in  the 

course of proceedings in this House.  I stand to be guided on this issue.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  For now, I would advise you that 

I will not agree on anymore debate on this Bill, and I thank you for your comments on 

the bereavement hence the reason why I agreed for you to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>Right, I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Report on the Bill be adopted? 

</span></div><div><span>For this I will require a division. 

</span></div><div><span>Those in favour, please stand.

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker I was hoping to get some clarification on 

this and perhaps we can ask the Crown Law Officials.  This is the vote that requires two 

third majority. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    My  apologies  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    Actually,  for  two  third 

majority, we have to have 16 ayes.  So the Motion is defeated. 

</span></div><div><span>Motion defeated 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you and now I repeat what I have said before.  I did not finish what I was reading 

and the Leader of the Opposition stood up.  In the correct words, I have to retract.

Report on the Constitution Amendment Bill No. 29, 2021.  Which will now sit for the…
