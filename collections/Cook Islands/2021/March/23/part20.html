</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  could  I  just  respond  because  he  has 

asked me to answer his question and I think I owe it to our listeners to respond to the 

question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Are we going to allow you and you can stand again later? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>No, no. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Anyway you may speak.   

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>The  Immigration  Bill  will  sit  where  it  is.    The 

Constitution Amendment Bill can be re-introduced in this House tomorrow or the next 

day  or  as  soon  as  and  we  could  run  that  process  without  having  to  go  back  and  do 

consultation and that process can be done in about half an hour or one hour and once 

the Constitution Amendment is validly made, then we revisit the Immigration and have 

that legislation passed which was the initial intention anyway. 

</span></div><div><span>I thought I made it very clear and the former Prime Minister could be right, I could be 

wrong.    We  have  seen  from  history  that  every  lawyer  can  be  wrong  at  any  time 

including them. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Prime Minister there is a way forward and if we are able to go down that track as I 

indicated  earlier,  you  have  the  full  support  of  the  Opposition  if  the  process  is  done 

properly and Parliament can be called as soon as you are back just so we can deal with 

this issue. 

</span></div><div><span>I am happy to communicate with Parliament as to the steps as you say that since we are 

the ones that asked for it to be done this way,  I am happy to communicate as to the 

process going forward and of course if we are right with our views of the legal position, 

then doing it this way can never be questioned by anyone. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.
