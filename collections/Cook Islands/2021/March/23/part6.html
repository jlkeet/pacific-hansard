<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Second Reading of the Police Amendment Bill.  I call upon the Minister Responsible 

to speak on the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Since assuming the Portfolio 

as the Minister of Police, there had been a number of inconsistencies in the Regulations 

</span><span>and now in the Act that has been brought to my attention. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can I interrupt you Honourable Prime Minister.  Can the Minister 

move for the Second Reading of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>8 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  before  I  move  on  to  those 

inconsistencies.  I now move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Police Amendment Bill be read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue Honourable Prime Minister 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  The public were recently made aware 

of requirements for renewing driver’s licenses once you hit the age of 60 that you need 

a medical test and an eye test.  This of course caused a great concern amongst those 

young pensioners in  our population  who are still fit and active and do not  require  a 

medical report to prove their suitability to be able to drive a vehicle. 

</span></div><div><span>And of course we are looking to  maintain  consistency in  these particular provisions 

with countries like Australia and New Zealand to ensure that there is no undue burden 

being placed on our people who need to undergo these costly medical exams when they 

are  perfectly  fit  and  capable.    Under  those  Regulations  today  Mr  Speaker,  I  see  the 

majority of the Opposition would require to undergo medical and eye test to continue 

</span><span>driving their vehicles. 

</span></div><div><span>But this Amendment Bill Mr Speaker is to, in our view, correct another inconsistency 

that needs to be done and it is a very straight forward amendment Mr Speaker.  It seeks 

to repeal Section 35 of the Police Act which relates to the compulsory retirement of 

Police at the age of 60.  The effect of this amendment is that members of the Police will 

no longer be required to retire at the age of 60. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the reasons for this Mr Speaker is that if we look at our Constitution, in particular 

Article  64  and  65,  this  deal  with  the  fundamental  human  rights  and  freedom  of  our 

people.  Putting an age requirement on a person’s ability to do a job Mr Speaker in our 

view is discriminatory and it denies the rights and security of a person or deprives them 

of an opportunity to earn for their living.   

</span></div><div><span>The reality is a number of our current serving Police would be forced to resign from 

their positions because they have hit the age of 60. Our incoming Police Commissioner 

would not be eligible because he is a youthful early 60s.  It is our view Mr Speaker that 

person’s ability to do their job should be based on the merits and not on their age.  

</span></div><div><span> If one looks at the Police Force in Australia and New Zealand, Mr Speaker there is no 

compulsory retirement age in these Police Forces.  That is because their view is that if 

a person is capable of doing their job then it does not matter what their age is. 

</span></div><div><span>However,  this  amendment  Mr  Speaker  does  not  deny  Members  of  the  Police  from 

taking  up  their  options  to  take  early  retirement  or  resign.    Every  public  servant  is  a 

member  of  the  Cook  Islands  National  Superannuation  Fund,  and  Police  who  are 

members of this Fund can if they choose take early retirement under the provisions of 

the Superannuation Act which can be at the age of 55. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I will have to interrupt you Honourable Prime Minister.  Our meeting 

will take a break for the second time.  We will return into the House at exactly 12.00 

noon.  We shall see you all back in the House at that time.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.29 a.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Parliament  is  now  resumed.    Before  we  took  a  break,  the  Prime 

Minister  had  the  Floor  speaking  to  the  Bill.    You  may  continue  Honourable  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Referring back to the Bill at hand, the 

Police Amendment Bill, I was referring to the Police Departments in both New Zealand 

and Australia and in  both these Police  Forces  there is  no mandatory  retirement age.  

Police can work into their sixties and in some cases into their seventies in these Police 

Departments as long as a person is able to do their job effectively.  So their employment 

is  based  on  their  performance,  not  on  their  age  and  that  is  one  of  the  fundamental 

reasons Mr Speaker we want to make sure that our Police Force legislation is consistent 

with the other countries that we have strong relationships with. 

</span></div><div><span>From the outset, I believe that by removing this discriminatory criteria of retiring at the 

</span><span>age of 60, we are complying with the Articles of our Constitution which protect our 

</span><span>fundamental rights and freedoms. 

</span></div><div><span>I know there may be some concerns that by removing the compulsory retirement age 

that younger Police may feel that they have limited avenues to be promoted in the Police 

Force.  However, since becoming the Minister of Police Mr Speaker, I am aware that 

we have far greater issues that we need to address within our Police Force, the least of 

these being the retirement age. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe our Police Force needs to  have clear career paths  for those who are newly 

appointed Constables into our Police Force.  There must be opportunities for them to 

be able to develop their skills as Police Officers and there must be due consideration 

given to the remuneration of our Police Officers. 

</span></div><div><span>We have some work to do within our Police Force but as I stated to our Police Force in 

my first parade as the Minister of Police, that I will be behind our Police Force every 

step of the way to ensure that we have a Police Force that is the envy of those in the 

Pacific. 

</span></div><div><span>I welcome the comments from the Members of the House in regards to this Amendment 

Bill but as I reiterate, this is a very simple and straightforward amendment to the Police 

Act and it deals with one issue and that is the removal of Section 35 which relates to 

the compulsory retirement age of Police at the age of 60.  This is just one of the very 

small steps that we are taking Mr Speaker to start building up our Police Force again.   

</span></div><div><span>With those words Mr Speaker, I commend this Bill to the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  Can I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tamaiva Tuavera 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> You may speak Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>10 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>Firstly, Mr Speaker I would like to extend our warm condolence 

to our family member who passed on in New Zealand, Robert Brown.  I can see there 

are five Members in this House directly related to Robert Brown and they are the Prime 

Minister,  Honourable  George  Angene,  Honourable  Rose  Toki  Brown,  Honourable 

Tehani  Brown  and  myself.    We  also  have  Members  in  the  House  very  close  to  this 

family.  His body will be returned on Friday and his body will be taken to the morgue 

at the hospital.  On Saturday morning, he will be brought to the Church in Avarua and 

at 10 a.m. the Church Service will commence and afterwards he will be laid to rest next 

to his mother in Tupapa. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe the Prime Minister will meet up with the family in Auckland when he gets to 

Auckland.  I thought the Prime Minister will take myself and my friend here along with 

him but he will confirm that to us. 

</span></div><div><span>I come back to the Police Amendment Bill 2021.  The Police have a Cook Islands Police 

Association  and this  is  what  they have forwarded to  me,  from  their President and it 

relates to Section 35 of the Police Act 2012.  When this is repealed, when you reach the 

age of 60 you will not be required to retire.  There are other areas in this Section 35 but 

</span><span>the problem is there are only 147 officers in the Force but when it comes to the time for 

</span><span>promoting the officers, it is already filled by the older officers. 

</span></div><div><span>We  know  that  the  Honourable  Vaine  Mokoroa  has  been  a  Police  Officer,  Tingika 

Elikana was a Police Officer and also the Secretary of Health.  This is the message, you 

cannot go up, you can only go sideways.  There are 147 officers and when we compare 

the 147 to the thousands in New Zealand and also in Australia, there are openings to go 

up  and  not  sideways.    This  is  the  request  from  the  Police  Association  that  they  be 

consulted on the amendment to Section 35 of the Police Act.  I do not think this is an 

unreasonable  request  from  the  Police  Association  because  they  are  saying  that  they 

have not been consulted of this change to the Act.  That is their main concern. 

</span></div><div><span>The Performance Appraisal Report has also been looked at.  The Report will define 

whether an officer is hard working or a person that does not do his job properly.  When 

you  work  for  a  particular  department  you  will  be  appraised  according  to  your 

performance.    I  am  mindful  of  the  fundamental  human  rights  and  freedom  in  our 

Constitution. 

</span></div><div><span>I am one of those against the introduction of the driver’s licence renewal  Regulation 

once you attain the age of 60 years.  The first thing I did was to go into the Constitution 

and looked at the section for human rights because we are discriminating against our 

plus 60 year olds. This is what this association from the Police is asking,  if they can 

meet with the Prime Minister who is also the Minister of Police to air their views about 

this Regulations.  

</span></div><div><span>When we look further, there are positions in the Police that are not filled and I am not 

sure whether there are sufficient budget for those positions.  I cannot believe there is no 

one  in  the  Police  today  that  can  fill  those  positions.    When  we  look  at  the  work 

</span><span>experiences the officers have that are leaving the Police, the lucky departments are the 

</span><span>Customs and Immigration.   Therefore, if we want  an effective Police  Service then  I 

believe it is better for us to listen to their views. 

</span></div><div><span>11 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at the budget for Police, it is not enough because we want to attract the 

youth to join the Police but they would not because the pay is not enough.  When we 

look at Police Officers holding high ranks today, they really have the patience to stay 

longer in the Police even if the pay is low.  What did they do?  They took courses at the 

USP and I am sure that is what the Honourable Tingika Elikana did during his time, as 

well as the Minister Makiroa.  This is to improve their academic standard so if they 

leave the Police, it will be easy to look for another employment. This is my request on 

behalf of the Police Association to look at whether the Minister of Police can meet with 

them for discussions.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  

</span></div><div><span>I also noticed there are a few of the Browns on this side without the ‘e’.  I am surprised 

what you are doing on that side.  

</span></div><div><span>I now see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>(laughter)</span><span>

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker for allowing me this opportunity to 

speak.  I would like to thank you Mr Speaker and the Honourable House for offering 

your condolences on the passing away of my mother Ngai Tupa and my father in law 

Motu Kora.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker.  I  would  like  to  congratulate  you  for  taking  this  high  position  in  this 

Honourable House. Even though your Deputy Speaker is the Member for Pukapuka, I 

know for sure Mr Speaker that you are always looking towards me and not at him. My 

congratulations to you for taking this very high post.  

</span></div><div><span>I will now come back to the Amendment Bill requiring Police Officers to retire from 

the Police once they attain the age of 60.  What we are looking at today, I have also 

looked at the Constitution.  The Minister of Police and Member for Ngatangiia have 

both given their thoughts on the Constitution.  We are all aware of Article 64 and Article 

65 of the Constitution and also the suggestion that has been raised by the Member for 

Ngatangiia concerning the Police Association. 

</span></div><div><span>In his explanation, there are some members in the association who are not happy about 

what is currently happening in the Police.  To me Mr Speaker, I would like to consider 

the importance of this because some of the officers who are not 60 years yet are striving 

to  get  promoted.    The  question  that  I  have  for  them  is  that,  do  they  really  have  the 

experience or the qualifications to pursue these high positions?  There are two classic 

examples  in  the  House  today,  the  Minister  and  Member  of  Parliament  for 

Nikao/Panama  and  the  Member  for  Pukapuka/Nassau.    Mr  Speaker,  I  am  glad  they 

resigned that time because they had enough wisdom and education before they resigned.   

</span></div><div><span>Following their resignation, the Member for Pukapuka/Nassau ended up taking the post 

of Solicitor General and the Member of Parliament for Nikao/Panama took up the post 

of Secretary  for  ICI during those times. As  you can see the level  of intelligence Mr 

</span></div><div><span>12 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>Speaker, they knew they could not go any higher so they took the opportunity to move 

aside.  I know there are some weaknesses in how our Police Service is operating and 

even up to today there are still some weaknesses in our Police Service.  

</span></div><div><span>We need to strengthen the operation in our Police however, we should not do it by haste 

but to carefully consider the level that we need for these officers to be put into these 

positions. Do not  ask  me  why my  views have  gone that way because  I  have had an 

experience  in  being  a  Head  of  Ministry.  What  I  did  Mr  Speaker  was  I  did  a  lot  of 

planning in analysing the staff under my supervision. Just like what the Member for 

Ngatangiia previously mentioned about the requirement for a Performance Appraisal. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to confirm that if you do not have a progressive  report for 

your Ministry, you will not progress upward but will go down. This is a necessity that 

I am considering in regards to the amendment of the retirement age. I have no issues 

about  amending the Act  however  I encourage the Minister of Police to  consider the 

request  by  the  Member  for  Ngatangiia  to  meet  with  the  members  of  the  Police 

Association and discuss a way forward. I know we agreed in our last budget that the 

new  recruits  should  get  an  increase  incentive  in  their  wages.  Mr  Speaker,  I  want  to 

</span><span>confirm with you that this has been done. Although this area has been completed there 

</span><span>are other areas that need to be addressed as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Some of the members of the Police Force have been in contact with me.  This is one of 

the  comments  that  they  have  raised  with  me  and  I  would  like  to  bring  it  into  this 

Honourable House.  I apologise in advance to the Minister of Police.  They said, if only 

our Minister is the Minister for Corrective Services then he would be able to understand 

our situation and provide a better procedure for the Police. 

</span></div><div><span>I  know  that  this  is  one  of  the  avenues  that  the  Minister  should  consider  for  the 

appropriation for our wages and maybe hopefully for this year, it will get better.  That 

is why I said earlier on that I do not have any problem with this Bill at the moment.  I 

hope there will be consultations between the Police and the Minister to come to terms 

with the needs and requirement of the force so that the position of the Police will be 

strengthened.  

</span></div><div><span>In our budget last year, I know there were some weak areas that we have not addressed.  

I know they only had three output areas in their budget, output one, two and three. 

</span></div><div><span>There is one area that I wanted to be included in the budget and that is to do with traffic.  

There was no allocation in the budget last year for traffic.  That is the reason we see the 

problems we have today on our roads.  If we were able to allocate money for this area 

of policing for our police to chase these offenders, we will have fewer problems on our 

roads.  I remember former policemen like Papa Archer Hosking, you will never know 

where they are stationed on the roads.  When they chase after you, you better watch out 

when they catch you. 

</span></div><div><span>During those days, the drivers on our roads were very careful and they were vigilant to 

</span><span>drive carefully.  As we can see today, there are people speeding around the island three 

</span><span>or four times a day and not being stopped because there are no traffic officers to control 

the area.  In our national budget this year, I hope the Government will include some 

</span></div><div><span>13 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>funds to support the traffic section in the Police to help reduce all the problems we have 

on our roads. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker before I take my seat, I have a request to the Minister of Police.  I would 

like to ask the Minister to consider the age of our police officers whether they are new 

in the force or long in the service.  I would encourage the Minister also to include the 

performance appraisal for the Police Force. I have met with the Deputy Commissioner 

of Police, Aka Matapo a couple of weeks ago, I offered my recommendations to him to 

improve  the  Police  Force  and  my  proposal  for  their  Police  budget  for  next  year  to 

increase  the  wages  for  the  Police  Service.  I  believe  this  will  strengthen  the 

performances of our Police Force. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker I do not have any problem with this amendment, I fully support it.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Before  we  proceed,  I  will  get 

myself in line with the process of our sitting.  Before I allow another Member to speak, 

I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Minister you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and greetings to all of us.   

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the Amendment Bill before the House.  The reason being 

Mr Speaker and this is the truth.  I have been in this Police Department for 34 years, 

because if you commit a crime, you will proceed through the Police Department.  This 

means for 34 years I have been through the Police Department. 

</span></div><div><span>Through this Department, I ended up in prison serving 34 years and also dealing with 

the lawyer office for 34 years.  I also served 34 years with the office of the Probation 

Services.   I have  gone through all these different  offices and  I know the many wise 

people during those past years.  I only hoped that they were alive today to see me and 

what I have achieved because of what they have taught me. 

</span></div><div><span>These were the wise saying that my Mama Maggie taught me, </span><span>“the older you are, the 

wiser you get.”</span><span>  Through the many years I have come until today and the arrival of this 

Amendment Bill into this House, I fully support this extension of time to over the age 

of  60  years  until  his  mind  is  ready  to  give  up.    When  we  consider  the  expatriate 

Commissioners,  some  of  them  were  over  70  years  and  their  minds  were  fully  alert.  

Therefore, I think it is appropriate that this age be extended. 

</span></div><div><span>There is a view that those who are new and below should rise through the ranks.  The 

</span><span>intention here is not just for anyone to be moved up but to progress with definite hard 

</span><span>work.  It is not for anyone to automatically move up but to prove your worth.  This will 

impact  on  all  of  us  Members  of  Parliament.    Your  voters  in  your  constituencies  are 

looking at our performance as to what we are doing for them.  This same principle also 

</span></div><div><span>14 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 23 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>applies to the agencies of Government. If you don’t perform well then you will not get 

an increment.  I uphold this principle because I worked hard to get me to where I am 

today. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker I encourage us all to consider this rightly as the Scriptures says, 

“</span><span>So teach to number our days so that we may apply our hearts with wisdom.”</span><span>  The 

Scripture also taught us to walk in the ways of wisdom not in the foolish ways as we 

consider the hard times of COVID-19.  Thank you to the Prime Minister for bringing 

this Bill into the House not only for the Police but for the other Government Agencies 

as well.  Some agencies are serving to influence others to lower their performance. 

</span></div><div><span>I do believe the Leader of the Opposition will understand because as a lawyer she will 

have full grasp on this area.  I take note of the comments by the Member of Parliament 

for Matavera that maybe I should be the Minister of Police.  Mr Speaker, during my 

past official travel overseas,  I visited five prisons in New Zealand, Tonga, Australia 

and Korea.  I visited three prisons in New Zealand and observed the way they managed 

it and I hope to bring this system to the Cook Islands in that the Prison Services work 

closely with the Police.   

</span></div><div><span>Maybe in the future I will ask the Prime Minister who is the Minister of Police, maybe 

to  accord me the opportunity to  review the operations of the Ministry of Police.   In 

terms of budget expenditure that remains with him. 

</span></div><div><span>I am only sharing my thoughts in what I have seen and experienced about the Police 

and Corrective Services and the plans for the future. 

</span></div><div><span>In  terms  of  the  60  year  limit,  I  do  fully  support  the  extension  of  the  years  and  as 

presented by the Minister of Police into the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Now  I  would  like  to  put  the 

Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING CLERK AT THE TABLE (J. DANIEL):  </span><span>Long Title: An Act to amend 

the Police Act 2012 to remove compulsory retirement at the age of 60 for Members of 

the Police.
