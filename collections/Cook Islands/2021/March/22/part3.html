<div><span>QUESTION TIME 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span> Thank you very much Mr Speaker for this opportunity to ask a question. 

I have two questions and I will ask the first question to the Honourable Minister George 

Angene.  

</span></div><div><span>I have seen him driving around in his Government car and on the rear windscreen is a 

title called “LEADER”.  I believe the Leader of Government, Honourable Mark Brown 

and the new Leader of the House Tehani Brown, which leads me to ask the Minister to 

explain to us why did he put “LEADER” on his car?  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Minister, George Angene.</span><span>

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  G.  ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  Thank  you  also  to  the  Member  from 

Matavera for the good question.  If you have heard the Chaplin this afternoon during 

our opening devotion mentioning the term “Leader”, leading the people of God.  When 

we got to Titikaveka, I had hope you would have followed us so you could listen to the 

Chaplin mentioning the word “Leader”. 

</span></div><div><span>On the question of what is the actual definition for the term “Leader”, we know the 

leader of Government  is  the Prime Minister.   Mr Speaker, the position of the Prime 

Minister is that he is the Prime Minister.  It did not say Prime Minister and Leader.  He 

is the leader of the Cook Islands Party, Tina is the leader of the Democratic Party and 

George Maggie is the leader of the One Cook Islands, returning to the home where he 

came from.  I believe the purpose of a leader is, for example:  “Love is patient, love is 

kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It does not dishonor others, it 

is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not 

delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.” </span><span>(1 Corinthians 13:4-6).</span><span>

</span></div><div><span>These are the status of a good leader and I believe the Cook Islands Party has elected 

the  right  leader.    This  is  my  response  to  you  Honourable  Member  from  Matavera. 

</span><span>“Teach us to number our days, that we may acquire a wise heart”.  “Thy word is a lamp 

</span><span>unto my feet and a light unto my path”.  Amen. </span><span>

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA</span><span>: I was going to ask a Supplementary Question to the Minister but I will 

ask a question to the Prime Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>The  question  is,  as  I  have  had  a  look  at  the  MFEM  website,  he  may  not  be  able  to 

answer  tonight  and  maybe  tomorrow  because  I  asked  this  same  question  at  the  last 

Sitting  last  year.  I  believe  the  Prime  Minister  will  have  a  fair  understanding  of  the 

question. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is, if you can explain to the House on the status of our financial situation 

in the country.  I believe Mr Prime Minister, our people listening in will be happy to 

hear where we are in terms of our financial situation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  also  to  the  Finance 

spokesperson for the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>Just  last  week  or  the  week  before,  the  Cabinet  received  and  released  the  Quarterly 

Report for the period ending December.  At six months of the Financial Year, we will 

be  reporting  on.    The  country’s  revenue  was  operating  better  than  expected  due  to 

additional revenues that were not recorded at the time of our budget in June last year. 

Our expenditures were also on track with what we have expected with minor variants 

but there is no denying that the revenues of the country because of the drop in tourism 

has  dropped  considerably.    Next  week  will  be  the  end  of  the  third  quarter  of  this 

financial year and again, we will have a better idea of what our actual revenues are and 

</span><span>our actual expenditures for these three quarters.  

</span></div><div><span>However, our team has made an assessment since the closure of our border in March 

last year – 12 months now. The cost of the border closure to our country, not to the 

</span></div><div><span>9 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>Government but to the wider economy, is about a million dollars a day.   This is the 

money that tourist brings into our country every year and that is what we are missing 

out on.  When I say we, I mean the hotel operators, restaurant owners, car rentals and 

motor  bike  operators,  tour  operators,  fishermen  who  sell  their  fish  to  the  hotels  and 

restaurants, the growers who sell their products to the hotels and the restaurants, the 

market vendors who no longer have any customers to sell to.  But we have kept our 

people alive, we have protected our country and not allowed the COVID to come in 

and I think for that, our people are very grateful. 

</span></div><div><span>However, it has come at a very big cost to our country but we are seeing now the people 

who have been on minimal wage or the wage subsidy close to a year, for many that is 

not enough for them to continue.  If the tourist are not bringing in the money for them 

to earn, our people will go overseas to find that money and that is what we are seeing 

now is our people going in for short-term contract at the meat works and at the fruit 

picking.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, this year’s finances has been appropriated in the budget and we 

stand by what we will make available to people right through to the end of the financial 

</span><span>year in June.  However, we have for a number of months now been preparing the new 

</span><span>financial year for the new budget and we will be going through its final processes by 

April.  It is here that we will see that there could be a funding gap. 

</span></div><div><span>In the budget for this year, we were able to fill that gap with the stabilization of the fund 

and money that we have set aside.  We were supported with some Grant Funding from 

New Zealand and we drew down on some of our loan and contingent borrowing from 

the ADB.  This year our options are very limited because we are a developed nation 

that  graduated  last  year,  the  Grant  Funding  and  the  concessional  borrowing  that  is 

available to other countries is not available to us.  

</span></div><div><span>So we are working very hard with other avenues to be able to fill in those funding gap.  

And part of my state visit to New Zealand in the next few days will be to talk with not 

only the Prime Minister of New Zealand but to also talk with relevant agencies and the 

Reserve Bank of New Zealand to look at other avenues for our country. 

</span></div><div><span>But the real fact of the matter is Mr Speaker that the avenue for us that is best suited for 

our country is the revenue that is derived from our tourist because it is money that we 

do not need to borrow, it is money that is not in the form of grants from donors, it is 

money that we as a country earned from our own hard work. 

</span></div><div><span>I know we have been sitting comfortably for one year now, keeping the COVID out 

and the tourist out.  But while we have been sitting quietly there has been a lot of work 

that has been going behind the scenes.  Our tourism operators have been gearing up for 

a restart of the tourism industry.  Our Health at Te Marae Ora has been gearing up to 

ensure our readiness in terms of health is well prepared. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  Border-Agencies  have  been  prepared  for  the  commencement  of  the  two-way 

</span><span>quarantine travel.  Our testing capability is fully functional and will be ready with the 

</span><span>additional  PCR  lab  in  two  weeks’  time.    Our  contact  tracing  capability,  today  we 

announce the commencement of the Bluetooth App that will complement the QR card 

</span></div><div><span>10

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>that is now in use in our country.  This app Mr Speaker is able to operate both here in 

the Cook Islands and also sync with the New Zealand system.    

</span></div><div><span>All  the  advice  that  I  have  been  given  Mr  Speaker  is  that  we  are  ready  to  open  for 

business.  The one added measure of comfort that is available to us Mr Speaker is the 

availability of the vaccine so that we can start vaccinating our population to protect our 

people.  Te Marae Ora have completed the detailed plan of the vaccination rollout which 

will mean that our entire population of Rarotonga, the Northern Group and the Southern 

Group can be vaccinated in a matter of days. 

</span></div><div><span>So, while the question raised by the Honourable Member (Vaitoti Tupa) regarding the 

status of our financial accounts is a very valid one.  We know our finances will be taking 

a battering but the bad news is not how the state of our accounts are.  Actually, I should 

rephrase that, the news that we should not be concerned with is how bad our state of 

accounts is.  The good news we should be looking at is how well as a country are we 

going to respond. 

</span></div><div><span>The good news Mr Speaker is that as a country we prepared ourselves one long year for 

</span><span>the commencement again for our business.  We have learned lessons about how our 

</span><span>tourism industry is operating better over the last seven years.  We know there will be 

new ways of doing business but we are positioning ourselves Mr Speaker to be one of 

the first in the region to be up and running and back in business. 

</span></div><div><span>We are the first country that New Zealand has entered into an agreement for quarantine 

free travel  between ourselves and New  Zealand.  As a matter of fact,  we have been 

operating in a two-way quarantine free travel between ourselves and New Zealand since 

January  this  year.    Albeit  just  restricted  between  Cook  Islanders  and  work  permit 

holders. 

</span></div><div><span>We have proved our ability to respond to any outbreak that occurred in New Zealand.  

Two recent  outbreaks over the last two months.    We were able to  respond and stop 

passenger travels for a short period of time to ensure that the COVID did not come into 

our country. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I say Mr Speaker that as a country, yes we have come through some very difficult 

times, but I say we are well placed indeed, Mr Speaker to face the coming challenge 

and to put ourselves back into business in the next few weeks. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker I will endeavor to provide to the Honourable Member the information that 

he seeks that  I have eluded to in our quarterly financial report on the website at the 

Ministry of Finance, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti 

Tupa and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question 

</span><span>to the Honourable Prime Minister.  My question is, have your team sought advice from 

</span><span>our financial partners as to what has been agreed to in the past to  give us aid  going 

forward.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>For example, we are a member under the Climate Change Organisation and we are also 

a member under the Environment Agency and we are a member in the BRS – Basel, 

Rotterdam and Stockholm Convention.  My understanding is that if we fail to consider 

our financial partners and yet we have adequate contributions with these international 

partners. 

</span></div><div><span>Referring back to our Pacific Region, under SPREP, SPC and SOPAC, I know that we 

have contributed to these Regional Organisation for we have signed the agreements. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is, what type of assistance can they provide for our nation and for us to 

become a developed country, will they be able to reassess our nation and place us back 

into  a  developing  country  again?    I  believe  that  this  is  a  valid  question  Honourable 

Prime Minister, they should provide the type of help we need for the Cook Islands and 

for the entire Pacific nation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER</span><span>:    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I can assure the Honourable Member 

</span><span>that the Government has left no stone unturned.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable 

Member Tamaiva Tuavera. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>My question is to the Prime Minister and thank you, Mr Speaker, 

for  this  opportunity.    My  question  Mr  Prime  Minister  is,  before  the  bubble  travel, 

because yesterday morning I watched the news from New Zealand and the New Zealand 

Prime Minister was getting interviewed on the Breakfast show.   

</span></div><div><span>The question posed to her was, are they going to open up the bubble with Australia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, can you ask your question please. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>Her answer to that question was, it is going to take another two 

weeks before she can answer the question regarding the bubble travel between Australia 

and New Zealand.  My question now is, do we play Russian roulette with COVID by 

letting tourists come to our country?  I know we are not ready.  We can boast how we 

got this, we got that, but we are not ready.  We still have two machines up there and 

there is nothing else that I have seen in the hospital that tells me we are ready if we ever 

get  COVID  over  here.    So  playing  Russian  roulette  with  COVID  to  me  is  very 

dangerous.    Do  we  get  vaccinated  first  before  we  seek  tourist  or  do  we  just  receive 

tourists and play Russian roulette? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister, can you answer that in short?   

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Your question will be answered tomorrow.
