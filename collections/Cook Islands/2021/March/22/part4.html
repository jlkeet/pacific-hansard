<div><span>PRESENTATION OF BILLS 

</span></div><div><span>I will call the Leader of the House, Honourable Tehani Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 224 Notice to be given of introduction of a  

Bill be suspended so as to enable the Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill  

to be introduced and passed through all its stages tonight to enable the Police 

Amendment Bill to be introduced and passed through all its stages tonight and 

enable the COVID-19 Cook Islands National Superannuation Bill to be  

introduced and passed through all its stages tonight 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Can I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tereapii Maki Kavana 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I just wanted to get clarification.  The 

Order Paper in our pigeon holes today did not include the Bills that was mentioned by 

the Leader of the House.  The Supplementary Order Paper we have received about half 

an hour ago does not have any of those Bills on the Order Paper.   

</span></div><div><span>I am looking at Standing Orders 64 to 70.  I am very mindful of the fact that part of this 

Session in Parliament is to correct mistakes that we made or this House made in March 

and September last year.  I do not claim to know exactly how these Bills come onto the 

Order Paper without them actually being stated on there.  I am a little surprised that we 

are still using the Suspension Standing Order in 4 to do the very things that the Standing 

Order  Select  Committee  have  been  discouraging.    In  other  words,  do  not  abuse  the 

Suspension Standing Order No. 4. 

</span></div><div><span>If you are confused, Mr Speaker that is because we also are confused and if you can 

take us through the Order Paper and how it is that you can include Bills on the Order 

Paper that are not on the Order Paper, then that will be helpful for us. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  These Bills are on 

Presentation of Bills Motion to allow the Bills to be dealt without notice required by 

Standing Order 224.  It’s on page 88 – second page Notice of Introduction of Public 

Bills  –  No.1  Seabed  Minerals  Amendment  Bill,  2  Police  Amendment  Bill  and  3 

COVID-19 Cook Islands National Superannuation Fund on the Order Paper.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call for a Seconder.
