</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. ARIOKA: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and greetings everyone in the name of our 

Lord.  Greetings to our people who are listening in to us tonight and also greetings to 

those watching us on livestream on Facebook.  Greetings to us Honourable Members 

in this Honourable House tonight.  Greetings to you Mr Speaker and congratulations 

once again for taking up the realm to lead this Honourable House into the next century.  

I also pay my congratulations to the Deputy Speaker as well for being able to take on 

this responsibility as your Deputy Speaker moving on the years ahead.  Greetings to the 

Leader of the Opposition and your Members of Parliament under your control and wish 

you  the  hard  work  that  we  have  worked  together  on  this  very  particular  Bill,  Mr 

Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>I think it is fair for me Mr Speaker to speak in our mother tongue because I know that 

</span><span>many of our people who has been working hard as well as being part of the process to 

bring this Final Report on the Agriculture Bill to a conclusion.  It is also fair Mr Speaker 

that on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture, the Honourable Rose Toki-Brown and 

</span></div><div><span>16 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>myself, as well as the Select Committee, they have been working so hard to bring this 

Bill to an end and it has been worthwhile waiting and at the same time now we have 

something concrete that our people and their livelihoods really depend on.  In saying 

that Mr Speaker, I congratulate the Select Committee who has worked tirelessly on each 

of the key elements  that concerns our people to  make sure that  we understood their 

concerns with regards to their livelihoods in agriculture.   

</span></div><div><span>Most in particular the Deputy Chairman who has been very vocal in making sure that 

the issues discussed has met all the criteria’s that this Bill has gained so that our people 

understands it very well.  I also give thanks to each member of the Select Committee 

who has worked as a group on every issues that we have dealt with and I am sure to say 

that we have thoroughly given time to make sure that this Bill is not only able to enable 

the industry to grow but also to assist our people to further on in the agriculture industry.   

</span></div><div><span>To  all  our  people  listening  today,  it  is  a  happy  day  because  we  have  accomplished 

something  wonderful  through  a  law  to  strengthen  agriculture  for  the  next  twenty  or 

thirty or even fifty years in the future.  I can assure you Mr Speaker that most of us in 

here are planters.  That is why we are so quick to understand the importance of this Bill, 

</span><span>collected and drafted from  the people of our nation, tabled today.  Mr  Speaker, this 

</span><span>report is very clear, we were able to distinguish the importance in compiling this Act 

for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>In year 1984, the Ministry of Fisheries Department was removed and since that time, 

Agriculture has held on to that long-standing law to this day.  No other law was passed 

to improve agriculture since 1994 to this day.  Fortunately for us because in 2012 FAO 

(Food Agricultural Organisation of the United Nation) funding was available to support 

and draft the Bill.  In 2017, consultations on a policy for the Bill took place.  In 2019, 

Cabinet then gave approval for public consultations.  So, Mr Speaker we can see that 

since 1996 the Ministry and it outputs remained at the same level.  Two things were 

noticed during that time.  Firstly, this Ministry does not get involved with agriculture 

in the outer islands, because of this, the Minister Honourable Rose Toki Brown in 2008 

formed an MOU to commence agriculture with the outer islands.  From then on until 

today, we can see the great work that has been put into this Bill.  We can see that there 

is no need to go back to an MOU as we have a Bill that will soon be passed in this 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  support  that  have  been  put  forward  by  the 

Members of this Committee.  Mr Speaker the first one is that the Government will be 

able to assist our people to market their produce to other countries.  This Bill will enable 

our people to send their produce to New Zealand and to other countries.  In the past it 

was very difficult for our local growers to market their produce New Zealand, but this 

Bill takes that away. 

</span></div><div><span>This Bill will enable our people to have the confidence that their produce will have the 

market  to  consume  them.    Although  with  the  assistance  of  Pacer-plus,  this  Bill  will 

enable our people to be in a good status regarding the market.  This is the stand of the 

</span><span>Members on this Committee that our people are catered for and not at a lost as in the 

</span><span>past. 

</span></div><div><span>17 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly  Mr  Speaker,  we  cannot  ignore  the  local  knowledge  our  people  possessed.  

Through our consultation with our people, it was established that the local knowledge 

of our people are very important and it should not be ignored.  The committee believes 

that these are the local knowledge of planting that our people have and we should hold 

on to this knowledge.  In fact, we can see today that some of our European friends are 

taking advantage of these local wisdom.  Therefore, since this is something of our own 

heritage, we should treasure these local knowledge and experiences for future benefit. 

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly Mr Speaker, I would like to point out the importance of members selected to 

be committee members that were appointed to support the overall work of the Ministry 

of Agriculture.  The committee were able to strengthen the overall performance of the 

committee and ensured a proper process in place in encouraging them to become great 

committee members should they get chosen to support the work of the Ministry.  These 

steps would be of great help for the Head of the Ministry in providing proper guidance 

for the right thing to be done under this Act. 

</span></div><div><span>I am glad to announce the support of our people to the Committee and for the process 

to be clear for our people to understand and to know that everything is being covered 

</span><span>under this Act and they will be protected should they get involved. 

</span><span>This Bill will strengthen the committee members covered in this Act for the work of 

the Ministry of Agriculture.   

</span></div><div><span>Fourth point Mr Speaker is based on the area of work for those seeking knowledge in 

the  agriculture  area  for  our  people.    I  am  also  glad  to  inform  you  Mr  Speaker  the 

importance of this Bill, it is to protect our nation so that nobody will not get into any 

problems, difficulties or mistreatment as previously experiences.</span><span>

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, the committee and our people had reviewed these closely to ensure that the 

work of our workers are correctly reviewed and protected when inspecting agricultural 

sites.  We have had past experiences of pest who had entered our country attacking our 

produce resulting a significant loss with our planters.  That is why this Bill is necessary 

for us to support our people by researching further into the agriculture activities.  On 

behalf of the committee,  I am honoured to report to this Honourable House that our 

people are happy because the process listed are very clear and these steps will not to be 

tolerated and be misused when a problem arises,  but to be used to support our local 

planters.</span><span>

</span></div><div><span>So, a decision has been made Mr Speaker, an authority has been granted, a law to help 

protect those who enter plantation grounds, even those who enters residential premises 

that  are  unattended,  they  will  be  protected  under  this  Bill  to  ensure  they  carry  their 

duties successfully.  Therefore Mr Speaker, this Bill is successfully completed. 

</span></div><div><span>The  fifth  important  thing  in  this  Bill  is  finding  people  that  the  Ministry  can  use  for 

various research task.  Anyone wanting to access this information will have to refer to 

the OIA Act 2008. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, I can see the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I rise to move: 

</span></div><div><span>18 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>That the Minister be given extra speaking time so that he  

can complete his speech on the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister and I call for a Seconder 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I know that is a very long speech Minister.  You may carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. ARIOKA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I am trying to be brief to give our other 

Members time to raise their comments. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker, as I was speaking on part of the Official Information Act 2008 

</span><span>to confirm that regardless whether the Bill is included in it, it is best that our people 

</span><span>follow  the  proper  procedure  outlined  in  the  Act  to  enable  them  to  collect  any 

information or knowledge from within our Ministry today.  Our committee were able 

to confirm these with Crown Law for our Ministry to proceed with their investigations 

in collecting information instead of the OIA 2008 being used against them.  In case our 

people requires information that the Ministry had collected, they will still have to refer 

to the Official Information Act.  The purpose behind this Act, so that we can protect the 

information that is freely given to us by our own growers.  The information given will 

benefit our own growers as this Act gives that protection. 

</span></div><div><span>Part 6 of this Report, Mr Speaker gives protection to the Agriculture Officers who work 

for the Ministry.  In this Bill there is provision made for those who will have to enter 

into homes or land used for planting or storage of machines, they will be protected when 

entering these premises. 

</span></div><div><span>However, in the first writings of this Bill there was a provision, or consideration given 

to  the  parquet  and  the  Committee  decided  that  this  explanatory  on  parquet  to  be 

removed because it did not serve its purpose under this Bill so this Amendment has 

</span><span>been completed under this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Part 7 of this Bill concerns the days applying to our growers.  Under the original Bill 

there  was  seven  days  allocated.    However,  in  the  Amendment  Bill  this  has  been 

extended to twenty-eight days and this is on part with all the legislations of this country.  

This was amended and accepted by our people so there’s uniformity in the accepted of 

28 days applying to our growers. 

</span></div><div><span>Part 8 of this Bill covers the relationship between the Ministry of Agriculture as well 

as  the  Island  Government  of  each  island  and  under  this  Bill  within  the  relationship 

between Ministry of Agriculture and the Island Governments there’s provision granted 

to  the Secretary of Agriculture within this section.  Everybody  accepted  this change 

because that includes that in the future maybe these types of work will be extended to 

the workers of the Island Government under this provision. 

</span></div><div><span>19 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>For example, we consider the caretakers that has been sent to the island of Suwarrow 

where they have been given the powers under this Act to act as biodiversity officers on 

the  island.    Therefore,  the  Committee  was  happy  with  the  support  granted  by  the 

Council Members on the island and through the Island Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I come to the final part which is on the Regulations under the Act.  The 

Output 5 areas under this Regulation where it lends support to the production of food 

right across the whole spectrum of agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>We see the different modes and methods of growing and planting today and an example 

is organic farming.  As well as beekeepers today and those who are growing root crops 

today.  But there remains legislation that will impact on our food producers which is 

the Food Safety Standards Requirement. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker the intent under the Regulations is to ensure that the food and 

produce that we grow do not cause other problems when we export them out of the 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>The second provision under the Regulations is concerned with the steps and the ways 

</span><span>where Government can assist the growers in exporting their produce overseas.  Hence  

the Committee has included major provisions under the Regulations that is completed 

today. 

</span></div><div><span>Number three under the Regulations is to do with certain steps and procedures that our 

growers need to abide and follow.  These steps are referred to as standards and codes 

of production.  Our people accepted these steps and is supported by the Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>The forth provision is made for the time when our people need to do the right thing and 

where protection is required under research and bio-security protection. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to seek leave of the House to provide 

extension of time for the Minister of Agriculture to complete his presentation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Minister, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. ARIOKA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I only have two short parts to complete 

what I have to say.  Provision 5 under the Regulations is concerned with growing and 

planting  in  the  Outer  Islands  in  co-operation  with  our  traditional  leaders.    These 

provisions  enable  us  to  consider  the  laws,  customs  and  practices  of  growing  and 

planting on each island.  The Committee gave full support to this and ensured that this 

</span><span>provision be included under the Regulations to ensure it does not fall aside.  

</span></div><div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Committee,  we  extend  our  sincere  thanks  and  appreciation  to  the 

people of our nation who had given their full support with the good work that we have 

</span></div><div><span>20 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>been doing today  and what  can be done for the  future.  We  can assure that  over 60 

recommendations were received from our people to be inserted into this bill, however, 

our Committee have managed to sort them out,  which is the report that you can see 

before us today. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister, I see the Active Deputy Leader of 

the Committee 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for the opportunity you have given for me to 

speak.  I will only speak for about 20 minutes.  Coming back to the report, as I am the 

Deputy Leader on this Committee, you will find recommendations that were confirmed 

in this report.  Within those recommendations confirmed by the Committee, they have 

selected nine recommendations who had been approved.  This confirmation had been 

relayed back to the people who had contributed.   

</span></div><div><span>We have all read the report, there were nine important recommendations which we the 

</span><span>Committee had discussed and confirmed with the public that these recommendations 

</span><span>had been included in this report.  Mr Speaker, I will spend most the majority of my time 

when it is the second reading of this Bill.  That is the end of what I have to say, that is 

why I said that I will only speak for about 20 minutes on this Bill, so I can give my 

support for this report.  Also, with the recommendations that has been approved, I want 

us Members of Parliament to read all the recommendations, so everybody understands 

what is being talked about with this Bill for Agriculture, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member, that brings us to the completion of 

the presentation of papers.
