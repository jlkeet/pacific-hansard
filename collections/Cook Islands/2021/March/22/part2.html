<div><span>OPENING PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER (T.TURA): </span><span>Please</span><span> </span><span>be seated.  Greetings to all of us this 

afternoon.    To  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Members  from  the 

Government,  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  Honourable  Members  of  your  team, 

greetings to you all.  Again, I would like to greet all the Honourable Members who are 

present in this Honourable House today. 

</span></div><div><span>I also wish to advise this Honourable House that the Acting Clerk received a letter of 

resignation from  the former Speaker of Parliament,  Mrs Niki  Rattle, on  Friday, 12</span><span>th</span><span>

February 2021.  It reads: 

</span></div><div><span>Miss Jeannine Daniel,  

Acting Clerk,  

Parliament of the Cook Islands,  

Nikao,  

Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>Re: Letter of Resignation 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana Miss Jeannine Daniel,  

</span></div><div><span>I  wish  to  tender  my  resignation  as  the  Speaker  of  Parliament  of  the  Cook  Islands, 

</span><span>effective as of this day Friday, 12</span><span>th</span><span> February 2021.  I am most grateful and humbled 

</span><span>for the opportunity to have been invited to be the Speaker of the Parliament of the Cook 

Islands back in June 2012, following the death of Sir Geoffrey Arama Henry, by the 

former Prime Minister Henry Puna.  Serving our country in this capacity of procedural 

technicalities has been a highlight milestone in my working career that    deviated from 

the humanitarian field of nursing Red Cross at all levels.  I embraced the challenges 

with  an  open  mind  and  on  the  whole,  I  have  thoroughly  enjoyed  the  role  and 

responsibilities and will miss the staff of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I have been able to operate at the highest level of the CPA in promoting our jurisdiction 

</span><span>and worked with many partners, such as UNDP, our twining Western Australia Pacific 

Jurisdiction and many others in bettering our small Parliament.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>I  regret  that  I  have  not  completed  many  of  the  important  projects  that  we  have 

implemented  but  I  know  that  you  and  the  team will  continue  to  completion  with the 

enthusiasm and dedication. 

</span></div><div><span>I will clear my personal property and hand over the Parliament resources on Monday, 

15</span><span>th</span><span> February.   

</span></div><div><span>Kia manuia,  

Niki Rattle. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now call the Acting Clerk to conduct the election of a new Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING CLERK AT THE TABLE (J. DANIEL):  </span><span>Honourable Members, we will 

now go to the election of the Speaker.  Before I call the nomination for the Speaker, I 

would like to draw your attention to and request that you take note of the Constitution 

Amendment 2001, No.24.  The person who shall be elected Speaker of Parliament and 

no other, shall be the person nominated by the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now commence the election process for the Speaker at this moment.  I now call 

</span><span>on the Prime Minister to make his nomination and move a Motion accordingly. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Acting Clerk.  May I, at this time, acknowledge, in 

this Honourable House, the outstanding service provided by our former Speaker, Niki 

Rattle.  She has served into her ninth year as the Speaker, gaining recognition for our 

country in the region and throughout the Commonwealth.  She has held positions of 

the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary 

distinction  and  high  authority 

Association and her service to our Parliament and to our country is well recognised by 

this House and will be accorded a deserved recognition in due course. 

</span></div><div><span>throughout 

</span></div><div><span>However, Madam Chair Person, may I, in accordance with Article 31 as amended by 

the Constitution Amendment 2001 No. 24, I now move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Honourable Tai Tura, Member of Parliament for Mauke do take the 

Chair of this Parliament as the Speaker of this Honourable House 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING CLERK AT THE TABLE:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I call 

for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Henry Puna 

</span></div><div><span>MR H. PUNA:  </span><span>I will speak briefly to the Motion please.   

</span></div><div><span>First of all, I would like to lend support to the comments of praise and congratulations 

by the Prime Minister for our former Madam Speaker.  I was somewhat surprised in 

learning of the resignation of the former Madam Speaker.  I suspect maybe because I 

resigned, maybe she has also decided to. 

</span></div><div><span>However, as the Prime Minister has said, the name of this country have been uplifted 

through the work of this woman.  The first time I worked with her was when she and I 

</span></div><div><span>2 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>travelled to Geneva in Sweden to attend the Conference of the Red Cross worldwide.  I 

did not know that she was already nominated to Chair this prestigious meeting. 

</span></div><div><span>As soon as we arrived, the President of Switzerland met to congratulate her and I was 

so proud in the way she conducted the meeting.  When she became the Speaker of this 

Parliament, likewise, she carried the name of this country very high.  In my mind, it is 

only right that we all should be very proud of what she has done.  However, I am even 

more  proud  because  I  am  the  Member  of  Manihiki  and  she  is  a  Manihiki  woman.  

However, she has always been a Cook Islander. 

</span></div><div><span>Yes, I know some of her major projects are not completed, however she probably thinks 

the time is right for her to retire.  Mama Niki, if you can hear me, I on behalf of all of 

us in the House convey our congratulations and praise to you. 

</span></div><div><span>To  our  Speaker  that  has  been  nominated  by  the  Prime  Minister,  a  son  of  Mauke,  I 

believe he is capable of taking the position due to the mentorship of Niki Rattle. I am 

sure that whatever concerns we put to him, he will not be flustered by it.  Just be careful, 

we  might  be  evicted  from  this  House.    However,  this  is  an  honour  that  has  been 

</span><span>bestowed onto this son from Mauke and he is following in the footsteps of our former 

</span><span>Speaker, Papa Mapu Taia, who also comes from Mauke.  Therefore, all the best with 

your new position. 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING CLERK AT THE TABLE:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Henry Puna.  I see the 

Member for Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span>Thank you Madam Acting Clerk for granting me time to comment in 

support of the nomination.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I lend my support for the nomination by the Member of Manihiki for our new 

Speaker of Parliament, the Member of Mauke.  Secondly, Madam Acting Clerk, I give 

compliment  to  the  former  Speaker,  Niki  Rattle,  as  beforehand  complimented  by  the 

Member  from  Manihiki.    We  have  all  heard  from  the  Member  of  Parliament  from 

Manihiki giving a brief background of her time as Speaker in Parliament, until the time 

I became a Member in 2018. 

</span></div><div><span>I acknowledge the time she spent in assisting the new Members through workshops and 

mentoring to assist us all in this House.  I would like to make a special mention to her 

for selecting me out of all the Members of Parliament in the Cook  Islands to be the 

Cook Islands Representative as an Observer for the Fiji Elections one  year.   At that 

point in time, I received great assistance and teachings from Niki Rattle regarding the 

period  observing  the  Fiji  elections.    Therefore,  if  you  are  listening  in  Niki  Rattle, 

through me and on behalf of all of us the Members of Parliament on the Opposition 

side, we give you our thanks and appreciation for your great service.  

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, to the Member from Mauke, we give you our full support and encouragement 

in your new role.  For that reason, if you want support, I am here to help you out.  From 

</span><span>all  of  us  in  the  Oppositions  side,  to  you  the  new  Speaker,  may  God  grant  you  the 

</span><span>knowledge and wisdom in your deliberations in this House.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 22 March, 2021 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING CLERK AT THE TABLE:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Vaitoti Tupa.  I see the 

Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Greetings to everyone this evening.  To the Acting 

Clerk, greetings.  To all your staff, greetings.  To the Prime Minister and your Ministers 

and all Members of the Parliament, greetings.  To our visitors in the gallery, greetings.  

I can see that you are here to support your Candidate from Mauke as the Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to seek some understanding, as I can see, the Crown Law Office is here with us.  

When  the  Standing  Orders  were  created,  it  was  the  original  Article  31.    When  the 

original  Standing  Order  was  formulated,  it  relied  on  the  previous  Article  31  of  the 

Constitution.  We know that in 2001, that article was amended and the difference is that 

the only person that can ever be elected as the Speaker, is the nominee of the Prime 

Minister.  The Article is quite specific, it says no other.   

</span></div><div><span>When we go to the Standing Orders, to all those Standing Orders I think that applies, 

Acting Clerk, I’m looking at Standing Order 8 (3), it says that: “If only one member or 

person is so proposed, he shall be declared by the Clerk to have been elected” by the 

</span><span>Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is, is that the procedure that we are going to adopt today? 

</span></div><div><span>ACTING CLERK AT THE TABLE:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Tina Browne.  I wish 

to confirm to this House that, that is the process that we are going to take today. 

</span></div><div><span>I am also minded to note that the Standing Orders had not been amended to implement 

the change to the Constitution. The Constitution overrides the Standing Orders where 

there is  a conflict.    In this  case  Honourable Members,  only the Prime  Minister may 

nominate a person to be elected as Speaker, under Article 31 (2) of the Constitution, as 

amended by Constitution Amendment number 24 at 2001. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, as there is only one nomination and none other, Honourable 

Tai Tura is declared the Speaker Elect.  

</span></div><div><span>Honorable Members and members from the public Gallery, please rise.  I am honoured 

to present to you the Speaker Elect, Honourable Tai Tura. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members and members of the Gallery, please rise. 

</span></div><div><span>I am honoured to present to you the Speaker Elect, the Honourable Tai Tura. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, please be seated.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I would like to thank you all for trusting in me.  In addition, to everybody who 

had encouraged me, I would like to let everyone know that I will do everything in this 

seat with honor and will do my best to be fair with everyone in this Parliament.  I’d also 

</span><span>like to give my thanks to the Former Speaker who had retired, because we had worked 

</span><span>together for some years and she had helped and supported me on some of the things 

that I had not done right.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 11 

</span></div><div><span>What will I do?  I can assure everyone that I will do my best and there is this saying, “I 

am the best”.  When the Sevens started here in the Cook Islands, there was a friend of 

mine Amene Rangi and the Member for Ruaau, William Heather.  We were the first 

outer island team to have joined in this tournament.  The Coach was, yours truly.   

</span></div><div><span>When  we  started  this  game,  the  players  were  asking  me  if  we  were  playing  against 

Jonah Lomu, because that was the time when Jonah Lomu returned and had just been 

selected in the All Blacks team.  This is what I said to these players, “You are the best 

and there is no one better than you, including Jonah Lomu”.  This gave them the courage 

to do their best.  Therefore, I would like to let you all know that you are the best in your 

own self.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now suspend Parliament to allow myself, the Proposer and the Seconder to go on 

to His Excellency the Queen’s Representative, Sir Tom Marsters, to take the oath of 

allegiance and to lay claim to all its privileges.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, Parliament is suspended. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 5.34 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed 6.57 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please be seated.  Parliament is resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  Honourable  Members.    I  am  pleased  to  report  that  I,  as  Speaker  of  this 

Honourable  House,  have  taken  and  subscribed  the  oath  of  allegiance  before  His 

Excellency,  the  Queen’s  Representative  Sir  Tom  John  Marsters.    That  on  behalf  of 

Parliament,  I lay claim  to all its privileges and that  His Excellency on behalf of the 

Queen was pleased to confirm the same. 

</span></div><div><span>May I call upon the Leader of the House? 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I stand to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament extends today’s Parliament sitting under Standing Order 54 (2)  

to allow Parliament to consider the business before the House  

with the following times:  Start at 5.00 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. break

</span></div><div><span>Can I call for a Seconder, please?  I see the Honourable Albert Nicholas.

Honourable  House.    I  rise  to  nominate  the  Member  for  Pukapuka-Nassau,  Deputy

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may proceed. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Our nomination is not undermining the Honourable
