<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  The  Clauses  of  the  Bill  will  stand  adjourned  until  after  the 

Schedules to the Bill are disposed of. 

</span></div><div><span>Schedule I: Agriculture 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $608,576 for Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Member for Amuri/Ureia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  I  do  not  know  why  people  are  laughing.  

Wheth</span><span>er there is somebody behind me I cannot see, I don’t have eyes in the back of 

</span><span>my head. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  to  everyone  in  this  House  this  afternoon.  Mr  Chairman,  to  you  and  your 

staff members, Kia Orana. Kia Orana to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, 

to the former Prime Minister, to the Cabinet Ministers and Government Members, the 

Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  your  team,  Kia  Orana.  Kia  Orana  also  to  our  people 

listening in to our discussions on the Appropriation Bill.  Kia Orana  to the people on 

</span><span>the  Island  of  Aitutaki  and  to  my  people  in  my  constituency  of  Amuri  </span><span>–</span><span>Ureia.    I 

</span><span>believe you understand the meaning of Kia Orana. I won’t say anything further, Kia 

</span><span>Orana  to  you.    Kia  Orana  also  to  my  colleagues  the  Honourable  Tom  Marsters  and 

Tangata Vavia,  Kia Orana to you.  I know that you have not departed from this Party, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>61 

</span></div><div><span>instead you have just moved temporary to that side. Do understand that we still want 

you back in this side of the House.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to congratulate the Minister responsible for the Appropriation Bill and to 

your team - in preparing this Bill.  I hope that  you can do the same in the future.   I 

would also like to congratulate new Members in the Opposition.  The reason being I  

heard you say that we should work together.  But the sad thing is that in the last term 

of  Parliament,    the  same  words  were  spoken  by  people  from  that  side.    They  all 

wanted us to work together, to co-operate but when it actually came to the crunch they 

were  also  very much opposed to  a lot of things that went  on in  this Hou</span><span>se.   I don’t 

</span><span>really want that disease to contaminate you.   I would like to congratulate you because 

what we have heard are honourable things that you have said.  I am very pleased. 

</span></div><div><span>We are now discussing the appropriation for the Ministry of Agriculture because we 

heard  from  the  Honourable  Member,  Robert  Wigmore  about  the  weakness  of  the 

Ministry  of  Agriculture.    I  am  not  trying  to  find  faults  in  Government.    What  I  am 

trying to  do is to  find ways because we have heard people say that we should  work 

together  and  co-operate.    We  should  find  ways  to  improve  the  situation.  What  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Robert  Wigmore  said  was  correct  when  he  said  that  the  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Agriculture is not involved any longer in sending our produce overseas. This  process 

is now in the hands of the private sector. I understand that in the past it used to be the 

Ministry  of  Agriculture  who  was  responsible  for  exporting  our  produce  to  countries 

outside of the Cook Islands.  It is now up to the private sector to help the growers of 

our country to market their produce.  I think it should be the Ministry of Agriculture, 

because they have the expertise, they are the ones who were sent overseas to study, to 

learn  the  marketing  procedures.  They  have  obtained  diplomas  and  degrees.    The 

Ministry is in possession of the personnel who have been going to all the workshops 

and I am not sure what they are using the knowledge they have acquired for. 

</span></div><div><span>Recently when I was in New Zealand I met these people speaking in English but they 

are Mangaians and Aitutakians. They were speaking in English.  As I was watching 

them, I was thinking whether they understand each other because they were talking in 

a foreign language. 

</span></div><div><span>I went around the shops where they sold fruits and root crops.  I saw the bananas and 

the pawpaws. What  was shocking was  that the bananas were scratched,  bruised and 

damaged. The quality was very poor.   I saw taro on the market  and these taro were 

still  carrying  the  mud  from  their  plantations.  These  were  imported  from  Samoa.  I 

asked  myself</span><span>,  “What  is  happening  to  the  taro  that  we  send  overseas?”.    I  had  a 

</span><span>Samoan friend.  I spoke to him and he said, in their Samoan Communities they speak 

Samoan.    In  their  Meetings,  they  speak  Samoan.  When  they  meet  each  other,  they 

</span><span>communicate in Samoan. They don’t addr</span><span>ess each other in any other language. 

</span></div><div><span>He admitted that there were some oppositions to their export of Taro to the overseas 

</span><span>markets.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  Samoa  responded  that  they  couldn’t 

</span><span>understand what their New Zealand counterparts were saying. That is why they kept 

</span><span>sending what they wanted. 

</span></div><div><span>In the past we used to send bananas, oranges and all sorts of crops to New Zealand but 

today we are not exporting any of these crops.  Why?  Why are we not able to send 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>62 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>these crops any more?  If the problem was a boat then why not tell us that we need a 

boat to carry our produce to New Zealand.  If the problem was the market why not tell 

us how best we can tackle this matter in order for us to satisfy the market.  If it was 

the  growers,  why  </span><span>can’t  they  tell</span><span>  us  that  the  problem  is  the  growers  so  we  can  do 

something  about  it?      I  understand  that  in  the  past  Agriculture  was  the  backbone  of 

this country. But we are no longer exporting our agricultural produce to New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>Now in Aitutaki there are private enterprises exporting our crops to New Zealand but 

the  unfortunate  part  is  that  if  the  space  for  booking  is  filled  by  themselves  then  the 

others will not have an opportunity to send their produce.  So, what I want to do is for 

this Ministry to wake up, to wake up and do something about it. If we are dependent 

on private exporters, private exporters will only look after their own affairs. They are 

not worried about the general exporting community. I understand Mr Chairman, that 

the private exporters operate on private basis. They send their produce to friends and 

</span><span>relatives.    We  don’t  know  how  these  private  people  operate.  This  is  the  problem  of 

</span><span>private exporting.  He will try and put his crops onto the market first.  He will do the 

</span><span>same  with  his  family’s  produc</span><span>e.  If  the  space  is  full  then  it  is  most  unfortunate  for 

</span><span>others because they cannot get in. I don’t want anybody to talk back because what I 

</span><span>am saying is what I know.  If the Members know anything they should speak up.  This 

</span><span>Honourable Member also exports, so </span><span>if you’d like, ask him to explain what he does. I 

</span><span>am only expressing what I know are the glaring problems in the Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Leader  of  the  Opposition  knows  about  this  but  he  is    getting  personal    at  me.  

Why is it happening this way?  We want to do something about this Ministry. So the 

question I wish to raise is, why is it happening this way?  We have been very active in 

the past in this area but why is it not happening today?  Today it is gone.  Are we still 

exporting the pawpaw?  This is the problem.  This is what I know in the Outer Islands 

but  here  in  Rarotonga  I  know  nothing.    So  I  would  suggest,  Mr  Chairman,  that  our 

colleagues in New Zealand be utilised.  Our Government has got workers there. Why 

</span><span>don’t we send our produce to them to market? </span></div><div><span>T</span><span>his is what I’m talking about. If the problem is the market why can’t we utilise our 

</span><span>office in New Zealand?  There are people sitting around on their seats doing nothing?  

</span><span>Why can’t we export our produce and they be in charge to sort out the market in New 

</span><span>Zealand.  Today, Aitutaki is lucky because the boat is going directly to Aitutaki, but 

when the boat goes back, Tonga and Fiji are responsible for filling the boat up before 

</span><span>heading  back  to  New  Zealand,  not  the  Aitutakians.    If  Tapi’s  boat  has  to  bring  the</span><span>

produce from Aitutaki, because of the cost of the freight,  then it leaves the growers 

nothing.    These  are  the  things  that  we  need  to  consider.    Through  the  advice  of  the 

Ministry of Agriculture then we should be in a position to know how to resolve these 

problems.  Maybe that is the way to do it.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can you just assume your seat Honourable Member.  Sorry.  Thank 

you.  I call again on the Honourable Member for Amuri-Ureia for your third speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> There are crops in Aitutaki that we can export to the Northern Group 

</span><span>Islands, but I was told that the freight on the boat is too expensive.  So what can the 

</span><span>growers get out of it?  This Honourable Member on our side is marketing the people’s 

products  to  Rarotonga.  I don’t know how he organi</span><span>sed the airline because again  we 

have  to  pay  the  freight.    Maybe  the  Ministry  could  negotiate  with  the  Airline  to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>63 

</span></div><div><span>provide some kind  of concessions for the simple products  like these when the outer 

islanders  need  to  market  them  to  Rarotonga.  Maybe  this  Honourable  Member  is 

getting his stuff across to Rarotonga free.  Chairman if the Honourable Member Dr. 

Pupuke  Robati  is  saying  that  this  is  the  job  of  the  members.    Of  course  this  is  a 

Member. I am only inviting the Ministry to be a little more involved. If we are going 

by the individual Members, then, the benefits will come to some people only.  That is  

not  what  I  am  advocating,  I  want  everyone  to  benefit.  We  must  understand 

Honourable Members that the cargo from Aitutaki is freighted here by plane.  But the 

plane  cannot  bring  all  of  those  cargoes  destined  for  Rarotonga.  And  it  will  be  very 

expensive to send the crops on the plane but if the boat of our friend over here would 

</span><span>go over there and bring our produce from Aitutaki, then there’s no problem. </span></div><div><span>The Members on the Opposition side are saying that the boat has been to Aitutaki but 

came back with no cargo on it.  I want them to know that the boat came back without 

</span><span>even  bringing  the  cargo  from  Aitutaki.    Don’t  open  your  mouth  because  you  don’t 

</span><span>even know what happened.  When the people tried to get their cargoes onto the boat,  

not all the cargoes were loaded before the boat left.  

</span></div><div><span>So our job is therefore to see how best we can attend to the needs of our people.  That 

</span><span>is why I said to the new Honourable Members on the Opposition side that the moment 

they are influenced by the older Members on the Opposition side, then they will all be 

lost.    Probably  in  the  next  couple  of  days,  you  will  know  how  they  perform  in  this 

House.      As  soon  as  one  Member  speaks,  they  will  want  to  speak.    When  I  rise  to 

speak, they will all start interjecting.  I will not say anymore Mr Chairman. I will sit 

down  and  I  will  reserve  one  of  my  ten  minutes  to  speak    later  on.    Thank  you  Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member. I call for the next speaker?  The 

Honourable Member for Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  R.  WIGMORE:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  Honourable  Members  in  this  House  this 

afternoon, greetings to  you all.  Greetings also to our people who are listening in to 

our  debate.  To  those  here  in  Rarotonga  and  also  in  the  Outer  Islands,  Kia  Orana.  

Because we have come to the Agriculture allocation, I rise to speak my mind.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  feel  sorry  for  my  colleague  the  Honourable  Member  Paora  Teiti, 

when he  asked  why the  Ministry of Agriculture   </span><span>didn’t do anything in  the past.  My 

</span><span>concern  is  how  long  has  he  been  on  the  Government  bench?    Maybe  for  5  years.  I 

listened to him Mr Chairman, criticising the Ministry of Agriculture but if he was in 

Government at the time he should be criticising himsel</span><span>f too.  Because he wasn’t able 

</span><span>to  carry out  his responsibilities as  a member in  the then Government.    Nevertheless 

Mr Chairman, I liked his views when he talked about his concerns. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday  Mr  Chairman,  I  was  saying  that  the  appropriation  for  the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture  is  insufficient  because  only  about  $100,000  was  placed  on  top  of  the 

</span><span>previous  year’s  allocation  for  this  Ministry.    That  is  why  I  said  that  there  is  not 

</span><span>enough money for the Ministry. If the Government was to inject about $120,000 more 

</span><span>into  the  Agriculture  Budget  then  I  would  say  that  that  will  be  enough.    What  I  was 

really saying was that only a $120,000 was allocated for Agriculture.  I said this is one 

Ministry we need to consolidate. The export of produce is one sector.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>64 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  stated  yesterday  that  the  reason  why  we  were  not  able  to  export  was  because  the 

export regulations were changed in New Zealand but the local Ministry of Agriculture 

was too slow in accommodating those changes. So the success that we have enjoyed 

in the past Mr Chairman is no longer there.  New Zealand has changed the law and the 

protocol for all the export that is required by New Zealand had changed.  We did not 

try  to  meet  their  requirements.    So  to  do  this  job  Mr  Chairman,  it  will  cost  money.  

</span><span>It’s not only the proto</span><span>col that we need to look at.  There are other researches we need 

to  undertake.  I  will  support  the  idea  that  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  should  not 

maintain the negotiations for the markets.  That responsibility should be carried out by 

the private.  I would strongly recommend that Ministry of Agriculture should not be 

bothered with the market but to concentrate on their role. 

</span></div><div><span>I want this House to know Mr Chairman, that I was involved in the past in negotiating 

for  markets for crops such as taro. But the problem that we have discovered in this 

area, Mr Chairman, is that we were not able to supply the market.  I want Parliament 

to  know  that  to  look  for  a  market  is  not  difficult.    The  important  part  for  us  to 

remember  is  that  we  must  be  able  to  maintain  the  market.    The  market  needs  to  be 

</span><span>supplied 7 days a week. The quality and the types of produce must be sustained at all 

</span><span>times. This is why I have said previously Mr Chairman, that I do not believe that the 

amount appropriated for Agriculture is sufficient for the work needed to be done. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Excuse  me  Honourable  Member.    You  are  taking  your  second 

speech.  Carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. WIGMORE:</span><span>  We must be aware that there are a lot of areas that help would 

be  required  to  be  provided  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.    So  I  urge  the  Minister 

responsible for this  vote item,  to  look  carefully  at  providing  enough funding so that 

we can  asses the implications of the various projects  carefully.  I believe also  that if 

this sector of our economy is improved,  this  particular sector will be able to help us 

in the recovery process.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, if the support is given to the Ministry of Agriculture we will be able - 

after  a  period  of  4  years  -  to  bring  in  an  amount  of  about  $11  million  through  this 

Ministry for the country.   I believe that if we maintain the kind of appropriations we 

now have in this Budget, we will not be able to get the projected target of $11 million 

in  4  years  time.    So  I  would  like  to  ask  us  all  to  look  at  this  appropriation  very 

carefully  because  this  is  an  area  not  given  the  support  required.      Not  only  in 

Rarotonga but in the Outer Islands  as well with particular reference to the export of 

our produces.  This is an area I would like to support Mr Chairman, particularly the 

export of our products.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  There appears to be none.  The Minister of Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you this afternoon.  To 

</span><span>the  staff  members  and  Members  of  this  House  and  to  our  people  listening  in,  Kia 

</span><span>Orana.    Kia  Orana  also  to  the  growers  of  this  nation.    I  would  like  to  send  my 

greetings to each and every one of them. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>65 

</span></div><div><span>What the Honourable Member Robert Wigmore is saying Mr Chairman, is quite true. 

The Appropriation for Agriculture is not sufficient.  I would just like to explain that 

the  Appropriation  here  for  the  Ministry  is  what  the  Ministry  asked  for.    In  fact,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, all the Ministries’ requests were made by the individual Ministries.  Ex</span><span>cept 

for  one  or  two  areas  where  we  felt  that  the  requests  were  too  excessive,  that  the 

Ministry  would  not  be  able  to  utilise  the  requested  funds  this  year,  we  made  a 

reduction.    But  on  the  whole  the  allocation  granted  to  each  Ministry  was    based  on 

their  actual  requests.    Maybe  Mr  Chairman,  now  that  we  are  aware  of  the  fact  that 

there has been a change in the Minister of Agriculture,  maybe we should give him a 

chance to go through his Ministry. In the future when we  get a better idea whether he 

will need extra funds or not, then we will act accordingly.  I would personally like to 

increase the allocation for Agriculture, Mr Chairman, because a lot of the money that 

we have used in the past has been money coming back through other channels into the 

country.  The revenue we have as  part of our Budget is the money that comes from 

outside  of  our  Nation.  We  are  relying  mainly  on  Tourism,  Marine  Resources  and 

Offshore Industries as our revenue sources.  Those are our sources of revenue and all 

of  them  rely  on  funding  from  offshore.    By  far  the  tourist  industry  is  our  biggest 

revenue source.  Unfortunately, Tourism is a very fickle industry.  It depends on the 

</span><span>whims  of  tourists,  whether  they  want  to  come  here  or  where  there  are  better 

</span><span>attractions elsewhere.  We know  that during the Asian crisis we lost a lot of tourists 

because some of our tourists used to come from Asia, and as a result in the down-turn 

in the economy in this area not many tourists from Asia came to us. 

</span></div><div><span>So now that the Asian economy is starting to pick up we are hoping there will be an 

increase in tourism from that area. 

</span></div><div><span>The  other  area  of  our  revenue  source,  the  other  important  area  of  revenue  source  is 

our  pearl  farming.    Unfortunately,  Mr  Chairman,  we  are  not  getting  value  from  our 

pearl  farming.    A  lot  of  pearl  farmers  are  not  paying  any  tax  at  all.    Not  only  the 

farmers, but  everybody  associated with  pearl farming.  The unfortunate thing is  that 

pearls  are  very  small  things  that  can  disappear  in  your  pocket.    So  when  you  travel 

overseas  and  s</span><span>ell  them,  nobody  will  be  the  wiser.  Even  though  it’s  an  important 

revenue source, we receive very little, that’s another area we need to boost.</span></div><div><span>And thirdly, the Agriculture sector, Mr Chairman.  This is also a problem area.  We 

are all aware that in the past we used to send our produce to New Zealand.  In those 

days  we used to  have a  guaranteed market  but  now New  Zealand has opened up its 

market to everybody, we have to fight with everybody else to get our produce to New 

Zealand.  We are not  the only ones  having problems.  Even New Zealand is  having 

</span><span>the same problems.  They can’t sell all their apples now.  They are producing so many 

</span><span>apples  that  they  cannot  sell  them  on  the  world  market  because  the  world  market  is 

now flooded.  We have to recognise all those realities even though agriculture forms a 

large part of our revenue. We need to look after and nurture it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Are you going to carry on with your second speech? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Yes Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  The Honourable Minister of Finance. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>66 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  We have to be mindful that we are competing with the rest of 

the  world.    What  we  have  to  be  careful  of  is  if  we  want  to  establish  markets  and 

maintain markets we have to be very careful with the  quality of our produce.  I think 

one  of  the  weaker  areas  is  the  quality  of  the  produce  that  we  are  sending  to  New 

Zealand. These are not of a very high standard.  I visited a company in New Zealand 

</span><span>in 1995 called “Chiquita” and they are one of the largest importers of bananas in the 

</span><span>world.    They  were  also  receiving  our  pawpaws  at  the  time.    I  went  to  inspect  this 

facility because I had complaints that our growers were being told that the quality of 

our produce was not of a high standard.  After visiting this complex I was assured that 

the rumours were true. The quality was not of a good standard.  Some were rotten and 

some were full of holes.  The shipment had just arrived when I got to the factory and 

they opened the boxes for my benefit.  What I found was that the pawpaws we sent to 

New Zealand were not market quality.  While I was there they asked me if we had any 

taro.  I asked them how much do you want?  They told me they wanted three 20 tonne 

containers every month.  They needed those containers every month.  I told them we 

would be lucky to fill those three containers in one year.  So we lost that because we 

could not supply during that time. 

</span></div><div><span>There are two things we must remember, Mr Chairman, when we want to export our 

</span><span>produce  overseas.    Two  things  we  must  remember.    No.1  the  quality  must  be  top 

class.  Secondly, we must be able to provide what they need.  That means we must fill 

</span><span>the  demand.    It  won’t  be  any  use  if  we  were  able  to  send  them  one  container  this 

month and none the next month because that’s not the way they operate.  So the new 

</span><span>Minister of Agriculture will have a tough job in ensuring that we continue to export 

produce overseas.  But I think we can be assured of one thing.  That is, we still export 

the  best  pawpaw  despite  the  bad  quality  I  saw  in  1995.    We  still  export  the  best 

quality pawpaw in the world and ours are also some of the best mangoes in the world.   

</span></div><div><span>If  you  walk  into  a  supermarket  in  Auckland  today  you  will  find  Mexican  mangoes 

being sold from $2.50 each but they are not good quality.  They are not very sweet.  

People who </span><span>are used to eating good mangoes don’t buy these mangoes.  They may try 

one out but that’s it. There is also  Equador bananas.  If you walk into a supermarket 

</span><span>you see these beautiful very nice yellow ripe bananas which are very firm.  But if you 

eat  these  bananas  they  are  very  dry.    But  the  important  thing  here  is  that  the  papaa 

</span><span>women buy these bananas because they look beautiful.  It’s like the Mexican mangoes  

</span><span>I was talking about, they are beautiful . . . 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  You should never judge your banana  or mangoes by the skin. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  But if you eat them they are not good.  But the papaa women
