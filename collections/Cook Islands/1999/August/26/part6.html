<div><span>SITTING RESUMED 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please be seated.  I call on the Deputy Prime Minister to continue 

with your speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I would like at this time to speak to my 

constituency  in  Enuamanu.    I  would  like  to  extend  to  all  my  people  on  Enuamanu 

Greetings  from  myself  and  Papa  Poko.    To  my  Committee  in  Tengatangi-Areora-

Ngatiarua  and to  my Executive Committee Members, to  all my campaign  Managers 

and to everybody  on the island, Greetings to you all in the name of our Lord.  I would 

like to thank you all,  the people on Enuamanu. You are my heart and my spirit. You 

are the beginning and the  end of my existence.  So to my people of Enuamanu, I am 

very  much    elated  that  you  have  put  your  trust  in  me  for  the  fifth  time.    I  am  very 

proud  of  you.  Thank  you  for  putting  your  trust  in  me  to  represent  you  in  this 

Parliament.  To the Ui Mataiapo, Ui Rangatira, to the Youth organisations, Greetings. 

To everybody on the Island of Atiu, the public servants and all workers on the island 

of Atiu, greetings to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  my  greetings  at  this  time  to  all  Members  of  the  New  Alliance 

Party.  The  Patron,  President  and  Secretary  and  all  the  Executive  Members,  on 

</span><span>Enuamanu  No,  everywhere!    There  are  Patrons  in  Rarotonga,  in  Atiu  we  do  have 

</span><span>branches  on  each  island throughout  the  country  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.  That’s  alr</span><span>ight 

interpreter.  To our Coalition partner,  the Cook Islands Party,  to your President, the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>55 

</span></div><div><span>new General Secretary and to the supporters of our Coalition Partners, Kia Orana to 

you all.   

</span></div><div><span>In our Coalition agreement we are together in Government, in Opposition, in storms 

and in calm.  In all conditions.  We have entered into this agreement with dignity and 

honour.    And  as  declared  by  our  warrior  the  Honourable  Albert  Nicholas,    we  shall 

face future elections together as one entity.  May I also take this opportunity to greet 

our brothers and sisters in the Democratic Alliance Party. To the Democratic Alliance 

Party  Leader  and  the  Caucus  and  to  their  two  additional  Members,  Kia  Orana.  

Whether  they  are  Opposition  Coalition  or  two  Independent  Members  or  they  have 

joined  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  we  will  have  to  wait  until  they  make  their 

announcements.    The  most  important  thing  is  that  our  democratic  system  works  Mr 

Speaker.  We have come through a General Election and by golly, there are lessons to 

be  learnt  from  that.    The  important  thing  is  we  are  one  people.  The  Democratic 

Alliance  Party  is  doing  the  role  of  keeping  the  balance  of  power  and  with  our  tiny 

majority, well, not a majority now, and hoping to get it from Pukapuka, then we will 

have the majority. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me just make one comment about what I call the shivering and frightening aspects 

</span><span>of  the  last  election.    If  the  reform  process  was  followed  to  the  ridiculous  level  to 

maybe  13  members  of  Parliament,  this  country  would  have  been  entering  civil  war 

right now.  Mr Speaker, the lesson that we should learn from the recent Elections is 

that  the  smaller  the  number  in  Parliament  the  better  chance  there  is  for  a  group  of 

business people to buy a Government.  If the total members to be elected are 13 then 

the  </span><span>business  community  can  buy  themselves  7  MP’s  to  be  a  Government.    If  the 

</span><span>number  is  10  all  they  have  to  do  is  buy  themselves  six.    The  vigour,  the  anger,  the 

craziness  demonstrated  by  some  business  people  during  the  formation  of  our  recent 

Government  clearly  demonstrated  that  these  people  wanted  to  buy  and  own  the 

Government.    They  know  very  well  that  they  cannot  do  that  with  the  present 

Coalition.  I also end my comment in that direction.  I venture to say there is a better 

future for this country with 25 Members in Parliament.  I venture to say there is safety 

and security with 25 Members. You reduce the numbers a Government can easily be 

bought at Elections.  And Mr Speaker, I reiterate by saying there are more aspects to 

reform than just the sheer numbers of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, paying my direct attention to the Budget let me say I congratulate the Minister 

of Finance the Honourable Papamama Pokino and the Secretary of MFEM Mr Kevin 

Carr and his staff for preparing the  Budget before us now.  I would like to touch on to 

some of the general provisions of this Budget.   

</span></div><div><span>Let  me  say  at  the  outset  that,    in  distributing  the  Budget  allocation  for  Government 

Ministries one has to look at where funds are available.  In some cases because of the 

efficiency of some of the Ministries they do not need the same Budget this time.   A 

</span><span>clear example is in the Justice allocation.  In the total allocation in the last ’98 Budget, 

</span><span>the Justice Ministry was given $1.3 Million. 

</span></div><div><span>Now in the current Budget it is $900,000 approximately.  Because of their efficiency 

</span><span>they were able to reduce the cost of running the Justice Ministry where they made a 

saving of approximately $415,000 in the last Budget.  Because of their savings they 

are only needing at the present time just under $1 million.  The question is how many 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>56 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>other Ministries can reduce their expenses?  If there is time to go through it how many 

Ministries can reduce their expenditure and allow others to benefit from the savings? 

</span></div><div><span>Now  the  subject  of  the  Civil  List  allocation  has    drawn  heat  from  our  friends  in 

Opposition.  I will give you a breakdown of these figures.  There has altogether been 

an  increase  in  the  Civil  List  allocation  of  about  $500,000.    The  reason  for  this,  Mr 

Speaker, is that we have restored some of the payments that were slashed during the 

economic depression.  You will recall that for a number of  years in  the last term  of 

Parliament  we  were  not  able  to  send  Members  to  CPA  Meetings  because  of 

inadequate  funds  but  since  the  recovery  this  has  been  restored.    Therefore  there  are 

now funds allocated in  the Civil  List to  allow Members to  attend CPA Conferences 

without paying it out of their own pockets. As well, we have included the  travels of 

Ministers and other Parliamentarians overseas. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  also  restored  the  right  of  Members  from  the  Outer  Islands  based  in 

Rarotonga to travel to their constituencies four times a year. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Oh, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    The  amount  that  has  been  allocated  for  CPA  Conferences  </span><span>–</span><span>that’s  Members  from  both  the  Governme</span><span>nt  side  and  the  Opposition  side,  to  attend 

those Conferences - the allocation for that is $150,000.  Also within  this is the travel 

</span><span>of  the  QR  to  the  Northern  Group  $6,000.    Ministers’  Travel  to  the  Outer  Islands 

</span><span>$38,000.  This clearly indicates that we are having a furiously active Cabinet who will 

be travelling to the Outer Islands to attend to work.  There is also constituency visits.  

The Budget for the constituency visits in fact is $52,000 and the travel by the Outer 

Islands MPs to  Rarotonga for Parliament sitting is  $6,000.  The transfers of all new 

</span><span>and retiring MPs comes to $55,000.  Clothing Allowance is $130,000.  In fact that’s 

</span><span>actually  been  reduced  to  $30,000  because  Members  will  be  asked  just  to  withdraw 

$1,000  a  year  for  the  next  five  years.    Y</span><span>es,  there  were  some  Assistant  Minister’s 

</span><span>Support Funds of $60,000 allocated but this will not be in the form of a salary.  It will 

be  in  the  form  of  Support  Services  to  help  them  in  their  services  in  the  offices  that 

they will be allocated. 

</span></div><div><span>In this Budget, Mr Speaker, the Health Vote has been increased by $431,000, a 13 per 

cent increase.  The Education Vote has been increased by 16 per cent which is  

$480,523 and of course the Civil List 34 per cent increase of $538,000.  And I want to 

assure this House . . . 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Your time is up Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Okay, I shall continue in the Committee of Supply.  Thank you 

maata. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The  Honourable  Sir  Geoffrey 

Henry, Member for Tutakimoa/Takuvaine. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Speaker.   Greetings to  you  and congratulate to 

you for the honourable work that you are doing in this House. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>57 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings also to all Honourable Members who have gathered here in this Parliament 

to our people who are listening in to our debate this afternoon, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>A  special  greetings  to  all  new  Members  whom  the  people  have  elected  to  represent 

their  interests  in  this  House.    We  have  met  over  the  last  two  days  and  you  have 

expressed  your  views  regarding  your  dreams  and  the  hopes  of  your  people.    I 

congratulate you for your thoughts. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings also to the Tapere-Ariki of Takuvaine/Te-o-Tue/Tutakimoa who saw fit to 

honour me again by  re-electing me to  represent them in this House. The individuals 

who reside in our Tapere, to the traditional title holders, crown servants, the business 

community, to  all the people of my constituency,  I  greet  you all in  the name of our 

Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, to the Leader of the 

Opposition, to your Deputy Leader and all Honourable Members  </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to  you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>When  the  Prime  Minister  made  his  speech  regarding  the    boat  load  of  food  and 

</span><span>alcohol beverages that arrived in Pukapuka, it  reminded me of the comments made by 

the Honourable Tapi Taio.  He indicated in his speech to  Tiaki Wuatai that the boat 

was  on  its  way  and  by  the  30</span><span>th</span><span>  of  next  month,  Tiaki    will  assume  his  seat  in  this 

</span><span>House. Now, I am able to comprehend the full meaning of the member’s remarks. My 

</span><span>understanding is that the boat is loaded with food and alcohol to buy the votes of the 

people  of  Pukapuka.  So,  I  am  advising  the  people  of  Pukapuaka  to  drink  all  the 

alcohol which will be offered to  you;  eat all their food but vote for Papa Inatio. Let 

them know that bribing you with food and alcohol is unacceptable. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time  to  congratulate  the  Minister  of  Finance,  the  Secretary  of 

Finance and people from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management for the 

Budget  now  before  Parliament.    As  expressed  by  the  Minister,    in    achieving  our 

goals,  we experienced incredible challenges. A large number of our people suffered.  

Many wept and cried as a result of those  years of adversity. Many demonstrated  to 

express their frustrations. Many resorted to the news media.  

</span></div><div><span>The Minister’s Speech precisely recorded the backlash we received.  Out of all that, 

</span><span>however, as he stated, the last financial year concluded with two and a half a million-

dollar surplus. 

</span></div><div><span>If  we  look  at  the  history,  the  trend  of  our  finances,  we  have  never  achieved  any 

surplus in the past to that extent except in the last Financial Year. For 30 years since 

Appropriations were introduced into this House,  we have never recorded such surplus 

</span><span>as  is  now  evident  in  this  year’s  Budget.  This  is  due  in  the</span><span>  main  to  the  stringent 

measures imposed by the Minister of Finance, the Ministry of MFEM and the Heads 

of  Ministries  in  the  management,  use  and  generation  of  Government  revenue  in 

accordance to the legislation we have enacted. There is no doubt that there are sectors 

</span><span>of  our  society  who  went  without,  such  as  the  Hospitals,  the  referral  cases  to  New 

</span><span>Zealand, the teachers who never received any increase in their salary for quite a while, 

and  others.  We  all  tried  to  endure  the  difficulties.  The  people  of  Rarotonga  still 

encounter potholes in the back roads. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>58 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Nevertheless, through all our endurance, our united efforts, the excellent management 

of our finances, the Minister and his financial officers were able to return to us today a 

surplus. Today, if we  fully analyse the  total increase  in expenditure, we accumulated  

$10,800,000.    Due  to  the  better  management  of  the  finances  of  our  country  and  the 

improved generating machinery which we put in place,  the Government was able to 

accumulate $10,800,000 for our small country to expend.  The good thing about this 

whole  process  is  that  now  the  Minister  is  able  to  appropriate  $3,200,000  for 

infrastructure.  This is not Aid.  It is money generated from within our economy,  our 

country!    From    our  gains,    a  further  $4,200,000    will  be  allocated  to  the  various 

Ministries above their  gross expenditure of the last Financial Year. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  vote  item  for  Tourism  we  see  that  this  has  been  increased  by  $500,000  an 

increase of 25%  on the amount allocated to them in the 1998/99 financial year.  There 

has been an increase of 16% for the Ministry of Education and 13% for the Ministry 

of Health. Once we pass this Budget,  phase 2 of the Ministry of Education long term 

plan will be implemented, and that is to increase the pay for our teachers.  Phase 1 has 

already been carried out. The Ministry of Health has received an increase to allow for 

</span><span>the  training  of  our  young  girls  as  nurses.    Secondly  specialists    will  be  seconded  to 

</span><span>visit us. 

</span></div><div><span>A  very  important  development    in  our  country  is  the  Conservation  of  our 

Environment.    We  all  want  to  develop  our  country  Mr  Speaker.    But  such 

developments  must  be  in  harmony  with    our  traditions,  customs  and  our  natural 

environment.  This is reflected in our Budget.  An increase of nearly $500,000 to the 

Environment Services has been made in this appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>Let’s  look  at  our  Budget  Estimates.  Mr  Speaker,  we  have  two  Budget  Estimates;  a 

</span><span>very thin one and a pretty fat one.  In the thin one we see that it tells us who gets what 

amount of money.  In this rather fat one, we are told how that money is actually spent.  

If we look at page 22 of the thin one, we see the table on those Expenses.  At the top 

of this page we see that over $5,600,000 has been set aside for Welfare, for those in 

the early childhood, and those elderly   people in our society.  Together  with that are 

appropriations  for  our  destitutes  and  the  infirmed  beneficiaries.      So  what  we  are 

proposing then in this House is that they be given over $5,600,000 to assist them. If 

we look further down the page at Schedule 3 we see a Table for Borrowing Expenses 

and  Debt  Repayment  to  service  our  debts.    If  you  look  at  Gross  Debt  Servicing 

Schedule 8,  it should be Schedule 7.   If we look at page 23 we see $73,000 for our 

Archives.  This is also a very crucial element in the preservation of the history of our 

country. There will be 12 new computers to be purchased  for the school children.  If 

we  look  under  the  allocation  for  Health  we  find  $150,000  for  the  renovation  of  the  

hospital  complex.  This  is  the  Government  contribution  towards  the  million  dollars 

that the Japanese Government is offering to assist  renovate our hospital. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker  I  would like to  say to  our Members in  this House and to  our 

people that there are a lot of merits in this Budget.  It should be our duty to support  it 

</span><span>so that we will be able to realise the aspirations of our people. Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

If not, I will call on the Minister to reply.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>59 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I won’t take long with my reply.  There 

</span><span>has  been  a    general  acceptances  of  the  Budget.    Just  for  one  or  two  minor  hiccups, 

minor  areas  that  are  of  concern  to  some  Members.  Having  said  that  Mr  Speaker,  I 

would  like  to  offer  my  thanks  to  all those  who  have  contributed  towards  the  debate 

and  the  discussion  on  the  principles  and  merits  of  the  Appropriation  Bill.    In 

particular, I would like to give my congratulations to the new Members who delivered 

their maiden speeches. Those have been of very high quality.   

</span></div><div><span>Speaking of the Budget itself Mr Speaker, let me remind everybody in this House, and 

the people listening that this is an interim Budget only.  We should not lose sight of 

the  fact  that  a  By-Election  is  in  the  pipeline  and  the  result  of  that  By-Election  will 

determine who the future government is going to be.  Therefore, whoever becomes the 

Government  at  that point  in  time will probably need to  bring their own  Budget  into 

this House again.  We are required to bring this Budget in to comply with the MFEM 

Act. The Act required a Budget to be passed  by the end of September.   

</span></div><div><span>Our Law only allows the expenditure of up to three-twelve of the previous financial 

</span><span>year’s budget.    If a Budget  is  not  passed by the</span><span>  end of September there  will  be no 

</span><span>supplies for the Government to use.  Any expenditure after that time will be illegal. 

</span></div><div><span>The  preparation    of  this  Budget  has  not  been  so  difficult  because  a  number  of 

legislation have been passed to simplify the Budget process.  All we needed to do was 

to  just follow what  the Law says and the rest  will  just  fall into  line.  You know Mr 

Speaker, last  week  I was asked by one officer from the Asian Development Bank if 

our Budget is  going to end up as  a deficit Budget.  The reason for his question was 

because he was worried about our debt repaying capacity.  I told him that due to the 

legislation  enacted  in  the  last  couple  of  years,  it  would  be  difficult  for  any 

Government to introduce a deficit Budget.  I tell you Mr Speaker, those ADB Officers 

left me fully elated. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, Mr Speaker, we all know the distribution of our funds depends on the cash 

available.  Although our appropriation is saying that we have so many  million dollars 

allocated to us, at the end of the day, our expenditure depends on how much money 

we  have  in  our  hands.  That  will  determine  how  much  money  we  will  spend  at  any 

point in time.  That is why it has been easy to manage our appropriation in the past 

few  years  because  it  really  depends  on  what  we  have  on  hand.    That  is  really,  Mr 

Speaker, the beauty of  relying on our own resources.  As Sir Geoffrey has just said 

before  I  got  up,  our  Budget  is  based  on  the  money  we  ourselves  generated.    Any 

money  from  the  various  Agencies  are  used  for  project  development  and  economic 

development  and none of the Aid funds is  used to supplement our National  Budget.  

So, as far as I am concerned, as Minister of Finance,  whether we get Aid money or 

not it does not necessarily concern me  that much.  If they offer it I will take it but I 

</span><span>won’t go and look for it.  Because I know we  can rely on our own resources and live 

</span><span>within our own means if we are very careful how we spend our resources.   

</span></div><div><span>I think Mr Speaker,  I will stop there.  Once again I give my thanks to all those who 

</span><span>contributed towards the discussions on the principles and merits of the Budget.  I am 

sure there  will be plenty of discussions later on and  I hope it is  discussions and not 

arguments we will entertain once we go through the Clauses in the Committee stage.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>60 

</span></div><div><span>Once again I move: 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>That the Appropriation Bill be Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I will now put the question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the 1999/2000 Appropriation Bill now be Read a Second time?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE: </span><span>A Bill intituled: An Act of the Parliament of the Cook 

Islands  to  appropriate  certain  sums  of  money  out  of  the  Cook  Islands  Government
