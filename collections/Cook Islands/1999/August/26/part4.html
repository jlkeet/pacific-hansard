</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Shut up. You shut up! 

</span></div><div><span>(INAUDIBLE </span><span>–</span><span> Members speaking ) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Order, Order. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>And remember it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool 

</span><span>than to speak out and remove all doubts. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  for  Manihiki,  will  you  please 

</span><span>observe the Standing Orders.  When I speak there is to be silence in this House.  I’m 

</span><span>not denying you your chance to speak your mind but we observe the Standing Orders, 

thank you very much.   

</span></div><div><span>I call for the next speaker.  There appears to be none.  The Prime Minister.  You have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  J.  WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  Kia  Orana  to  you  this 

afternoon.    To  the  Clerk  of  Parliament  and  your  staff  members,  Kia  Orana.    To  the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry,  Kia  Orana.    The  Members  of  the 

Coalition Cabinet and the Members of the Coalition Caucus, God bless you.  To the 

Leader of the Opposition, Kia Orana to you and thank you for your  contributions  to 

the Budget.  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Kia Orana also to you and thank 

you also for your contribution to this Budget.  Members of the Opposition, Kia Orana 

also to you and God bless you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I want to congratulate the young guns.  First, the young guns on the Government side, 

the  Member  for  Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara,  I  congratulate  you  on  your  maiden 

speech.  Your  called  for  your  people  to  take  off  that  political  cloak  and  put  on  their 

working  coats,  meaning  they  should  forget  their  politics  and  begin  to  work  for  the 

benefit of your people. That  is a very admirable thing to do, thank you for saying it.  

To the young guns on the Opposition bench, some of you are not too young, some of 

you  are  still  young,  congratulations  for  your  maiden  speeches.    The  Member  for 

Matavera my very good friend the Honourable Vaevae Pare, what I want to say to you 

</span><span>is if you enjoyed the 3 day political lessons there’s a small path across there, right in 

</span><span>front  of  you.  I  have  counted  the  paces.  There  are  10  paces  between  you  and  the 

Government bench.  You can even walk across to this empty chair here right now and 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>50 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>then we will give you a 5-</span><span>year lesson in politics.  Don’t go to Pukapuka because your 

future is not there but it’s over here.</span></div><div><span>To  the  Honourable  Member  for  Mauke,  I’m  worried  about  you.  You  see,  you  are 

</span><span>si</span><span>tting right next to the old guns.  Sitting next to the Member for Rakahanga, he’s the 

worst of the old guns.  I’m worried that he’s going to contaminate you.  I’m worried 

</span><span>about  you and I think you should move away from there, move right away from the 

old g</span><span>uns.  Don’t copy their habits, we will put another chair right there or right here.  

</span><span>Come  and  join  us.    The  other  two  members  of  the  young  guns,  I  commend  you  on 

your maiden speeches and to all of you may I join the Speaker in welcoming you to 

this Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  with  your  leave  I  want  to  say  Kia  Orana  to  all  the  people  that  are 

listening to this debate today and to say to them that we must work together for the 

benefit of  each and  every  person living  in  the Cook  Islands.   I know that  Pukapuka 

will  not  be  able  to  hear  our  broadcast  today,  but  nevertheless  I  want  to  extend  my 

greetings to the 2 Members that are standing, Papa Inatio Akaruru and Tiaki Wuatai.  

</span><span>It’s a pity that Pukapuka is being destroyed at this very time by the effects of another 

</span><span>political  storm.    I  received  a  report  from  Pukapuka  this  morning  that  a  boat  load  of 

</span><span>food and liquor has been taken to Pukapuka for the express purpose of campaigning.  

I have had a call from Nassau and the people of Nassau are asking that no politics be 

taken to their island.  They have peace now and they want to maintain their peace and 

they wanted me to tell this House. Leader on the Opposition, please desist politics in 

Nassau.  They are asking not to bring food and booze to damage and cause havoc on 

the island of Nassau. Please take heed of their  request. 

</span></div><div><span>To the people of the Overseas Constituency that are here in our ipukarea.  I want to 

say a very special greetings to you,  Kia Orana.  To the 2 Members sitting on the other 

side not on the Opposition bench but on the other side of the House,  Tangata Vavia, 

Kia  Orana.  And  to  the  Honourable  Member  Tom  Marsters  who  is  not  here  today,  I 

also want to send  Greetings to him.  I listened very carefully yesterday for people to 

greet  and  acknowledge  your  presence  in  this  House.    Not  one  member  of  the 

</span><span>Opposition  acknowledged    your  presence.  I  was  sad,  I  was  sad  that  you  weren’t 

</span><span>smelled but I say Kia Orana to both of you.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, now coming back to  the Budget.   This  Appropriation Bill  comes as no 

surprise at all and I must commend the efforts of all those responsible including the 

Coalition Caucus Members and  Officials in maintaining the principles of the Reform 

Process    and  to  ensure  that  this  Budget  comes  before  this  House.    I  want  to 

congratulate the Minister of Finance and his team and all the Heads of Ministries and 

staff for the efforts that they have made in holding the spendings of the last financial 

year within the projected frameworks to create the surplus this year.   

</span></div><div><span>It then would allow us to redistribute this surplus to areas of priority including Health 

and Education.  I acknowledge the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 

that the surplus was the  result of the work of the people last  year  and the efforts of 

</span><span>these people must be commended. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there will be no deviation  from  the reform  process.   What  is important 

</span><span>now is to enhance the Coalition Government’s focus on the principles of the reform 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>51 

</span></div><div><span>through  strengthening  economic  growth,  social  equity,  good  governance  and  the 

infrastructure  developments.  By  consolidating  these  efforts  we  will  ensure  that  real 

benefits be given to the consumers.  These will then allow us to put that surplus gains 

back into the community and back into the pockets of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  the political uncertainties during the past few months does not mean that things 

will  change  overnight.    What  is  required  is  good  financial  management  and  this  is 

what this Budget is all about.  It also require sound policies that will strengthen this 

</span><span>Government’s abili</span><span>ty to deliver  its promises. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  economic  growth  has  now  become  the  Coalition  Government’s  top 

</span><span>priority.    In  1993  our  GDP  growth  was  round  about  3.8  per  cent.    It  now  shows  a 

</span><span>positive indicator of 4.4 per cent.  That’s for this financial period an</span><span>d projections are 

that this figure will increase to about 4.7 per cent.  That is, 4.4 per cent, 4.7 per cent 

within  the  next  six  months,  thus  highlighting  confidence  by  the  private  sector  and 

international markets in our economy.  Clearly, Mr Speaker, there is a need for a co-

operative approach to ensure that the economic benefits gained thus far will continue.  

We will be encouraging further economic growth by broadening diplomatic relations 

</span><span>with  other  countries,  countries  who  are  willing  to  assist  us  with  trade,  tourism,  and 

</span><span>other economic activities that will benefit the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>At  this  stage  I  want  to  refer  to  comments  made  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition 

yesterday regarding the embassies.  As I said we need to broaden our approach.  We 

also need to look ahead, not just one year, two years, three years, five years, but ten 

and twenty years down the road. 

</span></div><div><span>Establishment of the embassies will not come overnight.  We have to plan.  We have 

to have a look closely at what has been established by the former Prime Minister and 

the  former  Cabinet  in  relation  to  the  international  perspective.    The  foundation  has 

been laid but we must make use of that foundation and establish relationships with the 

UN,  with  the  European  Economic  Community  and  with  Asia  which  is  the  fastest 

growing economy in the world. 

</span></div><div><span>China  has  been  recommended  by  Asian  countries  to  form  part  of  the  international 

nations targeted by the Cook Islands  where we must establish embassies.  Thanks to 

the  work  of  the  former  Prime  Minister,  we  do  have  that  diplomatic  relation  with 

China.  To kill this at this stage is the very wrong thing to do.  What we are doing is 

plan for the future.  We are not saying that we are going to establish embassies using 

the funds from this Budget.  The Member for Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara has rightly 

pointed out that there is no provision for these embassies in this Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>So the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader, Members of the Opposition, we ask 

for your co-operation in this.  We are not doing this for the benefit of the Government.  

It is for the benefit of your children, your grandchildren, your great grandchildren and 

your great great grandchildren. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Stop dreaming.  Stop dreaming. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>52 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>   Mr Speaker, the  Leader of the  Opp</span><span>osition  said,   “Stop 

dreaming.  You’re dreaming”.  Let me quote to you an economic saying.  “When you 

set a goal you are looking at a dream and the goal is a dream with a deadline”.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  We should all remember that Mr Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>      Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The  Honourable  Member  for 

Ruatonga/Avatiu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Greetings  to  you  all  in  the  love  of  God  this  afternoon.  

Greetings  to  you  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  Clerk  and  to  all  staff  members  of  Parliament, 

greetings to you all.  Greetings to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader.  To 

all    the  Honourable  Members  and  to  the  new  Members  who  have  been  here  since 

yesterday,  Kia  Orana.    Greetings  to  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Honourable  Dr  Joe 

Williams and also to the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, the Honourable Norman 

George, Sir Geoffrey Henry, Cabinet Ministers and the Honourable Members on the 

</span><span>Government side. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise, Mr Speaker, knowing that this is my maiden speech in Parliament.  First of all, I 

would  like  to  extend  my  Greetings  to  my  own  constituency  who  placed  me  in  this 

House.  Greetings  to  you  the  people  in  my  electorate  in  Avatiu/Ruatonga/Atupa  and 

Palmerston  Island.    Greetings  to  the  Ui  Mataiapo  and  to  the  title  holders,  to  the  Pu 

Tapere and to all the people from Avatiu to Atupa. 

</span></div><div><span>To my Executive members, to my own family, to all those people who are staying in 

my  constituency  </span><span>–</span><span>  Greetings  to  you  all.  You  decided  that  I  should  be  your 

representative in this House for the next five years, I Thank You very much.  I will do 

the  job  you  have  designated  to  me  with  integrity.  I  will  do  this  to  the  best  of  my 

abilities and with honesty.  To all the people of our country.  To all the members in 

this House,  I believe that we will all do our job  wisely for the sake of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>As I  speak, I stand here as a New Alliance Party Member.  So I would like to make it 

quite  clear  to  the  people  the  relationship  between  the  NAP  and  the  CIP.    I  heard  

yesterday that this relationship will not last  long.  I would like to assure everybody in 

this country that the relationship between the NAP and the CIP will last for more than 

five years or even to the extent of  up to ten years. 

</span></div><div><span>(Much laughter) 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Member  from  Aitutaki,  the  Honourable  Teina  Bishop  said  that  we 

have signed our agreements.  As part of that agreement, we the NAP and the CIP will 

only have one candidate in each constituency.  So this is the strength in the relation of 

the NAP and the CIP today.   

</span></div><div><span> Secondly, I have been appointed in this Coalition Government as Government Whip.  

</span><span>And the first thing that I will do on the Government side is to create a fence.  I will 

make sure that this fence will not allow anybody to jump onto the other side.  But the 

fence will  allow people from the Opposition to come onto this side.  I want to assure 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>53 

</span></div><div><span>the people out there that the Coalition Government  is working well for the benefit of 

our people.   

</span></div><div><span>I  will  now  come  to  the  Budget,  I  support  the  views  expressed  by  the  Minister  of 

Finance  yesterday.    When  I  referred  to  the  Budget  of    1998-99  in  comparison    to 

1999-2000 I found some increases in this Budget.  I take pride in this because  I am 

one of those who are involved in  the submission of this Budget  to  this House.  The 

CIP and NAP are instrumental in making sure this happened.  I have not much to say 

but  to  support  the  continuation  of  the  Reform.    We  will  continue  to  pursue  the 

objectives of the reform up to the end of this Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, in  regards to  the By-Election,  I hear  yesterday that the CIP and DAP is  not 

allowed to go to Pukapuka.  It seems to me that  the  only  party allowed on Nassau is 

the  NAP.  I  am  asking  the  former  Deputy  Prime  Minister  to  fly  over  and    campaign 

there because he will be the only one who will be accepted to go to Nassau.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member for Avatiu/Ruatonga.  I call for the 

</span><span>next speaker and I recognise the Member for Ruaau for her maiden speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  M.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  to  you  Mr  Speaker.    Congratulations  to  your 

appointment  as  the    Speaker  of  this  House.    To  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime 

Minister, former Prime Minister, Honourable Sir Geoffrey Henry,  to all the  Cabinet 

Ministers, Kia Orana to you and the Honourable Members of Government, Kia Orana  

to  you.    Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Deputy  Leader,  all  Honourable  Members  of  the 

Opposition, Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to correct the Prime Minister earlier in saying that my colleagues  in the 

Opposition  did  not  welcome  the  Honourable  Member  from  Murienua  and  the  

</span><span>Honourable Member from Nukuroa. I’m sure it was not intentional that they were not  

</span><span>greeted  yesterday,  because  we  are  all  on  the  Opposition  side.  We  are  on  the 

</span><span>Opposition side and  I‘m sure it was not intentional.  </span></div><div><span>To the Clerk of Parliament, your staff in this House, Kia Orana.  To all those listening 

</span><span>on the radio today, Kia Orana to you.  Mr Speaker, I’d like to extend my greetings to 

</span><span>my  constituency.    Kia  Orana  to  Tinomana  Ruta  and  your  husband    in  Puaikura,  Ui 

Mataiapo, Ui Rangatira.  To all the  different religious denominations in Puaikura and  

the various organisations within you, Greetings.  Kia Orana also to the Mayor and to 

your Council Members.  To everybody in Puaikura, Kia Orana 

</span></div><div><span>To my constituency Ruaau.  Special greetings to my Ruaau Democratic Alliance Party 

supporters.  The Executives and the Committee Members, to everybody in Ruaau, Kia 

Orana.  Without your hard work during this election I would not be representing you 

here  in  this  House.    To  the  former  MP  of  Ruaau,  Mr  Boy  Tepai  and  your  wife  and 

family,    Kia  Orana.    To  the  two  opponents  who  contested  in  the  Election  with  me,  

Kia  Orana.    To  all  my  European  voters  and  supporters,    Kia  Orana.    To  all  the 

</span><span>business  people,  the  workers,  the  Government  workers  and  to  everybody  in  Ruaau, 

</span><span>greetings.  Like I said before,  I’m going to represent  Ruaau in this election and  I am 

going to stand by that and represent everybody, I mean everybody.  So don’t hesitate 

</span><span>to approach me if you have any difficulties.  I will be representing you here.   So to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>54 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>everybody, thank you, thank you very much for your support and I will try and do my 

best  to  bring  your  voice  into  this  Chamber,  regardless  if  this  is  my    first  term  in 

Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of the Budget, I thank the Honourable Minister of Finance for presenting this 

</span><span>Budget to us today.  Like he said,  we have a $2.5 million surplus.  I hope we haven’t 

</span><span>spent it yet.  Be cautious  Honourable Members.  Be cautious in  what we are going to 

do with the Budget.  I hope we have got the  figures and the money there. I end here 

but within the next couple of days I will talk on the Budget again, but thank you very 

much Honourable Members.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  like  your  speech  where  you 

</span><span>said, “I will represent everybody in my constituency”.   I call for the next speaker, the 

</span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly I would like to compliment the 

two  previous  speakers.  One  lady  and  one  gentleman  that  spoke.    Congratulations  to  

them for the maiden speeches and keeping up the trend.  You are already making the 

</span><span>impact.  I really want to seek leave to make a small address to my constituency, but I 

</span><span>don’t like starting something and having to stop suddenly for the break.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  The time is up.  I 

suspend this sitting until 3.00 p.m. and you can continue with your speech then.
