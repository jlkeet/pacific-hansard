<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Appropriation  Bill.    Interrupted  Debate  on  the  question  that  the  Bill  be  now  read  a 

second time.  The last Member speaking was the Honourable Member for Manihiki.  

You have about 15 minutes to go. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Yesterday before you interrupted me I 

was giving my Aroa to the nation so I want to continue that today. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to extend my Aroa to our new colleagues on the Opposition side, that is 

the Honourable Tangata Vavia and the Honourable Tom Marsters.  Even though you 

</span><span>don’t have any degrees, we  will accept you onto the Opposition side.</span></div><div><span>Yesterday, Mr Speaker, we were talking about the Budget of this nation.  Today we 

have  the  honey  pot  of  the  country  in  our  hands  and  we  are  sharing  out  food  to  the 

different Government Ministries so that we can achieve the social equity we so much 

desire.  

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  go on Mr Speaker,  I  would like to  thank the former Prime Minister of this 

country for achieving a 2.5 million surplus in his last Budget.  Thank you also to the 

Minister of Finance for his eloquent delivery of the  financial situation of the country.   

</span><span>I  just  don’t  want  our  people  to  misunderstand  that  this  is  a  surplus  of  this  present 

</span><span>Coalition Government, </span><span>its not, it’s a surplus from the CIP Government previously in 

</span><span>control of the country.  While this Budget says, we have a crown revenue of just over 

</span><span>$48 million likewise our expenditure has increase by $6 million to that figure over last 

</span><span>year’s one.  I wou</span><span>ld ask the Minister of Finance whether this is an actual increase in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>48 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>revenue  or  is  it  borrowed  money?    Because  if    this  is  not  borrowed  money  in  this 

Budget, then it is a real increase.    

</span></div><div><span>If  we  look  at  the  honey  pot  of  the  country,  $48  million,  beautiful  honey  pot.    But 

inside this honey pot Mr Speaker are flies.  Because in it is the biggest fly - the Civil 

</span><span>List.   I’m  afraid  my  friend the Honourable Member from Nikaupara didn’t see this.  

One whole million increase over the last year’s expenditure to mai</span><span>ntain our political 

status.  For the benefit of our people, I will explain what this $1 million increase is.  

</span><span>Just over a half a million increase in the Civil List from last year’s expense.  </span></div><div><span>If  you  look  at  the  Ministerial  Support,  we  have  just  under  $400,000  and  the  MP 

Superannuation by $195,000, a total of $1.06 million.  If you calculate this increase it 

will work out to be about 30% of the increase in our  expenditure this year.  The Civil 

List should be less because there is now not 9 Ministers but 6 Ministers.  So the Civil 

List should be less not more.  What is this half million increase in the Civil List? Is it 

</span><span>to increase our MP’s pay or is it to pay for Assistant Ministers that are in the pipe line.  

</span><span>Of  course  the  new  Members  of  Parliament  would  know  the  difference  in  their  pay.  

</span><span>But  I  will  tell  you  Mr  Speaker  there  is  no  increase  in  the  MP’s  pay,  so  why  do  we 

</span><span>need this half million increase?  Why is it necessary to give half a million increase?  

</span><span>For the last 5  years the Ministerial Support had been $70,000 per  year per Minister. 

Now, suddenly we have a $400,000 -  close to $400,000 increase in their support, a 

total of $739,000 to support our Ministers. 

</span></div><div><span>I don’t mind if there is an increase and likewise an equivalence in  the output of the 

</span><span>Ministers.    But  I  will  tell  you  Mr  Speaker,    there  has  not  been  any  increase  in  the 

Outputs of the Ministers this year. If I may use or quote the infamous Pauline Hudson, 

</span><span>MP of Australia, quote, “</span><span>Please explain</span><span>”.  I know the Minister of Finance said that we 

</span><span>all suffered from the Reform. I take my hat off to that, because that is true.  The pain 

our people went through in accepting the Reform was so extreme. We often say in this 

House  that  we  should  have  a  private  sector  driven    economy  but  you  look  at  how 

much  we  are  giving  the  economic  generators  of  this  country.  Less  than  $700,000 

increase was ear marked for Agriculture, Tourism and Marine Resources.  I ask where 

is the economic drive in our reforms, $600,00 is that it?  Yesterday, the Honourable 

Wigmore referred to the Agriculture of this country as the sick man of the economy.  I 

</span><span>think, he’s being polite. I would go further and say the Agriculture of this country is 

</span><span>dead.    Because  the  Agriculture  was  increased  from  $600,00  last  year  to  $700,000.  

Simple arithmetic tells me that it is only  $100,000 we have increased  for the vote in 

Agriculture.    Look  at  Marine  Resources,  the  second  highest  revenue  earner  of  this 

country to Tourism. It received a measly $35,000 increase.  The Minister of Finance, 

has given Tourism a half million increase.   

</span></div><div><span>In this morning’s  Cook Islands News, it quoted the Prime Minister of the country Dr 

</span><span>Williams saying that we are not deviating from the Reforms.  We are speaking  about 

the economic growth and the social equity of this country.  I dare say Mr Speaker, that 

this Coalition Government is feathering its nest by giving itself $1 million increase.  I 

ask where is the social equity?  We have people dying in this country, dying to be sent 

</span><span>to a better facility overseas to treat their canc</span><span>ers.  Senior citizens of this country can’t 

</span><span>even  afford  their  medicine.    Our  children  are  forced  to  pay  their  school  fares.    The 

majority  of  our  parents  are  forced  to  go  and  play  housie  to  supplement  their  low 

</span><span>incomes.  So don’t hide the $500 increase in t</span><span>he Civil List behind our backs.  Come 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>49 

</span></div><div><span>on,  be transparent.  $500,000 sorry Mr Speaker.  It seems to me that the essence of 

</span><span>the  reform  to  reduce  the  political  cost  of  this  country,  hasn’t  been  achieved.    If 

</span><span>anything,  we  have  insulted  our  people  by  increasing  it  to  a  million.    Therefore  I 

cannot  and  will  not  support  this  Budget.    I  will  encourage  the  Members  of  the 

Opposition not to support this Bill.  They will need to explain Mr Speaker, why the 

increase in the $500,000. Are we paying phantom workers from the Civil List?  I ask 

my friend Teina Bishop, if you want to see the reform have a good look again in this 

Budget and decide what your heart tells you. Join those people who are committed to 

reforms and transparency to this country.
