<div><span>PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER took the Chair at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>  Please  be  seated  Honourable  Members.  I  trust  the  Message  from 

the Pastor will enlighten us in our deliberations today.  I would like to welcome you 

all  Honourable  Members  into  our  Parliament  this  afternoon.    May  I  call  upon  the 

Deputy Prime Minister who is the Leader of the House to move his  motion. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    This  is  a  housekeeping  Motion  to 

cover the hours of sitting of this House from this point onwards.  But before I do so 

may  I  extend  my  greetings  to  you  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  Clerk  and  staff  of  this 

Parliament.  Kia Orana to the Prime Minister Dr. Joe Williams, Sir Geoffrey Henry, 

Members of Cabinet, Members of the Coalition Government and also a Kia Orana to 

the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  his  Deputy  and  Caucus  Members.    To  our  people 

</span><span>listening in this afternoon, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House observes the following sitting days and hours</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Excuse me Honourable  Deputy  Prime Minister, would  you move 

the  Postponement of the Orders of the Day first. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Orders of the Day be postponed until after the Disposal of  

Motion No.1 on the Order Paper. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    I  am  sorry  about 

that interruption.  I call for a Seconder?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Mii Parima Member for Tamarua. 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  Speakers  to  the  Motion?    There  appears  to  be  none.    I  shall  put  the 

question.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Orders of the Day be postponed until after the disposal of Motion 

 No.1 on the Order Paper? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>45 

</span></div><div><span>And now the motion for the sitting hours please, Deputy Prime Minister.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House observes the following sitting days and times 

For Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays the sitting 

hours will now be from 1.00pm to 5.00 p.m. with a break from 

2.30pm to 3.00pm. And on Fridays from 10.00a.m. to 2.00pm 

with a break from 11.30am to 12.00 Noon.</span></div><div><span>Just by way of a brief explanation Mr Speaker, this means we are resorting back to the 

requirements  of  the  Standing  Orders  that  we  have  for  the  sitting  of  Parliament.  

During the last term of Parliament the sittings were reduced to three hours and there 

was  no  time  allocated  for  a  meal  break.    The  sittings  were  reduced  to  three  hours.  

Now that the economy has picked up we are now able to increase the sitting time back 

to where we were before.   I also  want  to acknowledge the role played by the Elijah 

Communications  which  is  the  owner  of  the  Radio  Station.    They  have  agreed  to 

</span><span>charge us for only half of our radio time and they have given us the other half  in the 

</span><span>name of freedom of speech.   

</span></div><div><span>Aside  from  that,  I  hope  the  Members  have  noticed  the  great  improvements  in  the 

kitchen  facilities  during  the  breaks.    These  are  the  changes  brought  about  by  the 

Coalition  Government  to  improve  the  standards  in  this  House.    I  also  would  like  to 

acknowledge  the  role  played  by  the  Member  for  Nikao-Panama,  Ngamau  Munokoa 

who  has  been  subsidising  food  for  the  livelihood  of  the  Members.    Aunty  Mau  has 

been  helping  sustain  the  Members  of  this  House  by  donating  surplus  food  from  her 

shop.    So  with  these  housekeeping  matters  in  place  we  can  look  forward  to 

outstanding  debates  in  this  House  based  entirely  on  the  principles  and  merits  and 

whatever result is needed to make the debate in this House of a high quality. 

</span></div><div><span>And  of  course,  Mr  Speaker,  with  your  sparkling  and  gracious  presence,  we  could 

expect  the  work  of  this  House,  the  standard  of  this  House  to  improve  considerably.  

And I also want to advise you that I have consulted with the Leader of the Opposition 

about  these  changes  and  I  am  quite  sure  that  they  will  also  be  giving  unanimous 

support to us to approve it. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    I  call  for  a  Seconder  to  the 

Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Ruatonga/Avatiu 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Greetings to you Mr Speaker on this beautiful day.  To all 

</span><span>your staff members in Parliament, to all Honourable Members in the House and to our 

people who are listening in to our debate, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>46 

</span></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to extend special greetings to the family who have suffered 

and lost their properties in a fire at their home in Titikaveka.  This was mentioned by 

the Honourable Member for Titikaveka, Robert Wigmore.  Therefore, I would like to 

extend to the family who is now homeless, a word of comfort. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  also  to  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the  Cabinet 

Ministers, to all Honourable Members on the Government side and also on our side, 

the Opposition.  Greetings to you all Honourable Members.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my mike has not been working properly since yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Sorry about that Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  I would like to ask you and your staff not to treat us this 

</span><span>way. Aunty Mau’s mike will do for now.</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time, Mr Speaker, to extend a very special greeting to our friends, 

the  Honourable  Tom  Marsters  and  Tangata  Vavia,  whom  we  overlooked,  as  we 

</span><span>extended  our  speeches  yesterday.  I  would  like  to  extend  a  very  special  greetings  to 

</span><span>both of them, on the Opposition side. They made the move to be on this side, to form 

a Coalition Government.  Unfortunately, the two parties in Government  merged and 

now we have them as the Coalition Government. Unfortunately the third Member who 

was to be with us defected and returned to his party and is now the Prime Minister. I 

give my special greetings to them. I am sorry to say this Mr. Speaker, that  we have 

ignored  them  yesterday  in  our  Greetings.    Although  that  was  not  deliberate.  But  I 

would like to  make this clear that with the </span><span>two of them and Tiaki Wuatai we’ll form 

</span><span>the Government one day. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  also  to  say  that  if  there  is  any  Member  on  the  Government  side  who 

thinks that the  terms of your contracts are not being fulfilled, the door is wide open 

for  you  on  this  side  of  the  House.    I  appreciated  the  Honourable  Member,  Teina 

Bishop  in  his  speech  yesterday  when  he  asserted  the  continuation  of    the  reform 

programme, and when he said he had news for those opposing the reform.  So I am 

sure those business colleagues of yours outside  Parliament listening to you, will take 

their hats off to you. 

</span></div><div><span>There is  no difficulty  from  the Opposition  side about  the changes, which have been 

brought about by the Leader of the House. We have again, Mr. Speaker, the extension 

of four hours. We have a half an hour gain in this.   We  are also having a half an hour 

break.  In the past the programme would proceed for three hours non-stop. The meal 

provided  for  us  yesterday,  I  felt  was  sufficient,  ample.  It  should  not  be  increased  

otherwise our people would say that we are only looking after ourselves.   

</span></div><div><span>In terms of  the views expressed by the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister regarding 

the rise of the  economy,  I would  caution him not  to  be too  sure of that  because the 

Budget is not  yet adopted. I </span><span>don’t believe the economy has recovered, and therefore 

</span><span>let  us  not  waste  our  finance.  The  Leader  of  the  House  indicated  that  there  are  a 

</span><span>number of areas  in this institute which have been improved.  I would like to see some 

improvements  to  some  areas  whereas  some  can  be  deferred  until  there  is  enough 

money then we can rectify the rest. On the Opposition side, there is no fan here and at 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>47 

</span></div><div><span>times we feel the heat of the day. The need for changes is there, but we don’t want to 

</span><span>rush into that.  We will have to take careful steps as we make these changes.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  support  the  views  expressed  by  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

House, for the Honourable Member, Aunty Mau, with the food that she has provided 

to sustain us.  I would like to raise the point t</span><span>hat although she doesn’t have a degree, 

</span><span>or  a  tertiary  qualification,  she  is  able  to  utilise  her  capabilities  far  more  efficiently 

than a lot of Members in this House who have high education. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I give my support to this motion. We have no difficulty. We support the 

Motion before us for the change in our sitting times. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the House.  Are there any further speakers?  

There appears to be none.  I will now put the question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to ? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
