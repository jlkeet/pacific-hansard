</span><span>back  Honourable  Members  to  work  cut  for  today.    I  believe  that  the  message  that 

Elder  Cummings  has  brought  to  us  this  morning  will  help  us  as  we  carry  out  our 

duties.  I would like to remind the Executive Committee, newly elected yesterday, that 

</span><span>we have an Executive meeting at 2 o’clock this afternoon.  Thank you very much.</span></div>
