<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>On the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $608,576 for Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The last speaker was the Minister of Finance.  Does the Minister wish to continue? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO: </span><span> For a few minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  You  are  on  your  second  speech.    How  many  more  minutes  Mr 

Clerk?  Oh, third speech, I am sorry.  You have 10 more minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  I want to start from the beginning, Mr Speaker </span><span>–</span><span> Mr Chairman! 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Carry on Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:  </span><span>Greetings  to  you  Mr  Chairman.  To  the  Clerk  and  all  staff 

members  of  Parliament  and  the  Honourable  Members  in  this  Honourable  House.  

</span><span>Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, regarding the Agriculture Vote.  As I said yesterday, although there is a 

great wish and desire to strengthen the role of the Ministry of Agriculture, I think it is 

only  fair  we  let  the  new  Minister  of  Agriculture  restructure  his  Ministry  and  tell  us 

what  he  needs.  If  there  is  a  need  for  extra  funding  then  we  can  put  it  into  our 

Supplementary Budget. At the same time, Mr Chairman, I would like to express my 

personal views  as  I see the role of the Agriculture Department.  While exposing the 

need to strengthen and support this Department, I think its role to be confined mainly 

</span><span>to research, advising the growers and perhaps establishing and monitoring standards, 

</span><span>with  regard to  Agriculture matters.  Let  me emphasise this Mr Chairman, that this is 

my personal view.  Yesterday I was explaining the need that if we want to gain and 

maintain  overseas  markets  we  need  to  set  very  high  standards  for  our  produce  and 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>69 

</span></div><div><span>ensure  that  we  can  supply  the  market  when  they  want  our  produce.    With  regard  to 

quality, I think that should be left to the growers themselves.  I remember a few years 

ago, Mr Chairman, when we were dealing through Turners &amp; Growers as our market 

outlet for our produce. The growers were required to have a number as they sent their 

produce on an individual basis and our each grower was responsible for the quality of 

his  produce.  Because,  Mr Chairman,  your reward was based on the quality of  your 

produce  and  you  were  paid  accordingly.    People  did  not  know  who  were  sending 

inferior quality produce and who were sending the best quality and those who sent the 

best quality obviously got the best reward.    

</span></div><div><span>And  after  a  while  the  auctioneers  used  to  know  who  were  the  culprits  who  sold 

inferior quality produce. They used to make it known amongst the growers that so and 

so were sending beans with fruit flies in them or pawpaws with holes in them.  But 

</span><span>after  the  demise  of  Turners  &amp;  Growers,  I  don’t  know  which  is  which.  Then  the 

</span><span>growers  used  to  send  their  produce  overseas  en  masse.    That  means  everybody 

received the same rewards whatever the pay became.  So if there were some inferior 

qualities  nobody  would  know  who  the  culprits  were  and  if  the  reward  is  low,  well 

everybody received a low grading regardless of the quality of your export. 

</span></div><div><span>I think the only way for the growers to be able to get back to the old standard is for 

them to have their own market and send their produce overseas through a system of 

collective  export.  But  with  a  global  mark  to  say  so  and  so  sent  this  quality  product 

overseas and so and so sent this inferior product. 

</span></div><div><span>Since  I  have  got  a  couple  of  minutes  left,  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  say  a  few 

words  about  </span><span>nono</span><span>  because  we  have  established  a  big  planting  scheme  of  </span><span>nono</span><span>  in 

Mangaia.  The last time I was there they have propagated over 200,000 shoots and up 

and above that some shoots that propagated last year have already been transplanted 

and the people over there are very enthusiastic about the </span><span>nono</span><span> because it is a crop you 

</span><span>don’t  look  after.    All  you  do  is  plant  it  and  wait  for  it  to  bear</span><span>  fruit.  Apart  from  the 

cultivating of </span><span>nono</span><span>, Mr  Chairman, there are also those that grow wildly  in  the bush 

and  the  people  are  now  receiving  income  from  harvesting  the  wild  </span><span>nono</span><span>  that  is 

prevalent in the bush in Mangaia.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I hope I will have more time to speak about the </span><span>nono</span><span> later. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I  call  for  next  speaker.    I  call  on  the  Honourable  Minister  of 

Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  you,  Greetings  to  the 

Clerk and all staff members and the Honourable Members of Parliament.  Greetings 

also to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, to the former Prime Minister, 

Sir  Geoffrey  Henry  and  Cabinet  colleagues  and  to  Honourable  Members  and  the 

Coalition Government today from NAP and CIP </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  Deputy  Leader  and  all  Honourable 

</span><span>Members  on  the  Opposition  Bench  and  most  especially  to  the  young  guns  in 

</span><span>Parliament. I pray and hope that you will carry out your responsibilities according to 

the needs of your people.  I would like to uphold the message raised by the Minister 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>70 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>of Finance yesterday to be extra careful about these older Members on the Opposition 

side in that they might influence your minds. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to give special Greetings to our Members, the Honourable Tom Marsters 

</span><span>and the Honourable Tangata Vavia who are our colleagues. Greetings to you.  Don’t 

</span><span>worry.  You will be there for only a short time and you will be back in your original 

seats on this side of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, through you I would like at this time to give a word of greetings to my 

own constituency. I would like to greet the Kopu Ariki, Vakatini Ariki, the Pu Tapere 

of Tupapa-Maraerenga, the Ui Mataiapo and Ui Rangatira and to our senior citizens in 

our constituency and to all the people of Tupapa-Maraerenga </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to extend my heart felt </span><span>aroa</span><span> to my very hard working committee, the 

Executive,  and  to  my  supporters  who  have  put  your  confidence  in  me  to  represent 

your interests in this Parliament </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all.  A big thank you to you all for 

giving that confidence in me to be your representative in this House for the next five 

years. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  all  our  people  in  the  Cook  Islands  here  on  Rarotonga  and  in  the  Outer 

Islands from this new Session of the Parliament of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>And a special greetings to our College students here from Titikaveka College. There 

could  be  a  future  Member  of  Parliament  of  this  country  amongst  you.  So  may  you 

have a very educational visit and time to observe Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I  now,  Mr  Chairman,  come  back  to  our  Appropriation  appropriated  for  the 

Department of Agriculture for the 1999/2000 year.  I wish also to say greetings to the 

Minister of Finance for the excellent Budget that he has before us. Kia Orana also to 

the  Secretary  of  Finance,  Kevin  Carr  and  to  the  people  who  are  responsible  for 

preparing 

to  make  a  special 

acknowledgment  to  some  of  the  people  who  are  instrumental  to  the  Budget  that  we 

have.  The  reform  that  we  have  come  through  really  affected  the  economy  of  our 

country but these people are part of the success that we are now experiencing in the 

Budget that we have today. 

</span></div><div><span>this  Appropriation  before  us.  I  would 

</span></div><div><span>like 

</span></div><div><span>From 1996 to 1999 there are those Ministers who are no longer here but outside there 

who have suffered the heartaches of the Reform Process. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  at  this  time  to  thank  you,  Mr  Chairman,  because  you  were  one  of 

those Ministers and you were the Minister of Education at the time of this reform.  To 

former Ministers of the Crown, Vaine Tairea, Minister Tiki Matapo and also our Papa 

Inatio Akaruru and the former Minister of MOWEPP, the Honourable Tom Marsters, 

together we went through the sufferings, the criticisms and the ridicules for the reform 

process.  Without  forgetting  another  Caucus  Member  now  being  brought  back  to 

Parliament  by  his  people,  the  Honourable  Member,  Tangata  Vavia  and  the  former 

</span><span>Member, Thomas Hewett.  We also see that the Honourable Member, Paora Teiti has 

</span><span>been returned to the House, the Honourable Member Mii Parima and it is sad to know 

that the Honourable Niroa Manuela and the Honourable Tiriamate have passed away. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>71 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Before  you  carry on,  excuse me Honourable Minister. Together 

with  you  I  would  like  to  welcome  our  young  students  from  the  School  Certificate 

Lower  Fifth  class  at  Titikaveka  College  with  their  teacher,  Mrs  Tiraa  Anguna,  so 

</span><span>welcome  to  you.    Thank  you  for  your  interest  in  your  Parliament  and  that’s  an 

</span><span>excellent sign. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much Honourable Minister please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I have 3 more Members to greet Mr 

Chairman  and  they  are  the  former  Members  of  Parliament  Boy  Tinomana,  Utia 

Matata and Mataio Aperau and also the former Leader of this House Mr Rei Jack. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, we have been told that there is a surplus of $4 million in this budget.  

</span><span>I’m sorry it is a $2.5 million surplus.  If we look at this budget carefully we will see 

</span><span>that this Government has allocated the surplus to priority areas, areas that Government 

has  decided  are  necessary  for  the  economic  development  of  this  country.    Although 

we can see that what has been distributed to the Ministries is not really sufficient, we 

feel that maybe this is enough for now. If we are able to find some more money, we 

</span><span>might be able to distribute some more in the supplementary budget.  

</span></div><div><span>Agriculture is still the backbone of this country.  Maybe there have been problems in 

some areas in the past and this might be the reason why we have not seen very much 

progress  in  this  area.    However,  we  all  know  that  since  1996  the  economic 

development  in  our  country  has  suffered.  And  during  this  period  of  3  years,  the 

Government  has  put  in  place  enabling  legislation  to  both  underpin  the  reform  and 

</span><span>create  an  environment  for  economic  growth.  It’s  now  time  fo</span><span>r  us  to  create  a 

development  plan  for  Agriculture  for  the  next  5  years.  I  hope  that  this  development 

plan will provide us with a base line document that  will address  all the issue facing 

Agriculture.  A  case  by  case  approach  is  being  looked  at  by  Agriculture.  Then  we 

conducted a holistic approach so that we can identify what resources should be put in 

place.  This  type  of  planning  will  look  at  issues  relating  to  Outer  Island  Agriculture 

production,  market  demands,  import  substitution,  market  access,  food  processing, 

transportation, branding and labelling, organic produce, the cost of capital, supporting 

industries, growth, etc.    

</span></div><div><span>I was very happy listening to the remarks made by the Honourable Robert Wigmore 

when he indicated that he himself is involved in this sector for such a long time would 

like to find ways of helping himself in order that this sector could be improved.  I also 

would like to thank him for paying for the programmes that he presents on the radio 

on Saturday mornings. On this programme know</span><span>n as “What’s on the market and other 

relevant  subjects”  the  Honourable  Member  promotes  and  advises  the  people.  And  I 

</span><span>also hope and believe that he and I can work together. I hope too that we can all work 

together for the benefit of this sector.   

</span></div><div><span>What he said is true with regard to the market that we have today. The prices of our 

produce fluctuate.  The total return of the pawpaw that we exported to the end of June 

</span><span>this  year was $575,000.  This  has  gone down from  the previous  year.  But  after the 

</span><span>Ministry  of  Agriculture  has  done  a  survey  the  Ministry  found  that  there  have  been 

more  pawpaw  trees  planted  this  year  and  therefore  they  expect  greater  income  next 

year.  I also would like to inform our growers especially our pawpaw growers that the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>72 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Ministry  of  Agriculture  has  again  started  to  sell  </span><span>nita</span><span>  seedlings  so  this  will  help  or 

assist our growers.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to  inform  everyone that for the last two weeks our pawpaw production 

has  dropped  somewhat  and  I  would  like  to  encourage  our  pawpaw  producers  to  do 

their best.  There are two other reasons I would like to bring to us today which should 

prompt  us  to  plant  pawpaws.    There  are  two  other  markets  that  I  believe  we  could 

contest.    One  is  Australia.    We  have  made  an  application  to  export  our  produce  to 

Australia  and  we  are  still  waiting  for  their  response.    We  also  look  forward  to  the 

flights  that  will  recommence  in  November  with  Canada  3000.    Our  staff  in  the 

Ministry  has  also  started  negotiations  with  Canada  to  export  our  pawpaw.  The  only 

complications we have come across are that the U.S.A. Government has restrictions of 

entry into Hawaii, but our staff are working on it and we hope to have all this ironed 

out by November. We cannot tell our growers whether this is going to be successful 

or not and we do not know what sort of price we will get for our pawpaw.  The second 

reason is that three weeks ago there was a workshop held on the island of Rarotonga 

about  food  processing.  In  this  workshop,  we  had  two  professors  that  came  from 

Taiwan and they have been trying to relay to the people in the Pacific, to growers and 

</span><span>food producer’s ways and means of starting a business.  Some of the participants who 

</span><span>attended the workshop have really enjoyed it.  They were shown ways of processing 

food  they  never  thought  possible.    They  were  even  shown  how  to  get  flour  from 

arrowroot, </span><span>kumara</span><span> and even pumpkin. 

</span></div><div><span>We are only exporting 1/5</span><span>th</span><span>  of our exporting capacity.  So what  is  happening to  the 

other  4/5</span><span>th</span><span>  of  the  pawpaw.    We  are  not  getting  anything  out  of  it.    We  are  feeding 

them to the pigs and leaving them to rot in the field.  These are the alternatives that 

these professors are looking into to utilise income out of these rejects.  Some of our 

people have been trying to vacuum pack our pawpaws and send them to New Zealand.  

Some of them succeeded but  some failed.  Some are turning them into jam.   I have 

brought  samples here to  show the Honourable  Members.  They  are all  made locally 

and  sold  locally.    I  advise  our  local  people  to  start  looking  and  buying  our  own 

products manufactured in our own country.  

</span></div><div><span>I have here one jar of pawpaw jam and the other is mango jam.  Both of these jams 

are  sold  at  the  CITC  shop.    These  are  the  alternatives.    These  are  some  of  the 

alternatives we could look at with only minor expenses to produce.  There are other 

things that these professors have been looking at.  For example, we can make bread 

out of </span><span>arrowroots.</span><span>  I have actually touched this flour.  It looks like flour, tastes like 

flour, smells like flour, and is white like flour, and it is better than flour.  I have been 

told flour can also be made out of pumpkin, </span><span>kumara</span><span> and mangoes.  The other amazing 

thing too, Mr Chairman, we all know that </span><span>maniota </span><span>has a shelf life of 2 to 3 days and it 

goes black.  We can now dip  </span><span>maniota</span><span> in  some chemical,  not  a dangerous chemical, 

and that </span><span>maniota</span><span> can last two to three weeks and stay pure white.  This means that we 

can now send our arrowroot overseas after dipping it in this solution without worrying 

that the arrowroot will turn black or have black spots. It will last two to three weeks.   

</span></div><div><span>The talk of the town in Agriculture today is “</span><span>nono</span><span>”.  Locally we are not meeting the 

</span><span>demand for Nono.  Danny Mataroa assured me that he is not getting enough </span><span>nono</span><span> to 

meet  the  demand  of  the  market  overseas.    I  know  a  lot  of  land  areas  has  been 

converted  into  n</span><span>ono</span><span>  plantations.    And  just  for  the  information  of  the  Members  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>73 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament and the public, we have someone here from Australia interested in going 

into  the  </span><span>nono</span><span>  business.    This  man  is  Mr  Garfield  Welles.    He  has  held  discussions 

with  Mr  Danny  Mataroa  and  Papa  Tukaroa  and  is  looking  to  have  discussions  with 

Government  to  obtain  permission  to  sell  our  </span><span>nono</span><span>  overseas.    The  only  thing  is  we 

</span><span>shouldn’t just jump into a situation such as this without thinking. The  </span><span>nono</span><span> tree is a 

very important tree to our country. If you can succeed in this venture, do join in.  It is 

also important to note that we are only getting about 70 cents a kilo. 

</span></div><div><span>This Company is looking at paying $2 per kilo and this is a good price.  We should 

also  look  at the end price.  What  are these people going to  be making out  of it?  In 

Singapore a one litre bottle of </span><span>nono</span><span> is sold for $US 65.  So this is the only reason I 

would like to  warn our  business  people here not to  get  all involved in  ventures like 

this because we in the future will not be the ones to benefit.  They will benefit. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe  as  a  matter  of  interest  to  Members  of  Parliament  I  will  just  go  through  the 

figures for our exports for last year.  I have informed Members of the figures for the 

pawpaw  production.  For  </span><span>maire  </span><span>we  received  $1,164.    The  trials  with  our  eggplants 

have started and we have sent off 43 cartons.  We have also obtained permission to 

</span><span>send  our  chillies  overseas  and  this  has  started  with  43  cartons.    We  also  started 

</span><span>exporting  beans  and  84  cart</span><span>ons  have  been  called  for.    I  can’t  give  you  the  actual 

</span><span>figures but an estimate has been given to me of more than ten containers, especially 

from the island of Aitutaki. These were filled with  </span><span>maniota, nu</span><span> and </span><span>taro</span><span> and sent to 

New Zealand.  We are still waiting for clearance for acceptance of two more of our 

produce and that is for clearance of our capsicums and clearance of our lemons.  So 

this would be good news for our growers. We are aware that some of our cash crops 

have been  given the  green light  and  I  think it is  time for us to  look forward to  next 

</span><span>year’s winter.  </span></div><div><span>I would also like to inform our people that we have just received a special selection of 

20 goats from Fiji. These goats will be used to help our goat farmers.  So for anybody 

who thinks that they would like to go into farming goats, after these goats have been 

bred then we will be able to provide you with these goats. 

</span></div><div><span>I will end here Mr Chairman.  I think I might have spoken too much.  I will now give 

the opportunity to other Members to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister. Are there any further speakers?  

I call on the Honourable Member for Mitiaro. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Good  morning  to  you  and  first  of  all  I 

would  like  to  give  you  my  congratulations  on  becoming  Speaker  and  I  am  quite 

certain that you will be fair in your dispensations of your duty as a Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  also  to  all  staff  members,  to  the  Clerk,  to  staff  members  of  Parliament  </span><span>–</span><span>

Greetings to you all. Greetings also to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, 

Sir Geoffrey Henry, Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader, Cabinet Ministers and 

</span><span>to all Honourable Members in Parliament today </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all in the love of 

</span><span>God. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>74 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I seek leave, Mr Chairman, to address my people in my constituency.  Greetings to all 

the  people  on  the  island  of  Nukuroa.  To  the  Ui  Ariki  and  to  your  good  ladies  </span><span>–</span><span>

Greetings to you all.  To the religious organisations on the island of Nukuroa and to 

your  members  of  your  ekelesia,  the  Mayor  and  your  Island  Councillors.    To  all  the 

people  on  the  island  of  Nukuroa,  from  the  eldest  right  down  to  the  smallest  </span><span>–</span><span>

Greetings to you all. Greetings also go to our people who are listening in to our debate 

today </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>First of all, I would like to extend to the Minister responsible, the Minister of Finance, 

for the Appropriation that we have before the House for the transparency that is quite 

obvious in these Appropriations.  But there are other areas in this Budget that we have 

</span><span>before  us  that  I  don’t  quite  like  </span><span>because  the  distributions  of  the  welfare  for  the 

development in our country is not really fair because we have indicated in the Budget 

that we are looking at Tourism, Marine Resources and Agriculture Department to be 

</span><span>developed for our country.  We didn’t t</span><span>ry and save money that we have here to show 

</span><span>the people that there is some change in our nation.  There’s a lot of money allocated in 

</span><span>this Budget.  So as we can see in this Budget the surplus that we have accumulated in 

this Budget, the people who should feel the surpluses have not seen any benefit out of 

</span><span>it yet.  Because we feel we have done quite well in the surpluses that we have gained, 

</span><span>we should be injecting these surpluses into Agriculture, Marine and Tourism but as I 

observed,  what  we  have  done,  Mr  Chairman,  is  we  have  increased  the  Support 

Services of the Ministers and the increases that we have effected cost over $200,000  

over and above the Budget of 1998/99. There is no explanation of what the increase 

for this allocation is for. I understand it is up to each Minister to decide how he can 

utilise this money. 

</span></div><div><span>This Budget allocation is not the same as the allocation for Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  The  Prime  Minister  has  called  a  Point  of  Order.    What  is  your 

Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Mr Chairman, we are dealing with the Agriculture sector 

of the Budget, not with the Ministerial allocations. 

</span></div><div><span>The old gun here is saying that he is comparing it.  He should wait for his turn. In my 

</span><span>opinion, it’s irrelevant. </span><span>When he gets up to speak then he can speak on the Agriculture 

Budget but if he veers slightly in the old style of the oldest gun, I will call him to a 

Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Prime Minister. Would you take your seat Honourable 

Member?  I will make a ruling. 

</span></div><div><span>Yes, I uphold the Point of Order. You have made the point and I think it is time for 

</span><span>you to come back to the Agriculture Vote. Thank you very much. Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman  for  your  ruling.  I  was  just  trying  to 

compare this distribution to what is given to the Agriculture Department and to make 

</span><span>my  comparison  much  clearer  I  needed  to  refer  to  these  two.  There’s  one  more  in 

</span><span>particular that I want to mention. 

</span></div><div><span>However, I will abide with your ruling. However, I will point one more distribution 

</span><span>and that is the distribution of the allocations to the Civil List.  Because I don’t think 

</span><span>there  is  a  fare  allocation  that  has  gone  into  these  votes  and  what  is  gone  into  the 

Agriculture Department.  Because Mr Speaker, in  the Agriculture vote it shows that 

there are 10 outputs.   In the Ministers Support Services, there is no output there.  It 

</span><span>looks  more  like  the  PNG  trust  funds.  Anyway  Mr  Speaker,  I’ll  come  back  to  the 

Agriculture vote. I’ll say that we </span><span>could have put those allocation from those votes into 

</span><span>Agriculture, because I’ll say then now we conferring with the people, the people that 

</span><span>matters. Then, I can say that we are complying with Reform Process that we are going 

through. 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at the Agriculture Vote Item, there is a total of $608,576 allocated for 

this financial year for Agriculture. However, when we go through these outputs, I feel 

</span><span>sorry  for  this  Ministry.  They  plan  to  increase  the  production  of  exported  domestic 

</span><span>trade  by  $11  million  in  the  next  4  years.  In  Output  1,  it  states  that  it  facilitates  and 

increase export trade of Agriculture production to $1 million. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>That’s  your  first  speech.    You  want  to  take  your  second  speech 

</span><span>Honourable Member, please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  Therefore,  when  we  look  at  it,  the 

Appropriation for this financial year that would take that return of $1 million to be put 

back into the country through export. It is going to cost $55.5 thousand to get a return 

of $1 million.  Mr </span><span>Speaker I think that’s a far fit call that we expect this Ministry to 

</span><span>get this output a return of $1 million with $55,000.  Mr Speaker I would suggest that 

when  we  have  a  $1  million  budget  for  Agriculture  by  now,  we  would  have  been 

making real money if tha</span><span>t’s the case that this $55,000 can make a return of $1 million.  

</span><span>I  doubt  that  very  much  Mr  Speaker,  because  as  I  see  this  $55,000  this would  cover 

only  the  pair  minimum.    It  will  only  cover  the  pair  minimum  of  this  output  it  will 

probably go all on wages.  In working this out Mr Speaker with a return of $1 million 

to achieve this Output with $55,000 that means that it will get a return of $1 to $20.00  

</span><span>$1 is in and $20 is out. I don’t know whether you call that efficiency Mr Speaker but I 

think  I’d rather t</span><span>hat  the  Honourable Robert Wigmore stand up and say  whether  you 

</span><span>can turn a $1 into $20 being a grower himself. But Mr Speaker, what I’m trying to say 

</span><span>here  is  that  this  is  where  we  should  be  putting  the  Agriculture  should  be  allocated 

more funds rather than  Ministerial Support Services and the Civil  List and the same 

</span><span>goes  with  Output  2.    There’s  an  allocation  of  $65  and  half  thousand  and  expected 

</span><span>return of $2 million in the local market.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we can see clearly the allocation in this even though these are estimates 

prepared by the Agriculture themselves. I think we in Government or any Government 

</span><span>should  look  at  it  and  ask  ourselves  whether  this  is  realistic  and  if  is  it  not,  then  we 

</span><span>should  put  the  money  where  it  should  benefit  our  people.    Not  us  for  a  start  Mr 

Speaker,  but  our  people  and  if  we  go  down  the  list  of  the  10  Outputs,  these  are  all 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>76 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>important areas that needs finance.  Of course, we know there are other areas we can 

</span><span>put money into like the Health and other areas as well, but…</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU: </span><span>Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>There’s  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor  Honourable  Member.  Yes 

</span><span>Minister of Police, what is your Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON T. TAPAITAU: </span><span>I ask Mr Chairman whether the Honourable Member is talking 

about the merits and the principles of the Budget, Appropriation Bill or is he talking 

about Agriculture. He seems to be wandering. I ask that he be called back. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Minister.  Honourable  Member  please  carry  on  but 

concentrate on the Agriculture Budget, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VAVIA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker and before I was called to a Point of Order, I 

was  identifying  other  important  areas  that  money  should  be  appropriate.  But 

</span><span>Agriculture’s  allocation  has  been  allocated  is  far  too  small.  I  just  couldn’t  get  away 

</span><span>from  t</span><span>he  other  Appropriations  in  this  Budget  that  is  to  me  is  that  we  don’t  needed 

</span><span>right now, particularly Mr Speaker the two vote that I have mentioned. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. Before I call on the next speaker, 

</span><span>may I request… oh it</span><span>s time for a morning tea.  I will give you my request when we 

resume, so this sitting is suspended until 12.00 noon.
