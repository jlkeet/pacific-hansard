<div><span>SITTING RESUMED 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please be seated. Before I call on the next speaker, please may I 

have  your  indulgence.  I  am  asking  Honourable  Members  that  we  are  on  the 

Committee of Supply talking on the Agriculture Budget. You will find on page 2 of 

Volume  2,  and  as  far  as  possible  please  speak  on  that  allocation.  If  you  have  to 

</span><span>digress,  it’s  alright,  but  not  too  long.  </span><span>That  is  my  request.  I  am  noting  what  you  are 

saying and I am noting how often you repeat yourself on the very same issue and you 

could  become  guilty  of  tedious  repetition.  Please  let  us  speak  on  the  Agriculture 

Budget.  Thank  you.  I  now  call  for  the  next  speaker.  The  Honourable  Member  from 

Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman  and  Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable 

Members in this House on this Kia Orana Day. We have heard all the greetings earlier 

</span><span>so  we  won’t  dwell  on  that  and  we  will  go  </span><span>on  the  Appropriation  before  us.  Through 

you  Mr  Chairman,  may  I  extend  greetings  to  the  two  visitors  in  the  public  gallery.  

And a special greeting to the Minister responsible for Agriculture, Honourable Tupou 

Faireka. I was elated when you said that there is a chemical we can dip our arrowroot 

</span><span>into  and  it  won’t  go  black  and  also  that  we  are  now  able  to  export  chilli  to  New 

</span><span>Zealand b because this crop is growing while in Aitutaki and being eaten by the birds. 

</span></div><div><span>  I  would  also  like  to  extend  greetings  to  someone  who  has  been  a  father  in 

agricultural work in our midst, excuse me if I say Kia Orana to the Honourable Robert 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>77 

</span></div><div><span>Wigmore.  Also  our  dear  Mama  who  is  a  specialist  in  taro,  the  Honourable  Ngamau 

Munokoa. Every Saturday morning the whole of the Cook Islands hears the voice of 

this gentleman giving words of encouragement to the growers of this country.  But I 

was a little disappointed with the idea from the speech from the Honourable Member 

Dr  Robert  Woonton  regarding  the  wasps  nest.  He  did  not  elaborate  what  this  wasp 

nest is like. I believe the wasp on this side is what we know as the bee that produces 

honey.  However,  the  wasp  on  that  end  is  the  one  that  stings.  Therefore  Honourable 

Member, you have no use there, rather you come to us where you can produce honey. 

Do  not  wait  for  Wuatai  it  is  a  waste  of  time.  So  Mr  Chairman,  the  Coalition 

Government  do not  play in  the dark we play in  the light  we offer  you a  seat  on the 

Government  Side  where  we  can  produce  honey  for  Agriculture.  Through  you  Mr 

Chairman, I would like to comment on the people who produce </span><span>maniota</span><span> and harvest 

</span><span>remu</span><span>known as the Are Nikau that  your cheque is coming on today’s flight. Collect 

</span><span>your cheque to help with your needs. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Order!  Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>  Thank  you.  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  also  like  to  extend  a  word  of 

</span><span>condolence  on  behalf  of  my  two  colleagues  and  myself  Hon.  Kete  Ioane  and  Hon. 

</span><span>Paora Teiti to the Tamapure family who lost their daughter.   

</span></div><div><span>When I look at the Budget Allocation for Agriculture, I can see the lot going to you 

on Rarotonga. However, there are things here that will be of benefit for our people in 

Aitutaki  and  I  believe  that  our  allocation  for  the  island  of  Aitutaki  will  be  under 

</span><span>MOID.  For the last  year’s Budget  of $490,290  and the new allocation is  $608,576, 

</span><span>which has increased by $118,256 . So I will say Mr Chairman this is enough for you 

in  Rarotonga.    Mr  Chairman  I  would  like  to  raise  a  point  that  looking  at  Budget 

allocations in the last 20 years in order for us to know where we are heading we must 

know where we have come from.  Because I believe that from the year 1978 to 1988 it 

</span><span>was under the Democratic Party, have patience with me the “Young Guns” you were 

</span><span>not part of that in those years. The allocation at this period of time was $12,128, 200 

allocated to the Department of Agriculture at the time. I tried to ask for the value of 

the Department of Agriculture, but this information was not available. From 1989 to 

last year, this is when the Cook Islands Party was in Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, under the Cook Islands Party Government, they have  given to  the Agriculture 

for their purpose $21,945,095. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  You  are  on  your  second  speech  Honourable  Member  for 

Nikaupara. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I am quite proud at this 

time for being part of this Cook Islands Party for what they have done and what they 

have given to the Department of Agriculture during their time in Government.  I want 

to bring this point out for us to know what has happened today. 

</span></div><div><span>Now to the Department of Agriculture.  Like the Honourable Member, Tangata Vavia 

</span><span>I also believe and trust among these three other areas, this is one of those important 

areas.  Amongst  these  things  excluding  the  Animal  Husbandry,  the  most  important 

aspect  is  the  land  and  the  people.  Within  this  area,  we  have  growing  for  our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>78 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>sustenance  and  areas  of  planting  for  revenue.  As  we  talk  about  Agriculture  in  our 

country,  we  must  not  forget  that  we  should  also  be  planting  for  our  home  use.  

</span><span>Because if we don’t plant, the next thing that will come to us is we</span><span> will buy bread and 

we will buy potato and the money will be taken out of the country. However, for us in 

Aitutaki today, there is this time we have started producing arrowroot pudding which 

we  have  found  that  it  has  commercial  value.  We  have  also  gone  to  the  extent  of 

selling our other products for some money. There are two areas that I need to touch on 

this and to bring to our attention the selling of our produce locally and the selling of 

the produce overseas. We understand the boat of our friend over here is going out to 

the Outer  Islands and coming back empty. Therefore, this is  an information for  you 

people on Rarotonga when the boat goes to Aitutaki next week it will come back with 

some kumara and taro for the Rarotonga market. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, for your information, I would like to say that we have earned $6,564 out of 

the sales of maniota and rimu.  So if we consider this for a period of 52 weeks with 

$2,000 a week, we will be raising about $104,000 a year.  So I am trying to give us an 

example,  Mr  Chairman,  like  we  sent  the  bananas  and  other  crops  to  the  Northern 

Group islands they send paua in return.  However, this money is circulated within our 

</span><span>country.  The important point over here is the money did not go out to buy potatoes 

</span><span>but it is circulating in our own country.  So if we are looking at an overseas market, 

Mr  Chairman,  we  should  be  looking  at  our  own  people  in  New  Zealand  and  in 

Australia. 

</span></div><div><span>So through the strength and working together with my friend, Terepai Maoate Jnr in 

Aitutaki, we have exported ten shipments of local produce to our own people overseas 

and we have managed to bring and come into the hands of our people $90,000.  So I 

</span><span>would like to encourage this House let’s not compete our produce on a supermarket in 

</span><span>New Zealand but take our own produce to our own people in New Zealand.  But the 

only problem that we anticipate about this is the people who are selling the produce in 

New  Zealand.    Therefore,  I  would  like  to  support  the  idea  of  my  colleague,  the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti to utilise the services of the Cook Islands Consulate 

</span><span>in New Zealand for this service.  If they don’t want to carry out those responsibilities 

</span><span>close the place down. 

</span></div><div><span>About our products, the mangoes, the protocol is open now in New Zealand because 

this  will  be  produced  by  Aitutaki  and  Mauke,  which  will  bring  some  benefit  to  our 

people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank  you Honourable Member.  You have one more speaking 

time if you want to take it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> Yes please. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  from  Nikaupara  for  his  third 

speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> So we have also experienced the problem that the taro has gone and 

</span><span>we waited and no money came back.  Why this happened was there are those people 

who tried to use our produce to benefit themselves.  So what we have done is we tried 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>79 

</span></div><div><span>this way of doing things but then we eventually find out that it is best that we take the 

produce ourselves and sell it ourselves and bring the money for ourselves. 

</span></div><div><span>So  this  is  another  way  of  doing  things  but  we  are  lucky  for  us  in  Aitutaki  the  boat 

came  from  New  Zealand  to  Rarotonga,  Rarotonga  to  Aitutaki  and  from  Aitutaki  to 

</span><span>New Zealand, but it is unfortunate for some of the Outer Islands that they don’t have 

</span><span>the same opportunity but this is our job to ensure that these services are extended to 

other  islands.    One  good  thing  about  the  market  as  we  sell  our  produce  to  our  own 

</span><span>people  no  matter  what  the  banana,  if  it’s  over  ripe,  but  our  people  know  inside  the 

</span><span>banana is the best. 

</span></div><div><span>The good thing about this system, Mr Chairman, is that you have to give the money to 

</span><span>the pocket of the person if the person works.  That’s not the way to do it.  So what we 

</span><span>need to  do is  to  encourage our people to  export which is  part of the  reform process 

that our people do something for themselves in order for the money to come into their 

pockets. 

</span></div><div><span>And  during  this  time  of  reform,  Mr  Chairman,  I  found  out  that  the  business  sector 

</span><span>worked  well  with  Government  and  we  want  to  continue  this  relationship.    The  idea 

</span><span>that  we  had,  Junior  Maoate  and  myself,  was  that  you  helped  the  people  earn  the 

money and the people come back and buy from your shop.  This is one way that I can 

</span><span>see.    I  don’t  think  that  some  of  the  business  people  on  the  island  are  doing  this.    I 

</span><span>believe  that  for  the  private  sector  and  the  Government  to  work  together  in  order  to 

help  our  people  and  to  encourage  our  people  but  the  key  factor  in  this  is  that  the 

people  bring  their  produce  and  no  longer  than  a  week  than  they  are  getting  their 

money into their pocket.  This key area is, I believe, the Coalition Government should 

look at the Cook Islands Development Bank to help our people. 

</span></div><div><span>That is why, Mr Chairman, I say this Budget allocation for Agriculture is enough and 

</span><span>I  don’t  agree  with  my  colleague,  the  Honourable  Tangata  Vavia  that  when  you  put 

</span><span>that sum of money into Agriculture that you will receive the same amount of money.  

This money that Junior Maoate received for this project that Are Nikau was doing is 

not in this Budget but we have used it to supplement this Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP: </span><span>Those are my views and support of the allocation for Agriculture in 

our Budget Mr Chairman, Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

I can on the Honourable Member for Mauke for your first speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  M.  TAIA:  </span><span>Kia  Orana  Mr  Chairman,  Kia  Orana  in  the  name  of  our  Lord.    Kia 

Orana also to Honourable Members in this House as we meet here today.  We have all 

heard the greetings that have gone before.  At this point, I would like to give separate 

greetings and congratulations to the Honourable Minister Tupou Faireka who has now 

been  given  the  responsibility  of  looking  after  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.    I  would 

also like at this point of time to give my congratulations to the Honourable Minister 

</span><span>Tepure  Tapaitau  who  has  now  taken  on  the  responsibility  for  the  Ministry  of  Outer 

</span><span>Islands  Development  and  I  believe  that  he  can  work  together  with  the  Honourable 

Minsiter Tupou Faireka to ensure that the development in the Outer Islands is put in 

place.  We have all heard the views of former speakers in this Honourable House and 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>80 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  believe  that  we  as  Honourable  Members  will  hold  hands  and  work  together  in 

pulling this cart.  And I hope that you will put us the new guns in front and all the old 

guns can be in the back and support and help to steer this cart in the right direction.  

Although  we  might  be  of  different  minds  that  of  the  government  side  and  also  the 

opposition  side,  but  I  believe  that  we  all  have  the  same  goal  and  that  is  for  the 

betterment of our country.   

</span></div><div><span>At  this  point,  I  would  like  to  come  back  now  to  our  Appropriation  now  for  the 

Ministry of Agriculture.  I would like to now speak on this export that we have been 

exporting overseas for some time now and that is the export of </span><span>maire</span><span>.  I believe it is 

now being 20 years since this project commence and I think that it is time for us to try 

to improve this venture.  When the ladies go into the </span><span>makatea</span><span> to pick the </span><span>maire</span><span>, it is 

not an easy task.  Some ladies, because this is their only source of income and in some 

case they go into the Makatea and fall over and hit themselves.  Sometimes people get 

lost on the Makatea and they spend the night on the </span><span>makatea</span><span>, people looking during 

the night, sometimes in the morning they are found and return to their homes.  After 

they  have  made  1  maire  ei  they  then  get  themselves  $4.  And  this  I  would  like  to 

highlight  because  I  believe  that  it  is  not  worth  their  while  to  go  into  the  makatea 

</span><span>sometimes get hurt there, get lost on the makatea for the price of $4.00 for 1 </span><span>maire</span><span> ei.  

</span><span>I was an agent for the maire from 1981 to 1985 and I know how hard it is to get the 

</span><span>maire.</span><span>  It may be a good idea for an official from the Ministry of Agriculture to come 

to the island of Mauke, Mitiaro or Mangaia because these are the 3 islands where this 

</span><span>maire</span><span>  can  be  found.  Maybe  then  they  will  be  able  to  see  exactly  how  hard  it  is  to 

make a living out  of this  </span><span>maire</span><span>.  So this what  I  would like to  bring into this House 

today is for us to look for a way maybe to try and increase the price of the maire being 

paid to these ladies so that it will be worth their while trying to look for the maire and 

making a protect out of this.  As the Honourable Minister highlight earlier the number 

of cartons of maire being send to Hawaii.  In this cartons of </span><span>maire</span><span> there are about 20 

strands of </span><span>maire</span><span> and if we multiply that by $4.00, we will find that there was about 

$100,000 worth of maire sent to Hawaii.  So if we look at the Appropriation for the 

Ministry  of  Agriculture  we  find  that  this  is  about  1/6  of  the  total  funding  for 

Agriculture.  Therefore, this will show us the importances that the maire holds in our 

country.  It  is  therefore  my  belief  that  we  should  look  for  and  try  to  find  ways  to 

increase the amount of money being paid to our Mamas. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>You wish to continue Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA: </span><span>Yes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Now, you are on your second speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA: </span><span>So this is what I am trying to present to government for government 

to find ways to look out and look after our mamas. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, we have heard that the statues or the Ministry of Agriculture has suffered a 

lot  in  the  last  couple  of  years  and  my  question  that  is,  could  we  then  reopen  the 

</span><span>branches of the Ministry of Agriculture in the Outer Islands.   It would then be their 

</span><span>responsibility  to  advice  our  people  in  the  Outer  Islands  about  issues  that  we  are 

speaking of now.  Our people are still carrying on with their planting schemes but the 

only  problem  is  when  they  run  into  trouble  they  need  advice,  they  have  to  ring 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>81 

</span></div><div><span>Rarotonga and this costs and so I believe that it will be better if the advisers could be 

there with them on those islands.</span></div><div><span>Another important area is also the quarantine section and we can see that there are no 

good  facilities  set  aside  for  carrying  out  this  service.    In  the  past  it  used  to  be  the 

responsibility  of  the  quarantine  section  to  supply  the  chemical  required  before  the 

Maire  is  exported,  but  today  because  the  people  who  are  carrying  out  this 

responsibility now have not been properly trained and may become ill because of this.  

This  is  why  I  said  yesterday  that  the  appropriation  for  Agriculture  is  not  sufficient 

because  I  believe  this  should  be  increased  to  enable  us  to  open  these  agencies  for 

Agriculture  in  the  Outer  Islands.    I  hope  that  the  Government  will  look  at  this 

carefully  and  if  we  are  not  able  to  carry  out  the  changes  this  year,  may  be  at  some 

other  time  but  I  would  not  like  the  Government  to  forget.    I  believe  that  the 

Agriculture  sector  in  the  Outer  Islands  will  help  to  improve  the  economy  of  our 

country.    May  be  this  is  not  in  line  with  the  policies  of  the  reform  process  but  we 

should look at it anyway.  The reason I would like to stay on this point because today 

there  three  young  men  trained  in  Agriculture  but  today  they  are  working  for  MOID 

and  they  do  not  know  how  to  fix  cars  but  they  know  Agriculture.    This  is  why  I 

</span><span>humbly request that you please look into this. 

</span></div><div><span>We  also  heard  mention  by  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  and  the  Honourable  Teina 

Bishop about arrowroot.  In the month of June there was a ship that arrived in Mauke 

and  on  it  was  this  young  man  Chris  Manu.    There  were  some  discussions  held 

between this  young man and the Island Council and Aronga Mana.  The discussions 

were  along  the  lines  that  if  the  island  of  Mauke  were  able  to  make  starch  to  be 

exported to the Northern Group or New Zealand.  Because the understanding was that 

freight charges on the ship would be cheaper than on the airlines. The intention was 

and  I think the Deputy  Prime Minister knows the intention and that is  that this ship 

was to service Nga-Pu-Toru and the Northern Group islands and then go on to Samoa 

and New Zealand.  The discussions were not just centred on the issue of arrowroot but 

also on </span><span>taro </span><span>and that the island might be able to supply the Northern Group and would 

benefit  the  people  in  the  Northern  and  Southern  Groups.  I  hope  we  will  all  join 

together and cooperate so that this will become a reality. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  You  have  one  more  speaking  time.    Do  you  want  to  carry  on 

Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span> If I may Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You are on your third speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span> During the period of the Manea Games, we need a lot of vegetables.  

So I flew to Rarotonga to check out the situation but when I arrived I found that the 

tomatoes  sold  here  were  $10  a  kilo  and  from  New  Zealand.    I  bought  what  I  could 

afford and took it back to Mauke to help feed those who came to the Manea Games 

and  I  believe  if  we  had  been  able  to  plant  this  on  Mauke  the  need  would  not  have 

</span><span>arisen  to  have  it  brought  in.    If  the  Honourable  Teina  Bishop  had  sent  us  some 

</span><span>assistance  from  Aitutaki  when  the  airlines  brought  the  athletes  to  Mauke,  the  way  I 

see  it  he  was  too  busy  making  money  to  think  about  us.    So  this  then  Honourable 

Members is to show the House that there are a lot of areas that need assistance today. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>82 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Another  important  crop  that  I  have  noticed  is  the  pineapple.    I  know  that  our  local 

variety  is  the  strongest  of  the  pineapples  around.    And  better  than  the  varieties 

introduced  into  our  country.    Now  the  people  have  started  to  replant  pineapple  to 

supply  the  people  on  the  island.    If  we  have  sufficient  supplies  then  we  will  export 

some  to  the  Rarotogna  market.    The  reason  I  would  like  us  to  look  at  this  fruit  is 

because it is easy to maintain.  I believe if we are to try this it will be of benefit for us.  

Just  as  an example a gentleman had recently planted ¼ acre of pineapples and after 

selling  his  crop  he  was  able  to  buy  a  Datsun  Pickup.    This  is  again  Honourable 

Members to show us that there is plenty out there but only a few of us are reaping it.  

Therefore, again I would like to highlight to this House the reason why I brought this 

up  so  that  we  can  have  a  Budget  to  enable  us  to  seek  out  these  support  agencies.  

There is also a project we have begun on the island of Mauke and that is the planting 

of </span><span>“mario”</span><span> bananas. 

</span></div><div><span>And  this  came  about  as  a  result  of  our  son,  Dr  Mataio  Pureau  who  is  at  present  in 

Samoa and he and his friend believe that it would be a good idea to have our Outer 

Islands planting bananas and the bananas are the very short mario banana.  In Mauke 

</span><span>mario banana and in Rarotonga it is called the tarua banana and these are the types of 

</span><span>bananas that these two though would be a good idea as a project for the Outer Islands 

and  if  it  does  succeed  then  these  bananas  will  be  sold  as  dried  bananas  or  as  we 

locally know it as piere.  The beauty about piere is that the piere itself if it is ripe and 

treated properly it will never  go off.   It  will never rot.   I believe that if  we think of 

something  we  should  not  be  afraid  to  do  it.    I  also  believe  that  if  we  try  it  and  it 

</span><span>doesn’t</span><span>work  out  then  we  have  failed  but  if  we  try  it  and  we  succeed  then  that’s  a 

</span><span>benefit to the country.  I believe in this English adage nothing is impossible. 

</span></div><div><span>My last thought for this afternoon is with regard to what the Minister said earlier on 

about  the  special  selection  of  goats  and  I  would  like  to  ask  when  these  goats  are 

distributed Mauke would like some goats because this is where the goat was created.  

</span><span>If only we had a good person to look after these goats in Mauke they wouldn’t die out.  

</span><span>But now that we have a good project in place for the goats it will be a success.  So I 

believe  that  Honourable  Members  in  this  House  will  support  these  projects  for  our 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  for  Matavera  for  your  first 

speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR PERI V. PARE:</span><span> Greetings to you Mr Chairman and to all your staff members.  

Greetings  in  the  love  of  God  this  afternoon.    Greetings  to  all  Honourable  Members 

this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I say something on the matter I would like to say greetings to all the growers 

on Rarotonga and in the Outer Islands, especially the full-time growers and also the 

part-timers.  There are also those Mamas who are very good market gardeners.  I can 

alone give them the encouragement to carry on in their agricultural work and to those 

</span><span>businesses  that  are  processing  our  produce  on  the  island  because  I  know,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, that people like John File and Hugh Baker are some of those few who are 

processing our second grade pawpaw.  For Hugh Baker he is producing alcohol from 

our pawpaw g</span><span>rowers’ rejected pawpaw and the likes of John File who is also buying 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>83 

</span></div><div><span>our  rejected  pawpaw  but  because  of  the  volume  of  our  rejected  pawpaw  these  two 

processing plants are unable to take them all.  So it is rotting away.  So at a time when 

the  Kia  Orana  Foods  was  still  operational  there  were  those  times  they  took  the 

pawpaw at  20 cents  a kilo  to  produce juice.  But  today, Mr Chairman,  I  realise that 

growers  exporting  pawpaw  overseas  are  bringing  back  40  cents  a  kilo  per  pawpaw.  

</span><span>There’s  also  a  big  loss.    The</span><span>se  are  the  reasons  why  the  pawpaw  growers  give  up.  

When the price of the pawpaw goes down everybody gets out and when the price of 

the pawpaw goes up everybody goes in.  I feel, Mr Chairman, this is another area that 

Government should be looking at, at the loss sustained by the growers in this respect. 

</span></div><div><span>I now  come back to  food processing.   I  also  heard what  the Minister of Agriculture 

has said with regard to processing our produce.  I feel Mr Chairman that before these 

processed  foods  can  go  on  the  market  they  have  to  go  through  some  laws.    At  the 

Research Station in Totokoitu, Titikaveka the New Zealand Government has put up a 

lab and for the purpose of this building that was built it was as a laboratory testing lab.  

But  the  unfortunate  thing  about  this  beautiful  house  is  that  there  are  not  enough 

facilities in the building and nobody properly trained to work in this lab. The value of 

this  lab  is  not  to  test  the  food  only  but  also  the  soil  and  Agriculture  chemicals  and 

</span><span>pesticides  and  the  production  of  milk  that  has  been  produced  here  in  Rarotonga.  

</span><span>About three years ago there was a meeting at the Totokoitu Research Station with the 

Minister  of  Agriculture,  the  staff  of  the  Research  Station  and  other  business  people 

and  Dr  Pureau  was  the  Chairman  of  that  meeting  and  the  Secretary  of  Agriculture, 

Nga  Mataio  was  there.    Because  the  purpose  of  that  meeting  was  since  the  reform 

started there were those expats who requested through the New Zealand Government 

and John File was one of them.  There was another papaa there who was the first one 

to  start  off  vacuum  taro.    I  heard  the  Minister  say  earlier  that  the  vacuum  packed 

pawpaw that was exported </span><span>–</span><span> the reason why these people who have started into this 

business  of  processing  our  local  produce  is  dependant  on  what  Government  has  to 

say.    At  the  time  during  that  meeting  the  milk  processing  factory  was  one  of  the 

subjects but there was no place to test the milk. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Do you wish to continue Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR PERI V. PARE: </span><span>Yes Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please take your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR PERI V. PARE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  The only problem at the time was a 

place to test the standard of the milk because there is only one well equipped lab and 

that is at the hospital but the hospital lab is not for food testing but for the sick.  But 

the taro processing, the Manager of the milk processing factory came and said what is 

the  equipment  that  he  needs  to  buy  for  the  milk  laboratory  and  the  equipment  was 

procured but there was nobody to operate it and one of the girls who had graduated 

from the University of the South Pacific in laboratory work and she was employed by 

this company.  But the only problem then, Mr Chairman, was because the laboratory 

that  was  built  by  the  New  Zealand  Government  was  not  fully  equipped  to 

</span><span>accommodate all the work that is required. 

</span></div><div><span>So this is my request to the Honourable Minister responsible for Agriculture if some 

money  can  be  made  available  to  equip  this  laboratory  for  future  needs.  Because  we 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>84 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>know that there are some pest  that are destroying our taro crop over here so if only 

this laboratory can keep fully equipped to carry out the test in order for us to come up 

with a way to combat the pesticide that is attacking our crop.  This extends to testing 

of  soil  because  we  sometimes  plant  crops  on  the  wrong  soil.  When  we  have  this 

</span><span>equipment  then  we  won’t  be  doing  what  was  raised  by  the  Minister  of  Finance 

</span><span>yesterday.    This  is  where  the  Advisory  Unit  of  Agriculture  can  be  useful.    This  is 

where  the  we  can  work  together  with  the  laboratory  technicians  to  give  the  proper 

advise to growers what they need to do with the soil of the place that they are going to 

plant.   I would say that the Honourable Member from Titikaveka Honourable Robert 

Wigmore would agree with me that sometimes the problem that we are encounting is 

the  soil  type.    So  what  we  need  is  for  some  money  to  be  allocated  to  improve  and 

upgrade  the  facilities  in  this  laboratory  at  the  Research  Station  in  Titikaveka.    The 

field service of Agriculture should work together with the laboratory people and with 

the growers to give them the proper advice of how to go about.   On our islands, there 

are a lot of flowers.  In the flowers that we have there is something called essences.  If 

the Dr Purea was able to  extract  the scents  from  the flowers which we can produce 

</span><span>perfumes  why  can’t  we  carry  these  activities  on.  When  we  look  at  someone  in 

</span><span>Matavera who has a place to manufacture soap and perfume, the various things that he 

</span><span>is working on are locally grown, like the skin of the watermelon, the skin of oranges.  

</span><span>The skin of oranges, they keep them and they try and squeese the brick of oil out of 

the orange skin for perfume.  And we can see that there are alot of pontentials for us 

on our island and this expatriate came here and is producing something from our local 

</span><span>product.  These are the views that I wish to raise that weren’t brought to us earlier.  </span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  speak  on  breadfruit.  This  is  one  of  the  islands  that  have  a  lot  of 

breadfruit  and during the breadfruit season  all this breadfruit fall on the ground and 

</span><span>rot away.  I don’t whether this is one of the produce that the protocol has been cleared 

</span><span>to send overseas.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  for  Matavera  for  his  last 

speech.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  PERI  V.  PARE:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Because  I  was  looking  at  the 

breadfuit  that  is  falling  on  the  ground  and  rotting  away  and  the  Department  of 

Agriculture never even take any concern about these produce.    When  I was at  the 

flee market in Otara, South Auckland, they have breadfruit, they have kape and other 

produce and makes me wonder how come these people are able to send theirs to New 

Zealand  and  what  about  us.    Maybe  the  former  Prime  Minister  did  not  support  the 

Minister of Agricuture then to have our produce send to New Zealand.  This is a easy 

fruit for us to pick for the mamas to carry out and for the children because breadfuit 

tree are nowadays are short and easily picked by  the mamas. So for the Minister of 

Agriculture to  look  at  this area so our children  will not  be suffering from  collecting 

the rotten fruits on the ground.   

</span></div><div><span>I would now speak on the starch.  In the shop today we are buying the starch from the 

</span><span>Philippines.  The distant that this starch has travelled. Why can’t we produce the same 

</span><span>here, there again we need support from the government.  When you look at the starch 

</span><span>from the Philippines they are pure white but compared to our one, ours are off-white. 

This is something to do with the people who grow arrowroot here in Rarotonga.  I will 

also  speak  on  the  crop,  yam.    This  is  another  thing  that  it  takes  a  long  time  to  rot 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>85 

</span></div><div><span>away.    This  is  another  crop  on  Mangaia,  Atiu  and  probably  Mauke.    There  is  also 

</span><span>money in this for the people.  When you bring them to Rarotonga, the Rarotonga’s not 

</span><span>use to eating it.  When we export the to New Zealand, there in New Zealand are the 

Atiuan, the Maukean, the Aitutakian and Mangaian and they will like to buy the yam.  

And to the people in the Northern Group island, while you people are eating rice over 

there,  this  is  another  best  alternatives  for  you  the  yam  which  will  not  rot  away 

quickly.  When we talk about taking the standard of our Agriculture work up but the 

money that has been allocated to the department of Agriculture is not able to bring the 

standard up.  Maybe the Government did not consider these things as important in our 

country.  So therefore we cannot even show the support that we ought to give when 

we talk about Agriculture as being the backbone of our country.  Therefore, I would 

there say Mr Chairman that the most important thing that I would like at this time is to 

remind the Minister responsible for the lab to be utilised. Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  I  call  on  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman I stand in total support 

</span><span>of the Vote allocation for Agriculture.   I would like to  advice the Members that are 

</span><span>sort  of  critical  about  in  the  view  the  low  allocation  of  these  budget  items  because  I 

want to tell you my experience when we were working on the budget it was 2 weeks 

of really intensive work, the heads of each Ministry was present.    

</span></div><div><span>What  is  remarkable  is  in  fact  they  get  everything  they  ask  for.    All  their  Budget 

requests  were  agreed  to.    We  cross-examined  some  of  them  why  such  and  such  an 

allocation  is  needed.    The  Heads  of  Ministries  and  their  technical  people  explained. 

We  tried  to  talk  them  down  but  once  we  were  satisfied  that  the  explanations  the 

request  was  upheld.    I  am  sure  these  Heads  of  Ministries  are  listening  and  some  of 

them are probably at P</span><span>arliament.  They got what they wanted so don’t complain that 

the did not get enough they got what they wanted.  You know there is a saying,  “It 

isn’t the size of the dog it is the fight in the dog that matters”.   So it is not the amount 

</span><span>of  money  you  give  them  it  is  the  amount  of  work  the  Ministry  can  do  that  is  more 

important. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, this morning I had the pleasure of welcoming two of our Cook Islands 

men home, Mr Eric Ngau Wichman and Papa Tamataia Pera and these are two very 

important  people  that  </span><span>we  know.    Papa  Tamataia’s  reputation  as  a  very  active 

</span><span>entrepreneur who is always trying his best for his people and he has devoted a lot of 

his time to helping his people year after year, decade after decade and Papa Tamataia 

must be in his sixties now, but he is still full of power and energy and he still strives 

to see if we can send our produce to New Zealand. This young man Eric Wichman he 

</span><span>is in his early 30’s and he has a Q.S.M for work in New Zealand, he is also a young 

</span><span>Justice of the Peace and he is an energetic young man and these are the kind of people 

we should encourage to do things in our community. These two gentlemen come here 

to  meet  up  with  growers  to  see  if  they  can  organise  the  export  to  New  Zealand  of 

maniota, coconuts, taro and any organic produce which is the in thing in New Zealand 

</span><span>and overseas they want things grown without fertilisers. These gentlemen are going to 

</span><span>hold a press conference at my office on Monday morning. They will also meet with 

growers of this country.  I have made available to them my support office and that is 

the Deputy Prime Ministers Office.  I have made this office available because I have 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>86 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>on  contract  a  number  of  people  who  are  able  to  work  in  this  particular  area  of 

motivating the agricultural produce, fishing and other activities.  Mr Chairman I have 

organised  for  facilities  to  be  made  available  for  these  people.    I  have  advised  the 

Agriculture spokesman on the Opposition Side Honourable Robert Wigmore to make 

use of it.  I hope these people will organise a meeting of all growers.  I have spoken to 

the  Minister  of  Agriculture  who  supports  the  move  to  allow  Mr  Pera  and  Mr 

Wichman  to  meet  with  the  Growers  of  the  island.    So  when  you  my  friends  in  the 

Opposition are critical about the allocation for my office it will be worthwhile.  The 

dollars  allocated  will  be  worthwhile.    Please  do  not  expect  results  before  we  do  the 

work.  We have to do some work to get results. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your second speech Mr Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>  And  of  course,  Mr  Chairman,  I  have  to  emphasize  to  these 

gentlemen what is very important at this end is to set up a good person to supervise 

the purchase of the produce. Arrange shipping and packaging and make sure money is 

available  to  pay  the  growers  each  time  they  sell  to  the  Group.  Mr  Chairman,  the 

classic fault of this country in the past is the lack of tenacity. The lack of spirit and 

</span><span>tenacity.  We all get excited for about one or two months and then everything flops.  

</span><span>What are needed are people with commitment instead of rushing to get this going to 

set it up carefully so that once it is in operation it must go on and on and not fluctuate.   

</span></div><div><span>Look at the humble coconut. There is huge amount of coconuts lying around. We are 

not touching it and we are not processing it. What they are saying is that they could 

buy  all our coconuts  but  they must be husked and shipped to  New  Zealand because 

they have access to a coconut cream manufacturer who cannot get any supplies from 

Samoa. He has set up a plant to process coconut cream in Samoa but Samoa cannot 

supply. 

</span></div><div><span>What this factory does in New Zealand actually is to make fresh coconut cream about 

three  times  a  week  for  distribution  in  large  bulk  quantities  to  restaurants  all  over 

</span><span>Auckland.    Right  now  they  can’t  keep  up  with  the  demands  bec</span><span>ause  fresh  coconut 

cream has a life of four to five days.  They have to keep making them because of the 

short shelf life of coconut cream.  So there we are, we have a market for the coconuts 

that are sitting there.  I think if we organise it, if this group of people organise it, there 

should  be  two  containers  of  coconuts  going  on  every  ship  that  is  going  back  empty 

every month of the year and indeed when I heard my cousin, the Member for Mauke 

talk about the need for regular shipping services, I endorsed his remarks.  We should 

</span><span>sit  down  with  the  owners  of  the  Forum  Tokelau  to  make  sure  that  there’s  a  set 

</span><span>schedule of that ship going to Mangaia, Atiu, Mauke and the Northern Group in the 

future.  Because the people of Mangaia and Atiu were let down by the Triad Group 

when we first brought the Ngamaru into the Cook Islands over ten years ago.  It was 

meant to cover Atiu and Mangaia.  They failed us completely. 

</span></div><div><span>So  we  ask  the  Minister  of  Shipping  to  arrange  a  meeting  for  us  Members  of 

Parliament from those islands, from Ngaputoro </span><span>–</span><span> who knows there might be a chance 

</span><span>to also call at Mitiaro if they can put a container full of produce from that island. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  if  firm  schedules  are  established  on  these  islands  the  growers  will 

produce  in  accordance  with  that  schedule.    They  will  have  the  stuff  ready  well  in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>87 

</span></div><div><span>advance  before  the  ship  arrives  so  it  needs  some  simple  co-ordination.    We  are 

looking forward to it.  I am quite sure that the people of Mangaia and the people of 

Ngaputoro are looking forward to this arrangement, so Minister of Shipping, you are 

on call. 

</span></div><div><span>Recently,  Mr  Chairman,  when  I  was  in  Auckland  I  raised  this  matter  up  with  our 

Consul General, Bill Teariki.  He has expressed his willingness to support the export 

of our produce.  He said they had a very successful network of distributing taro and 

other produce around New Zealand but that was subsequently taken over and ruined 

by the entrepreneurs.  So there is also a large boardroom at the Cook Islands Office 

</span><span>there.  There’s a computer and telephone facili</span><span>ties.  I see no reason why our exporters 

cannot  set  up  an  office  there  to  help  facilitate  our  exports.    I  am  quite  sure  the 

Honourable  Member,  Teina  Bishop  would  be  delighted  to  know  that  such  excellent 

facilities are already there in place. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your last speech Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span> I might as well finish it for the day.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  

</span><span>It  will  be  my  third  and  last.  The  others  can  carry  on  next  sitting.  In  other  words,  I 

</span><span>don’t intend to complete my total ten minutes or </span><span>continue with it on Monday. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  there’s  also  the  area    </span><span>-  I  think  the  Honourable  Member  for  Matavera 

raised it - </span><span>of vacuum packed frozen taro.  Our taro is the best in the world.  It’s a black 

</span><span>diamond and the new concept for taro export is to vacuum pack them in nice packets 

of differing weights.  That has been done I believe.  Fiji is exporting their taro in that 

manner.  It is processed, frozen and straight into the supermarket freezers.  I think the 

gentleman  that  started  a  similar  one  a  few  years  ago  went  wrong  because  he  was 

aiming  for  the  cooler  display  counters  in  supermarkets.    He  ignored  the  frozen 

compartment.    Mr  Chairman,  frozen  taro  can  be  kept  in  the  deep  freeze  for  years 

without deterioration.  You cook it and it looks as though  you have taken it out  the 

day before.  The quality remains with it as long as it stays in the deep freeze. 

</span></div><div><span>We have a friend that is planning to go to California shortly to look at the American 

</span><span>market.   As  you know, in California there’s a big Polynesian market</span><span> because of the 

huge concentration of Samoans and Tongans there.  He will attempt to get a contract 

from  one  of  the  major  food  companies  on  the  West  Coast  of  America  to  secure  a 

market for our taro products and do it on a big long term basis where such companies 

will  assist  to  set  up  processing  factories  for  freezing  them  here  in  the  Cook  Islands 

and  offer  standards  to  match  the  American  health  requirements.    The  Coalition 

Government  will  encourage  this  work  to  be  done  and  if  it  gets  off  the  ground  there 

will be exciting opportunities for the people of Rarotonga and the other taro producing 

islands  of  Mangaia,  Atiu  and  Mauke  and  Aitutaki  to  get  involved.    One  of  the 

advantages of processing or freezing our taro is that if it breaks in half when you are 

pulli</span><span>ng it out you can trim it, slice it up or if there’s a rotten part at the bottom you can 

</span><span>cut the rotten part off and still use the good part. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> It is time to stop, excuse me. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>88 

</span></div><div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I conclude by saying that there are exciting times 

ahead  for  our  Agriculture  industry.    There  are  challenging  times  ahead.    Before  I 

conclude, may I wish all Honourable Members a very pleasant weekend. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> I call on the Minister in Charge of the Vote.
