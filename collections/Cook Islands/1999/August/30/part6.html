</span></div><div><span>Here we are talking about the Agriculture Budget but when he sent his boat out to Pukapuka he 

sent food and liquor.  I think, together with the Honourable member for Akatokamanava, you 

too should come and  share in some serious discussions with me.  I wo</span><span>uldn’t want us to indulge 

</span><span>in  bruising  future  encounters,  particularly  the  Opposition  Members  less  the  Honourable 

Member, Ngamau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Honourable Member from Vaipeka, Vaipae and Tautu </span><span>–</span><span> I really liked your thoughts and 

your speech, likewise the M</span><span>ember from Akaoa but I didn’t like what I heard  earlier on.  They 

</span><span>were saying that the  new guns should not be influenced by the old guns.  Nevertheless, I want 

you  to  remember  that  I  am  your  Uncle  Joe.    Maybe  you  should  come  with  the  other  two 

Members I invited  to have a serious discussion with me. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  A Point of Order has been raised.   

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  The Honourable Prime Minister has been irrelevant since he got up.  He 

</span><span>hasn’t mentioned anything</span><span> to do with the vote on Agriculture.  He is totally irrelevant. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Yes,  the  Prime  Minister  is  speaking 

under the guise of </span><span>aroa</span><span>, greeting the people.  But it is a bit protracted, a bit too long. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Come back to the Agriculture vote. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Yes please.  Carry on with your Greetings but  not for too long.  Come 

back to the Vote. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  I agree Mr Chairman.  The Point of Order is right.  I was waiting 

for someone to call for a Point </span><span>of Order but I didn’t expect  this Honourable Member to call it.  

</span><span>And he was one of those people who have been irrelevant all these past years 

</span></div><div><span>Never mind, Mr Chairman, coming back to the Budget.  If you look on page 3 of the Budget, 

the  specification  of  </span><span>Goal  1.    It  states  there,  “Goal  1  is  to  increase  Agriculture  production  for 

</span><span>export  and  domestic  trade  by  $11  million  over  the  next  four  years.”    That’s  the  type  of 

</span><span>statement  that  we  want  to  see.    In  Agriculture,  and  indeed  in  any  economic  development 

proje</span><span>ct, it’s very positive.  It specifies the amount and the deadline.  Remember, Mr Chairman, 

</span><span>I did  state the other day that a goal  is  a dream  with  a deadline.  A dream  with  a deadline.   I 

admire the statement by the Minister of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Your second speech Prime Minister.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  The Minister of Finance stated that he  would  have liked to  have 

</span><span>given more money beyond the $608,000 specified and in his mind this probably not enough.  I 

</span><span>tend  to  agree  with  that  statement,  but  nevertheless  Agriculture  has  specified  a  goal  of  $11 

million in four years generated from export as well as domestic trade.  He also stated the need 

to produce high quality produce for export.  I quite agree with this expression because if we are 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>106 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>to  export  our  Agricultural  produce  it  must  be  of  the  highest  quality.    We  need  to  be  able  to 

compete  with  other  countries.    The  member  for  Arutanga,  Reureu  and  Nikaupara,  the 

Honourable Teina Bishop knows because he is a businessman and he does export produce on 

behalf  of  his  fellow  constituents  to  New  Zealand.    Likewise  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Titikaveka, the Honourable Member Robert Wigmore because he has been exporting right from 

the  word  go,  in  our  export  trade.    He  would  be  the  one  that  would  specify  the  need  for  the 

highest quality produce for export for our country.  

</span></div><div><span>As  I  listened  to  the  various  Members  Mr  Chairman,  it  sounded  like  the  statement  of  an 

Agriculture survey in this House. It sounded like  expressing what the needs are on each island.  

This I think is what we should be looking at. Each and every Member must come to this House 

and say this is what Rakahanga needs, this is what Mauke needs, this is what Aitutaki needs.  

The  Member for Mauke has stated that the women folk go out to the Makatea and labour to get 

the </span><span>maire</span><span>, at a measly price of $4.00 for a string of ei.  The Agriculture and Government should 

look at this.   You also stated that pineapple is being grown and one grower through a ¼ of acre 

had  earned  himself  a  pickup.    This  is  an  expression  by  the  Member  who  plant    pineapples.  

Pineapple  is  a  crop  that  we  should  concentrate  on  in  Mauke.    He  also  stated  that  the  </span><span>mario</span><span>

bananas grow well in Mauke and converted into </span><span>“piere</span><span>” it last a long time and t</span><span>his would be 

the  bases  of  another  industry  for  Mauke.    On  the  protein  side,  he  specified  goat  meat.    Goat 

meat could be another Agriculture industry for Mauke.  The Member for Rakahanga again is 

crying out for the need for us to utilise coconuts.  The old too  forgotten coconuts.  There is a 

team on the island now who are looking at taking coconuts to New Zealand and processing it in 

New Zealand.  The person organising this is one of our own countryman Tamataia Pera.  He is 

trying to organise this to make sure that this particular commodity is utilised.  I will arrange a 

meeting between the Member for Rakahanga and Tamataia Pera and his team.  He has brought 

with him expatriates.   

</span></div><div><span>I listened to the Minister of Agriculture speaking about the need to produce other crops instead 

of the pawpaws alone.  And this was echoed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the 

need to diversify, rather than sticking to the pawpaws, the </span><span>taro</span><span>, the arrowroot.  Diversify and 

have  a  look  at  other  crops  that  we  could  use  for  the  export  trade.    I  listened  to  the  Minister 

talking  about  possibilities  of  opening  up  other  markets  in  Australia,  Canada  and  other 

countries.    He  talked  about  the  possibility  of  utilising  Canada  3000  to  open  up  a  market  in 

</span><span>Canada.  Oddly, the day he made the statement I had a telephone conversation with the owner 

</span><span>of Canada 3000.  One of the subjects we talked about was the opening up of markets in Canada 

for our pawpaw.  But the main reason why he rang was to see if this Government could assist 

Canada 300</span><span>0 in picking up more passengers from Australia.  At the moment it’s restricted to 

</span><span>60.  From Australia they need to  bring a capacity load here and then over on to Canada.  Now 

the Minister has stated in this House the need to open up that market in Canada. We will make 

sure  that  this  gentleman  has  contact  with  our  Minister  of  Agriculture.    He  also  spoke  about 

increasing production on crops like eggplant. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Excuse me, your last speaking time Prime Minister.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>107 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR.  J.  WILLIAMS:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    He  spoke  about  the  need  to  export 

other crops like eggplants, chilli, beans, capsicum, lemon etc.  Thus highlighting even more the 

point of diversification.    

</span></div><div><span>You  know  Mr  Chairman,  I  remember  the  days  when  a  lot  of  us  here,  sitting  in  this  House 

exported capsicum, a lot of it.  Exporting beans, eggplants and  other products. I remember the 

Leader of the Opposition was one of the big time exporters of capsicum.  I tried to match his 

</span><span>record  at  that  time  but  I  couldn’t.    But  these</span><span>  are  areas  that  we  must  look  at.    I  was  quite 

delighted  with  the  expression  by  the  Member  for  Matavera,  my  friend  over  there  the 

Honourable Vaevae Pare. I say, my friend because you and I have been friends for a long time,  

-  if  our  friendship  is  to  be  closer  I  think  only  10  steps  will  mean  a  whole  lot  more.    He  has 

spoke about flowers, harvesting flowers extracting from it the essences.  From the orange peels, 

extracting oil that could be used for export and for local use in perfumes and other cosmetic.    

He spoke about  yam.  These are some of the things that we should be looking at.  You know 

</span><span>when  you  go into the market  in  New Zealand  you don’t see any  yam  form  the Cook islands, 

</span><span>you see them from Tonga.  Other speakers has spoken about the </span><span>nono</span><span>, marinda citrafolia (??) as 

the Member for Manihiki stated.  This has been used not only in Manihiki but in all the islands 

throughout all of Polynesia and Asia for generations.  I noticed the Minister of Agriculture has 

highlighted the </span><span>nono</span><span>.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, this could be one of our biggest Agricultural export.  Somebody in this House 

said they grow without fertilising it. It will grow naturally,  organically grown. Mr Chairman, 

</span><span>the Asian market is huge.  It is big and I don’t know there is no way we can fill it.   A</span><span>s far as 

the </span><span>nono</span><span> is  concerned organically  grown  </span><span>nono</span><span> could  carry quite  an important  element to  our 

export.      As  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  said,  crops    organically  grown  goes  down  well  with 

buyers  in  other  parts  of  the  world  where  there  are  contamination  -  plus,  plus,  plus.    As  the 

Member  Dr  Robert  Woonton  said  not  quite  rightly,  not  genetically  or  bio-genetically 

engineered.  And I hope that the Growers will not resort to fertilising  </span><span>nono</span><span> because once you 

fertilise  </span><span>nono</span><span>  you  lose  that  organically  grown  label.    And  once  you  spray  it,  it  does  need 

spraying, but  ones  you spray it  you also  lose that  organically  grown label.   There are natural 

manure which can be used.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  the  market  overseas  in  Asia  alone  is  huge  and  we  in  this  country  can  never 

</span><span>produce  enough  to  satisfy  that  market.    We  should  develop  it  further  and  get  the  experts  to 

</span><span>come in and have a look at the possibility of producing tablets, not just liquid nono.  So that it 

becomes more palatable to the consumer.  A word of warning to the Growers of </span><span>nono</span><span> and to 

our local people.  Because of the economic possibility of </span><span>nono</span><span> people will come here and try 

and commandeer the market.  Mr Chairman, I  end by  warning our people, not to give away 

the potential to marketing </span><span>nono</span><span> to anyone outside our country, we can do it ourselves. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  The Minister of Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, firstly as Minister responsible for the Agriculture Vote I 

</span><span>am very happy to acknowledge all the Members who have spoken on this vote item. Thank you 

for  the  proposals  and  the  ideas  on    ways  to  upgrade  and  better  the  Agriculture  Department.  

Agriculture throughout all the years has always been a very popular vote item for debate in this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>108 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>House. And certainly, this year is no exception and knowing what has been said in this House 

makes  me  very  happy  to  accept  them  and  take  them  for  further  consideration  for  the 

development of Agriculture in this country. 

</span></div><div><span>Just before I round up Mr Chairman, may I say Kia Orana to you and to all the Members of this 

House.  To our people listening in, especially on Rarotonga and our Outer Islands, Kia Orana.  

May I also, through you Mr Chairman, express a word of condolences to the family in Tupapa  

who lost their loved one. And the apologies of the Honourable Tangata Vavia who is a member 

of the bereaved family.  We have the passing away last Saturday of Putiare of Mitiaro.   He is 

</span><span>to  be    buried  in  Tupapa    at  3  o’clock  this  afternoon.    Through  you  Mr  Chairman,  we  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Members  of  the  House  extend  our  condolences  especially  to  Ngatapu  and  Papa 

Timi where the old man has been staying for the past couple of years.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  give  my  acknowledgement  to  the  staff  of  Agriculture  especially  the 

Secretary of Agriculture, Mark Bro</span><span>wn and his staff for their efforts.   They’ve performed well 

</span><span>managing in this Ministry in the last couple of months.  Regardless of the transition of some of 

the staff and the privatisation of some of the divisions of Agriculture they managed to maintain 

the wheels of the Ministry turning very well.  For the information of the Honourable Members, 

of the $118,000 increase of the Budget for 1999/2000, over half of that is going to the payment 

of  overtime  for  our  quarantine  officers  at  the  Airport.    As  was  rightly  expressed  by  the 

Honourable Members of this House this division of Agriculture,  which is quarantine is a very 

important    division  to  the  safety  of  our  country  especially  with  regard  to  pests  and  insects 

coming  from  overseas.   I  was briefed this morning by the HOM of one  very important  thing 

going on in Agriculture.  This is the prohibition of the import of cats from Australia.  We have 

been informed that there is a virus carried by  domesticated cats that can kill human beings.  So 

Australia  has  issued  an  exportation  order  stopping  cats  from  being  exported  from  Australia.  

Likewise  our  quarantine  has  also  endorsed  the  prohibition  of  importation  of  cats  from 

Australia.   

</span></div><div><span>We    have  still  not  mastered  the  control  of  white  fly  in  our  country  but  we  have  local  people 

who  have  been  trained  overseas  and  are  working  in  our  laboratory  at  the  Totokoitu  Station 

searching for a natural plant that can counter the white fly insect in our country.  At this stage I 

would  like  to  acknowledge  the  German  support  and  the  secondment  to  our  country  of  a 

</span><span>scientist on plants, - an Entomologist, who has been here  for one term already and has agreed 

</span><span>to extend her term for another year.  I am very happy to hear the words of all the  Honourable 

Members but the point is there is so much to do and we have little resources to accommodate 

the things that we want.  Yes, we will be looking at restructuring the Agriculture Department. 

Looking at our aims and goals we will make  changes if possible to improve Agriculture in the 

coming year. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  re-echo  the  sentiments  of  the  Honourable  Members  on  the  importance  of  re-

diversifying our efforts to include products other than the ones we have been concentrating on 

</span><span>for  the  last  few  years.  I  am  very  happy  to  hear  the  Honourable  Tapi  mention  about  copra  - 

</span><span>supported by the Honourable Member for Rakahanga, Papa Pupuke.  In fact I would submit a  

plead to them to ensure that this project gets off the ground because for the Northern Group this 

is one sure means of getting money into their hands.  If you need any assistance, any support 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>109 

</span></div><div><span>from the Agriculture Department please do feel free to come and talk with us or the workers at 

the Agriculture.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  support  the  sentiments  of  the  Member  for  Tautu  and  Vaipae  that  some  of  the 

Workshops should be held in the Outer Island.  I would encourage you or all the Outer Islands 

Members to feel free to go and meet with the Agriculture offices and express your concerns.  If  

</span><span>nothing is  done, come and see me.  We’ll see something is done.</span></div><div><span>I feel obliged to support the concern of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Dr Woonton in 

emphasising the need to do something about the brain. As he said, the only doctorate we ever 

</span><span>produced in this country comes from Agriculture.  I’m sorry, I need to be corrected.</span><span>  We have 

two other, doctorates in other fields.  But we can assure this House that Agriculture is one of 

the  services  that  has  produced  qualified  workers  throughout  these  years.    We  have  at  the 

present  in  the  Agriculture  four  personnel  with  a  Masters  Degree  in  Agricultural  Science.  

Basically half of them  are still working and some have left after having attended some sort of 

tertiary education. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like    to    support    the  concerns  of  the  Honourable  Albert  Nicholas  in  also  asking  the 

Growers  Association  to  start  doing  something  about  their  own  Members.  I  understand  they 

have a very large amount of money banked in their account.  For the last four years this is the 

lowest that the pawpaw price has gone down, 40 to 50 cents a kilo and yet at the same time the 

demand for the pawpaw in New Zealand has gone up 200 per cent. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Quality. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>So I couldn’t see the correlation of the demand going up and the price 

</span><span>going down.  I have made enquiries and this morning I have been briefed that there are other 

countries  exporting  pawpaws  to  the  market  in  New  Zealand.    Such  as  the  Tongan  pawpaws,  

the  Fijian  pawpaws    and  the  Hawaiian  pawpaws.  Although  the  variety  of  these  pawpaws  are  

not the same.  We have the Manavaroa type which is one of the best pawpaw in the Pacific but 

</span><span>we couldn’t compete with the price that is being entertained by these pawpaws from these other 

</span><span>three countries.  So it all boils down to quality from now on. 

</span></div><div><span>Having a few more minutes to go, Mr Chairman, just to sum it up.  If we want to get something 

</span><span>out  of what  we export we are looking at  two types of marketing.  Macro and micro.   I don’t 

</span><span>think we can ever supply the macro marketing.  The only product that can take us closer to that 

is  </span><span>nono</span><span>–</span><span> miranda  citrifolia that  we  can produce here.  It   will have to  be micro because Fiji, 

Tonga and  Samoa are sending containers after containers of what we can produce over here.  

So we have to carefully go out there and look at the type of markets, the people involved, the 

consumers and so on in order for us to prepare our marketing to whoever can give us the best 

price. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly,  Mr  Chairman,  let  me  thank  all  the  Growers  in  the  Cook  Islands,  especially  on 

</span><span>Rarotonga.  Let me thank also all the business people in the Cook Islands for doing their best in 

using whatever products  we have on the island.  We are all trying  to make money out of  these 

commodities,  not  only  for  themselves  but  for  the  planters  as  well.    I  would  also  like  to  

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>110 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>acknowledge one other  person, Brian Bartrum  who  sold  me the two bottles of jam on Friday 

last week. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  It is time to stop Minister.  I call on you as Minister in charge of the Vote. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported to Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I now resolve Committee to Parliament.
