<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted Debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $608,576 for Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The last speaker on Friday was the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  I believe you are not 

going to continue with your speech?  I now call for another speaker? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member for Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>DR. P. ROBATI:</span><span> To you Mr Speaker, to all Staff Members and to Honourable Members on 

both sides of the House, the Honourable Members of the Coalition Government and to us on 

</span><span>our side, Kia Orana.  To our people who are  listening in to our debate this afternoon, Greetings 

</span><span>to you all in the Love of our God. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  listened  to  the  various  speeches  and  I  appreciate  the  point  raised  regarding  the 

exportation of our crops we grow in the Southern Group to the Northern Group.  With the 

abundance of seafood in the North, like </span><span>Paua</span><span> and fish, we could reciprocate by marketing 

our marine products to the Southern Group islands.  Mr Speaker, I would suggest that for 

the people of Rakahanga I do not think they would want the </span><span>taro</span><span> sent to them because they 

would end up consuming these in a day.  What they would like are </span><span>taro</span><span> shoots and banana 

</span><span>shoots for planting.  I have discussed this matter with the former Minister of Agriculture, 

</span><span>Vaine  Tairea.    The  possibility  of  sending  </span><span>taro</span><span>  and  banana  shoots  to  Rakahanga  was 

thoroughly discussed with him but  at that time  the soil was still suffering from the effects 

of  salt  water.    Now  is  the  right  time.  If  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  could  send  </span><span>taro</span><span>  and 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>90 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>banana shoots to Rakahanga, it will be a great benefit to us.   I  suggest to the Minister to 

ensure that the shoots they send to Rakahanga are disease free.  I also wish to extend my 

thanks to the former Minister of Agriculture who was very supportive of the move to send 

</span><span>taro</span><span>  and  banana  shoots  to  Rakahanga.  Unfortunately  he  is  not  here  today  with  us.    I 

appreciate the initiatives so far from the Ministry of Agriculture but  I support the views of 

the  Assistant  Minister  of  Agriculture  in  his  speech  when  he  said  that  maybe  we  are 

wasting the  appropriation  for Agriculture  because they  are not  conducting the kinds of 

activities we usually have in  the past in  this  Ministry.   If there is  any  further increases  I 

think  that  money  should  be  confined  to  a  certain  number  of  people  including  the 

Honourable Member for Titikaveka, Robert Wigmore, who is doing an excellent job. He 

should be given some money to help him with his programme on the Radio. 

</span></div><div><span>Danny  Ma</span><span>taro</span><span>a  who  is  doing  an  excellent  job  on  the  </span><span>nono</span><span>  industry  should  also  be  included.  

He is helping the people of the Northern Group Islands  to bring the </span><span>nono</span><span> over for production. 

The same should be extended to the Honourable Member, Tapi Taio.  He has been very helpful 

to the people in the Outer Islands.  At the time when the copra production was in progress the 

Government was not helping the people.  This Honourable Member  was the one who was there  

to  assist  the  people  export  their  copra  to  Samoa.    This  also  includes  the  </span><span>nono</span><span>.    His  boat  has 

been very helpful in bringing the </span><span>nono</span><span> from Rakahanga to Rarotonga. Government should be 

concentrating  on  this  area  to  help  these  people  who  are  going  out  of  their  way  to  help  the 

people in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I see that the new Member from Aitutaki is doing an excellent job.  He and his friend Junior 

Maoate  are  doing  quite  well.    If  only  the  former  Members  of  Aitutaki  were  doing  the  same 

thing    Aitutaki  would  be  far  better  off  now.  The  Member  from  Aitutaki  is  interjecting  and 

asking what I have done?  Well I am the one who asked to send a boat and bring the </span><span>nono</span><span> and  

the copra to Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    That  is  your  first  speaking  time.    Do  you  wish  to  carry  on  Honourable 

Member? 

</span></div><div><span>DR. P. ROBATI:</span><span> No thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Well I really cannot answer you back because you were talking about me.  

</span><span>Please  don’t  talk  about  me.    I  can’t  answer  you  back.    I  call  on  the  Honourable  Me</span><span>mber  for 

Vaipae and Tautu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR K. IOANE:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, Greetings to you and to all your staff Members working under 

you.  To all of the Honourable Members in the House </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you. 

</span></div><div><span>I have not much to say Mr Chairman because my other colleagues who have spoken before me 

from Aitutaki  have said most of it.  But there are points  which were not raised Mr Chairman. I 

</span><span>want to comment  on them. 

</span></div><div><span>Even  though  we  are  in    two  different  parties,  I  believe  that  we  are  working  together  for  the 

benefit of all the people of Aitutaki.  When I look at the views of the Honourable Member, Pa 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>91 

</span></div><div><span>Teiti, I feel he will influence his friend next to him.  Because I hear that he is the one who is 

creating a division amongst us. 

</span></div><div><span>I think  the present Minister will serve this Ministry well. In terms of the former Minister,  the 

people  of  Aitutaki  loved  him.    Every  time  he  comes  to  Aitutaki  the  Minister  exerts  all  these 

</span><span>fantastic proposals onto the people but the moment he departs, that’s the end of those ideas. I 

</span><span>trust our present Minister will not repeat that kind of attitude. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I would like to raise a matter with the Minister of Agriculture, in particular, the 

people we send to study abroad for further education.  I would recommend that the experts and 

consultants be seconded to come from  overseas.  They should come to Aitutaki or the Outer 

islands because if we send one person to  study overseas, then most of his knowledge will be 

restricted to him. Whereas if we have a consultant from abroad then more people will gain from 

him.  I  recall  some  years  back  when  the  officers  from  the  Agriculture  Department  came  to 

Aitutaki  for the purpose of setting up piggeries, raising chicken, and grafting, a lot of people 

learnt after those sessions.  But the only problem which hindered the progress of the work was 

the cost of the pig and the chicken feed.  These are very expensive.  I know, Mr Chairman, that 

there  are  young  people  in  my  constituency  who  are  very  good  at  market  gardening.  The 

knowledge  they  gained  from  those  workshops  served  them  well.    Mr  Chairman,  if  there  is  a 

workshop  similar  to  what  was  done  in  those  days,  we  may  have  a  lot  more  people  planting 

vegetables. 

</span></div><div><span>This is what I wish to raise Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  for  the  next  speaker.    The 

Honourable Member, Ngamau Munokoa, Member for Nikao-Panama. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Greetings to you Mr Chairman, the Clerk and to all the staff  Members 

working  in  Parliament.    To  the  Prime  Minister,  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet 

Ministers,  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  and  all 

Honourable Members in Parliament, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Listening to  all the debates  I trust  that  the Minister of Agriculture is  taking these to heart.   I 

</span><span>believe, Mr Chairman, I hope that he will put them all together and make use of them.  There 

</span><span>are    a  lot  of  Agriculture  staff  members  who  were  transitioned.    Some  who  used  to  train  and 

assist our people in market gardening and educational activities have left.  One of them now is 

the  MOID  Administrator.    Because  I  understand,  Mr  Kato  Tama  is  an  excellent  teacher  in 

helping  the  Growers.    The  other  one  is  Taukea  Pokoati,  David  Greig  my  brother-in-law,  Bill 

Hosking Jnr and so  on.  They have been working for Agriculture for many  years.  These are 

some people whom you could call upon to assist you with the development of our Ministry of 

Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>We  want  to  encourage  people  to  plant  crops,  which  will  be  of  benefit  to  us  to  be  cultivated. 

</span><span>And in this House, let us conduct our businesses properly rather than politicising it.  There are  

young  people  among  our  younger  generation  today  who  are  now  enthusiastic  in  their 

Agricultural activities. Some old hands in Agriculture  are still working away.  I also appreciate 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>92 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the  contributions  made  by  the  Honourable  Member  Robert  Wigmore  every  Saturday.    The 

advice  he is giving our people on how to use the chemicals  and  fertilizers are of great value to 

a  lot  of  them.  Some  people  are  reaping  the  benefits  while  others  are  trying  to  get  out  of  the 

shortfalls.  We  have  experienced  that  in  the  past  few  months  our  pawpaw  suffered  drastically 

from the heavy rains. The Minister said that the pawpaw seedlings are now available from the 

DSIR in Titikaveka but if you are not able to buy some for you try and sow some seeds for you 

to grow. 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to the </span><span>nono</span><span>, the Honourable Member Albert Nicholas and  Papa Man Browne are 

planting pawpaw as well as  </span><span>nono</span><span>.  They are the people that I know who are  </span><span>nono</span><span> producers. 

</span></div><div><span>With the </span><span>taro</span><span>, we also heard that the </span><span>taro </span><span>is now affected by a plight and we need to sort out 

our shoots to continue planting. What we sow is what we reap.  So we ought to work together 

for our own benefit.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I call for another speaker. I recognise the 

Honourable Member for Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  TAIO:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  Kia  Orana  to  you  and  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime 

Minister, to all Honourable Members, Greetings to you this afternoon.  To our people who are 

listening in, Greetings to you all this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  on  behalf  of  my  district  of  Puaikura.  It  is  public  knowledge  that  Puaikura  has  been  a 

strong  district  for  Agriculture.    Today  the  number  of  people  involved  in  this  activity  has 

declined  dramatically.    More  people  are    now  planting  for  home  consumption  and  less  for 

export. In the  past, Arorangi had the most pawpaw Growers.  But today there are only about 5 

who are planting pawpaw for export.  I contacted  some of these people to find out what seems 

to be the problem.  Maybe the problem is in New Zealand, maybe the problem is on the plant or 

the quality of the soil. I was told that the pawpaw treatment at the airport is the biggest concern. 

When  the  plant  was  privatised,  it  developed  into  a  predicament  for  the  pawpaw  Growers  of 

Puaikura.  Not because of the treatment but because of the charges imposed onto the Growers. 

They are charging 30c to a kg  of pawpaw, the packers get 20c a kilo, the exporter gets 5c,  Air 

New Zealand has been very kind to the Growers and has reduced the  charged from $1.80 to 

</span><span>90c a kilo,  and the Growers today are getting 40c a kilo.  Mr Chairman, the grower will have 

</span><span>to  look after the  pawpaw to mature for at least 1 year. During that time he has to take care of 

the pests on the pawpaw, to keep it free of weeds, harvest and do everything possible to get to 

the treatment plant.  In the end he will get 40c to a  kilo. Yet the packers will get 20c for less 

than 10 minutes work and the person who treats the pawpaw will get 30c.  What the Growers 

have asked is that if they get 60c per kilo then they will break even.  Obviously, the  40c  they 

are being paid  means that they are losing.  So I would like to ask the Minister to look into this 

because the 40c  they are being paid now is insufficient. Maybe another 20c will be a lot better 

then what they are getting. The pawpaw is exported to New Zealand, the agent handling these 

</span><span>pawpaws  gets  80c  a  kilo.    And  the  auctioneer  who  auction  on  the  market  gets  10%.    It  is 

</span><span>obvious that wherever this product goes, a % is deducted or added on.  It is out of control.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>93 

</span></div><div><span>Why is it that we the Cook Islands want a bag of onions or a bag of potatoes, we have to send 

</span><span>the  money  to  New  Zealand  first?  The  New  Zealand  Growers  don’t  have  to  wait  while  the 

</span><span>pawpaw Growers sometimes have to wait for 1 year before their money gets to them. I looked 

into  this  matter  further  and  found  that  a  company  in  New  Zealand  has  been  bought  out  by 

</span><span>Hawaiian company call “Angie”.  Now Hawaii is sending pawpaws to New Zealand.  This is an 

</span><span>issue  the  Growers  must  be  aware  of.    They  need  to    analyse  how  the  pawpaw    is  marketed 

there, otherwise we will also lose this market as was experienced with our citrus. 

</span></div><div><span>I think first we should have a look here in Rarotonga. Particularly with the  costs that I have 

mentioned earlier.  I think we should adjust these as an incentive to the Growers. 

</span></div><div><span>I come now to our </span><span>taro</span><span>.  We know that there is a reservoir in Akaoa and we know that the </span><span>taro</span><span>needs water.  So I’m saying why don’t we repair this reservoir? I know that  the complaint we 

</span><span>had with this reservoir was because of the pupae that was found in the water.  I think the </span><span>taro</span><span>

would like this pupae.   

</span></div><div><span>So I would like to ask the Government of today to look into this area because if we want to help 

the  Growers  of  this  country  we  should  be  looking  at  this  reservoir.    If  we  were  to  go  to  the 

market and try to compete with the Fiji </span><span>taro</span><span>at a $1 a kilo, I’m certain that the grower here will 

</span><span>not sell their </span><span>taro</span><span> for less than a $1.50 per kilo.  So I would like to ask the Growers listening in 

to  this debate to   look  at the figures first  because it will be very very hard for us to compete 

with the produce from other sources. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    It  is  now  the  end  of  your  speaking  time,  would  you  like    to  continue 

speaking?  You can continue speaking, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:</span><span>  I would like to ask that the reservoir in Akaoa be revived.  Because there are a 

big pieces of land in Puaikura that are not planted today. Maybe we can revive the </span><span>taro</span><span> planting 

on dry land if we get the water.  I would like to thank the Growers who are planting cabbages, 

carrots, lettuces and other vegetables. In the past we used to bring these vegetables from New 

Zealand.  This reservoir will be an excellent project during the dry seasons.  I know we are still 

importing  vegetables from New Zealand.  

</span></div><div><span>If  we  are  able  to  fix  this  reservoir  it  will  be  there  to  help  you  the  vegetable  Growers  and 

</span><span>Growers of other produce.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to move to the Outer Islands and speak on the issue of copra.  In the time that I 

tried to revive the copra industry the people on the Islands of Aitutaki, Palmerston, Nassau and 

Rakahanga worked hard.  From the time that I tried to revive the industry to the time that I left 

there had been over two hundred tons of copra exported.  The reason that this was stopped on 

25</span><span>th</span><span> September 1997 was because I received a letter from the mill in Samoa informing me that 

they  had  increased  the  levy  on  copra  by  35%.    So  this  is  an  area  that  Government  could  get 

</span><span>involved and negotiate with Samoa to  try and lower this tariff.  After studying some records on 

</span><span>the copra industry I have found in the past there were times when over 100 tons of copra was 

produced  every  two  months.    Although  this  may  not  seem  a  large  amount  of  money,    to  the 

people who export copra it is substantial.  Now we have a market in Fiji. To the people in the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>94 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>copra  industry  I  would  like  to  tell  you  that  it  won’t  be  long  before  we  kick  start  the  copra 

</span><span>industry  again.    The  price  of  the  copra  will  basically  be  the  same  as  before  with  a  minor 

increase    So  I  would  like  to  encourage  the  people  in  the  copra  industry  in  the  Outer  Islands.  

That is all  I  would like to say, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The 

Honourable Member for Avatiu-Ruatonga 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span> Kia Orana to all of us in the name of our Lord. Mr Chairman, to you and 

to your staff, the Members in the Opposition, as well as the Government Members, Kia Orana.  

Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  all  the 

Members in the name of Our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>The first point I would like to raise is to give my support to the Minister of Agriculture who has 

been  given  this  responsibility  for  the  next  five  years.    It  is  up  to  him  to  look  into  our 

Agricultural activities. I support the vote requested by the Ministry of Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>I  come  back  to  the  subject  of  pawpaw.    I  was  a  pawpaw  grower  at  the  time  when  pawpaws 

were sent to Turners &amp; Growers.  In those days when we exported, a number will be attached to 

the cartons of the  pawpaws. That will signify who the grower is.  If the quality of the  pawpaw 

in the cartons are high, it will reflect the number, hence the grower.  It was an excellent system.  

The saddest part in those days was that if your number was really bad you ended up having to 

pay instead of collecting money for your pawpaws.  I know there were a lot of Growers at the 

time who were caught because of the quality control measures in those days. When Mr Tatuava  

started  his  marketing  service  there  were  a  lot  of  Growers  who  went  to  him  to  send  their 

pawpaws overseas.  The reason was that he would give a set price of $1.10 per kilo.  So all the 

Growers went to him and the system worked at the time.   

</span></div><div><span>I  will  come  back  now  to  the  present  situation  as  highlighted  by  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Akaoa, Tapi Taio.  Today we hear stories of the fluctuations in the price for pawpaw. Some get 

30  cents  a  kilo  and  others  40  cents,  and  at  one  stage  $2.90  per  kilo.    In  the  last  three  weeks 

there has been  a demand for pawpaws  from  the New  Zealand market  but  the supply was not 

enough.  Now the Growers are supplying the market but are still only getting 40 cents a kilo 

</span><span>and I cannot figure that one out.  I would like to ask the Minister of Agriculture to look into this 

</span><span>matter and find out from the Nita Growers Association exactly what the situation is.  Because I 

believe today there is a Rarotonga Pawpaw Growers Association and I also understand there is 

a  reserve  fund  somewhere  to  assist  the  export  of  pawpaw.    In  the  past  the  Government  has 

found it difficult to step in and offer assistance.  I believe the new Minister who has been given 

this  responsibility  will  be  a  hard  working  Minister  because  he  is  also  a  grower  himself.    He 

knows how hard it is to be a grower and I hope he will talk to those people in this Association. 

</span></div><div><span>We were told earlier on Mr Chairman, that there are a number of deductions from the price paid 

</span><span>for our pawpaw.  The returns to the Growers have been fluctating so much. I have two points 

</span><span>here  which I think will assist the Growers. I can remember a meeting held for Growers in the 

past  and  I  was  at  that  meeting.  I  am  a  pawpaw  grower  of  Rarotonga.    I  suggested  in  that 

</span><span>meeting that the Grower’s Marketing company should buy the pawpaws from the Growers at 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>95 

</span></div><div><span>$1.10.  A $1.10 goes i</span><span>nto the Growers’ pocket and after that it is up to the marketing company 

</span><span>to add on his costs, but this idea was not supported.  Another point I raised in the same meeting 

was that  the Association could buy a container of fertiliser and all these ideas were to try and 

assist the Growers and not necessarily to assist the business people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>This will be your second speech Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span> I am pleased Mr Chairman, with the new Minister because I am certain 

he will help the Growers on the island of Rarotonga and those in the Outer Islands. I was also 

happy  to  hear  from  him  last  week  when  he  told  us  that  beans  and  eggplants  are  now    being 

exported because this country has exported beans in the past but up to about ten years ago the 

export of beans stopped. So I would therefore like to ask the Minister to please look into this 

situation because I myself have been involved in this Association for a number of years and I 

am aware of a lot of concerns from this association.  So I hope that he will look into that. In  

regard to the issue of pawpaws I would like to assure all the Growers that the pawpaws you are 

exporting  earn  the  revenue  to  pay  everybody  and  then  you  the  planter    will  be    left  with  40 

cents a kilo. 

</span></div><div><span>I  believe  that  our  present    Minister  will  help  us  in  our  Association  for  the  betterment  of  our 

Growers.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I call for the next speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to  your staff and Kia Orana 

also to Honourable Members in this House. Kia Orana to the people listening in this afternoon.  

A special Greetings Mr Chairman, to our Growers, to our subsistence Growers, people growing 

for home use as well as those who export, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  send  my  Greetings  out  to  the  Democratic-Alliance  team    on  the  island  of 

Pukapuka who are having a wonderful time up there.  I would like to register this matter with  

you,  Mr  Chairman,  that  our  people  are  not  allowed  to  use  the  Peacesat  radio  in  Pukapuka.  

</span><span>They have been banned from using that by Inatio and Honu Ben.  Nevertheless, Mr Chairman, I 

</span><span>still extend to  them a word of Greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>Let  us  refer  to  the  Budget  allocation  we  are  now  debating.  I  get  sick  of  this  demeaning 

statement  that    Agriculture  is  our  backbone.    Today  we  hear  the  Minister  say  that  this  is  the 

backbone of our country.  So  I will ask, Mr Chairman, where is  the Government  policy with 

regard  to  Agriculture?      I  have  been  waiting  for  this  but  I  have  never  been  assured  what  the 

Government policy is for Agriculture.  So I want to know, Mr Chairman, whose policy are they 

going  to  implement?      The  Cook  Islands  Party  policy  or  the  New  Alliance  Party  policy?   

</span><span>Because  the  policy  of  these  two  Parties  does  not  seem  to  be  what  they  promise  during  the 

</span><span>campaign period.   The New Alliance Party  was criticising the Cook Islands Party policy.  But 

when  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  rose  to  speak  he  said  that  Government  is  now  planning, 

Planning what they need to do today.  So I could probably be right to say that there is no policy 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>96 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>which they can implement.  Until I see the day that the policy is laid before this House for the 

people to know, there really is no policy. 

</span></div><div><span>And I have heard that the Cook Islands Party Government said that they will be making some 

developmental plans  in Agriculture.  With that they will set aside some special allocations for   

this Ministry 

 including  Tourism,  Marine  Resources  and  so  on.    Because  I  of  these  views 

scenario,  it  assured  me  that  they  have  copied  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  Manifesto.    But 

when  the  Minister  rose  to  speak  on  Agriculture  and  when  he  said  that  they  are  planning,  it 

</span><span>proved that they don’t have any plans in place. Maybe when he speaks lat</span><span>er on  we will know 

for sure whose policy  they are going to implement.  Either the Cook Islands Party  or the New 

Alliance Party policy. 

</span></div><div><span>I feel disappointed for the Budget allocation for this Ministry which is $700,000.  The emphasis 

on this Budget allocation is Rarotonga.  Maybe the allocation for the Outer Islands Agriculture 

work is included in the MOID Budget because I  heard the Deputy Prime Minister say that this 

is what the Ministry of Agriculture has asked for.  I cannot see any way how they will be able 

to achieve the target of $11 million in the  next four years. 

</span></div><div><span>And they have set down some sectorial goals by having to gain $1 million from one section and 

$2 million in another next section.  This looks like a dream to me Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>In  my  observation  there  are  other  allotments  that  have  been  made  which  are  not  worth  it.    I 

</span><span>don’t see it being a priority. If we are to allocate funds to a sector, then let us be realistic.  If it 

</span><span>is for Agriculture let us make sure that it is enough to  realise their  plans  and their goals. I will 

give  you an example Mr Chairman.    I looked at this Budget  and there  was an allocation for 

</span><span>eight motor vehicles.  I don’t know whether it’s a bus,  a car or a truck. There is also a need  for 

</span><span>30 computers.  Yet I see that there is a lot of  funds for capital expenses, but only $100,000 was 

allocated for the support of Agriculture.  We  have a strange mentality here Mr Chairman. If 

one person wants a computer everybody wants a computer, and if  one person wants a vehicle 

everybody wants a vehicle.  I see this as contagious. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You wish to carry on Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> May I be allowed to give you another scenario Mr Chairman. In the  

</span><span>$700,000 allocated for Agriculture I see that the target is Rarotonga  and for the Outer Islands 

they are included in the MOID Budget.  I  heard the Deputy Prime Minister saying that he will 

</span><span>appoint some people to work in the Ministry of Agriculture. I don’t know whether he had done 

</span><span>so.  The  point  Mr  Chairman  is  that,  if  the  Minister  wants  to  know  what  is  happening  in  the 

Ministry  of  Agriculture    in  the  Outer  Islands  his  best  source  of  information  would  be  the 

</span><span>persons he appointed.  I don’t know whether the other Ministers are also aiming fo</span><span>r the same 

methods in the Outer Islands because their support services in their Ministries have increased 

too.  But if we are to  fully analyse the Agriculture appointments in the Outer Islands we seem 

</span><span>to  be  receiving  two  groups  of  workers.    One  lot  appointed  by  the  Minister  and  another  lot 

</span><span>appointed  by  the  MOID.    The  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has  admitted  the  lot  he    would  like  to 

appoint.  I am just wondering which is the policy we have to abide by.  This is  a very poor way 

of organising our Ministries. We will certainly end up duplicating our functions. What really is 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>97 

</span></div><div><span>the Government  doing about  this mess?  In the past,  the former Minister used to  say that we 

will bring our tourists to Rarotonga, to the Cook Islands and the Growers must plant and raise 

livestock to feed them. I would support the views of the Honourable Members Robert Wigmore 

and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Dr Robert Woonton when they said that this Ministry 

is sick and dead.  

</span></div><div><span>Now I will stop here and concentrate my speech upon the actual Agriculture work.  During the 

last  heavy  rain    we    experienced,  acres  and  acres  of  pawpaw  plantations  were  destroyed  by 

flooding.  I never heard of any assistances from the Government to support the Growers.  This 

</span><span>is  pathetic.    Why  couldn’t  the  Govern</span><span>ment    provide  simple  things  like    pawpaw  seedlings? 

They  lost  so  much.    Our  Government  has  been  able  to  assist  other  countries  who  are  much 

more  wealthier  than  us    and  have  suffered  some  forms  of  disasters.  Yet  we  encountered  a 

similar situation in the Coo</span><span>k islands but the Government couldn’t be bothered.  Maybe because 

</span><span>the pawpaw and the Agriculture activities are now regarded as the responsibilities of the private 

sector. 

</span></div><div><span> MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Excuse me, you wish to carry on, this is your third speaking time, thank 

you.  Carry on please. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:   </span><span>It’s up to them now to decide what they wish to plant.  It’s up to 

them to decide how much will it cost to go into their  ventures.  It’s up to them to plant what 

</span><span>type of crops they want to grow as demanded </span><span>by the market.  It’s up to them to decide which 

market they wish to send their produce to.  The Government’s task should be to find a way to 

</span><span>market our produce. It is the responsibilities of Government to provide advisory services to the 

Growers. The main office on Rarotonga and the Outer Islands have  a crucial role in assisting 

the Growers in the Cook Islands  Marketing is a very important element in this business.  The 

Growers themselves must be involved in negotiating for the best markets. Do not depend on the 

office workers. The latter group should attend schools.  

</span></div><div><span>I’m sorry to say Mr Chairman that the Research Station in Totokoitu is a waste.  This is one of 

</span><span>the most important arm of the Agriculture Department </span><span>–</span><span> Research Station.  Mr Chairman, it is 

inappropriate for the Growers of one country to have their produce assesed  by a research or a 

laboratory in another country.  The soil types, the climates and the plant species of one country 

</span><span>differ  from another. I am disappointed Mr Chairman because we had a lot of potential at this 

</span><span>Station in Totokoitu.  Today, we’ve lost all the different varieties of crops and plants trialed and 

</span><span>tested.  

</span></div><div><span>So we have a big job ahead of us in order to revive this sick patient.  Sometimes when we talk 

about Agriculture we seem to think that Agriculture work is easy.  This is a very difficult job. 

</span><span>And  the  return  from  it  is  often  very  risky.  I  haven’t  heard  of  anybody  who  got  riched  from 

</span><span>Agriculture.   Agriculture is only to assist our domestic livelihoods. It is there to  help support 

you  to  purchase  other  amenities.    Honourable  Members,  I  would  like  to  encourage  us  to  put 

</span><span>planting into better perspectives. Do not be misled into believing that the Growers are getting 

</span><span>rich.  That is not true. I don’t want to see us in our cou</span><span>ntry depend on crops planted by New 

Zealanders to  feed us. The priority is  to  ensure that  we raise our own produce to  support us.  

And if Rakahanga is asking for </span><span>taro</span><span>shoots  let us help them out. If Tapi’s fishing boat goes out 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>98 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>there to fish from the Northern Group to sell locally, so be it. It is important for a country to 

</span><span>have enough food.  There’s one thing I would like to thank the past Government and that is the 

</span><span>policy  to  avoid  imposing  a  levy  on  fertiliser  and  the  animal  feeds  for  the  last  5  years.    We 

should encourage our people in strengthen their positions in their respective ventures. Our job 

over here is to see that Agriculture and  Tourism are developed in balance.  We need sufficient 

supplies of food products to support Tourism as well as our domestic needs. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>   Time to  stop  now Honourable  Leader of the Opposition.   This  sitting is 

</span><span>suspended until 3.00 o’clock.</span></div>
