<div><span>PARLIAMENT IS SUSPENDED 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 3.00 p.m.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Shall we all be seated please.  The sitting is resumed.  The last speaker was 

the Leader of the Opposition, you have 30 seconds.  I will call on the next speaker.  The Deputy 

Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:  </span><span>Greetings to you Mr Chairman and to all Honourable Members and to 

our people listening in, Greetings to you all.  I shall be very brief Mr Chairman.  I would like to 

make some comments regard into the Agriculture Vote. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  sat  here  listening  to  speakers  from  both  sides  of  the  House  regarding  our 

Agriculture with great interest.  I see people with the expertise from both sides of the House.  

You  may  ask  Mr  Chairman,  what  Agriculture  has  to  do  with  the  Northern  Islands?  Let  me 

assure  you  Mr  Chairman,  that  we  are  very  much  interested  in  Agriculture  developments 

including any new ideas that the Department of Agriculture comes up with.  It is obvious why 

we are so keen on Agriculture.  Simply because of the lack of large Agriculture activities in the  

Northern Group. 

</span></div><div><span>I fully sympathise with the Honourable Member from Vaipae, the Honourable Kete Ioane, who 

voiced his concern regarding workshops.  I could not agree more with the Honourable Member 

than to have the experts visit these islands, not so much Rarotonga, but the Outer Islands.  They 

</span><span>need to have Workshops so that they can teach them basic Agricultural skills.  We have many 

</span><span>of our young men well trained in Agricultural practices and we would gladly invite them to the 

North to hold workshops to establish small market gardening for subsistence.  The Honourable 

Ngamau  Munokoa  mentioned  that  many  of  the  trained  agriculturists  are  no  longer  with  the 

Department.    I  also  remind the House we only  have one Doctorate in Agriculture and that is 

Matairangi Purea who is now resident in Samoa.  Even though he is in Samoa he is working for 

the Food and  Agriculture Organisation  (FAO).   I had the privilege of meeting  with  Dr Purea 

</span><span>two  weeks’  ago  and  I  voiced  my  concern  about  skilled  people  leaving  our  country.    He  was 

</span><span>very modest.  He would not state categorically why he left the country but  I rather suspected 

</span><span>that  his  skills  was  not  wanted  in  this  country.    I  am    certain  if  the  current  Minister  of 

</span><span>Agriculture  asked  Dr  Purea  to  come  back  he  would  willingly  come  back  to  work  for  his 

country.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>99 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I heard planters in this House express their concern about the low value of their 

produce.    I  think  it  concerns  everyone  in  this  country  that  the  Agricultural  output  from  this 

country is poor.  I think perhaps we need to have a  task force.  If Government, as the Minister 

said earlier, set up a task force,  I think a it should be comprised of Members on both sides of 

the House including expert planters.  We only have to look back two years down the line to the 

time  when  the  country  went  through  some  difficulties.    A  lot  of  people  were  brainstormed.  

Where are we now?  We have turned the country around and now we are on the way up.  To 

rely  only  on  the  Minister  to  do  a  miracle  would  be  foolish.    We  need  brainstorming  on  the  

Agriculture system in this country.   To kick-start it may be necessary for this Parliament  to set 

aside a special fund to  generate the  interests amongst planters, and Agriculturalists   - people 

who are interested in our Agriculture.  Bring people from the North and South to Rarotonga  to 

have a brainstorming session and see where they can best meet the demands of the future.  For 

too long we have depended on a narrow field of Agriculture and we have limited ourselves to 

pawpaws,    </span><span>taro</span><span>  and    tapioca.    I  think  it  is  about  time  we  ventured  into  other  fields  of 

Agriculture such as Kava like Fiji and Vanuatu and Hemp plants.  This is not marijuana, this 

hemp plant, which is of a very high value, is used in the textile industry.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please carry on Honourable Member.  For your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Like our new produce the </span><span>nono</span><span> plant.  While it may be new to the South,  

the Northern Group have always used the </span><span>nono</span><span> plant for medicinal purposes.  Not just the fruit 

but the root extract from the </span><span>nono</span><span> plant as well.  These are areas that will create new ventures 

for our people in Agriculture and we should look into it.  There is a huge market demand for 

</span><span>nono</span><span>  juice  for  its  medicinal  value.    Government  has  to  come  up  with  the  initiative  to  start  a 

processing plant for our product.  Because if we semi process this produce we will have a high 

return from the sales.  Not only that, but  it will create jobs for our people in the islands.  I take 

the view from the Honourable Robert Wigmore on Agriculture and he is an expert;  that if you 

add other experts to him then our Agriculture will be back to what it was </span><span>–</span><span> the backbone of our 

country.    It  will  be  the  backbone  of  our  country.    If  you  look  at  the  rest  of  the  world,  food 

production is one of the most important things each nation is concerned with.  

</span></div><div><span>We  may  not  be  self  sufficient  now  but  we  will  have  to  work  towards  that  target  to  provide 

sufficient supplies of a wide range of Agricultural products for our people rather than importing 

</span><span>them.  If we take the flour extracted from the arrowroot plant, there is a very high possibility 

</span><span>that we can supply 50 per cent of our requirement without importing it.  We just have to look at 

the shipping.  If it fails and there is no flour, everybody says that there is no food.   Just because 

</span><span>there’s no flour there’s no bread.  In the northern islands, if  the Honourable Tapi Taio’s boat 

doesn’t arrive and sugar or flour runs out, we hear that the islands are suffering from starvation.  

</span><span>It is really just these two basic items that run short and people refer to it as a huge starvation. 

</span></div><div><span>Shortly after Manihiki was struck by Cyclone Martin there was a lot of vegetation damaged on 

the  island  and  my  good  friend,  the  former  Minister  of  Agriculture,  Vaine  Tairea  assured  me 

</span><span>there would be some funding to re-vegetate our denuded beaches.  In fact, I accompanied two 

</span><span>Agricultural officers up to Manihiki to cite areas where nurseries could be set up.  There was a 

beautiful  report  written  by  these  two  people  from  the  Agriculture  Department  and  that  is  the 

last of these projects  I heard.  I would ask the Minister of Agriculture,  please  look into this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>100 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>matter  because  we  need  this  nursery  to  bring  back  the  breadfruits  we  totally  lost  in  the 

hurricane.  Bring back the lime trees we lost in the hurricane and other vegetations that can give 

us more security in the times of high seas. 

</span></div><div><span>We don’t want </span><span>taro</span><span>shoots because it won’t grow in Manihiki but we do want some bananas.  I 

</span><span>would suggest, Mr Chairman, that this House for once, for once get together and form a Task 

Force for Agriculture and kick-start our Agriculture so that ever</span><span>ybody will benefit.  We don’t 

</span><span>want to hear any more moans from Members of Parliament about the low price of pawpaws and 

</span><span>taro</span><span>.   

</span></div><div><span>Over the next six to twelve months something will happen in our region.  I am talking about the 

</span><span>America’s Cup in New Zealand, t</span><span>he Olympic Games.  There will be a huge influx of visitors 

coming into these islands and how are we going to feed them.  If you just look at the bookings 

in the motels, our motels are booked out because there will be twice as many people coming 

</span><span>and  there’s</span><span>  three  times  more  airplanes.  Air  New  Zealand  is  putting  on  three  extra  flights.  

Canada  3000,  Tainui  Airlines  and  probably  the  K2000  will  all  be  heading  our  way.    My 

concern, Mr Chairman, is that these planes will come with the bags of tomatoes,  </span><span>kumara</span><span> and 

potatoes to feed the people who will be coming. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  This is your last speaking time, Honourable Member.  Carry on please. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>As I said, we don’t want to lose out.  We want our planters and Growers 

</span><span>to benefit from this influx of people coming into our  country.  With a little bit of planning we 

can achieve a lot more.  If we look ahead,  in the next six months there will be a huge demand 

for Agricultural  products  like tomatoes, lettuces, you name it.   I think the former Minister of 

Agriculture, Vaine Tairea also saw this coming.  This is why he was saying that we  will bring 

the market here rather than take our products to the market.  We bring the market here. 

</span></div><div><span>I have one last question to ask to  the new Minister of Agriculture, Mr Chairman.  With some 

concern  I  hear  the  Secretary  of  the  former  Minister  of  Agriculture  had  lost  her  job.    She  has 

served the former Minister of Agriculture for over 15 years and having to be told to go home, I 

think was a bit unfair on this Government worker.  No wonder, Mr Chairman, she lost her job 

because  according  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  last  week,  the  officials  of  the  Agriculture 

</span><span>Department only asked for $100,000 in the Agriculture Vote.  She probably got left out because 

</span><span>the amount the officials of our Agriculture Department asked for was a small amount.  There 

</span><span>was no increase in this year’s Budget.  Not only the former Minister’s Secretary lost her job but 

</span><span>our former Chief Quarantine Officer was also sent home.  I certainly hope there is no politics in 

him  losing  his  job.    I  am  talking  about  the  only  qualified  Quarantine  Officer,  Mr  Samuel.    I 

think  at  the  time  when  we  really  require  the  knowledge  of  these  trained  people,  with  the 

increase  of  air  travel,    we  need  to  have  our  vegetation  protected  by  people  with  this  kind  of 

knowledge.  We have to be careful in what we do because if you are not careful you will easily 

introduce new pests into the country.  Whatever  we are trying to  upgrade in  Agriculture will 

</span><span>not succeed.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I call for the next speaker.  The Minister 

of Education. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>101 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  J.  MARURAI:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you.    Kia  Orana  to  all  the 

Honourable  Members  in  this  House.    Kia  Orana  also  to  all  our  people  listening  in  to  our 

deliberations this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>We  heard the wonderful thoughts from both sides of the House.  The words of encouragements 

to try and raise the standard of Agriculture in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I will try and confine to the Outer Islands.  I will be brief.  I want to talk about the Revolving 

Fund for Growers.  There are a lot of young people in the Outer Islands with no job.  We know 

that Government has a programme to develop the </span><span>nono</span><span>,  arrowroot and </span><span>taro</span><span> in this country.  I 

would  like  to  propose  if  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Islands  Development  could  set  up  in  the 

forthcoming Supplementary Budget a revolving fund for this purpose. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  the  Growers  Associations  to  administer  this  fund  to  assist  develop  cash  crops.  I 

believe  Mr  Chairman  that  this  will  be  an  incentive  to  our  young  people  to  move  into  cash 

cropping.  To assist them plough their areas or to clear the land for them.  During the campaign 

period in my constituency, this particular project came up. The suggestion was not just limited 

to Agr</span><span>iculture but also to craft work and mama’s weaving.  So I think if there are any ideas on 

</span><span>this they should be voiced in this House today.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Minister.  I call for the next speaker.  The Honourable Member 

from Rakahanga for your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    I  rise  Mr  Chairman  to  present  to  this  House 

something that is bothering me with regard to this Ministry.  The coconut is one very important 

crop that has not been harvested  and marketed regularly in our country.  In a retreat that was 

held at the National Auditorium, the presentation made by the Ministry of Agriculture did not 

mention anything about the coconut or copra or the benefits from this commodity.   Thereafter, 

the Ministry of Agriculture  never brought any proposals  to see how best we could utilise this 

product.  Yet coconut is a very  important crop  to us.  Why is it that we are being treated like 

</span><span>this? The coconut is something that we don’t plant, we don’t have to fertilise, we don’t have to 

water  them.      This  is  a  vital  crop  in  the  Northern  Group  so  I’m  just  asking  how  come  the 

</span><span>Government  is  not  doing  anything  about  this  crop?    Why  is  the  Government  ignoring  the 

</span><span>Northern Group?  Why was it left up to the Honourable Member Tapi Taio to try and foster this 

industry in the last couple of years?  By right, as I stated earlier, any extra spending should be 

given to the people who are trying to   develop. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  one  of  the  reasons  that  I  rose  now.      I  really  enjoyed  listening  to  all  the    novel 

developments  proposed  by  Government.  Meanwhile,  we  have  a  produce  over  here    which  is 

</span><span>readily  available.      We  don’t  have  to  plant,    it’s  already  there  and  the  coconuts  are  being 

</span><span>wasted.  I was happy on the day that I made a speech at the retreat because my views were the 

</span><span>same as the views of the Member of Parliament for Tongareva.  This is why I wanted to speak 

</span><span>on this subject.  This is a crop that is already there and we don’t have to fertilise, we don’t have 

</span><span>to water it.  It is already in place and if there are any commercial products from this crop, it is 

the  copra.    Maybe  it  will  benefit  not  only  the    Northern  Islands    but  rather  the    country  as  a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>102 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>whole.    We  had  a  visit  from  a  specialist  in  coconuts  and  this  person  went  to  the  Northern 

Group.  He also visited the Southern Group and then made a Report but nothing has eventuated 

</span><span>as a result of that Report.  I’m quite certain that if we had followed the recommendations of this 

</span><span>Report then we would be able to assist the financial crisis that we are in now.  Why should we 

</span><span>go  after  things  that  haven’t  even  been  grown  and  proven  yet  where  we  have  something  here 

that’s  already  growing  we  are  just  ignoring  it.    I  believe  that  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

</span><span>Agriculture is going to be helpful to the islands from the Northern Group because this is where 

he is from.  He was raised on, coconuts!    

</span></div><div><span>So I won’t have much more to say, I just wanted to speak about this product that is out there, 

</span><span>untapped by the Ministry.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The 

Honourable Minister of Outer Islands Development. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to Mr Chairman and  Kia Orana 

also to the Clerk of this House.  Kia Orana to the staff of this House.  

</span></div><div><span>I rose Mr Chairman to give my support to this allocation for the Ministry of Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to extend my Greetings Mr Chairman to the Prime Minister of our country, to the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to  all  the  Cabinet  Ministers,  to  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry  and  to  all 

Government  Members,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    To  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  and  to  his 

Deputy, to all the Members on the sea side, Kia Orana to  you all in the name of our Lord.  I 

send a special Greetings out to our people listening in to our radio this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>At this point Mr Chairman, I would like to  extend a special Kia Orana to the Member of the 

island of Akatokamanava.  To the Honourable Member of Akatokamanava,  Mapu Taia and to 

his  people for the occasion  of the Manea Games that was held  on their island recently.  I pay 

tribute to you.  Because during the Opening of the Manea Games that I was invited to open we 

all knew that the young sports people of the southern group were on that island at that time. I 

know  personally  Mr  Chairman  that  the  Honourable  Member  was  the  co-ordinator  for  the 

Manea  Games.  The  representatives  from  SEASAW  and  I,  together  with  all  those  who 

</span><span>participated saw how well the people of the island looked after the visitors and the contestants 

</span><span>from the other islands.   

</span></div><div><span>This is why, Mr Chairman, I wanted to congratulate him, his people and the Aronga Mana of 

the  Island  for  all  those  wonderful  preparations  and  the  implementation  of  the  programmes 

during the Manea Games.  I would also like to thank him for looking after myself and my wife 

while we stayed on Akatokamanava. 

</span></div><div><span>My second special Greetings, Mr Chairman,  goes to the people on my home island.  To all the 

</span><span>Ministers in the different denominations on the Island, the Mayor and Island Councillors,  to all 

</span><span>the people and the children on the island, Kia Orana to you all in the name of our Lord.  You 

have all heard a number of rumours going around ever since the day of the Elections.  It does 

not matter, just listen to your radio and you will know what is happening. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>103 

</span></div><div><span>I will come back now Mr Chairman, to our Budget.  We see a sum of $608,576 and I am quite 

certain Mr Chairman, that we all know that this is for the Agriculture of Rarotonga alone.  It is 

not  for the Outer  Islands.  We might  ask Mr Chairman, where is  the allocation for the  Outer 

Islands?  The answer to that, Mr Chairman, is that a figure can be found in the allocation for the 

</span><span>Ministry of Outer Islands Development under the heading of “Economic Growth for each of the 

Outer  Islands”.    I  think  it  is  a</span><span>ppropriate,  Mr  Chairman,  in  our  Greetings  that  we  should  also 

</span><span>greet  the  “King  of  Agriculture”  on  Rarotonga  and  that  is  the  Honourable  Member  Robert 

</span><span>Wigmore.  We all know the benefits that our country is getting from him and his company.  As 

he  is  know  as  t</span><span>he  “King  of  Agriculture”  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga,  there  are  people  in  the 

Outer  Islands  who  can  also  be  called  “Kings”  in  their  own  right.    In  the  Southern  Group  we 

</span><span>have high raised volcanic islands and we are planting food crops here.  And as the Honourable 

Member for Rakahanga, Dr Pupuke Robati, was saying earlier, on the islands of the Northern 

</span><span>Group we have a lot of coconut trees.   Therefore we can be identified as the “Queens” in the 

</span><span>Northern Group.  Once you see a rito hat then you will know it co</span><span>mes from the “Queens” of the 

</span><span>Northern  Group.    We  are  also  aware  that  there  are  a  lot  of  orders  for  these  rito  hats  from 

overseas countries. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Your second speech Mr Minister.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  While the people in the Southern Group plant on the land the people 

of  the  Northern  Group  plant  in  the  lagoons.    I  will  not  speak  much  on  this  subject,  Mr 

Chairman.  We will be discussing this when we come to the allocation for Marine Resources.   

</span></div><div><span>If we come back to the appropriation for the Ministry of Agriculture we find three key sectors 

for the Ministry.  One of the important sectors in this Ministry is the Advisory Unit.  We know 

that from time to time we get these people to advise the country about various developments in 

the  world  of  Agriculture.  They  may  have  done  some  experiments  and  this  is  the  issue  the 

Honourable  Robert  Wigmore  was  highlighting.  The  Honourable  Member    is  also  doing  the 

same kind of things over the Radio every Saturday morning.  This is what these people do in 

this  Division.  In the past this was a very big Ministry with a lot of employees and they used to 

go  out  to  the  people  to  help  them.    But  a  lot  of  money  was  required  to  pay    these  people.  

Recently, to bring things in line with the reform process this Ministry has been reduced in a lot 

</span><span>of areas.  Now we see there are a lot of planters who are able to do things for themselves.  If 

</span><span>you want to  ask for the proof, I think the proof is right here in this House in the form of the 

Honourable Member Robert Wigmore.  If we look outside of this House Honourable Members, 

I am certain we can identify a few Growers who are now independent and are successful today. 

In  the  Outer  Islands  we  know  who  these  people  are.    This  is  the  result  Mr  Chairman,  of  the 

efforts  of  this  Advisory  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.  Mr  Chairman,  as  I  said  earlier 

people are standing on their own feet because they do not want the Government to spoon feed 

them.    I  am  certain  we  all  know  there  are  a  lot  of  people  out  there  who  can  say  that  I  have 

earned my own money and do not rely on Government anymore.  We can see proof of this in 

</span><span>the responses of people who are expressing their thoughts over the Radio talk back. A host of 

</span><span>them are quite happy about the direction which we have taken.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>104 

</span></div><div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, another very important unit is the Pest Control.  This second division, is also a 

very important division where our Quarantine Section actually gives us the procedures that are 

required  in  order  that  we  are  able  to  send  our  produce  to  overseas  markets.    This  is  why  the 

Minister said,  that the head of the Ministry and  the Technical Advisors had sat down together 

and  gone  though  the  Budget  as  we  see  it  now.  They  have  all  agreed  Mr  Chairman  that  the 

figure that we have before us will be sufficient to run the Ministry for this financial year. 

</span></div><div><span>I rose, Mr Chairman, to explain this and also to give my support to this appropriation for the 

Ministry of Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Minister. I call for a next speaker. The Minister of Agriculture, 

are you summing up?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Sorry, the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you this afternoon.  To the 

Clerk of the Parliament and to all your staff </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you all in the name of Our Lord.  

To the Deputy Prime Minister, to Cabinet Ministers, to Sir Geoffrey Henry, to the Leader of the 

Opposition  and  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  to  all  Honourable  Members  of  the 

Opposition </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, when I looked at the Order Paper of Friday and today I saw something right at 

the very bottom, that is the Honourable Member for Rakahanga has a Motion here. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  Nothing to do with Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  This is why I would like to give my Greetings to him. I was quite 

happy with the speech made by the Honourable Member from Mauke when he told us of the 

things that Mauke would like but I was quite worried because he is sitting next to the oldest of 

the old guns.  I would like to tell the Honourable Member from Rakahanga that that man next 

to him is my relative.    This is  why I was rather concerned.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  give  my  Greetings  to  the  young  guns  on  this  side.  To  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member  from  Arutanga,  Nikaupara  and  Reureu.  I  didn’t  hear  all  your  speech  the  o</span><span>ther  day.  

</span><span>The reason being I was requested to meet someone  outside of this Chamber.  But from outside 

I heard a remarkable speech presented by you. The other young gun is not yet ready to speak 

and therefore  I  will turn my attention to  the Corrective  group.   I recall being made clear that 

they are not the Opposition.  I quite like this concept and I hope we will  continue to uphold 

this  form  of  cooperation  forever.  But  I  am  quite  concerned  with  the  Member  from  Akao 

because he was not in Parliament when he did a very unusual thing which did not seem right to 

me. Maybe the other guns have influenced him to do what he did. He sent his boat to Pukapuka 

he and instead of filling his boat with Agriculture machinery he filled it with food and liquor.
