</span></div><div><span>Appropriation Bill </span><span>––</span><span> Interrupted Debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $705,576 for Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>The Minister of Agriculture was speaking when we adjourned. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to you, the Clerk and all 

staff  members,  greetings  to  you  all.  Greetings  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  the 

House.  The  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Sir  Geoffrey,  Members  of 

Cabinet and Members of Government.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader, 

</span><span>and Members of the “Corrective side” –</span><span>I like the name “Corrective”. G</span><span>reetings to our 

people who are listening in to our debate this afternoon, the people on Rarotonga and 

the Outer Islands, greetings to you all in the Love of God.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to extend a very special greeting to our senior citizens in our country.  As 

Minister  responsible  for  our  senior  citizens,  our  elderly,  I  would  like  to  make  this 

statement.    Rest  assured  that  the  problem  some of  you  may  have  encountered  when 

you  returned  from  New  Zealand  and  have  to  wait  for  three  months  to  collect  your 

pensions,  will  very  soon  be  solved.    May  I  just  give  a  word  of  caution  to  you,  the 

elderly.  Do not spend too much time just eating and sitting around because this is the 

time  in  life  that  one  is  prone  to  strokes,  heart  attacks  and  other  illnesses.    So,  my 

advice is for you to go for a walk, visit your children and grandchildren, even your in-

laws, do some exercises. 

</span></div><div><span>Because we are on the Budget for Agriculture, I would like to encourage the elderly 

</span><span>not  to  eat  too  much  red  meat,  as  this  is  sometimes  the  cause  of  strokes  and  other 

complications. But eat lots of vegetables and fruits.

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to send a very special greeting to a former Pastor, Papa Enua 

Totini, who is sick.  I extend to him a special greetings this afternoon.  

</span></div><div><span>Before I go on, I would like to advise our people with regard to the export of Pawpaw.  

As from yesterday we have designed a new package for exporting our pawpaw and I 

am sure this new packaging will improve our pawpaw exports.  I have also requested 

the  Secretary  of  Agriculture,  Mark  Brown,  to  go  to  New  Zealand  and  Australia  to 

seek markets for our pawpaws.  We have exported a shipment of fifty cartons of chilli 

and  we  will  be  sending  eggplants  overseas  as  well.  I  have  asked  the  Secretary  of 

Agriculture  to  see  Turners  &amp;  Growers  with  regard  to  getting  the  best  price  for  our 

produce.  I  appreciated  the  comments  made  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  when  he 

was  in  New  Zealand  that  he  had  met  a  group  of  Cook  Islanders  from  Nga-Pu-Toru 

and the Northern Group who are prepared to buy our produce, and to develop the best 

way that we can style our products for the people who are handling the marketing. In 

the past, people who sold our products on our behalf in New Zealand get the money 

and slip it into their pockets. 

</span></div><div><span>This is all I have to say, Mr Chairman and I give my support to the appropriation of 

</span><span>$608,576 for the  Ministry of Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Minister. Are there any further speakers? Thank you.  

I will now put the question.  There appears to be no further speakers.  I will put the 

question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $608,576 for Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $501,532 for PERCA stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Minister of Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you  Mr  Chairman.  

Greetings to you and to all staff members and to the people who are listening in to our 

debate this afternoon.  Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, before I proceed with the debate on the PERCA Vote, may I just make 

a simple observation. I noticed that after the Minister of Agriculture wrapped up his 

debate on the Agriculture Vote  you asked for a further speaker.  I thought that after 

</span><span>the  wrapping  up  session  I  thought  that’s  the  end  of  the  debate.  I  thought  it 

automatically goes to the Vote.  It’s just an observation.  I’m not criticising.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Order, order.
