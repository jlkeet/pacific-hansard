<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the Vote of PERCA, Mr Chairman, I don’t really want to speak about the 

</span><span>Vote.  I just want to speak about the Office.   

</span></div><div><span>The  PERCA  Act  brought  into  the  House  was  enacted  in  1996  as  part  of  the  reform 

</span><span>package.  There were three laws introduced to effect that reform.  The other two laws 

were the FEM Act and the Public Service Act.  Although I was partly responsible for 

the  introduction  of  the  PERCA  Act,  I  would  like  to  point  out  that  there  are  a  lot  of 

anomalies associated with that Act. But firstly let me explain what PERCA stands for. 

</span></div><div><span>PERCA  stands  for  Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee  and  Audit.    Usually,  Mr 

Chairman  </span><span>–</span><span>  usually,  not  much  debate  is  conducted  over  this  Vote  Item  because  to 

everybody it is a very uninteresting Office.  But nevertheless, it performs a very very 

important function.  Before I go into what the functions of the Office are, let me go 

through those anomalies I mentioned earlier. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  Mr  Chairman,  the  Minister  of  Finance  is  responsible  for  this  Office  but  this 

Office is responsible to Parliament.  Furthermore, the Minister appoints the Chairman 

of this Committee but if he is to be dismissed for various reasons, the Minister cannot 

</span><span>dismiss him. The Queen’s Representative on the recommendation of Parliament is the 

body to  dismiss him. At the same time the Queen’s Representative on the advice of 

</span><span>Cabinet can only appoint the rest of the Committee Members.  So the only connection 

the Minister of Finance has with this Committee is  as  Minister  responsible for the 

</span><span>Committee.  That’s all.  No, that’s not quite right Mr Chairman.  The Minister is in 

</span><span>charge of this Committee.  At the same time his other responsibility is the power to 

appoint  the  Chairman,  full-stop.    But  the  Committee  is  responsible  directly  to 

</span><span>Parliament.    So  I  don’t  really  understand  even  though  I  admit  to  being  part  of  the 

</span><span>formulation of this Act, what the position of the Minister of Finance is with regard to 

this Committee.  However, the Minister of Finance is also responsible for the Office 

of Audit and the Audit Office assists the PERCA Committee with its responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>The  present  Members  of  this  Committee  are:  Chairman,  Mike  Mitchell;  Members:  

</span><span>Mr John Kenning, Mr Trevor Simmonds and Mrs Tina Browne.  You will notice, Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, that these people are either lawyers or accountants.  Even though it is not 

specifically inserted into the Act what the qualifications of the  Committee Members 

need to be . . .  

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>114 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    By  virtue  of  the  job  they  perform, 

they need to be either lawyers or accountants because the work of this Committee is a 

financial investigative function. 

</span></div><div><span>In  fact,  Mr  Chairman,  if  you  look  at  this  Part  II  of  the  Budget  Estimates,  under  the 

Vote  Item  of the Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit  on page 12,  you 

will note that the goals of this Committee are:  

</span></div><div><span>Goal 1: to ensure that the Cook Islands General Annual Accounts are true and fair and 

comply with the Act.   

</span></div><div><span>Goal No. 2: to review and identify the improvements and efficiency, effectiveness of 

the economy throughout Government.  

</span></div><div><span> Goal No.3: to undertake special reviews and investigations as requested.  

</span></div><div><span> And  Goal  No  4:  is  to  increase  and  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  in 

Government financial transactions.   

</span></div><div><span>That’s roughly Mr Chairman  what this office is suppose to do.  That is to investigate 

</span><span>things  that  Government  does  and  also  to  the  extent  of  investigating  appointments 

made  by  Government.    They  also  look  into  the  procedure  of  making  a  budget  Mr 

Chairman.    But  most  importantly  is  to  ensure  that  transparency  is  in  place  and 

accountability  on  behalf  of  Government.  So  Mr  Chairman,  this  is  a  very  very 

important  Committee  even  though  its  not  well  known  amongst  most  of  our  people.  

Understandably,  because its only been in existence for about 3 years now.  Although 

the oldest functions of Government has been in place for a v</span><span>ery long time,  it’s only 

</span><span>since 1996 that we have put into place Auditors from our own community.  I know in 

</span><span>the past, we have utilised Auditors from overseas.  But that’s mainly because most of 

</span><span>the  funding  we  used  in  the  past  were  from  overseas.    And  that  is  still  in  place  Mr 

Chairman.    Any  money  we  receive  from  overseas  are  audited  by  donor  agency 

</span><span>auditors.    But  they  don’t  audit  any  local  funding  or  any  revenue  accumulated  or 

</span><span>distributed locally.  They do not have any jurisdiction over that.  Yes, our auditors are 

responsible for auditing the money we get ourselves.   

</span></div><div><span>Of  course  Mr  Chairman,  that  does  not  stop  us  from  utilising  or  using  overseas 

auditors  if  we  wish  to.    But  we  have  established  our  own  Audit  office  and  its  only 

right that we utilise their services.  However the flexibility of seeking other services is 

in place. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  finish  my  presentation,  I  would  like  to  give  my  thanks  to  the  present 

Committee - the Chairman Mr Mike Mitchell and the 3 Members of the Committee.  I 

can assure you Mr Chairman that they have been performing a good service for  the 

</span><span>country over the past 3 years.  But I would like to point out to them that there need to 

</span><span>be  some  upgrading  of  the  existing  Act  so  that  the  anomalies  I  have  pointed  out  are 

removed. Various responsibilities of the Minister of  Finance,  of Parliament and the 

responsibility  of  the  Committee  are  clearly  defined.    I  think  the  work  of  this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>115 

</span></div><div><span>Committee should remove the fears, maybe fears is not the right word Mr Chairman.  

</span><span>I think “</span><span>akava-</span><span>ngakau” </span><span>is the word.  I think Mr Chairman that these changes should 

remove the doubts in some people as to what the power of this Committee is.  Let me 

</span><span>correct the Interpreter Mr Chairman, its not the changes in the Act, it’s the existence 

</span><span>of  the  law  that  will  remove  the  </span><span>“</span><span>akava-</span><span>ngakau”</span><span>in  some  people’s  heart  about  the 

</span><span>abuse that can take place in managing Government funds.  

</span></div><div><span>If you look at their functions I see that they are responsible to Parliament.  Then only 

Parliament can influence their work.  Nobody else can do that. In actual fact they are  

independent investigators.  And that was the spirit when the law was put in place, to 

give these people an independent power so they cannot be influence by others.  The 

</span><span>Committee  has  been  acting  on  anybody’s  suggestion.    Private  i</span><span>ndividuals  can 

approach the Committee if they have any complaints to make and the Committees is 

abliged to investigate accordingly.  That in a nutshell is roughly what this Committee 

is all about Mr Chairman.  As I said it forms a part of the Reform Process.  Although 

</span><span>there are anomalies in the Act establishing this Committee it’s role nevertheless is a 

</span><span>very important one and we should not alter its role.  All we need to do is to clean up 

the  Act  so  that  everybody  clearly  understands  where  each  sector  that  is  involved  in 

</span><span>this Act stands.  With that Mr Chairman I suggest we move on to the next vote item, 

</span><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Minister.  The Honourable Member for Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman and Kia Orana to you this afternoon, 

Kia Orana also to all Honourable Members and to our people listening.  To the Prime 

Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and to  all Honourable Members 

of this House, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand Mr Chairman to support the Appropriation for the Public Expenditure Review 

</span><span>Committee  and  Audit.    I  couldn’t  disagree  more  with  the  Minister  of  Finance  who 

</span><span>said that the function of the PERCA is an independent body to look into the spending, 

the use of public funds.  As he also correctly said that this Committee was set up in 

1996 because of the Reforms.  We were going through a rough time and because of 

the concerns of some people have on how public funds are utilised.  I think this is one 

of the  reform aspects  that  our people  fully  supported where the  former  Government 

established  this  Committee.    But  I  have  some  concern  in  what  the  Minister  said.  

Particularly  in  the  anomalies  regarding  the  PERCA  Act.  Did  he  ask  for  a  clear 

definition as to whom is responsible to whom?  But towards the end of his speech he 

clearly  hit  the  nail  on  the  head  when  he  said  PERCA  is  a  fully  independent  unit 

without any interference from the Minister or Government or from this Parliament.  It 

seems to me the Minister  wants PERCA under his responsibility.  There is a danger if 

PERCA is under the responsibility of the Minister of Finance.  Because by placing the 

Committee under a Minister, it can be influenced, and you lose the independence of 

this  Department.    The  PERCA  Act  clearly  states  that  the  Committee  submits  the 

Report to this Parliament, not to anybody else.  Not to the Minister of Finance, not to 

the  Prime  Minister,  but  directly  to  this  Parliament.    Clearly  this  tries  to  avoid  any 

</span><span>influence that may occur when PERCA finds out what it finds.  While it may be the 

</span><span>Minister’s  prer</span><span>ogative  to  appoint  the  Chairman  of  the  PERCA  the  Act  clearly  says 

that only the QR can have that Chairman removed.  Clearly this is an indication that 

nothing can influence the Chairman of PERCA.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>116 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>If we say that the Chairman of PERCA has to investigate the Minister of Finance and 

the Minister does not like it, and if the Minister is his boss, it is easy for the Minister 

to  sack  him.    But  if  the  independence  of  the  Chairman  is  to  be  maintained  and  the 

Chairman of PERCA investigates the Minister of Finance and comes up with findings 

that may not please the Minister he cannot sack that Chairman.  Only the QR can do 

that.   

</span></div><div><span>In the case of the Audit  Department  that is  a different  issue.  This  is  a  Government 

Department,  it  does  not  have  the  independence  that  PERCA  has.    Even  the  Audit 

Department can be investigated by PERCA.  So to me, Mr Chairman, I do not see any 

anomalies.    There  are  deliberate  moves  designed  to  clear  any  conflict  of  interest 

between the Minister and PERCA.  In fact I see it as a guarantee of the independence 

of PERCA.  Perhaps what we should be looking at is when PERCA has performed its 

functions  and made its report to  Parliament, what  else can PERCA do?  There have 

been  a  number  of  incidents  where  PERCA  uncovered  a  misappropriation  of  public 

funds but PERCA is only required by law to make a report to Parliament.  It is up to 

Parliament then whether to take any further action on this matter and report this to the 

</span><span>Police  or  not.    In  fact  I  would  say  that  PERCA  as  it  stands,  and  where  its  legal 

</span><span>functions are concerned is totally useless.  They can’t take actions on any public funds 

</span><span>misappropriated.  But  I  am not certain Mr Chairman, who is  going to take action to 

remedy  the  problem  and  have  people  properly  punished  if  there  are  missing  funds, 

misappropriated and misuse of Government funds? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your second speech Honourable Member.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank  you Mr Chairman.  There has been a classic example 

last  year  when  there  was  a  report  from  PERCA  regarding  the  Housing  Authority 

funds.    In  fact  PERCA  made  a  lengthy  report  to  this  House  where  it  clearly  says 

public funds have never been properly accounted for and there is no way that we can 

recover  it.    Some  of  the  people  involved  in  Housing  refused  to  cooperate  with 

PE</span><span>RCA.  Clearly we should see that PERCA’s functions are completed by giving it 

</span><span>legal  powers to  make remedies through the Court  or in  conjunction  with  the Police.  

Without a provision like that, we are wasting public funds to purchase the services of 

PERCA.  The Minister of Finance says the creation of PERCA has caused assurance 

amongst  our  people  that  public  funds  will  no  longer  be  misused  or  misappropriated 

like it was in the past.  I have a very high regard for the Chairman of this Committee, 

Mr Mike Mitchell, and his Committee Members.  But I feel Parliament has failed to 

give them the necessary powers to exercise, or to come up with recommendations on 

how to remedy the issues of misuse of public funds.  Unlike some other departments, 

like  the  CIIC,  where  there  has  been  monies  from  our  Post  Office  Savings  Bank 

missing - I think the money from there was used for the wrong purpose.   

</span></div><div><span>This  is  the  kind  of  thing  where  we  would  require  PERCA  to  investigate  to  see  the 

borrowing of money from the Post Office Savings to put in other areas that Parliament 

has appropriated.  If it is legal what they have done then let it be.  I will support this 

</span><span>Vote  for  PERCA  and  I  hope  the  Minister  will  not  reduce  their  independence.    If 

</span><span>anything, we should give PERCA more independence so that they can carry out their 

functions to the best of their knowledge to see that public funds are properly utilised 

and not  wasted.   This  is  a Committee that has been set  up not  only to  look into the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>117 

</span></div><div><span>affairs  of  Government  but  in  other  matters  including  the  Local  Government.    Right 

across the board where public funds are utilised.  The creation of this Committee, the 

Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee  is  a  bold  step  forward  by  the  former 

Government.   

</span></div><div><span>What  they  have  created  is  a  watchdog,  a  big  watchdog  that  will  bite  the  hand  off 

somebody who is meddling with public funds.  So my good friend from Aitutaki, the 

Honourable  Teina  Bishop  will  be  happier  to  rest  assured  that  the  money  the  public 

have  is  in  good  care.    It  is  all  part  and  parcel  of  the  checks  and  balances  on  our 

Government and if in the next few weeks we become the Government, I will welcome 

PERCA to look into our affairs.
