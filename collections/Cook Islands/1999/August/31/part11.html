</span></div><div><span>123 

</span></div><div><span>We all heard what we have spoken of with regard to the Agriculture Budget but as I 

drove through my car I heard Danny Mataroa expressing his disappointments. I would 

like  to  ask  the  Ho</span><span>nourable  Minister  of  Agriculture  to  meet  Danny  Mataroa.  I  don’t 

</span><span>know whether they have shared with the Deputy Prime Minister because there is a big 

problem  aired  through  the  radio.    We  have  to  be  cautious  about  what  we  say.    We 

must also be conscious of the needs of our people.  

</span></div><div><span> In our debate on this vote item for the PERCA, let us find out what they need.  And 

first,  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  suggest  an  amendment  to  the  name  PERCA. 

Instead of just Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit, include Revenue.  I 

am  recommending  this  Mr  Chairman,  because  we  see  PERCA  dealing  with 

expenditure and audit only.  But when it comes to how the money is distributed, they 

are not involved.  Like, for instance, what we are going through right now.  This is the 

time to talk about the appropriations. This is the time when the proper appropriation 

of funds is very important. If the revenue of this country is not fairly distributed then 

we have a problem. Some will get more such as the Ministers while some will get less 

and  others  will  have  nothing.  That  is  my  suggestion.  I  know  I  should  not  be 

deliberating on this part too much because it is not part of this PERCA as such, but 

</span><span>that is my view. 

</span></div><div><span>Now let us go back to the time when this Committee was formed.  There was a reason 

for  forming  this  Committee  and  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  this  was  due  to  the 

reform.  The  Government of the time planned and implemented the  establishment of 

this Committee so that we will be able to keep track of the expenditure of this country. 

Mr  Michael  Mitchell  was  appointed  as  Chairman  and  as  far  as  I  can  see  from  the 

Reports they have done  a very  good job.  The people appointed as Committees have 

integrity  and  credibility  and  they  have  produced  results  according  to  their  Terms  of 

Reference.  

</span></div><div><span>Now when we look at the Budget and as mentioned by Sir Geoffrey Henry there are 

very  few  people  working  on  this  Committee  and  yet  the  amount  of  money 

appropriated is only about half a million dollars. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I ask myself this question.  Can PERCA effectively operate with this Budget of 

</span><span>half a million dollars?  My answer to that is simply “no”. Why? In my view, when I 

</span><span>look back to what they have done and the Reports they have completed, presented and 

tabled in this Parliament, I see an excellent achievement. I am not sure whether any of 

those  Reports  have  actually  been  implemented  to  the  extent  that  the  content  of  the 

recommendations have been analysed and applied. A big chunk of the Budget of this 

country should be allocated to the work of PERCA. It has been mentioned that their 

work stops when they present their Reports and that is true because I have involved 

myself in laying a complaint with the Police Commissioner as a result of one of those 

reports by PERCA. 

</span></div><div><span>The other point, Mr Chairman, is that when a report is filed by PERCA, it affects the 

performance of the Government of the day.  If it brings out a report that recommends 

</span><span>for the Police action then as we have seen, no action was taken.  No complaints were 

</span><span>given to the Police and it has to be the Opp</span><span>osition that’s we, to do something about it.</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>124 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Listen  to  all  the  speakers  who  have  spoken  on  this  matter.  I  think  we  all  have  one 

view and that is the Act governing the activities of PERCA needs to be amended to 

address the anomalies. In other words, the money we are appropriating for the work of 

PERCA will be wasted. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I also support the views of those 

who have spoken that the PERCA Act should include some teeth and it should include 

some means to  make recommendations to  Crown  Law or to  Police to  look  at  cases.  

Particularly controversial  cases requiring Court  actions.  And without those changes 

with the amendments Mr Chairman, I see this as a waste of money.  Not that I under 

value  the  professional  ability  of  these  Committee  Members.    It  simply  means  that 

</span><span>nothing happens after a hard day’s work put into compiling this Report.  But I must 

</span><span>go along with the views of those who have spoken before me that the Members of this 

</span><span>Committee have done a great job. I don’t go along with my Brother in</span><span>-law here, the 

Minister  of  Finance  recommending  that  perhaps  PERCA  maybe  responsible  to  a 

Minister. I see that the composition of this Committee, as provided by the Act is quite 

</span><span>in  order.   Except  the Act  have no teeth.    Further actions by the Committee must be 

</span><span>authorised  to  improve  the  operations  of  their  inquiries.  As  such,  my  support  to  this 

Appropriation is only subject to some amendments to the PERCA Act. And instead of 

giving  the  Minister  more  teeth,  I  would  rather  give  more  teeth  to  the  PERCA 

Committee. Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member. Are there any further speakers?  

There appears to be none.  I will put the Question.  The Question is:  

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $501,532 for PERCA stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We move on to Crown Law: 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $295,766 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Attorney General. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman, to the Clerk and to the staff 

of  this  House.    Kia  Orana  also  our  people  listening  in  to  this  debate  this  afternoon.  

Kia Orana to all of us in this House.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman this is my Vote Item before the House.  This allocation of $295,766 is 

found on pages 16 to 20 of Volume 2 or part II of the Budget Estimates Booklet that 

we  have.  Now,  Mr  Chairman  the  prime  function  of  the  Crown  Law  for  which  this 

</span><span>allocation  is  made  pursuant  to  Section  10  of  the  Crown  Law  Office  Act  1980,  is  to 

</span><span>advise the Crown on legal matters referred to it by Cabinet.  And for legal matters Mr 

</span><span>Chairman  referred  to  it  by  the  Prime  Minister,  Ministers  of  the  Crown,  Queen’s 

</span><span>Representative, the office of the Ombudsman, Heads of Ministries and other statutory 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>125 

</span></div><div><span>bodies.  In addition to those functions, the office has also been given the responsibility 

of providing the censorship services required for the censoring of films and videos in 

accordance  with  the  Films  and  Censorship  Act  1985.    This  is  because  that  Act 

stipulates that the Minister responsible for that Act is the Minister responsible for the 

office of Crown Law.    

</span></div><div><span>If we look at the allocation contained in those pages Mr Chairman we will find that 

this Crown Law office has budgeted for 3 Outputs.  

</span></div><div><span>The 1</span><span>st</span><span> output being the Legal Advise and Representation.  If we look at the booklet 

itself, we will find that the sum of $181,899 has been allocated for that Output No.1. 

</span></div><div><span>Then  there  is  the  2</span><span>nd</span><span>  Output  which  is  listed  under  Draft  Legislation.  The  costs 

estimated for the delivery of this Output is $103,557.   

</span></div><div><span>The 3</span><span>rd</span><span> Output Mr Chairman, being the Censorship of Films and Videos is estimated 

to cost $15,344.   

</span></div><div><span>Now  this  brings  the  gross  total  of  the  Crown  Law’s  Budget  to  $300,800.  It  is 

</span><span>projected  that  the  office  will  generate  a  trading  revenue  of  $16,000  from  the 

censorship  of  films  and  videos,  therefore  bringing  the  total  nett  office  budget  for 

Crown Law to $284,800.   

</span></div><div><span>Taking a comparison from last year’s budget of $264,910 we can see an increase of 

</span><span>almost $20,000 on this budget of 1999-2000. There are reasons Mr Chairman.  One of 

the reasons  for the increase is  due to  the increase in  the office professional  services 

allocation.  Now this allocation Mr Chairman has been increased by a sum of $4,000 

in  anticipation  of  the  extra  costs  for  outside  legal  services  relating  to  the  Electoral 

Petitions.   

</span></div><div><span>An  example  of  that  is  that  we  have  a  By-Election  on  our  hand  and  there  are  funds 

required  to  accommodate  those  outside  legal  services  when  the  need  arise.    The 

second  reason  Mr  Chairman  is  that  a  request  has  been  made  by  the  office  for  an 

increase  in  about  $11,000  to  update  the  Computers  and  Air-conditioners  inside  the 

Crown Law office.  Now out of the nett figure of $284,800 a $172,346 is allocated for 

Personnel.  Included in the same allocation is funding for the employment of another 

Crown Counsel to assist the Solicitor General in the delivering the rest of the Outputs 

of the office.  Now the balance of $112,454 covers the Operating cost with the largest 

operating  expenditure  being  the  Professional  Services  allocation  of  $54,000.      In 

recognition of the services of the offices limited resources which includes the lack of 

legal staff, this amount is utilised for retaining the services of legal expert advise both 

locally and overseas.  And as a result also Mr Chairman, of the recent Elections there 

was a need for Crown Law to bring a Constitutional Legal Expert from New Zealand, 

</span><span>Mr  Alex  Frame,  in  order  to  advise  the  Queen’s  Representative  on  his  constitutional 

</span><span>powers.  Apart from that Mr Chairman, the services of local solicitors for example Mr 

Tony Manarangi, and others are also retained by the Crown Law Office. The balance 

</span><span>of that Budget covers Sundries and Miscellaneous under the Office itself.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>126 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>That covers, I think Mr Chairman, an outline of the services and outputs for the Office 

of Crown Law. I shall rest there and reserve the rest of my speaking time to answer 

any questions from the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Attorney General. You have unlimited speaking time.  

Are there any speakers?  The Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I do not intend to dwell too long 

on this Vote Item.  I would like to make some comments.  I think the performance of 

this  Office  has  been  excellent  as  far  as  I  am  concerned  and  they  maintained  the 

integrity  of  this  Office.    However,  recently  Mr  Chairman,  I  must  mention  that  the 

advise of Crown Law Office in one case that I can recall recently was ignored.   

</span></div><div><span>I’d like to give the example which was the Court of Appea</span><span>l on the Pukapuka-Nassau.  

Because the Appeal Court Decision, as far as I am concerned, clearly indicated what 

the Electoral Office should have taken and that was to make the announcement for the 

By-Election  as  determined  by  the  Court.    Unfortunately,  that  Ruling  created  some 

inaction  on  the  part  of  Government  and  the  Minister  of  Crown  Law.    To  the  extent 

</span><span>that a Declaratory Judgement was called for. To me Mr Chairman, this appears to be a 

</span><span>very  unnecessary  action.    It  attracted  extra  costs  which  was  uncalled  for.  Because  I 

was in that Hearing, listening to the Court as evidences were heard.  And the Crown 

Law  Representative  mentioned  that  advice  had  already  been  given  to  the  Minister 

with regards to the Court Decision but the Government, and the Minister in particular, 

ignored  that  advice.    And  therefore  the  Judge,  the  Appeal  Court  Judge,  gave  that 

Declaratory Judgement to ensure that the Appeal Court Decision was acted upon. As 

everybody probably knows the Honourable Minister Tapaitau and I were asked by the 

Radio for comments.  Although I made no personal attacks on him, I believe he made 

some personal attacks on me.   

</span></div><div><span>Now  Mr  Chairman,  this  is  one  incident  which  cost  us  so  much  unnecessarily.  We 

should be encouraging the office to perform and to give them as much independence 

as possible.  In my view the Minister was interfering with the Decision of the Crown 

Law  Office.    How  can  they  in  the  future  feel  confident  in  providing  advice  to  the 

Government and to the Minister with that sort of practices?  Maybe this is one Office 

that  should  have  the  same  privileges  as  PERCA.  I  see  the  Minister  of  Finance  is 

sitting  next  to  the  Minister  Tapaitau.    Maybe  the  Minister  of  Finance  is  getting  his 

advice  from  the  Minister  Tapaitau  as  to  what  should  be  added  to  the  PERCA  Act.  

This recent incident Mr Chairman is of concern to me. There is no doubt in my mind 

that  this  will  be  a  black  mark  against  the  Crown  Law.    Interferences  like  this  can 

affect the confidence and the performance of this Office.  

</span></div><div><span>One other thing I observed while the Minister was explaining the role of the Crown 

Law  Office.    It  seems  that  he  mentioned  all  the  various  Government  divisions, 

Government Departments, Ombudsman and Parliament but excluded the Opposition.  

Now I would like to remind him that we are also a part of this Parliament.  We are a 

part of this country and I feel the Opposition should receive the services of the Crown 

</span><span>Law as well. And if it should make him happier, the Opposition should not be asking 

</span><span>for  the  services  for  the  purpose  of  attacking  Government  or  even  to  embarrass 

Government. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>127 

</span></div><div><span>I am sure there are areas where the Crown Law Service can assist the Opposition for a 

good purpose that may be of benefit to all.  Maybe that is something that we ourselves 

in Opposition will have to look at later on.  However, I thought I would mention this 

because I think we as a Parliament, as representatives of our people, should look at the 

role of the Crown Law for everyone concerned.  I think it should be fair to say that the 

people in the Opposition, Members in the Opposition, should be allowed access to the 

services of the Crown Law Office. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Are there any further speakers?  The 

Honourable Member for Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I have a question to raise to the Minister.  Seeing that 

the Minister has explained the responsibility of this Department,  I would like to ask 

whether Crown  Law also carry out  the  responsibilities of film  and video censoring?  

Is this censoring business a job for the lawyers to look at?  Is it necessary for these 

lawyers to do the censoring of these videos. Before it was the Police Department who 

</span><span>did all this work. I am surprised.  Just lately John Webb was doing the censoring but 

</span><span>now  I  am  surprised  to  see  t</span><span>hat  it  is  the  Crown  Law’s  responsibility  to  do  the 

</span><span>censoring. I am concerned because of the amount of money that is being used to pay 

these lawyers to censor.  If Government is finding any difficulty to do the censoring I 

would volunteer to do the job. 

</span></div><div><span>This is my question, Mr Chairman that I wish to raise with the Minister responsible. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Attorney-General. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I can see there are two questions 

raised before us.  I think after I finish then we can move on to the next Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition raised the first question.  First of all, the question of the 

application  for  a  declaratory  judgment  that  I  issued  with  regard  to  Inatio  A</span><span>karuru’s 

</span><span>appointment.    He  has  raised  this  matter  over  the  radio,  he  has  taken  this  matter  up 

with the media and it came on the TV about how this Government has wasted a lot of 

money  delaying  the  process.  These  criticisms  were  due  to  the  decision  that  was 

handed  down  by  the  Judge.    And  that  I  as  Attorney  General  was  the  one  who  was 

delaying  this  by-election  in  Pukapuka.  In  Cabinet,  we  deliberated  over  the 

determination of the Court. We wanted to analyse that decision. The Court of Appeal 

ruled  that  the  Election  of  Pukapuka/Nassau  was  null  and  void.    A  By-Election  was 

required.  From that decision we were not sure what the position for Inatio Akaruru 

was.  Because before Parliament was called for the election we know that we all held 

our  various  Offices  as  Members.    We  collected  allowances,  salaries,  and  other 

entitlements vested in us and in Parliament.  And when the Court of Appeal handed 

down its decision they were quiet about what will happen to the Member Inatio, in the 

</span><span>sense  that  a  By-Election  was  called  for  Pukapuka  without  considering  the  effect  of 

</span><span>that determination on the incumbent Member.  I did not apply what I thought would 

be an appropriate measure.  Instead I sought a Court Declaration.  There was a need to 

determine exactly what  the position is  for the former Minister  Inatio Akaruru.  And 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>128 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>whether  there  was  a  determination  on  his  entitlements  as  a  former  Minister  of  the 

Crown,  and  how  the  ruling  affected  his  salary  and  other  entitlements  as  is  the  case 

prior  to  the  General  Election.  The  Chief  Justice  Quilliam  responded  to  our  inquiry 

through the Secretary of the Ministry of Justice.  I will read the answer from the Chief 

Justice: 

</span></div><div><span>“Wellington.  </span><span>

New Zealand 

14</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Terry Hagan, 

Secretary of Justice 

Rarotonga 

</span></div><div><span>I have spoken to Speight </span><span>J. (That’s Justice Speight) about Mr Akaruru’s position.  As I 

</span><span>expected,  the  matter  has  not  been  raised  during  the  Appeal  and  so  no  ruling  could 

have been given on it.  I can see no escape from someone having to file an application 

for a declaratory judgment so that those who are interested or affected can be heard.   

</span><span>At  a  very  quick  look,  it  appears  to  me,  to  be  that  there  will  be  a  question  of 

</span><span>interpretation  to  be  given  to  Section  8  of  the  Civil  List  Act  and  Section  8  of  the 

Electoral  Act  but  I  would  not  wish  to  go  further  than  that  without  the  matter  being 

</span><span>properly argued in Court.”</span></div><div><span>This  is  the  reply  that  we  received  from  the  Chief  Justice  Quilliam  on  our  inquiry 

regarding the determination by the Court of Appeal. This is the reason why I filed a 

request for a Declaratory Judgement. So that it will give us a clear idea of the position 

of  Inatio  Akaruru.    That  is  why  this  request  was  lodged  to  the  High  Court  in  New 

Zealand.    That  is  why  I  came  over  the  national  radio.  To  me  the  criticisms  raised 

against  me  </span><span>were  just  rubbish.  I  wasn’t  the  only  one  who  was  doubtful  about  this 

</span><span>matter, Cabinet was also not sure, even the Chief Justice was doubtful. Well, that is 

why the Chief Justice recommended an application to be filed and let the Court argue 

on the matter. So this is what happened, Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>I’m surprise to hear this question from this Papa.  It seems to me that he is saying that 

</span><span>I am a Lawyer and I am one of those censoring the films. No, Mr Chairman. Nobody 

knows who exactly is doing it.   He was right when he said that Papa John Webb was 

carrying out the censoring but since John Webb passed away we looked for someone 

else  to  carry  out  this  responsibility.  Poko  Tutaka  was  identified  as  the  appropriate 

person.    Maybe  Papa  Pupuke  thought  that  Poko  Tutaka  is  a  lawyer  that  is  why  he 

</span><span>raised  the  question.  There’s  nobody  else  carrying  out  the  censoring  except  for  this 

</span><span>gentleman.  He has a private company and he censor films. So I believe Mr Chairman 

that there will be no further speakers. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Attorney  General.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

The Honourable Member for Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Order please! 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>129 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>To  all  Honourable  Members  and  our  people  listening  in.  Mr 

Chairman  I  have  no  difficulty  with  the  allocation  to  the  Crown  Law.  I  strongly 

support that allocation. But I am very happy to hear the answer given by the Minister 

responsible  for  the  declaration  of  the  By-election  of  Pukapuka.  For  us  in  the 

Opposition side, we have no doubt of the decision by the Chief Justice. If you look at 

</span><span>us  on  the  Opposition  side  there’s  not  even  a  trace  of  a  Member  with  a  lawyer’s 

</span><span>qualification. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  happy  with  the  Clerk  of  Parliament  and  also  with  you  Mr  Chairman  and  your 

staff for the orientation that you gave to our Members just prior to the Pukapuka Court 

decision. Where you clearly defined the tenure of an MP in the Cook Islands.  That is 

</span><span>you’re  no  longer  a  Member  of  Parliament  when  you  die.  These  are  the  conditions 

</span><span>where you no lo</span><span>nger become an MP of this country. And (b) you’re no longer an MP 

of this country when the Court in a Petition declares your seat void.  Now I’m having 

</span><span>second thoughts Mr Chairman. Why are we giving Crown Law so much money and 

still come up with a simple d</span><span>ecision like that?  Why do they need to apply for a “side 

hat”? Not a Declaration but a Clarification from the Court or an explanation. In any 

</span><span>case,  this  was  an  Appeal  to  the  Appeal.  Without  any  law  qualifications  or  law 

</span><span>background, the members of the Opposition were adamant that we will win our case 

</span><span>and we did.   

</span></div><div><span>On a more serious note Mr Chairman there was some public debate about this case.  I 

was  unimpressed  with  the  comment  by  the  Attorney  General  regarding  my  leader.  

His reference to a 4 letter word  was inappropriate of a Minister of the Crown. With 

</span><span>your  permission  Mr  Chairman  I  can  repeat  the  word  but  I  prefer  not  to  and  I  don’t 

think  it’s  appropriate  for  a  Minister  of  the  Crown  to  refer  to  another  colleague 

</span><span>whether  they  are  in  opposition  or  not,  as  such.  The  proper  manner  would  be  an 

apology to the Leader of the Opposition for the use of that word. So that we can go on 

respecting each other.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?    The  Honourable....  order  please!!    The  Honourable  Member  for 

Rakahanga, your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Chairman I rise to remind the Attorney General that in 1994 a 

By-Election was held but the determination of the Appeal Court was exactly the same 

as  the  one  now  in  question.  The  irony  is  that  he  never  sought  for  a  Declaratory 

Judgement.  Mr Chairman, that case  was  against me Mr Chairman and because this 

present  case  is  against  a  Cook  Islands  Party  Member,  then  he  wanted  to  lodge  an 

application.  At the tim</span><span>e Mr Chairman, …  I can hear  another Member saying that  I 

</span><span>should have lost that By-election. I did not loose.  At the By-Election, I got in again, 

although  I  was  in  the  Opposition.  When  the  Determination  was  handed  down  for  a 

By-Election,  the  Government  then  never  sought  any  Declaration  for  me.  However, 

because in the present case a Cook Islands Party Member lost his seat, the Attorney 

General  want  to  lodge  an  application  to  the  court.    I  just  want  to  remind  him  Mr 

Chairman about that case, maybe he forgot about it.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Attorney General.

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  I rise Mr Chairman, to make a statement regarding the views 

expressed  by  the  Honourable  Dr  Robert  Woonton.    He  was  saying  something  about 

what  I  said  with  regard  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.  If  there  is  any 

misconstruction about what I said it is not my word, it must be theirs.  If they refer the 

</span><span>matter to the Oxford Dictionary, the word means “rubbish” and that is</span><span> the context in 

which I have used that word.  If they go back and get a replay from the TV operators, 

they will know that I have tried to explain the word clearly.  It is not intended in the 

way that he and his people and the people siding with him intends it to be.  I will not 

apologise to the Leader of the Opposition because I believe I did not say the word in 

which they have intended it.  I have explained on the Radio that this is rubbish and I 

am not going to apologise. This is what I have said and I shall say it before you Mr 

Chairman and this  House and the  Leader of the  Opposition  - I will never stoop that 

low to take the step which they are inclined to believe I took. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, in  response to the matter raised by this  Papa, about  his  case of Appeal  in 

1994. I wish to apologise to this House because I do not have any information as to 

what was the determination by the Court then.  Therefore, I cannot comment on this 

issue.  The Leader of the Opposition is indicating that the case was similar to this one. 

</span><span>So you may as well put the Question Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Attorney General.  Are there any further speakers? 

There appears to be none. 

</span></div><div><span>I shall put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $295,766 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We move to Culture 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is:  

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $514,406 for Culture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Minister of Cultural Development, the Honourable Member Jim Marurai. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. J. MARURAI:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, Clerk of the House, 

your staff, our listeners and Honourable Member of the House, Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>The  1999/2000  Budget  for  Culture  has  an  increase  of  $99,000  over  the  1998/99 

Appropriation.  Added to that is an amount of $91,000 for Capital Expenditure.  The 

increase, Mr Chairman arises from the following.  The main items are the depreciation 

of  the  National  Auditorium,  the  purchase  of  library  books  for  the  National  Library, 

maintenance of equipment and the stock purchase of the National Auditorium, and the 

filling of two senior posts in the Ministry.  One in the National Archives and one in 

</span><span>the  National  Library.    The  details  for  the  Appropriation  are  in  the  Part  2,  Ministry 

</span><span>Output  Specification,  and  pages  22-28.    You  will  notice  Honourable  Members  that 

there  are  three  main  categories  that  are  divided  into  smaller  subgroups.    The  first 

sector  has  an  appropriation  of  $159,872.    The  second  main  category  is  made  up  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>131 

</span></div><div><span>$123,077  and  the  third  group  is  made  up  of  $81,262.    The  balances  for  the 

Appropriation of $59,095 are miscellaneous expenses.   

</span></div><div><span>There are three main sub-categories in the Sectoral Goals.  In the first sectoral column 

the first one refers mainly to the safekeeping of archival material.  The main problem 

here is the  storage of material.  The present building is in need of repairs hence the 

capital  expenditure  I  mentioned  in  the  Schedule.    $73,000  will  be  put  towards 

repairing the Vaka House building up at Takuvaine Valley.  Hopefully by June 2000 

60%  of  the  documents  will  be  relocated.    The  other  main  items  in  this  group  is  the 

cataloging  and  putting  documents  and  films  on  data  base.    From  this  it  is  hoped  to 

bring some awareness to the availability of our archival material on disc and perhaps 

encourage researchers to use these materials.  The third section in this category refers 

to  again  cataloging  but  the  main  idea  is  to  get  the  public  to  use  the  Library.    The 

second  sector  in  this  Appropriation  refers  to  our  Cultural  and  Historical  sites.    I 

believe this refers to </span><span>Marae</span><span>.  The purpose here is to record the sites and register the 

locations to enable our future generations to have an identification of the sites.  The 

third section refers to the National Museum.  The main idea here is the protection of 

the artifacts.  Not only to protect but also to encourage carvers to reproduce them for 

</span><span>future  use.    At  the  same  time  it  is  hoped  to  record  all  the  artefacts  produced  in  the 

</span><span>Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  will  leave  it  here  at  the  moment  to  save  my  time  to  answer  any 

questions.  I will accept all questions and comments and even criticisms.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Minister.  Are  there  any  speakers?  I  call  on  the 

Honourable Member for Nikao-Panama. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, Kia Orana to you, Kia Orana to the Clerk and 

all staff members of the House.  Kia Orana  also  to  all Honourable Members of this 

House </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you all this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to all the people listening in to our debate in Parliament this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  this  Appropriation  for  the  Ministry  of  Cultural 

Development because I believe that this is an area that we should take care of for our 

future  generation.    And  this  is  all  in  respect  of  our  culture,  our  carvings  and  other 

things that we do - including our language.  Because I believe, Mr Chairman, that this 

is one of the social aspects, which is slowly disappearing in our community. 

</span></div><div><span>In  New  Zealand  today  our  people  are  educating  their  children  between  the  ages  of 

three to five to learn our language.  Here in the Cook Islands our children start off for 

the  first  and  second  year  maybe  speaking  our  language  and  then  any  time  after  that 

they start speaking in English.  This is another area that we should look at so that we 

</span><span>don’t lose our language in the Cook Island</span><span>s.  We should also revive our </span><span>marae</span><span>.  I can 

</span><span>see in our Budget Estimates what you intend to do for these places.  But I can see as I 

</span><span>go on my travels around the back road that there are places that are not being cleaned.  

So  I would like to  ask  the Honourable Minister to  go out  there  yourself and inspect 

these places. Often I find Tourists taking a break at these places but these places are 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>132 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>not  cleaned.    We  are  all  aware  that  a  large  portion  of  our  revenue  comes  tourists. 

Therefore it is appropriate that we look after this industry. 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to some books and records of great events that happened to determine the 

destiny of our country, these should be safe guided.  As we know, the former Justice 

complex  was  burnt  down  and  today  we  find  it  really  difficult  to  reconcile  our 

genealogies.    I believe that  the Ministry of Culture  and the Justice Department  who 

keep the records of our  genealogies should be the exactly same.  Some times in  the 

</span><span>past,  if  you  visit  the  Justice  Department  they  wouldn’t  have  the  recor</span><span>ds  that  you 

require  but  at  the  Theological  College  in  Takamoa  they  have  some  of  the  records.  

However, we have now created confusion in our records to the effect that these three 

record-holding  complexes  have  contradicting  documentation  of  our  histories.  The 

Cultural  Development,  Takamoa  and  the  LDS  Mission  all  have  differing  records. 

Therefore no one is sure what record to follow. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe it is my responsibility to support this vote item because this area is of crucial 

importance  to  a  lot  of  people  who  </span><span>don’t  have  any  genealogy.    I  would  like  to 

</span><span>encourage the staff members in this Ministry to assist our people when they come to 

</span><span>them for help. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  support  the  carvers  who  were  mentioned  and  I  would  like  to  say  that  they 

should be creative and at the same time, they should have some moral obligations. I 

</span><span>don’t  believe  that  these  very  huge  Tangaroas  are  appropriate  and  some  people  are 

</span><span>looking at these Tangaroas from different perspectives. In the past when I was young I 

never used to see the statue of Tangaroa as we see them today.  If you look at what 

artists used to draw we never used to see the Tangaroa drawn that way.
