<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  been  asked  when  we  will  become  the  Government.    It  will  be  on  the  29</span><span>th</span><span>  of 

next month, September. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Dream, dream.   (Then sings)  Dream, dream, dream, dream, 

</span><span>dream, dream. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  So,  Mr  Chairman,  I  give  this  appropriation  for  the  Public 

Expenditure  Review  Committee  my  full  support  and  I  commend  the  people  on  this 

Committee for their good work thus far.  I support them wholeheartedly.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I heard someone singing so I 

give the floor to that singer. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  I hope you enjoyed it, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  am  just  admiring  those  Honourable  Members,  including  yourself, 

who are wearing a bow tie in the House.  I think you are setting a trend in the House.  

I would like to have one if you can give me your spare one. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, to you and to all the Honourable Members in the House this afternoon 

</span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana.  To all of our people listening in </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, before I speak on the Vote Item, I have a small announcement to make.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, it is  with sadness  that  I announce  to  this House and to the nation  the 

passing  away  of  Judge  Alistair  McHugh  earlier  this  morning.    Mr  Justice  McHugh 

arrived in the country in the weekend.  He presided in Court yesterday and he was due 

to hold a series of Land Court hearings this week and next week and when he failed to 

</span><span>turn  up  to  Court  this  morning  the  Court  staff  visited  the  Judge’s  house  in  Arorangi 

</span><span>where  his  body  was  discovered.    He  appeared  to  have  died  in  his  sleep.    I  want  to 

advise  this  House  that  the  Secretary  of  Justice  has  advised  Mrs  McHugh.    The 

condolences of the Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and the people of this country 

</span><span>have been conveyed to Mrs McHugh.  All arrangements about taking the body back to 

</span><span>New Zealand is being arranged by the Justice Department.  The Secretary of Justice, 

Mr  Terry  Hagan  will  be  accompanying  the  body  back  to  New  Zealand  tomorrow 

morning.    I  am  also  pleased  to  advise  that  the  former  Minister  of  Justice,  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>118 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Tiki Matapo has graciously accepted our request to represent this country 

</span><span>at Judge McHugh’s funeral when tha</span><span>t is held either later this week or early next week.  

We  are  indebted  to  the  former  Honourable  Tiki  Matapo  for  accepting  our  humble 

request.   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  sure,  Mr  Chairman,  that  this  House,  including  yourself  as  Speaker,  the  Prime 

Minister, Sir Geoffrey Henry, the Ministers of Cabinet, the Leader of the Opposition 

and  the  Caucuses  on  both  sides  of  the  House,  join  our  people  in  extending  our 

condolences to Mrs McHugh. The Prayers of the entire nation go to Mrs McHugh and 

all their family and relations. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  want  to  announce  that  all  further  hearings  which  were  scheduled  have  been 

suspended and we do have other Judges  on our roster ready to  take over  as soon as 

possible. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you  for  your  indulgence  Mr  Chairman.    That  concludes  that  particular 

announcement. 

</span></div><div><span>I now turn my attention to the Vote Item allocated for PERCA.  I would like to extend 

</span><span>my total and wholehearted support for this Vote allocation.  I think this is one of the 

most outstanding creations of the former Cook Islands Party Government and as Sir 

Geoffrey is  in  the House, as he was the Prime Minister that led this  creation, may  I 

say to him, Congratulations!  PERCA has proven to be very efficient, able to flush out 

deficiencies  and  even  corruptions  and  criminal  behaviours  in  the  Public  Service.    It 

would  appear  to  me  that  PERCA  will  grow  in  importance  in  our  society.    There  is 

clearly a need for it.  So under the present climate of the reform process we shifted a 

lot of fiscal responsibilities from Ministers to HOMs, to Heads of Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>In the reform process there is a lot of delegation of powers spread right throughout the 

Public Service. This is to show clearly the transparency desired by Government and as 

</span><span>a result of the past Government’s suffering under the continuous assault on them by 

</span><span>the  media  about  malpractice,  about  allegations  of  corruption,  etc,  delegation  of 

powers  was  inevitable.    It  never  ceases  to  amaze  me  that  when  it  comes  to  every 

aspect of public conduct, the politicians are always slammed from one corner to the 

other while others using public funds seem to be able to dance, to waltz, to jitterbug, 

to get away with anything. 

</span></div><div><span>The  public  servants’  massive  overseas  travel  never  even  raises  an  eyebrow.    Every 

</span><span>conceivable act that they do </span><span>–</span><span> they are allowed to drive around in the latest limousines 

and  nobody  wants  to  say  anything  about  it.    But  the  moment  I  use  a  car  it  makes 

headlines everywhere. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on Deputy Prime Minister for your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    They  pay  themselves  annual  bonuses  from  public  funds.  

Nobody  utters  a  word.    They  pay  themselves  enormous  salaries  and  nobody 

</span><span>complains.  I don’t know what happened to the junkie journalists.  They completely 

</span><span>ignored  that  kind  of  behaviour  and  concentrated  on  politicians.    Surprisingly,  or 

unsurprisingly, when we were going through this Budget, Mr Chairman, they made an 

allocation of $240,000 to pay them even more allowances.  When we saw it, we just 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>119 

</span></div><div><span>about froze on the spot and said, “Here we go again”.  When we counted the number 

</span><span>of  HOMs  who  would  receive  part  of  this  money  as  Annual  Bonuses  for  them,  they 

</span><span>would each collect $16,000 bonus on top of their salaries.  That’s on top of the flash 

</span><span>cars  they  drive  around  and  their  huge  salaries.      None  of  which  is  below  $50,000.  

And  yet  they  never  get  any  attention  from  the  media.    Even  when  Cabinet  was  just 

browsing through the Civil List, just browsing through the Civil List did you hear the 

</span><span>thunderous attack?  We can’t even look at it.  So it goes.</span></div><div><span>Now the end result is we have the potential to have a runaway Public Service in our 

system.    In  New  Zealand  they  are  almost  totally  out  of  control.  There  was  a  recent 

example  a  few  months  ago,  where  a  Head  of  Ministry  in  the  Work  and  Support 

Services  authorised  the  charter  of  an  aircraft  to  fly  the  departmental  members  to 

</span><span>Taupo for a conference at a cost of $60,000 to the New Zealand taxpayers.  I’m sure if 

</span><span>they had a PERCA set up over there PERCA would have tackled it.  Maybe thanks to 

the last Government  we now have a PERCA to tackle exactly that kind  of problem.  

</span><span>And  it’s  still  happening.    It’s  been  drawn  to  our  attention  that  one  individual  in  the 

</span><span>Ministry  recently,  a  few  days  ago,  a  few  weeks  ago,  managed  to  highjack  money 

intended for Small States into a development </span><span>–</span><span>I won’t give you too much ground at 

</span><span>this stage.  But to spend large amount of money in something that will benefit him and 

</span><span>his family. This was done with the knowledge of others in a Government department.  

</span><span>I dare say to this House that this is another case that’s ready to be referred to PERC</span><span>A 

</span><span>in the next few days.  Of course I’m sure the media will remain silent about it as they 

always have.  So it’s only politicians who will cop and the others can get away.  But 

I’m very very glad that we have a PERCA Committee to handle all these.  The peop</span><span>le 

who are sitting on PERCA have impeccable reputations and these are one of the few 

exceptional  individuals  that  we  have  in  our  community.    So  I  hope  that  this 

Committee  will  continue  with  its  good  work  and  that  if  they  do  need  more  powers, 

these be given </span><span>to them. I’m also glad that Government had suggested to continue the 

</span><span>right  of  New  Zealand  Audit,  to  examine  our  books.    That  is  one  proof  way  of 

guaranteeing that no access from outside is made available to penetrate our offshore 

industry.  And the result of that move is that no information can possibly leak out or 

be subjected to subpoena in New Zealand as a result of their access to our records. 

</span></div><div><span>I also have words of caution to mention to the Director of Audit who is  responsible 

for  PERCA.  That  his  personal  behaviour  needs  very  close  attention.  Our  head  of 

Audit should be above suspicion, should behave above the normal and we expect him 

to  display  the  responsibility  of  a  man  holding  an  important  post  because  this 

Government will not tolerate any poor performances.  I would also caution him that 

the  Government  vehicle  that  he  drives  around  should  not  be  driven  to  homebrew 

schools or nightclubs.   

</span></div><div><span>I conclude Mr Chairman by congratulating PERCA for their outstanding performance 

and also to wish them even more and better luck, and efficient in the new year.  Thank 

you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  Are  there  any  further 

</span><span>speakers?  The Honourable Sir Geoffrey Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker, 

Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Leader of the Opposition, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>120 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Honourable Members of this House and also to 

our people listening in this afternoon.  Kia Orana in the name of our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>I  have  no  doubt  Mr  Chairman  that  a  large  number  of  people  are  listening  in  to  our 

</span><span>debate this afternoon.   Because I’m sure they are listening in to the debate over the 

</span><span>Appropriation  Bill  that we have before the House for this  country   - to  see how  we 

distribute  the  funds  amongst  various  departments.    So  to  our  people  Mr  Chairman 

who are listening to us near and far, greetings in the love of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I  stand  Mr  Chairman  to  support  the  allocation  for  the  Public  Expenditure  Review 

Committee and Audit. This is not a very big department Mr Chairman.  In fact there 

are a very few people who work there.  We have a relatively small Committee while 

the Audit staff is cut back to the minimum.  However, the amount of money that has 

been allocated to them reflects the importance of the responsibilities that they carry.  

In here we are agreeing Mr Chairman, to grant to this branch of Government activity 

</span><span>more than half a million dollars for just a handful of people.  But I don’t think there’s 

anyone in this House and I don’t </span><span>think anyone else outside of this House who would 

question the importance of the work that this Committee does in terms of maintaining 

</span><span>the integrity in the spending of Government funds.   

</span></div><div><span>What we’ve done in creating this body Mr Chairman, is very unusual </span><span>and is not found 

anywhere else in the Commonwealth.  Elsewhere a Parliamentary Public Expenditure 

Review Committee comprising of politicians is to be found.  So you have a situation 

there where the politicians, where watchdogs are themselves, which is a rather strange 

arrangement.    Here  what  we  have  is  a  Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee 

comprising  of  professionals  from  the  private  sector.    And  this  has  been  a  source  of 

wonder  marvelled  by  many,  particularly  by 

the 

Commonwealth because their systems are entirely different from ours.   

</span></div><div><span>the  Parliamentarians 

</span></div><div><span>in 

</span></div><div><span>The second important principle embodied in the construction of that Committee is the 

principle  of  independence.    A  principle  which  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition 

well  covered.    A  principle  that  I  believe  is  important  in  any  watchdogging  activity, 

particularly financial watchdogging.  So at the first glance, when we have a look at the 

Act  it  may  seem  a  little  confusing  that  the  lines  of  communications  are  somewhat 

different.  But all this has been put in place to allow this Committee to be fearlessly 

</span><span>independent  in  its  investigations.    If  you  are  a  politician  it’s  not  fun  being 

</span><span>investigated.   History has shown that politicians tend to react rather violently to any 

investigation  into  their  activities  or  their  work.    We  therefore  have  to  approve  or  in 

fact  accept  a system  whereby independent  investigation can be conducted.  Not just 

the  politicians  but  the  public  servants  as  well.    Without  that  investigation  being 

blunted by the reactions from politicians or public servants.  And we all know that the 

Ministry of Finance Act has set down the rules.   

</span></div><div><span>That  Act  lays  down the  rules for both  Ministers  and Departmental Heads as to  how 

they are to lawfully spend the money of this country.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    I  </span><span>have  to  interrupt  you  Honourable  Member.    It’s  time  to  take 

</span><span>our break. This sitting is suspended until 3 o’clock.</span></div>
