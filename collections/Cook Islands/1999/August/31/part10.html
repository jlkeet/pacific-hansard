<div><span>SITTING RESUMED 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Be seated please Honourable Members.  The Sitting is resumed. 

The Honourable Sir Geoffrey Henry was the last speaker and he is not in the House.  I 

call for the next speaker?  Oh, here he is.  Sir Geoffrey, you have the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I was talking about one of the 

fundamental  principles  involved  in  the  construction  of  PERCA,  Public  Expenditure 

Review Committee and Audit. Mainly, the principle of independence. Mr Chairman, 

as rightly pointed out by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, PERCA is responsible 

directly to Parliament.  And that in fact the appointments of members of that Board is 

so  convoluted  that  the  dismissal  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  is  very  difficult  to 

achieve.  We  borrowed  that  principle  from  the  Constitution  that  established  the 

position  of  the  Speaker  where  the  Speaker  cannot  be  whimsically  removed  from 

office except by Parliament. We know that it is important that the independence of the 

Chair is seen to be maintained and therefore the Constitution was amended to ensure 

that  there  will  have  to  be  very  strong  feelings  against  the  Speaker  before  he  can  be 

</span><span>removed. That removal has to have a two-thirds majority support. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on Honourable for your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  And I think to a larger than a 

lesser extent, the current Act has succeeded in preserving that particular principle.  I 

believe to a larger than a lesser extent PERCA has worked very well in carrying out 

their  responsibility  under  their  Act.    They  have  written  many  reports  about  certain 

aspects  of  Government  administration  and  Government  management  of  finance.  

Many  of  these  have  come  through  to  us  and  many  in  fact  have  become  public 

documents.  I believe, Mr Chairman, the Committee together with the staff of Audit 

over  the  last  year  have  done  a  very  good  job  in  carrying  out  their  watchdog 

responsibility and I think they deserve our congratulations.   

</span></div><div><span>We  may  need  to  look  at  some  of  the  procedures  of  the  investigations  conducted  by 

PERCA.    For  example,  Mr  Chairman,  the  question  concerning  the  sale  of  the 

Rarotongan Hotel.  The Report on that activity was tabled in Parliament and yet at no 

time did PERCA meet with the main players of that activity. Such as myself, Lloyd 

Powell,  the  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Rarotongan  Hotel  and  the 

purchaser, Mr Tata Crocombe.  I find it incredible to believe that a Report at that time 

could  be  completed  without  a  proper  interview  with  the  main  players  involved.    So 

maybe  we  need  to  look  at  that  and  maybe  we  need  to  specify  in  the  Act  how  the 

procedures of investigation have to be carried out. And that with as much information 

as they have must be fully presented to Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>Some  have  commented  on  what  they  see  as  a  toothless  watchdog.    In  other  words 

even after investigations, when they find something is not quite right they are not in a 

position to effect a prosecution.  I think we need to have a clear understanding of the 

</span><span>role of PERCA.  PERCA is an investigative body.  It researches carefully the manner 

</span><span>in  which  Government  finances  are  spent  and  how  Government  assets  are  used.    If 

there is some wrong doings and they have found some incriminating acts or some acts 

of corruptions, it is not for them to prosecute.  It is clear perhaps that a further change 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>122 

</span></div><div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>to  the Act  could  be  contemplated because the PERCA Act  does not specifically tell 

PERCA  what  to  do  when  they  find  some  act  of  corruption  or  some  criminal 

behaviour.   What it says is for them to write a Report and in that Report may be some 

mention of wrong behaviours.  Then they must present that Report to the Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps  we  might  consider  making  a  provision  whereby  if  they  saw  fit  they  should 

refer  their  Report  to  the  Commissioner  of  Police  as  well.    I  am  aware  too  Mr 

Chairman, there has been some delay in the presentation of Reports.  Some Reports 

have come to Parliament and the delay is  when these Reports are tabled.  We could 

give  some  thought  to  that  problem.  In  our  Standing  Orders  we  make  sure  that  the 

Audit  Report  must  be  tabled  in  Parliament.    This  House  could  give  some 

consideration to the thought that the Standing Order specifically also require that this 

House debate the Reports of PERCA.  

</span></div><div><span>We also need to be careful about the content or composition of the Committee. We do 

not have such a large pool of professionals from which to draw the appropriate skills 

for  this  Committee  without  conflict  of  interests.  Many  of  the  professionals  in  our 

country, accountants, lawyers are working either for themselves or for one company 

</span><span>or  another.  Or  the  legal  advisors  for  companies  or  people  or  several  people  in  the 

</span><span>country.  And ours is a very small community, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your last speech, Sir Geoffrey. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>So it is therefore difficult to put together a body of professionals without a situation of 

conflicts of interests arising.  I know, however, Mr Chairman that the Members of this 

Committee  are  very  very  careful  about  that  issue.    And  I  know  that  they  absent 

themselves from any discussions where there is a conflict of interest but that is not the 

only problem.  For the simple reason, Mr Chairman, ours being a small community, 

we know everybody.  And while we seek to preserve the independence of PERCA it 

is  impossible  to  stop  them  from  being  friendly  or  having  friendship  with  people 

outside of their own sphere.  Our House, this House, has very diligently preserved the 

independence of this  Committee.  There is  no way, however, Mr Chairman, we can 

stop  them  being  subjected  to  commercial  influence.    Therefore,  Mr  Chairman,  I 

believe that this House should give careful thought to the question of the composition 

of  this  Committee  so  that  it  achieves  as  far  as  it  is  possible  that  principle  of 

independence  from  politics,  independence  from  social  and  community  influences. 

And  that  they  be  guided  and  they  be  strictly  guided  by  the  responsibilities  and  the 

functions prescribed for them in their Act. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I stand in support of the allocation for PERCA.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

I call on the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.
