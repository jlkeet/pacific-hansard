<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Interrupted debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,485,694 for Foreign  Affairs stands part of the Schedule?</span></div><div><span>The last Member who spoke was the Leader of the Opposition.  You have seven more 

minutes to go on your second speech.  You have the Floor Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you, to your staff, 

Honourable Members and our people listening in this afternoon.  Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday Mr Chairman,  I  expressed my  concern for the lack of the numbers in  the 

Government side.  So I am pleased to see that the Honourable Member Teina Bishop 

is  now  back  in  the  House  but  I  still  fail  to  see  the  Honourable  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry 

taking part in the sitting today. I see the Prime Minister is indicating that Sir Geoffrey 

is down with some illness so I think we should accept that. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman with regard to this Vote Item we are debating right now I was looking at 

the  aid  money  brought  into  our  country.    The  aid  given  to  our  country  has  been 

mismanaged.    It  is  becoming  a  problem  for  aid  donors.    Sometimes  they  give  aid 

</span><span>through  materials  and  resources,  which  often  lead  to  abuses  by  some  people. 

</span><span>Sometimes it is the leaders who are abusing these things. I can recall sometimes ago a 

car was donated by the Chinese Government and this donation was abused. I am sure 

the Deputy Prime Minister would recall this matter because he was the one who took 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>227 

</span></div><div><span>the  matter  to  the  Police.    I  am  sure  that  when  it  comes  to  his  time  to  speak  he  will 

elaborate  on  this  matter.    I  am  sure  he  will  not  be  able  to  comment    on  this  issue 

because  right  now  they  are  forming  the  Government  of  this  country.    These  are  the 

kind  of  things  which  our  people  are  very  much  concerned  in  the  manner  we  are 

managing these aids to our country. This issue has been on my mind for a while.  This 

will be the second last day of the budget debate and there is no doubt that Government 

will be depending on us to support the passage of this budget tomorrow.   

</span></div><div><span>I want to express my views if you would allow me to Mr Chairman because there are 

some Vote Items in our Schedule we will not be able to debate on by tomorrow.  The 

Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati has brought this matter to our notice, which is 

the Ministerial Support vote. 

</span></div><div><span>If we all require each other to support the Budget that we have before the House, I am 

requesting that we on the Opposition side be allowed to speak on any Vote Item that 

we wish to speak on in the Schedule. You must realise  Mr Chairman, that what I am 

trying to do is to support the passage of this Budget so that we can implement it. I can 

also see that the Members of Government have taken up a lot of time, which inhibits 

</span><span>our chances of reaching some of the votes at the end.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  You now have your last speech.  Do you wish to proceed? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman. I am making this request to the 

Minister responsible, the Minister of Finance or to the Prime Minister, in order that I 

may  be  in  a  position  to  determine  how  our  side  can  debate  the  rest  of  this  Budget. 

Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>the  Chair  cannot  answer  your  request.    This  is  a  Government 

Business.    Therefore  you  should  approach  the  Government  as  Leader  of  the 

Opposition  to  negotiate  how  the  rest  of  the  Votes  can  be  debated.    However,  in 

accordance with the Standing Orders I cannot permit any Member to debate at length 

on a Vote other than Foreign Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>Deputy Prime Minister, you wish to speak on the matter?  Not on the Vote but on the 

matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Yes I do.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I was in fact going to get 

the ball rolling by moving  that the question be put on this Vote Item 

</span></div><div><span>And in doing so, I would like to indicate to the Chair that the Government wants to 

enter the spirit of enthusiasm to cover whatever subject there is in this Budget.  We 

want to enter the spirit by encouraging the Opposition to traverse this Budget as much 

as they can, if they want to  move along quickly.   At this time we hand the drum to 

them. They beat the drum and if they want to stop, we stop. They fire the questions 

and we are entitled to reply.  We welcome their questions and comments so long as 

they also give us the courtesy to have the right of reply. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank you Norm. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>228 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  It will only benefit the standing of this House if the Members 

of  this  House  are  given  total  freedom  to  ask  any  question  they  wish  to  do  so  and  I 

want to assure the Opposition that the Coalition Government will have all the answers 

to their questions.  I share their frustrations because I myself was in Opposition for a 

long  long  time  and  we  were  never  able  to  get  to  the  Vote  Allocation  for  Ministers.  

Even though I know I will get most of the firing because I have the largest allocation.  

I can tell you the replies I will give you will deafen you with those correct answers. 

</span></div><div><span>We also do this in the spirit of transparency and reform, Mr Chairman.  This is what it 

is all about.  I want to serve notice on all Members of this House that this is a clear 

indication of the flexibility of the policies of the Coalition Government. I would also 

like to see in the near future a Question Day in the House.  Maybe every day we kick 

off with the first half an hour as a Question hour when anybody can raise questions 

with  any  Member  in  the  House.    Maybe  we  prefer  Question  hour  every  day  rather 

than wait for once a week every Thursday. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  in  conclusion,  Mr  Chairman,  we  go  along  with  the  request  of  the  Opposition.  

Therefore, I would like the question on the Vote for Foreign Affairs to be put now so 

</span><span>we can move along with the Opposition rolling the drums.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of Government Business.  I will now put the 

question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,485,694 for Foreign Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Justice Department. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $924,700 for Justice stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    I  would  like  at  this  time  to 

thank Government for responding to our request to speed up the debate on the Budget 

schedule  in  order  for  us  to  get  down  to  votes  where  we  never  had  time  to  debate 

before.  I trust the Honourable Members on the Opposition side will be able to raise 

questions  and  the  concerns  we  have  been    talking  about.    As  we  know,  today  and 

tomorrow are the only days left for us to debate on this Budget. That is up to us. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  we  are  talking  about  $924,700.00  allocated  for  the  Justice  Department  in 

Rarotonga.   I have nothing much on this matter.   I just want  to  emphasise the point 

that I want more progress on this debate. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  The Member for Nikao-Panama. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Good  afternoon  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  at  this  time  to 

Greet you and the staff members of this House. To all Honourable Members on both 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>229 

</span></div><div><span>sides of the House and to our people listening in to our debate, Good afternoon to you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a question to raise Mr Chairman. I heard some rumours that something is going 

to happen to the money for land rentals money held in trust by the Registrar. I heard 

that this money would be transferred elsewhere if the land owners fail to collect them.  

This  is  a  major  concern  where  there  are  a  number  of  share  holders  who  are  not 

residing here in the Cook Islands.  One day those owners will return and then they can 

uplift their money. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to suggest that maybe the Justice Department could use the interest of the 

fund to assist with the administration.  Even if the original land owners pass away, the 

succeeding issues can collect that money.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Member of Parliament for Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA: </span><span>Mr Chairman, Kia Orana to you in the name of our Lord.  Kia Orana 

also  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and 

</span><span>Government Members.  Kia Orana in the name of our Lord.  Kia Orana  to the Leader 

</span><span>of the Opposition,  your right hand man the Deputy Leader and the Members on this 

side  of  the  House.    Kia  Orana  in  the  name  of  the  Lord.    Kia  Orana  to  our  people 

listening  in  to  this  discussion  in  this  Honourable  House.    Kia  Orana  also  to  the 

administrators in the Ministry of Justice in Rarotonga and in the Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>First of all I support this Allocation so that this Ministry can do what it is supposed to 

do. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  speak  on  this  Ministry  of  Justice  with  regard  to  the  Offices  of  this 

Ministry  in  the  Outer  Islands.    I  have  been  a  Justice  of  the  Peace  on  the  Island  on 

Akatokamanava and I thought it would be appropriate for me to highlight a couple of 

matters  for  us  to  contemplate.    I  believe  that  the  Justices  of  the  Peace  on  the  Outer 

Islands  are  part  of  this  Ministry.    While  I  was  a  JP,  I  have  had  some  problems  in 

executing  my  duties.  Particularly  in  presiding  over  Court  cases.    We  need  to 

strengthen  the  position  of  Justice  of  the  Peace,  their  knowledge  and  capabilities.  I 

have found that at times I have had difficulties in reaching a proper decision because 

of my limited knowledge of the Law.  The only thing I have which is of benefit to me 

is the fact that I understand a little English and therefore am able to decipher some of 

the language which is basically technical legal language for lawyers.  So I would like 

to ask the Minister responsible for this Vote Item if it is possible for some workshops 

to be held to assist the Justices of the Peace. The people are watching how the J.</span><span>P’s 

are performing.  In some Acts, the JPs can’t comprehend. In some instances, such as a  

</span><span>young man who may be closely related to me, I feel totally out of place presiding over 

his case because of my relationship with him. This is why I brought this matter to this 

House.  We need to look into it. I know of a case where the JP was forced to make a 

decision  over  a  case  brought  before  him  and  the  offender  was  a  grandchild.    The 

sentence given to that person was less than the sentence given to another offender of a 

</span><span>similar  crime.    If  the  Justices  of  the  Peace  are  going  to  do  this  how  can  the  people 

</span><span>believe in justice being served on their individual islands?  I am not criticising anyone 

in particular but we should be made aware of this. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>230 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on with your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span>  Thank you.  In another case, a person was sentenced to serve a term 

in prison in Rarotonga.  But because of the lack of funds, this person ended up doing 

community service. This  young man re-offended and the problem the Police Officer 

had to grapple with was that if the case goes back to the Court, the young man would 

still remain in Mauke doing community service. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I would like to speak about the Land Division.  I believe it is time for the 

Judges of the Land Court Division and of the High Court to be localised.  Such as Mr 

Nikau  Tangaroa  who  has  been  involved  in  land  dealings  and  High  Court  work.    I 

believe  he  would  be  most  suitable  to  be  appointed  as  a  Judge  of  the  Land  Court.  

Another person  is Mrs Rima David who has been involved with the Land Court for 

many, many years. I believe she would make a good Land Court Judge.  There may be 

other  people  who  would  be  appropriate  because  they  have  the  knowledge  and  are 

aware of our local customs.  Whereas a European Judge does not know our customs.  

As an example there was a case on the Island of Mauke where there were two parties. 

One  party  had  a  lawyer  and  the  other  did  not.    The  party  with  the  lawyer  won  the 

</span><span>Court Case and the other party lost.  And yet the people knew there was an error in 

</span><span>judgement. What we have also found is that a person who has money to pay  a lawyer 

will end up with the land and a person who cannot afford a lawyer will lose. 

</span></div><div><span>My  last  request  through  the  Minister  is  in  regard  to  a  group  of  women  who  were 

asked to cater for the last Elections on the Island.  Since that day these women have 

</span><span>not  been  paid.    This  is  the  CICC  Women’s  Ekalesia  Group  from  Oiretumu.    It  has 

</span><span>been a long time and no one has paid them.  They need their money to assist in their 

services to the Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  all  Honourable  Members  in  this  House  because  I  can  see  the 

progress we are making in trying to complete this budget.  So to all Members on the 

Government  side  I  thank  you  on  behalf  of  myself  and  Members  of  the  Opposition.  

You have not ignored our plight in terms of the limited time available to us. And you 

have  also  used  this  as  a  basis  for  progressive  debate.    To  the  two  Honourable 

Members on this side of the House the corrective side, thank you very much for your 

support.    To  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  Deputy  Leader  and  the  Honourable 

Member Dr Pupuke Robati who have given their support to us the new boys on this 

team, Thank you.  We are trying hard to learn the ropes of this game. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member for Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:  </span><span>Greetings to you Mr Chairman, Greetings to Members of Parliament 

this afternoon.  I rise to  give my support to the Justice Department appropriation.  I 

would  submit  the  Minister  one  minor  request.  This  is  in  regard  to  search  fees.  Our 

people  have  to  pay  some  high  fees  in  order  to  have  access  to  these  books.    I  am 

</span><span>inviting for the fees to be reduced. 

</span></div><div><span>These  people  are  landowners  but  because  they  do  not  have  enough  money.    As  a 

result, they are not able to go through these books and in some cases they end up with 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>231 

</span></div><div><span>no  land.    Those  who  have  the  money  are  better  off  in  preparing  their  cases  before 

going to Court. Otherwise I would like to congratulate Mr Terry Hagan and his staff.  

I think they are doing a good job in the Land Court. 

</span></div><div><span>With  your  permission  Mr  Speaker,  yesterday  the  Prime  Minister  asked  if  I  could 

speak on the issue of manganese nodules.  I would like to ask if I may speak on it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>You can touch on it but you cannot speak at length.  If you wait 

until we get to Marine Resources which is two items down then you can speak to your 

</span><span>heart’s content.</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  TAIO:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    The  reason  I  did  not  speak  yesterday  is 

because  last  night  I  rang  Norway  to  find  out  some  up  to  date  information  on  the 

manganese nodules on our seabed.  I was lucky in my call last night. When  I  rang the 

person in charge had just returned from the United States some five minutes earlier.  

To those people who do not know anything about Norway, it is a land of rocks right 

from the mountains down to the sea. So their money comes from the ocean.  We are in 

the same position because we have such a large ocean we have to look at the ocean to 

</span><span>assure us of our future.   

</span></div><div><span>We  are  very  lucky.    When  I  was  in  Norway  I  met  two  of  the  leading  experts  on 

manganese nodules in the world.  I met them through our Honorary Consul in Norway 

Mr Huriby. He is working for us without pay.  During the discussions which was held 

here, there was a memorandum of understanding signed by the former Prime Minister 

Sir Geoffrey Henry and the Cook Islands Government.  Subsequent to that there have 

been discussions with quite a few others with regards to manganese nodules.  There 

are  several  countries  exploring  to  mine  manganese  nodules  including  South  Korea, 

China, India, the United States and Taiwan.  They are all working on this manganese 

project.  It is up to the Government of today to decide whom we are going to take as a 

partner  on  this  venture.    Today  Norway  is  the  country  with  the  most  advanced 

technology with regards to mining manganese nodules.  My friend told me last night 

that  the  world  knows  that  biggest  nodule  deposit  in  the  world  is  here  in  the  Cook 

Islands.  One may ask, why are they  interested in the Cook Islands?  The answer is 

that our manganese is very rich in  cobalt.  In other countries companies have to dig 

huge areas but do not get very much cobalt because cobalt is the ore with the highest 

price tag.   

</span></div><div><span>The two scientists I met while I was there are Willie Oleson and Jan Mathesen.  Willie 

Oleson  has  moved  into  Government  as  an  advisor  for  Foreign  Affairs  and  Jan 

Mathesen is still in charge of the development of manganese nodules.  Our status to 

date  in  Norway  is  as  follows.  They  have  had  a  change  of  Government  there  in  the 

recent  past  and  the  progress  o  this  project  has  been  a  slow.  But  it  has  not  been 

shelved. Willie Oleson is the key man behind the initiation of this project in the Cook 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Please carry on Honourable Member with your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  In the middle of October, the Parliament of 

Norway will meet again.  One of the subjects on the agenda is manganese nodules in 

the Cook Islands.  The good news I would like to give you today is that the industries 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>232 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>in  Norway who will do  the work with  regards to the manganese have their hope on 

their Government.  They are ready to get this started in the Cook Islands.  What they 

are waiting for is for the Government of the day to give the signal.  What they have 

asked  us  to  look  into  is  to  develop  a  stable  Government.    They  cannot  invest  in  an 

unstable Government because it is risky to the investors. 

</span></div><div><span>I will travel to Norway in October.  I will be travelling for other business but  I will 

also be meeting these people on the manganese project.  I will pay my own fare.  This 

is what Norway has given us to date. 

</span></div><div><span>We  all  know  that  they  are  one  of  the  leading  suppliers  of  petroleum  in  the  world 

today.    They  are  also  one  of  the  leading  nations  in  fisheries.    While  I  was  there  I 

looked at 870 different salmon farms but I only managed to visit two.  The Norwegian 

</span><span>people don’t go out into the cold  frozen  waters to fish. They raise the fish close to 

</span><span>land and farm them there.  They have asked us to decide which country we would like 

to have a partnership with.  Norway has the finance, they have the funds, they have 

the technology and they also have the know-how with regard to fisheries. 

</span></div><div><span>One hundred years ago this was a very poor country.  They have worked hard.  They 

</span><span>have tried their hand at everything and today it is a very rich country.  They think in 

five years time they will be one of the biggest finance investors in the world. 

</span></div><div><span>So my question to the Government of today is, are we striking a partnership with the 

right people?  Are we going to be safe in the hands of the Norwegians or the Chinese 

hands?  Perhaps on my return I will tell you a little bit more.  But one point I will say 

is that Norwegians have already been here for the last 100 years. They are part of the 

Cook Islands now. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I finish, this gentleman I spoke to in Norway is very confident that this venture 

will commence very soon and they have not let go of this idea.  So for all these people 

who have thought that these rocks are for fishing, no this is a resource. I really think 

that these people in Norway are not lying. The world knows of this great wealth that 

we have at the bottom of our ocean.  So we must all remember that Norway has the 

finance, Norway has the expertise, and they themselves can mine this wealth from the 

oceans.  And because they are also a fishing nation, this will also be of benefit to us 

because we have such a large ocean that is not been harvested.  What they have asked 

is that at the end of the day they want the Cook Islands to be 100 per cent owners of 

this project. 

</span></div><div><span>I will leave the Government to make the final decisions  and I  think that we should 

look into this matter very seriously. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Good on you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  That is all I want to say. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

</span><span>speakers?  There appears to be none.  I call on the Minister of Justice. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>233 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I should only take about five minutes.  I want to 

kick  off  by  announcing  that  the  Justice  Department  is  holding  the  deposits  of  17 

candidates of the last General Elections.  Their $500 is being held.  It is ready to be 

handed  out.    There  are  17  people  who  contested  the  last  General  Election  who  had 

</span><span>their deposits ready to be paid out.   $12,500 is waiting to be collected.  If you don’t 

</span><span>collect it, it will be for my Christmas funds. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  I will follow the sequence of questions.   I  am  very  grateful  to  the  Honourable 

Members  in  Opposition  who  raised  these  questions  and  I  shall  answer  them  in  the 

order in which those were raised. 

</span></div><div><span>Currently the Justice Department is holding $1.1 million in trust money.  That money 

has  been  sitting  there  since  1965.    Under  the  Unclaimed  Moneys  Act  of  1973  the 

Justice Department can hold that money for up to six years.  Under the present MFEM 

Act of 1997 they can only hold that money for up to three years.  Under the present 

arrangement that three years expires in December 1999, the end of the year.   

</span></div><div><span>We propose to give as much publicity as possible here in the Cook Islands. When a 

</span><span>couple  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice  staff  travel  to  New  Zealand  and  Australia  we  will 

</span><span>encourage them to publicise to our people there about the need for them to check their 

entitlements in this land trust account kept by the Ministry of Justice.  I understand the 

Law Society of the Cook Islands have made a submission to the Ministry of Justice to 

try and extend this period as they are still having trouble tracking people down.    You 

will understand that the Ministry is only doing this to help although legally they are 

not entitled to hold on to this money after December. 

</span></div><div><span>And the handling of land trust money, the handling of land rentals is not a function of 

the Justice Department.  Their function is to safeguard money that has been deposited 

for Court actions, for damages, for other areas in law - other than land money.  So the 

question is what happens when the period expires?  What happens when none of these 

people  claim  the  money?    What  will  happen?  The  money  will  go  as  part  of  public 

funds.  It will be deposited into the Public Account.  So I agree with the sentiments 

expressed  by  the  Honourable  Member  for  Nikao-Panama  that  further  attempts  be 

made  to  invite  our  people.    You  see  a  lot  of  difficulties,  Mr  Chairman.    If  it  is  for 

example land money,  while the next-of-kin are living overseas some of them have not 

succeeded to their lands. So they have to come back to the Cook Islands to succeed or 

they  have  to  arrange  with  somebody  to  file  their  application  so  they  can  collect  the 

money.    So  there  are  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  these  people  living  overseas  who 

</span><span>haven’t  succeeded  to  their  entitlements  in  their  lands.    Therefore  these  funds  have 

accumulated in the Justice Department for so long.  It’s a h</span><span>uge amount now and the 

Justice Department are uncomfortable about holding these huge amounts and if they 

</span><span>don’t pay it into the Public Account they are breaking the law.</span></div><div><span>So my Ministry will sit down.  It could well be that when a staff member goes away to 

see  all  the  absentee  landowners,  we  might  consider  a  solution  whereby  we  set  up  a 

separate trust to handle money like this rather than paying it into the Public Account. 

</span><span>There  may  be  room  to  set  up  a  totally  separate  trust  system  administered  by  people 

</span><span>oth</span><span>er  than  the  Ministry  of  Justice  to  safeguard  people’s  money.    So  we  are  open  to 

</span><span>suggestions  from  the  public.    If  they  have  any  ideas  about  it,  please  forward  your 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>234 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>suggestions to either me or the Secretary of Justice but the one thing we want to make 

clear is that the Ministry of Justice does not want to continue to look after these funds. 

</span></div><div><span>The second matter I want to quickly mention here of interest to the Members and to 

our people listening in is passports, New Zealand Passports.  This is a matter that the 

Justice Department has been trying to publicise repeatedly.  That is before January in 

the year 2000, all those people who are Cook Islanders born outside of New Zealand 

and the Cook Islands have got to get a New Zealand Passport. 

</span></div><div><span>If you are born in Tahiti, if you are born in Australia, if you are born elsewhere, you 

have to get your New Zealand passport no later than next January. If you do not apply 

for a passport by that time you will miss out completely.  

</span></div><div><span>A few minutes and I will be finished. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  this  is  a  clear  notice.    If  you  have  relations  who  are  born  outside  of  the  Cook 

Islands or New Zealand, hurry up,  you only have about six months to go, otherwise        

you can come to the Cook Islands and never be a New Zealand citizen again. 

</span></div><div><span>On the questi</span><span>on of J.P.’s.  presiding in our Courts.  I appreciate the points raised by 

</span><span>the Honourable Mapu Taia.  The future for Justices of the Peace sitting on the Bench 

are somewhat limited.  We are planning to bring in legislation in the House to create 

another  ti</span><span>er  of  our  Court  System.    We  wish  to  appoint  JP’s  with  experience  in  the 

</span><span>position  of  Magistrates.  These  Magistrates  will  deal  with  all  cases  that  the  JPs  are 

doing  at  the  present  time.    They  will  travel  to  the  Outer  Islands  on  a  regular  basis.  

This  is  a  po</span><span>sition  above  those  of    JP’s  and  just  below  those  of  Judges  of  the  High 

</span><span>Court of New Zealand.  So these will come out of the experienced Justices.  The JPs. 

</span><span>will be fairly appointed.  There will be no CIP, no DAP only NAP!!  Now, that’s just 

an aside. That’</span><span>s for refreshment purposes in case you get bored.  No.  It will be clearly 

</span><span>on a neutral basis.  Politics just won’t enter into it.  We do have, I think it’s obvious to 

</span><span>everybody  who  the  two  or  three  leading  Justices  of  the  Peace  are.    One  is  a  former 

Registrar,  a  former  Head  of  Justice,  very  experienced.    But  the  ones  who  are  out 

</span><span>campaigning in Pukapuka, I don’t think qualify, because they are too political!  Too 

political.  But anyhow, that will lessen the need for JP’s to preside.  But we will still 

</span><span>give  Justices  of  the  Peace  opportunities  to  sit  on  the  Bench.    I  agree  that  there  is  a 

need for regular workshops for them to familiarise themselves with the Law.  In the 

</span><span>case where JP’s have relatives appearing before them, they should decline to hear the 

</span><span>case</span><span>.  That’s a standard procedure.  If somebody is related to the JP, he or she should 

</span><span>decline to hear the matter and that is a well-known procedure to the Justices.   Maybe 

in the experience of the Honourable Member Mapu Taia, the Justice of the Peace that 

p</span><span>resided  over  his  grandson’s  trial  is  unaware  of  that  requirement.    I  think  that  was 

</span><span>what I call Maori Justice.   

</span></div><div><span>In  the  case  of  Outer  Islanders  being  sent  to  the  Outer  Islands  to  serve  their 

imprisonment, that is a requirement of the  Law.  If they wish to take that option, to 

send them to  the Outer  Islands to  serve their imprisonment by doing free  labour for 

</span><span>the Government  instead of imprisonment in Rarotonga, that is  also  considered. That 

</span><span>penalty  is  actually  imprisonment.    Instead  of  sending  them  to  Arorangi  to  stay  in 

Prison,  they  serve  their  imprisonment  in  the  Outer  Islands  by  doing  labour.    Mr 

Chairman, if they re-offend while they are doing this in the Outer Islands, they should 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>235 

</span></div><div><span>automatically be sent to Prison. And I am sure if there’s failure to do s</span><span>omething about 

</span><span>it, it’s probably the police who should have laid charges, transferred the person back 

</span><span>to Rarotonga, where he should be going to Prison in Arorangi.   

</span></div><div><span>On  land  matters,  of  course  we  have  recently  lost  a  Judge  of  our  Land  Court.    Mr 

Chairman,  we  have  already  identified  a  successor  to  Judge  McHugh  and  that 

successor will be appointed shortly. So we will never run out of Judges to preside on 

our Land Courts.  And if you are concerned about their ages and their fitness, we will 

make  sure  they  undergo  a  fitness  test  before  they  are  appointed.    In  terms  of  some 

issues  that  were  raised  by  the  Honourable  Taia  about  Land  Court  procedures, 

everything  that  he  said  is  nothing  new.    These  were  all  raised  during  the  Land 

Commission of Inquiry.  A lot of the problems were  identified.  It is just a matter of 

going  through  that  report  again  to  implement  some  of  the  changes  recommended  to 

overcome the problems that were raised by the Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>And finally, in relation to the catering account of the Oiretumu Ekalesia Vainetini, the 

Secretary of Justice said that every account that has been presented to the Ministry of 

Justice were paid within seven days.  So the question we ask the Ekalesia of Oiretumu  

</span><span>is, where is your account?  Give us your account and you will be paid on the spot. 

</span></div><div><span>That answers all the questions, Mr Chairman, and that concludes my presentation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  will  put  the  question.  The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $924,700 for Justice stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Before I propose the next question, can I just make this observation?  Earlier in this 

sitting  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  asked  if  we  can  move  along  quickly,  and  the 

Leader of Government Business, on behalf of Government, gave an open invitation to 

the Opposition to move as fast as  you want.  I am suggesting that the Leader of the 

Opposition  can  indicate  as  to  which  Vote  the  Opposition  would  like  to  question 

Government.  And you do not have to speak on every Vote.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you.  I will propose the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,922,499 for Health stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, I stand to a Point of Explanation.  I think your 

observation in regards to the request by the Opposition was that we choose any Vote 

</span><span>Item  in  the  left  over  Budget  to  discuss,  which  was  supported  by  the  Deputy  Prime 

</span><span>Minister and the House.  I understand from the Deputy Prime Minister that this was 

the intention of this Motion earlier, when the House moved for that kind of discussion 

to take place, rather than each individual item on the Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>236 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  made  a  Ruling  on  that 

particular  point  raised  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  That  the  Chair  cannot  allow, 

under the Standing Orders, when we are looking at the Health Vote for any Member 

to speaker on the Ministry of Sport, on Parliament, or whatever you want.  Now, that 

is not possible.  So, when I p</span><span>ut the Question on each Vote, I’m saying  you don’t have 

</span><span>to speak.   And then when we come to a vote that you wish to speak on, the Leader of 

the Opposition, then can indicate your desire to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>That is the only way we are going to proceed on the rest of the Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>Anyway, it is time to stop for our afternoon tea.  This Sitting is suspended until 3:00 

p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED AT 2.30 p.m.</span></div>
