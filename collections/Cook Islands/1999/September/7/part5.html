<div><span>SITTING RESUMED 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Please be seated Honourable Members.  The sitting is resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the next speaker, on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,922,499 for Health stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I recognise the Honourable Member for Matavera.  You have the Floor Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  VAEVAEPARE:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Good  afternoon  to  you  in  the 

love of God. To  all the  staff members of Parliament, to  the Prime Minister, Deputy 

Prime Minister, Honourable Members on Government side, to the Cabinet Ministers, 

to  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the  Deputy  Leader  and  to  all 

Honourable  Members  on  the  Opposition  side,  Kia  Orana.    To  all  the  people  of  the 

Cook  Islands  who  are  listening  in  to  our  debate  this  afternoon,  Kia  Orana.    Special 

Greetings to all the staff members of the Ministry of Health and in particular, to the 

Secretary of Health who is in our midst. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman  I  rise  to  comment  on  the  allocation  for  the  Health  Department.  

Chairman,  the  budget  for  the  Health  Department  indicates  an  increase  of  half  a 

</span><span>million dollars.  I do hope this increase to the Health Department’s budget will also 

</span><span>accommodate </span><span>the increase in the staffs’ salaries.  For our information, Mr Chairman 

</span><span>this  is  one  of  the  lowest  paid  crown    workers  in  Government.  I  would  like  to 

complement the present Minister of Health because I am sure he will be looking at the 

salaries  of  doctors  and  nurses  and  all  those  who are  working  within  the Ministry  of  

Health.  I  understand  that  the  doctors  are  underpaid  as  opposed  to  some  clerical 

workers  in  other  Ministries.  The  nurses  and  technical  officers  in  this  Ministry  have 

also been underpaid for a long time.  I believe this $500,000 will assist  in increasing 

the salaries of the staff members. I worked in the Health Department for 34 years and 

</span><span>I was getting $22,000.   I understand that a particular driver was receiving  $27,000.  

</span><span>Money  was  not  my  main  concern.  My  job  was.  I  was  making  sure  the  work  in  the 

Health  service  was  done  properly.    It  was  hard  to  endure  that  kind  of  treatment  Mr 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>237 

</span></div><div><span>Chairman. I had to tolerate that. But now I trust the present Minister of Health will see 

a better salary scale for the staff members. 

</span></div><div><span>In the Capital Item I can a number of equipment and items due for replacement. There 

is an allocation of $50,000 here for the water pump for the hospital.  If we are looking 

at  the  water  supply  at  the  hospital  we  should  also  consider  erecting  another  tank.  

There have been quite a few times when we ran short of water up at the hospital and 

had to hire private vehicles to transport water supplies there.  The water pump often 

malfunction.  I do not know how much for a load but it may be $150 and they need up 

to  8  loads  per  day.  So  there  are  approximately  $1000  to  $1200  per  day  for  private 

trucks to cart water up to the hospital.  If the water pump breaks down it takes three 

days before it is fixed.  In that three day we would have spent $3,500 for water.  I feel 

there should be another water tank erected up at the hospital for emergency supplies.  

We should also be catching the water running off the roof and storing it in a tank.  A 

huge  amount of water runs off the roof every time it rains.  This  is a very  important 

</span><span>allocation but I don’t see any allocation for projects such as these. I trust the Minister 

</span><span>of Health will look into these matters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your second speaking time Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  VAEVAEPARE:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  see  that  Government  has  allocated  in  the 

Capital Expenses $150,000 for renovations of the hospital complex.  I understand this 

is for a new laboratory, the administration and the Physical Care Unit. I would like to 

acknowledge  the  former  Minister  of  Health  because  it  was  through  him  that  we 

received  a  donation  of  $1.1  million  from  Japan.    Our  present  Minister  obviously  is 

keen to have these projects completed.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, in comparison with other Ministries,  only one Ministry has spelt out 

two areas of Expenditure.  My concern Mr Chairman is the need for a proper transport 

service. When I look at the budget for Culture and the Police Department they have 

transport  allocations  but  in  the  Ministry  of  Health  there  is  none.    Our  Van  with  the 

registration number GA 203 is  in disrepair. 

</span></div><div><span>This  van  is  not  safe  to  pick  up  and  transport  the  nurses  home.    The  windows  can’t 

</span><span>open and the fume leak into the van. For the carbon monoxide to leak into the Van, it 

is totally unsafe to transport the Nurses. The other vehicle of the Health, GA24 has a 

blown up engine.  I have seen the Ambulance transporting the nurses late at night and 

the Ambulance is being used to subsidise that service. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask the Minister responsible to review the transportation problems of 

these officers.  Maybe it is because the Secretary of Health is weak or the Director of 

Medical services to make recommendations. I know then Members on the Opposition 

side will support this Budget and I am inviting the Minister to purchase a Van for the 

Hospital. 

</span></div><div><span>I  know,  Mr  Chairman,  they  need  two  or  three  vans.    In  the  Budget  there  is  no 

</span><span>allocation for capital for the laboratory.  For many years the lab has been wanting to 

</span><span>acquire a machine called Chemical Analyser.  It costs from $80 to $100,000. I know, 

Mr Chairman, that a number of equipment in the laboratory have broken down. Not 

for  any  other  reason.  Simply  because  these  equipment  have  aged.  And  not  one  was 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>238 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>purchased  by  Government.  All  were  donated  to  us.    I  am  hopeful  that  the  present 

Minister will help us.  All the Members of this House will be assisted in testing their 

blood  by  a  machine  like  this.  However,  if  there  is  a  change  in  Government,  never 

mind, we will implement the needs of the hospital. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  these  are  not  the  only  things  we  want  Government  to  improve.  The 

Operating Theatre will also require major renovation. We need new equipment there 

as well. A number of equipment  in there are ancient.  That is why we have to transfer 

major cases to New Zealand. That is my concern. Only two areas of the hospital were 

identified while the rest were ignored. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Your third speech coming up.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. VAEVAEPARE:</span><span> Some real technical equipment for the laboratory cost from 

$120,000 to $150,000.  They are old. They were donated to us by aid agencies. Some 

were loaned  to us and after about 3 years we will have full ownership. Government 

did not have the money to purchase  them. The only expenses Government met was 

for  chemicals to use in the operations of these machines. 

</span></div><div><span>So I would like at this time to acknowledge and thank the New Zealand Government 

for the donation of this machine to use during the time of our dengue epidemic.   And 

</span><span>also  Abbot’s  Diagnostics  in  Australia  for  donating  to  us  a  Chemistry  Analysing 

</span><span>machine as well as the free services to maintain this machine. I thank these people and 

acknowledge them for their contributions to the lab at the hospital. 

</span></div><div><span>Through this machine we were able to  test PSA  in  this country.   This  company has 

contributed  alot  to  this  Minis</span><span>try.  Maybe  there  are  people  listening  in  who  don’t 

</span><span>understand  the  importance  of  having  this  laboratory.    This  is  the  right  arm  of  the 

doctors  in  the  hospital.  It  helps  the  doctors  to  diagnose  the  diseases  of  our  patients.  

But  when  it  comes  to  remuneration,  they  are  one  of  the  lowest  paid  Ministry.  

Therefore I would like to request the Minister to consider improving the pay packets 

of these officers. 

</span></div><div><span>Another area requiring our attention is the X-ray division.  I heard that this equipment 

came  through  the  German  aid.    I  would  like  to  thank  Dr  Wolfgang  for  he  is  the 

German  Consul  General  in  the  Cook  Islands.    Through  him  the  Rarotonga  Hospital 

and the Aitutaki  Hospital  were facilitated with  a number of equipment.  This  Consul 

has actually managed to help us a lot. 

</span></div><div><span>There are other areas of contention. In terms of the groundsmen at the hospital, they 

have no mower or grass cutter. So they bring their own machinery from home to do 

the  work  at  the  hospital.  Maybe  the  former  workers  were  supplied  with  the  proper 

</span><span>equipment  and  when  they  left  they  took  these  things  with  them.  I  don’t  know.    But 

now,  there’s  no  such  equipment.  There  are  no  full  time  groundsmen.    So  the  office 

</span><span>staff, the kitchen hands, the lab. Officers, the nurses, the staff of the Clinical Services 

had to help clean up the compound.  I would like to thank them for bringing their own 

</span><span>gear to help tidy up the hospital.  To our kitchen staff at the hospital, Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>239 

</span></div><div><span>I recall one time there was no pot to cook the food so I brought my pot from home.  

Maybe  the  workers  at  the  Hospital  took  it  home  thinking  it  was  theirs.    But  I  was 

happy  when  I  went  to  the  Hospital  lately  to  find  that  the  kitchen  was  well  stocked 

with kitchen ware.  Mr Chairman, I strongly support this Budget and emphasising that 

the </span><span>wages of the staff will be raised. I don’t expect him to be biased when increasing 

the pay rises.  Don’t favour the NAPs only.  Serve everyone fairly. This is why I rose  

</span><span>Mr Chairman. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I call for the next speaker.  The 

Honourable Member for Nikao-Panama. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  again  to  everyone.  To  the  Secretary  of  the 

Ministry of Health who is here this afternoon, Kia Orana. To the doctors, nurses and 

all the workers at the Hospital, not forgetting the cooks, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>We heard the views of the Member of Parliament for Matavera and I believe what he 

said was true. The work is now with the Minister to see how these can be achieved. I 

have  personal  experiences  too  about  our  Hospital.    Every  white  Sunday  I    visit  the 

</span><span>Hospital.  As  mentioned  by  my  colleague,  there  are  many  areas  which  require  our 

</span><span>help. At one time I nearly fell into a  big hole in the corridor near the Laboratory.   

</span></div><div><span>When  I  was  having  children,  in  1975  to  1977,  the  area  where  the  Honourable    for 

Matavera used to work used to be the Maternity Ward. Kit was a beautiful Ward. Now 

</span><span>you don’t feel like visiting it. Today this is used to accommodate  our elderly. There 

</span><span>are 4 of them.  I do feel  for them. Some of these people have children out  there but 

</span><span>they  don’t  even  visit  these  people.  They  are  stuck  up  at  the  hospital.  I  cannot 

</span><span>understand how you can leave them in there.  I think we should do something about 

this because everything the Honourable Member for Matavera has said is true. Now 

let us go back and improve the standards of our hospital. Before we can have a nice 

walk from  one ward past the lab to the next adjoining ward.  There used to be two 

Wards in the wing of the lab. Today, this is a mess.  I would like to ask the Minister of 

Health to look into this. The floor is broken up in many places. It is not nice. I think 

our  people  will  be  happy  if  you  can  fix  this  up.  I  support  what  the  Member  for 

Matavera said. Even though there is not enough funds for this I hope the Minister will 

be  able  to  solicit  funds  from  somewhere  to  renovate  this  building.  These  are  my 

views, Mr Chairman, Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I call on the Deputy Leader of 

the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable 

Members of this House and to our people listening in this afternoon.  A special Kia 

Orana  to  all  our  Health  workers  throughout  the  Cook  Islands  who  are  dedicated  to 

looking after our welfare.   

</span></div><div><span>I  could  not  agree  more  with  the  Member  for  Matavera  as  well  as  the  Member  for 

</span><span>Nikao-Panama on the points raised by them.  Health has always been controversial in 

</span><span>our country and will always continue to  be a controversial  issue.  It  is  only obvious, 

Mr  Chairman,  with  our  increasing  age  population.    Our  population  shifting  to  older 

people, our health costs likewise will increase.   The reason for the increase in  older 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>240 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>people in our population is that there is better health quality delivered to our people 

and they are living longer. And most of our young people have left the country.   

</span></div><div><span>The allocation for Health is  just under $4 Million,  I’d say  would be sufficient  to  be 

</span><span>able to deliver some quality of health care to our people.  I see that the revenue the 

Ministry of Health can generate is a mere $57,000.  We must ask the question, is this 

$57,000 worth the disruption and the inconvenience to our people?  Earlier this week 

we  heard  about  children  who  could  not  make  it  to  school  because  they  could  not 

afford the fare for the school bus.  Likewise, there are a lot of our people who cannot 

</span><span>be seen by the doctor because they can’t afford the small amount of money they are 

</span><span>required  to  pay.    I  will  ask  the  current  Minister  of  Health  to  look  seriously  at  this 

figure.  The money collected for the training for health is about $57,000.  Is it worth 

it?  I suspect, Mr Chairman, that the cost of collecting this training revenue is more 

than $57,000.  So why bother?  If we look across the board at the goals of the Health, 

</span><span>it says “to promote good health and to encourage our people to use health facilities”.  

</span><span>And  yet  on  the  other  hand,  we  are  trying  to  discourage  them  making  a  visit  to  our 

health facilities.  This is the very basis why the  Democratic Alliance Party stated in 

our  Manifesto  that  we  would  provide  free  health  care  to  our  people.    I  know  it  is 

</span><span>expensive to have a good health system. But I ask the question, “at what convenience 

</span><span>do  we  require  of  our  people  to  have  this  health  facility  available  to  them?”.    I  also 

</span><span>note  there  is  a  departure  from  the  normal  way  that  Health  is  dealt  with.    That 

prevention  is  far  greater  than  trying  to  cure,  or  close  the  door  when  the  horse  has 

already bolted. 

</span></div><div><span>I  looked  at  sectoral  four  of  the  Health  budget  where  there  is  delivery  of  good  oral 

health for our children.  An amount of $121,000 was allocated for the prevention of 

diseases  in  our  children,  especially  their  teeth.    Rarotonga  enjoys  this  privilege  of 

dental health care whereas some outer islands are without any dental health care at all.  

The largest provision on the health is the prevention of non-communicable diseases.  

There  is  very  little  given  in  the  way  of  preventive  medicine.    We  should  be  very 

happy  that  this  country  does  not  yet  face  the  consequences  of  an  outbreak  of  HIV 

disease.   

</span></div><div><span>I had the opportunity to visit the main hospital in Tahiti recently.  The doctors there 

</span><span>say they  can’t keep up  with  the number of HIV cases in  Tahiti.   We are the closest 

</span><span>neighbours to our cousins in Tahiti. They are facing this drama but we will be facing 

it in the near future.   

</span></div><div><span>I  also  sympathise  with  the  views  put  forward  by  the  Honourable  Vaevae  Pare 

regarding the staff of the hospital.  A lot of them are demoralised because they would 

like  to  spend  money  to  deliver  quality  health  to  our  people  but  they  find  there  are 

constrictions stopping them. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Please carry on with your second speech.   

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    As  far  as  capital  replacement  is 

</span><span>concerned, one piece of machinery will take care of $200,000 let alone replacing the 

</span><span>ageing vehicle that is used to carry the nurses.  The Minister of Health has indicated 

</span><span>there is some help coming from the Japanese.  Let’s hope they will replace some of 

</span><span>the antique machinery our surgeons and doctors are using.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>241 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  to  support  our Health  staff  in  their  work  because  i</span><span>f  we  don’t  many  of  our 

</span><span>trained  doctors  and  nurses  will  leave  our  shores.    For  too  long  we  have  been 

depending  on  the  sympathy  of  aid  donors  to  help  us  in  our  Health  system.    Always 

</span><span>anticipating the good will of others to help us.  Why don’t we get on and s</span><span>pend some 

of our own money to improve our Health facilities?  If we look at the main hospital in 

Rarotonga the paintwork on that hospital is disgusting.  You look at the main hospital, 

the pride of the nation is suffering from neglect.  No wonder the morale of nurses and 

senior  Health  officers  are  very  low.    Maybe  the  Health  Department  should  have  a 

committee like the schools and then the Health building will be repaired with a new 

coat of paint.  I may sound like I am exaggerating.  I will tell you Mr Chairman some 

of our people are scared to be hospitalised in that hospital because of the condition it 

is  in.    We  should  do  something  about  it  urgently.    People  who  are  in  pain  and  are 

suffering will be terrified when they go to a building like that because they come from 

very  reasonable  homes.    We  want  our  hospital  to  exude  confidence,  to  exude 

professionalism, to give us the impression that it is safe and that our  illness will be  

</span><span>fixed when we go in.  Don’t use hospital workers to do the yard work. Get pris</span><span>oners, 

</span><span>get workers to clean up the yard.  We don’t expect doctors to do the paintwork on the 

</span><span>hospital.  We want them to cure people who are ill.   

</span></div><div><span>There  are  some  areas  that  concern  me  regarding  our  Health  system  and  that  is  the 

referral  of  those  who  are  critically  ill.    The  doctors  in  the  Cook  Islands  know  their 

limitations.  We know our limitations, what we have available here and what we can 

deliver.    Yet  only  three  hours  away  are  the  best  facilities  in  the  world,  available  in 

Auckland  and  Wellington.    I  will  urge  the  Minister  of  Health  to  look  into  referral 

system we have to be able to provide a more efficient Health delivery to people in dire 

need of medical help.   

</span></div><div><span>My  people  in  Manihiki  are  still  waiting  for  some  kind  of  hospital  to  be  built  there 

because the existing facility is only a makeshift  after the hurricane hit Manihiki two 

years  ago.   I will support  the vote item  for Health plus  another half  a million  if the 

Minister  wants  it  because  I  know  the  Secretary  of  Health  will  put  it  to  good  use.  

There are some urgent areas in the hospital which need our attention.  Please resolve 

those problems so our people will enjoy quality Health care.  The Minister of Health 

should sit down with the Health workers, the nurses and Health workers and listen to 

the problems we have in our country because I will certainly advise the new Minister 

of Health to build on it when we become Government. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Before  I  call  for  the  next 

speaker  I just wanted to  say that  I did  not  declare the translation  that the interpreter 

</span><span>used,    the    term  “pig”  as  unparliamentary  because  he  is  talking  about  the  hospital 

</span><span>walls.  If he were talking about another Honourable Member I would have pulled him 

up.  You people eat pig so it must be all right.   

</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Minister of Internal Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you, Kia Orana to the 

staff of this House, Kia Orana to the two sides of Parliament, the Government and the 

corrective side.  Kia Orana to everyone. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>242 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to our people listening in to our Budget discussions this afternoon.  A 

special Kia Orana to all the staff of the Ministry of Health on the island of Rarotonga 

and in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to the Head of the Ministry and the Secretary of Health who is with us 

today in his capacity as adviser to the Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time, Mr Chairman, to extend my Greetings and also my gratitude 

to the various organisations that are supportive of the Health Service in our country.  

To  the  Hospital  Comforts  Committee,  the  Rotary  Club,  the  Red  Cross  and  other 

organisations who are providing health services. My acknowledgement and Greetings 

to NZODA, the WHO and the UNFPA for their supporting programs. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  to  give  my  full  support  to  the  allocation  to  the  Ministry  of  

Health.    As  echoed  by  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition  health  is  a  very 

complicated  issue.    Throughout  the  world  today  there  is  not  one  country  that  has 

found a medical remedy for all health problems.  Neither New Zealand, Australia, nor 

</span><span>America </span><span>–</span><span> the United States </span><span>–</span><span> one of the richest countries in the world.  In fact we are 

</span><span>better off than any of these countries that I have mentioned.  Our infant mortality rate 

is  about  8-9 per 1,000,  compared to  New  Zealand which has16 per 1,000. Australia 

has  around  about  that  figure  and  the  States  has  over  20  per  1,000.    I  personally 

believe, Mr Chairman, that there are times that we should compliment ourselves.  Not 

only  for  the  Government  of  the  day  but  for  all  the  Governments  that  have  been  in 

office  because  goodness  comes  out  of  a  long  planned  service  which  gradually 

eventuated into a very high standard of health as we experience today. 

</span></div><div><span>Three years ago we held a Health Ministers’ Meeting here in Rarot</span><span>onga attended by 

14 Ministers of the Pacific Region.  They all went up to the Hospital and their report 

was  that  we  have  a  very  high  standard  hospital  in  the  Cook  Islands.    They  were 

amazed  to  see  the  hospital  empty.    They  were  amazed  to  see  not  one  patient  in  the 

Outpatient to see a doctor.  They were amazed to see our floors polished. 

</span></div><div><span>Last year we had a delegation from the Japanese Government.  Most of them came to 

evaluate  the  project  we  proposed  for  the  new  Laboratory  Service.    Their  general 

comment to </span><span>me as Minister at the time was we shouldn’t be giving you any more aid.  

Your hospital is well up.  It’s a class well beyond some of the developing countries in 

</span><span>the Pacific.  Your hospital is quite equipped with some of the modern  equipment of 

the world.  In fact that is one of the reasons why it took us over 12 months to get this 

project  that  was  mentioned  by  the  Member  of  Matavera  -  approved.    You  see  in 

Health, aid is given on the basis of some data, of some health indicators.  Last year the 

Cook  Islands  was  classified  worldwide  as  a  developed  country  because  of  our 

economic development,  our health indicators. For the information of this House and 

Members  of  Parliament,  health  in  the  Cook  Islands  has  also  been  elevated  as 

developed to World Health Organisation standards.  So, in most of our participation in 

World Health Conferences and Seminars we will have to meet our own expenses.  In 

</span><span>the Pacific today there are only five countries that are developed and below the status 

</span><span>of a developed country.

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to our appropriation, Mr Chairman, I fully support the sentiments of the 

Honourable Dr Woonton in echoing the parts we are pushing in our Health Services.  

I also said last year that the emphasis that we are putting into our Health Services is 

more on curative rather than preventative. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on for your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Chairman.   If the new Minister  can come up 

with a system where we rediversify the priority of Health Services into preventative, I 

will be very happy and supportive.  It is said that the consequences of the outcome of 

not putting enough emphasis on preventative is  so great that we cannot  afford it.   It 

would  be  quite  difficult  for  us  to  change  it  immediately  but  I  am  sure  if  we  start 

changing  now  and  looking  at  steps  of  improving  it  to  be  more  priority  on  the 

preventative side then it can be done.   

</span></div><div><span>Some  of  the  consequences  are  already  imminent  today,  Mr  Chairman.    The 

consequence of high blood pressure, of obesity, gout and worst of all, the new virus 

known  as  HIV  AIDS.    In  practice,  what  I  am  trying  to  say  is  for  us  to  double  the 

</span><span>effort. Let’s double the funding we put into our education program to make our people 

</span><span>more aware of the consequences of being obese, of having high blood pressure and so 

on. 

</span></div><div><span>For the last 15 years,  we the  men have always been looking at women to be victims 

of cancers.  Today men, let me warn you, we are infested with this virus or with this 

sickness of prostrate cancer.  More of our men are dying because of this disease.  We 

must look  into ways  of  getting funds to  initiate programs  of checking our men, two 

yearly check-ups.  Not only in Rarotonga but in the Outer Islands, likewise with the 

program  for women. They   must  be checked regularly  on Rarotonga and the Outer 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Although  I  will  support  the  concern  of  the  Members  in  giving  some  increase  to  the 

remuneration of the Health staff members, I think right now the priority is the Health 

services.  We must be careful how we are dishing out our limited resources. For your 

information of the $3.9 Million here to Health,  $2.7 Million is going towards paying 

our  staff.    $2.7  Million  which  is  about  two-thirds  of  the  total  Vote  Item.    The  total 

Health allocation is about 26% of the National budget. Three years ago we reviewed 

the salaries of the Health staff. This was one of the first Ministry after the Transition 

to  be  reviewed.    We  have  tried  to  rectify  some  anomalies,  especially  staff  members 

who  have  worked  for  over  thirty  years.    We  have  tried  to  revise  their  salaries  to  a 

</span><span>reasonable standard.  The Doctors’ salaries have been reviewed and they seem to be 

</span><span>happy.    But  I  think  if  we  could  have  surplus  funds,  if  a  bit  of  money  was  there,  I 

would support reviewing Health staff salaries.  There are other areas of priority that I 

mentioned.   

</span></div><div><span>Water is also priority for any health service, for any hospital in the World.  Last year 

we  proposed  a  project  to  AUSAID  if  they  could  fund  two  more  water  tanks  for  the 

</span><span>Hospital and we have had no notification whether it has been approved by AUSAID.  

</span><span>I have been told that one of the Japanese  Anaesthetists has arrived on our shores to 

take over that service because our own Anaesthetist, is in training in Fiji at the School 

of  Medicine.    We  have  put  in  a  request  to  the  Japanese  Government  for  an 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>244 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Anaesthetist  because  Frank  Obeda  wants  to  get  his  qualification  in  this  area  and  he 

has  been  sent  to  Fiji  to  get  his  qualification  in  Anaesthesia.  This  doctor  from  Japan 

will be here for three months and then another doctor from Japan will replace him. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your third speech coming up Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>    Thank  you.    We  have  also  requested  a  Gynaecologist  from 

Japan  who  will  be  here  for  three  years.    All  these  doctors  are  funded  under  the 

Japanese  Government  Aid.    There  are  other  supports  that  has  been  given  to  our 

Government by other funding agencies.   

</span></div><div><span>Four weeks ago we got some funding from UNFPA donating thirteen motor bikes for 

our Public Health nurses. Eight already landed and the balance will be here very soon.  

</span><span>For us who are not equipped and who haven’t got these resources and assistance let us 

</span><span>go out and seek aid.  I do agree that we have neglected the health service for so long.  

But  I  am  not  saying  that  we  have  intentionally  neglected  it.    Mr  Chairman,  all  the 

Health complexes in the Outer Islands need to be re-built or replaced.  So far, to my 

understanding, the only new health clinic that has been built is in Penrhyn of which 

</span><span>the  funds  were  sourced  by  the  Member  for  Penrhyn,  Honourable  Tepure  Tapaitau.  

</span><span>And  Manihiki  definitely  needs  a  new  hospital.    Rakahanga  definitely  needs  a  new 

hospital.  And Mauke of all islands needs a new hospital and a new location.   

</span></div><div><span>A few years ago, Cabinet held their Cabinet meeting in Mauke and all the Ministers 

went to look at the hospital in Mauke. We  all agreed that Mauke needed a new site 

because  the  present  site  is  vulnerable  to  hurricanes.    And  I  am  urging  the  new 

Minister  of  Health  who  is  a  Maukean  himself,  to  please  look  for  some  funds  and 

relocate that hospital and get it rebuilt. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, there are a lot of  issues  that we should talk about on health.  We in 

this House, our Government and our country have limited funds. This Government so 

far has given priority to  health. This is reflected in the $2.5 Million surplus we had.  

We gave half a million dollars to Health.  But the fact of the matter, Mr Chairman is, 

if  we  just  pour  money  into  Health  and  disregard  other  essential  services  no  benefit 

will come out of Health. Anyway Mr Chairman, I have got a few more minutes.  Let 

me welcome home our new doctors to the Cook Islands. Dr Amanda Noovao and Dr 

Tapukura Rairi.  I am looking forward to using Dr Teariki Maoate who has offered his 

services  to  the  Government  and  looking  forward  to  having  him  with  us  in  the  New 

Year.    It  is  a  pity  that  we  cannot  cater  to  the  needs  of  our  qualified  doctors  trained 

overseas but if we can do something to entice them to come back even for a short time 

we  should  do  something  about  it.    I  give  my  full  support  to  this  Appropriation  Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Minister of Internal Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>I call upon the Honourable Member for Arutanga Reureu Nikaupara. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  We have heard all the Greetings from 

</span><span>the Honourable Members of the House.  I rise to support the allocation for Health and 

also to request the Honourable Members to put the question for Health so we can get 

on to Marine Resources and the MOID allocation which deals with the outer islands.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>245 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman  before  I  go  any  further  into  that  request,  we  must  not  forget  the  $1.2 

million for Health in the MOID budget.   13% of MOID budget is  for Health.  With 

my request I believe there  are 13 sister island members in the House who are sure to 

support my move to put the question on Health and Internal Affairs so that we can get 

to the outer islands and the Marine Resources votes. If I am correct 25% of the total 

budget is given to MOID but we will give only one day to talk about it. I think it is 

not  fair.    Therefore  I  would  like  to  support  the  Health  allocation  and  request  to 

Honourable Members that we put the question on Health and Internal Affairs.  Thank 

you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Before I call upon the Leader 

of the Opposition can I make this explanation.  If you wish to move a motion for the 

question to be put on say the Health vote you just move a motion. Then I will test it to 

see  if  Members  want  the  question  put.    I  am  sorry  I  have  an  indication  from  the 

Leader of the Opposition that he would like to speak to the Health vote so I cannot put 

the question. 

</span></div><div><span>HON DR T. MAOATE:  </span><span>I would like first to endorse the motion by seconding it but 

</span><span>before I do that I would like to say a few things.  I just want to polish what has been 

said  about  the  Health  allocation  for  Rarotonga  and  the  comments  from  both  sides 

regarding their real intentions.   

</span></div><div><span>I am pleased with the comments of the previous Minister of Health when he said that 

in  the  past  a  lot  of  emphasis  was  on  curative  rather  than  preventative  medicine..    I 

think it is quite clear according to the budget there has been a further half a million 

dollars allocated.  Perhaps Health on Rarotonga is happier now with that increase in 

the budget but I would like to see when we go to MOID how much Health in the outer 

islands has been appropriated out of this budget.  Not only when in dealing with the 

health  of  the  people  but  in  terms  of  education  as  well.  We  must  start  off  from  the 

basics.  When I started to hear about monster hospitals it hurt my ears.   

</span></div><div><span>You  see,  when  I  first  started  to  work  in  the  outer  islands  20,  30  or  40  years  ago  

people were having reasonable buildings. What was important was the equipment in 

the  room.    Secondly  the  time  we  spend  with  the  community.  Getting  out  there  and 

looking at what the needs are and doing something about it.  We must put more into 

preventative medicine. The programmes on the radio and television and in the media 

are the kinds of things our people need.  Even though our standard of living is high, 

our  life  style  is  killing  us  through  high  blood  pressure,  diabetes  and  obesity  from 

eating  too  much  of  the  wrong  food.  We  get  told  that  we    are  overweight  and  we 

should not eat too much, nobody listens.  But the moment you collapse because of a 

heart attack and the ambulance is not there in one second, you make a big deal about 

it.  We are still looking at modern hospitals with intensive care units and sophisticated 

</span><span>equipment, but nobody knows how to use these equipment.  Let’s get back to basics.  

</span><span>The outer islands are crying for these basics.  We need to look at it. If we increase $2 

million in Health is that going to solve their problems?  No.  You need to know what 

</span><span>the value of that investment is going to be.  How can you prevent diseases, how to get 

</span><span>indicators  to  tell  you  the  value  of    the  money  appropriated.    Do  we  know  what  the 

standards of the Health of our people is in the outer islands?  Do we have indicators 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>246 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>and statistics to  tell us?  I have a strong feeling that today the reporting system from 

Health divisions to the centre here is not very good. 

</span></div><div><span>You  cannot  plan  for  the  delivery  of  any  service  without  having  the  right  figures  in 

your hand.  With those few words Mr Chairman I support the motion and I think we 

should move on to MOID so that when we start tomorrow we will start right on target, 

nothing else but MOID. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    There  is  a  saying  you  can’t 

have  your  cake,  you  can’t  move  a  motion  then  speak  on  it.    I  will  accept  a  motion 

</span><span>from a member who has not spoken to move that the question be put.  Yes Minister of 

Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:  </span><span>I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Question be put 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,922,499 for Health stands part of the Schedule?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We will move on to Internal Affairs.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,007,825 for Internal Affairs stands part of the Schedule?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Marine Resources.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $908,087 for Marine Resources</span><span> s</span><span>tands part of the Schedule?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We move to the Ministry of Outer Islands Development.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $9,058,566 for MOID stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Prime Minister</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I stand to move: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>247 

</span></div><div><span>That the Question be put 

</span></div><div><span>But before that, I have been sitting here in a wee bit of a dilemma because the Leader 

of the Opposition had hijacked my Vote.  In the middle of Foreign Affairs I found that 

I  could  not  answer  any  more  questions  because  he  decided  to  hijack  my  Foreign 

Affairs.  Because he hijacked Foreign Affairs I am going to hijack MOID. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Question be put 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Well  as  I  said,  if  you  want  the  question  put,  you  just  move  the 

</span><span>Motion.  It doesn’t need a Seconder and then I will </span><span>test it. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  I withdraw the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Prime Minister.  I call on the Honourable Member for 

Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  First of all with regard to the appropriation for MOID, I would like 

to ask the Minister of Health,  when the islands of Rakahanga and Manihiki will get a 

doctor?    In  the  past  there  used  to  be  a  doctor.  The  two  islands  of  Manihiki  and 

Rakahanga used to use one doctor, the doctor on Manihiki. But now there is no doctor 

for Manihiki or for Rakahanga.  The Minister was explaining earlier on that there has 

been a request for hospitals on the islands of Rakahanga, Manihiki and other Northern 

Islands groups but what I would like is a doctor. There is no use of a hospital without 

a doctor.  But before we send a doctor off to the island of Manihiki and Rakahanga we 

need  a  hospital  first  for  Manihiki  because  the  hospital  has  been  destroyed  by  the 

</span><span>hurricane.  But if the doctor is sent to Rakahanga then that’s okay because the hospital 

</span><span>on Rakahanga is okay. The doctor can stay on Rakahanga and go to Manihiki every 

once in a while.  But the people of Manihiki and Rakahanga have no problems with 

sharing a doctor.  I think the priority for the island of Manihiki is a hospital because 

the previous one has been destroyed. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like the Minister to look carefully at this because today there is an increase in 

the population on the island of Manihiki due to the pearl industry.  There is a need, 

which  has  been  in  place  for  a  long  time,  and  this  has  not  been  met  yet.  That  is  a 

decompression chamber.  I believe that we need two of these.  One on the island of 

Manihiki  and  one  for  the  island  of  Penrhyn.    Other  islands  such  as  Rakahanga  may 

not  really  need  a  decompression  chamber  but  the  islands  such  as  Penrhyn  and 

Manihiki will desperately need a machine each because these are the two islands who 

are really into the pearl farming industry. 

</span></div><div><span>Another  thing  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  to  look  into  is  the  issue  of  people 

coming  to  the  island  of  Rakahanga.    It  is  very  hard  for  the  people  on  the  island  of 

Rakahanga  because  if  somebody  is  sick  and  needs  to  be  referred  to  the  hospital  in 

</span><span>Rarotonga they have to be taken to the island of Manihiki by boat and then flown to 

</span><span>the  island  of  Rarotonga.  If  there  was  a  doctor  present  if  there  was  a  doctor  on  the 

island of Manihiki, then maybe some of the illnesses that people have may not require 

referrals to Rarotonga.  However, because there is no doctor, we are encountering all 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>248 

</span></div><div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>kinds of medical problems. I would like to congratulate and to thank the nurses who 

are carrying out the duties of the doctors. 

</span></div><div><span>Another  area  of  concern  to  me  is  where  patients  are  referred  to  the  hospital  in 

Rarotonga.  After  they  arrive  in  Rarotonga  and  seen  the  doctor,  they  are  sometimes 

told to go home and come back maybe a week later for a checkup. This is where the 

problems  arise  where  the  sick  from  the  Outer  Islands  have  to  look  for  friends  or 

family to stay with and await their checkups.  This becomes a problem for the friends 

and family on the island of Ra</span><span>rotonga. Isn’t it possible for the Health or MOID to help 

</span><span>them? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>   It  is  time to  stop.   Sorry to interrupt  you Honourable Member.  

May I call on the Minister in Charge of the Vote to  move for  progress to be reported 

please. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress on this Appropriation be Reported to Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
