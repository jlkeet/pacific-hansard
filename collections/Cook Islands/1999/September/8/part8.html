</span></div><div><span>And  to  you  Mr  Speaker,  a  special  word  of  thanks  to  you  for  the  clarity,  speed, 

efficiency  and  versatility  demonstrated  by  you  throughout  these  sittings.    You  were 

perfect  until  the last  few minutes when  you t</span><span>ook on Papa Tutiâ€™s old  habits of being 

</span><span>forgetful. 

</span></div><div><span>I also want to say that all the Members were so well behaved.  That is why we fed you 

so well in the last few weeks.  A hungry man is an angry man so we have had nothing 

but  pleasantries  in  the last couple  of weeks.  So if this behaviour continues  I  assure 

Honourable Members they will continue to be well fed. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    I  call  for  a  Seconder  to  the 

Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Paora Teiti Member for Amuri/Ureia 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  There appears to be none.  I will now put the question. The 

Question is</span><span>:</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>274 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Before we adjourn, I just wish to draw the attention of the Members to a workshop for 

Members  of  Parliament,  HOMs  and  Mayors.    It  will  be  conducted  from  the  27</span><span>th</span><span>

September to the 1</span><span>st</span><span> October. To those Members who live here in Rarotonga, if  you 

are interested in attending please see the Clerk for more information.  The workshop 

is on Gender Training.  The Clerk has told me that he will be circulating a reminder to 

Members. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, those Members representing our Branch to the CPA Conference, please do 

us proud by behaving  yourselves and participating fully and  effectively  and pass  on 

our best wishes to the CPA family through the leader of the delegation, the Minister 

of Police. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call on an Honourable Member to close our meeting with a prayer.
