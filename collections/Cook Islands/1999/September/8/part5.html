<div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>    (INTERJECTION) 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>   Two of them  I am  told,  Mr Chairman, spend most  of their 

time here in Rarotonga .  Now, these problems, Mr Chairman, will continue to occur 

and  occur  and  occur,  if  we  do  not  address  them  now.    In  actual  fact  what  we  are 

talking about, Mr Chairman, is the need for us to have a good look at the process of 

Devolution.    There  is  this  real  need,  Mr  Chairman,  to  reassess,  to  re-evaluate  and 

review our direction. 

</span></div><div><span>the  economic 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Chairman, during the many consultation and Retreats  that we have had in 

1996,  when  Government  had  focussed  at 

reform  package, 

representatives  from  the  Outer  Islands  made  an  outcry.    They  wanted  to  have  some 

say in responsibilities relating to the social economic destiny of their own individual 

islands.  I think I would be closer to being accurate to say that there is this outcry from 

our  people  of  the  Outer  Islands.    Now  Mr  Chairman,  as  a  result  of  this  outcry, 

Government  in  its  economic  reform  programme  embraced  these  calls  and  began 

negotiations  in  1996  with  UNDP.    The  negotiations,  Mr  Chairman,  hinged  at 

developing  a  programme  outline  that  would  support  institutional  strength.    A 

</span><span>programme  that  would  also  support  legislative  consistency.    A  programme,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, that would also develop human resources.  Again, focussing on the Outer 

Islands.  As a result of these negotiations in 1996, Mr Chairman, a Memorandum of 

Understanding  was  signed  between  UNDP  and  the  Cook  Islands  Government  in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>254 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>November 1998. This M.O.U. Mr Chairman committed the Cook Islands Government 

and UNDP to a three year programme.  A three year programme, Mr Chairman, that 

</span><span>will  support  Government’s  ongoing  initiative  to  facilitate  the  devolution  of 

</span><span>responsibilities and programmes to  the Outer  Islands jurisdiction over that  period of 

time.  On one hand, the M.O.U. also  committed UNDP  to  provide US$300,000  and 

this will be provided in funds, technical experts and support and advisory assistance to 

the programme for the period of three year.  Then on the other hand Mr Chairman, the 

Cook  Islands  Government  through  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Islands  Development  is  to 

contribute  the  local  support  programme  of  $45,000  over  the  same  period  of  time 

particularly  for  travel  in  the  Outer  Islands.    Now,  Mr  Chairman,  I  will  make  an 

attempt to summarise the key factors relating to the activities.  However, before doing 

that, it is important to highlight the goals of the exercise.  The goal, Mr Chairman, is 

very simple. The goal is to have a full operational devolution of resource management 

and control by the Outer Islands by the year 2001.  Now, some of these key factors Mr 

Chairman  are  the  devolution  policy  framework.  This  involves  the  selection  of  local 

consultants  who  will  be  responsible  to  supervise  and  disseminate  draft  devolution 

policies  for  endorsement  and  implementation.  This  is  then  to  be  followed  by  an 

annual  review  system  through  the  Mayoral  Forums  to  monitor  the  progress  of  the 

</span><span>activities involved. 

</span></div><div><span>The  second  key  factor  relates  to  the  legal  work.  Now,  we  need  to  have  a  selection 

process of local consultation for legislative review and rewriting exercises. A process 

of consultation and monitoring to ensure consistency of rewrites follows this on.  Of 

importance also at this particular stage of the exercise is the conducting of seminars 

with each island administration and key agencies to go over these legal revisions.   

</span></div><div><span>The  third  key  factor  Mr  Chairman  relates  to  human  resources  development  and 

planning.  Not  forgetting  that  this  is  a  very  important  part  of  the  exercise.    Human 

resources  development  and  training  involves  recruiting  experts  to  assist  our  local 

people  in  certain  aspects  of  the  devolution  programme.    It  requires  training 

programmes  for each island to be done each  year during the duration of the term of 

this exercise.  Now it is important also Mr Chairman to understand that a three year 

timeframe  for  the  main  programme  implementation  will  follow  the  recommended 

timeframes and output. Let us turn to year number one. 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  important  to  initiate,  consult  and  formulate  the  devolution  policy  framework 

which will provide the guidelines for national and local Government operations in the 

net two years and beyond.  Clearly as a process and clearly important is to note that 

the  devolution  policy  will  be  reviewed  by  each  island  and  the  devolution  task  force 

and related agencies connected to it on an annual basis.  It is also important to initiate 

the  process  to  have  legal  documents  that  will  affect  the  implementation  of  the 

devolution policy.  It is mandatory to do this.  This would ensure compatibility for the 

devolution requests of those people from the Outer Islands.  Further, in year one it is 

important  to  initiate a process  to  implement  human development  programme for the 

Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>In  the  second  year  Mr  Chairman  there  will  be  a  natural  implementation  of  training 

</span><span>island  devolved  responsibilities  and 

programmes  and  fine 

programmes. This interactive process of fine tuning changes will be common in this 

phase.   

</span></div><div><span>tuning  of  outer 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>255 

</span></div><div><span>In the third  year maturity  of the devolution  methodology  and establishing  of critical 

masses  of  training  and  competent  personnel  in  island  jurisdictions  to  take  up  the 

devolution  process.    This  timeframe  schedule  is  locked  into  the  UNDP  requirement 

for ongoing monitoring and annual reviews.  This continuous monitoring and annual 

reviews  are  elements,  essential  ingredients  to  correlate  with  the  Public  Service  Act, 

the MFEM Act and the PERCA Act.  This is to highlight part and parcel of the reform 

process which directly relates to transparency and accountability.  In other words the 

jurisdiction in the Outer Islands will operate under similar provisions and conditions 

as Ministries in Rarotonga.  These Ministries under Outer Island jurisdiction require 

as part and parcel of the reform process to be transparent and accountable.  

</span></div><div><span>Under this, Mr Chairman, a programme manager Mrs Vaine Wichman was recruited 

in  April  of  this  year  to  manage  these  activities.  Based  on  the  Memorandum  of 

Understanding  or  agreement,  the  programme  is  overseen  by  a  devolution  task  force 

which  is  made  up  of  MOID  Secretary,  a  representative  from  the  Public  Service 

Commission, the Solicitor General, the Mayor of the Forum, the Chief of Staff of the 

Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Head  of  Projects  in  MFEM.    The  design  and 

</span><span>formulation of a robust devolution policy framework is a key ingredient in the overall 

</span><span>process  of  devolution.    The  team  has  been  assembled  to  develop  and  finalise  the 

framework in  consultation  with  each island jurisdiction.  The team  comprises of the 

following people: 

</span></div><div><span>Tai Herman Team Leader. 

Roger Malcolm Local Government Representative 

Taukea Raui Local Government Community Consultation  

Otheniel Tangianau, Local Government Community Consultation 

Anna Katoa Representative from Manihiki 

Ron Crocombe Technical Advisor 

</span></div><div><span>Of course Mr Chairman all are responsible under the management of the Programme 

Manager  Mrs  Vaine  Wichman.    These  people  Mr  Chairman  are  in  the  process  of 

visiting  the  Outer  Islands.    They  have  already  visited  a  couple  of  the  Outer  Islands.  

They have been given a timeframe to work under.  A time frame to the 10</span><span>th</span><span> of October 

is given to these workers by which time they are expected to finalise their reports for 

each island. They should be able to finalise a report, which will incorporate island by 

island perspectives.  Looking at what level and type of devolution islanders perceive 

and  desire.    As  well  as  highlighting  devolution  commonalities  and  looking  at  the 

uniqueness  of  the  process  highlighted  to  assist  with  implementation  of  policies  and 

programmes of all the Outer Islands involved.  I think it is also important for me to 

speak in Maori. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to try and summarise the whole process of the agreement that was signed 

between this Government and the United Nations Program. I am sure that there are a 

lot of people out there listening in to our program and do not understand what is being 

</span><span>said and don’t have any understanding of what is happening.</span></div><div><span>In the  first  year  as  I  have mentioned  earlier, this is  what  will happen.   Consultation 

will  have  to  be  made  through  meetings  with  the  various  bodies  to  arrive  at  what  is 

required by law. These legislation will assist the Government, the Local Government 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>256 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>and  then  people  in  the  Outer  Islands.  This  is  a  crucial  element  to  the  people  of  the 

Outer Islands in coming to grips with the reality of the devolution process. Therefore, 

it  is  important  that  we  have  the  proper  guidelines  to  assist  gauge  our  directions  and 

our  desires  for  each  of  the  islands.  Once  this  stage  is  set,  these  information  will  be 

returned to Rarotonga for a proper in-depth assessment of the facts collected. Involved 

in the final documentation will be the Mayors, the Island Councillors, the Government 

Representative, the CEO, the Ui Ariki, the Ui Mataiapo and the Ui Rangatira of the 

islands.    Then  a  Report  will  be  compiled  here  in  Rarotonga  and  the  report  will  be 

submitted to the Mayoral Forum which will be held in Tongareva. 

</span></div><div><span>The second  year will be a reassessment of the changes and the developments which 

took  place  to  comply  with  the  needs  of  our  people.  The  most  important  thing  is  to 

maintain  people  consultation.  There  should    be  a  trend  achieved  in  this  second  year 

where our people should be able to operate with minimal supervision. 

</span></div><div><span>By  the  third  year  the  people  will  be  able  to  know  how  to  run  their  respective 

operations with minimal involvement from Rarotonga. They should be able to operate 

in compliance with the provisions of the Public Service Act, the MFEM Act and that 

</span><span>of the PERCA Act.  That is  the plan established  as  a  guideline for our people in  the 

</span><span>Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Well, Mr Chairman, I have taken quite some of your time Honourable Members in the 

House, in going through the program for the Devolution Task Force.  I do hope that 

what I have just outlined in the House will lay to rest some of the questions that are 

about  to  be  thrown  about.  Before  I  sit  down,  Mr  Chairman,  I  am  inviting  all 

Honourable  Members  from  the  Outer  Islands  to  come  out  with  your  views  and  of 

course  your  contributions  to  the  debate  in  this  House  for  a  very  important  issue 

concerning  the  Outer  Islands.    Very  important  because  we  are  talking  about  the 

welfare of our own people out there whom we represent in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank  you Minister.  Are there any  further speakers?   I call on 

the Member for Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  Greetings  to  you  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  all  Honourable 

Members. Greetings to all our people who are listening in this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise,  Mr  Chairman,  to  give  my  support  to  the  allocation  made  for  the  Ministry  of 

Outer Islands Affairs.  However, Mr Chairman, I want to register my disappointment 

in this House because we have been sitting over the Budget of this country for the last 

ten  days.    Only  today  we  were  given  the  detailed  spending  of  each  of  the  Outer 

Islands.    Although  we  were  given  the  overall  spending  of  the  Outer  Islands,  we 

</span><span>haven’t b</span><span>een given any details until today, now in fact when we are about to debate 

this  Vote  Item.  How  can  we,  the  Opposition  Members,  make  some  constructive 

remarks  regarding  the  spending  in  the  Outer  Islands?    In  any  case,  we  have  spent 

</span><span>nearly the last hour listening to the Minister of Outer Islands taking back the power 

</span><span>given  through  the  devolution  process.    I  haven’t  heard  any  comments  made  about 

</span><span>Health, Education, the Environment  and the Outer  Islands.   It  seems  the focus from 

the Minister is on the administration. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>257 

</span></div><div><span>The  former  Prime  Minister  of  this  country  started  the  devolution  process  some  six 

years  back  in  association  with  the  former  Minister  of  Outer  Islands  Affairs.    In  the  

last Session of this House we assured the people of this country that in two years time 

we will devolve all the powers to the Outer Islands Local Government.  What do we 

hear today?  We will involute or devolve those powers from the Outer Islands so we 

can have another look at it for the next two years, to the year 2001.  Then we will be 

able  to  trust  our  people  in  the  Outer  Islands  to  have  the  authority  to  run  their  own 

affairs.  We can go on making the excuses.  We can use the MFEM Act as an excuse. 

The bottom line is, when are we devolving that power back to the Outer Islands Local 

Government?    Or  are  we  scared  of  giving  this  power  to  the  Outer  Islands  because 

some  of  the  Mayors  and  Councillors  elected  by  the  Outer  Islands  are  against  this 

Government? 

</span></div><div><span>To  my  surprise,  Mr  Chairman,  there  are  Assistant  Ministers  now.    I  don’t  see  any 

</span><span>listing for Assistant Ministers in the Civil List except Assistant to the Minister.  Not 

Assistant Ministers.  Quite two different kettles of fish.  So it is with perplexion that I 

see there are Assistant Ministers in this Government.  Totally against the very essence 

</span><span>of the reform process, the political reform process which we were all sounding about 

</span><span>just before the election. 

</span></div><div><span>I have been through some of the Outputs of the Outer Islands.  I don’t see anywhere in 

</span><span>here  where  our  Environment  is  protected  or  provided  for.    It  seems  the  Rarotonga 

Environment is more important than any other environment.  Maybe the Outer Islands 

should resort to people who voluntarily give their time and effort in providing some 

guidance, some help in providing good environmental care like Rarotonga.  Like Mr 

and Mrs Gray who are voluntarily giving their time to help with our environment.  We 

</span><span>should make use of them in our Outer Islands.  That’s if Rarotonga doesn’t want them 

</span><span>as scouts for our environment.   

</span></div><div><span>I am somewhat disappointed that we are taking back the powers which for the last five 

years have been earmarked to give to the Local Government. Today we are finding all 

kinds of excuses to bring it back under our control. To direct letters to our Mayors of 

Local  bodies,  saying  unless  you  do  this  we  are  not  going  to  budget  </span><span>–</span><span>  is  too  much.  

There is nothing wrong with re-evaluating what has happened in the last three years.  

But it seems to me that we are bringing the Outer Islands directly under the control of 

the Minister of Outer Islands Development. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Outer  Islands  have  elected  their  Local  Government.    They  have  elected  their 

</span><span>Mayors.  Let them decide.  To quote the former Minister of MOID he said:  “If you 

waste  your  Budget  that  is  your  fault.”    We  accept  this  challenge  from  </span><span>the  former 

Minister of MOID.  Surely we have survived up to now without putting strain on the 

parent Government.  

</span></div><div><span>I note that the allocations for Health in the Outer Islands has been minimal to say the 

least.  If I may just take the case of Manihiki and Rakahanga, there is no way we can 

</span><span>cover  a  doctor  being  permanent  in  those  islands.    $17,000  was  allocated  for  the 

</span><span>purchase  of  medicine  and  about  $30,000  for  improving  the  performance  of  Health 

workers. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>258 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    What  we  need  to  see  in  the  Outer 

Islands  is  the  provision  for  qualified  personnel  to  deliver  to  our  people  quality 

medicine  like  that  available  in  the  main  Island.    I  said  that  if  there  has  been  some 

failure  on  the  part  of  the  Outer  Islands  to  perform  the  functions  they  have  been 

prescribed, it should be the responsibility of MOID to point out the areas of weakness 

rather than taking the control of the Outer Islands back into the control of MOID.  If I 

correctly  remember,  Mr  Chairman,  the  Chief  Executives  were  there  to  report  and 

perform  duties  for  two  years  and  then  relinquish  the  responsibility  to  the  Local 

Government.  This is not the case.  As we see it today there is a three year programme 

to put the Outer Islands through another devolution.  Another devolution again.   

</span></div><div><span>I recall Mr Chairman, when this country was given control, to govern, we were given 

up to one year to be able to run ourselves.  In 1964 we chose a Government that saw 

the first Premier of the country, Mr DC Brown was elected and his Shadow Ministers.  

In  1965  Papa  Arapati  became  the  first  commonly  elected  Premier  of  the  country.  

Therefore, my question is, Mr Chairman, why is it so difficult to devolute the powers 

</span><span>to the Outer Islands.  Because if we go through his plan for the next three years then 

</span><span>the  total  process  of  devolution  is  nearly  10  years  all  together.    All  I  can  say  is,  the 

Outer Islands will never be devoluted.  The powers that the Devolution  has planned 

for  it  may  never  materialise.  Maybe  the  Outer  Islands  should  look  at  becoming 

republics.  That  is  probably where we will be  responsible for our destiny instead of 

suffering from the heavy hand of any Government.  All I ask Mr Chairman, is for us 

to  give  the  Outer  Islands  a  fair  go.    At  least  trust  their  elected  representatives,  the 

Mayors and Island Councillors.  I know a lot of them are very capable people.  The 

Mayor on Aitutaki, Atiu, and Mangaia are capable people. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  disappointed  with  the  letter  to  the  Mayor  of  Aitutaki.  An  attempt  to  clip  his 

wings.  That is what it means.  This is an unfair treatment of a good Mayor who has 

</span><span>been supporting the Democratic Alliance Party.  So my advice to you Mayors is don’t 

</span><span>be scared. Go in there and we will get the powers devoluted to you.  Our promise, the 

Democratic Alliance Party promise to  you when we become Government, is that we 

will devolute the power to you.  We will also find the money to run the island and you 

can  use  it  as  you  see  fit  for  your  people.    All  we  are  asking  is  for  you  to  be 

accountable  for  the  money  you  use  but  if  you  misuse  it  we  will  take  you  to  gaol.  

Because  the  law  of  the  country  is  for  everybody  not  just  a  select  few.    It  is  for 

everybody.    Whether  you  are  a  Mayor,  whether  you  are  a  Councillor  or  a  Chief 

Executive.  Even if you are an MP, or a Prime Minister or a Minister of the Crown.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I know it is difficult to share a small cake among so many people out 

there  in  the  Outer  Islands.    The  least  this  Government  should  have  done  was  to 

consult us, the Members of Parliament and the people of the Outer Islands. We need 

to  have  an  input  in  the  allocations  in  the  Budget.  We  are  the  ones  who  face  the 

problems every day and know what is needed to improve our lot in the Outer Islands.  

We  might  be  able  to  bring  other  issues  to  the  attention  of  Government,  such  as  the 

</span><span>people suffering in Penrhyn without water.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

I call the Honourable Member for Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA</span><span>:</span><span>Mr Chairman, Greetings in the love of God.  To the Clerk and to all 

staff Kia Orana in the Love of God.  Greetings to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime 

Minister  and  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry,  to  all  Government  Members  and  to  the  Leader  of 

the Opposition, Deputy Leader of the Opposition and all Members on the Opposition 

side, Good afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, we come to a very important area regarding the people of the Outer Islands.  I 

would  like  to  give  my  Greetings  to  all  the  people  of  the  Northern  Group  and  the 

Southern Group.  This is our time to look at  your Budget.  I believe we will have a 

difficult  task  because  of  the  wide  range  of  demands  from  the  respective  islands.  I 

would  like  to  express  my  Thanks  to  the  former  and  the  present  Ministers  of  Outer 

Islands Affairs. You have contributed a lot to the developments of the islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Excuse  me  Honourable  Member.    It  is  time  for  a  break.    This 

sitting is suspended until 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED AT 2.30 p.m.</span></div><div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>The sitting is resumed.  Before I call on the Honourable Member 

for Mauke to continue with your speech, I would like to remind Honourable Members 

that I shall be terminating the debate on the Bill at 4.30 p.m.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member for Mauke.  Did you wish to continue?  You have the Floor 

Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  M.  TAIA:  </span><span>Kia  Orana  again  to  all  of  us  in  the  blessed  name  of  our  Lord  Jesus 

</span><span>Christ.   We  are  now  debating  the  Outer  Island  Affairs’  budget.    We  have  heard  the 

</span><span>Deputy  Leader  of  the  corrective  side  express  how  the  devolution  has  impacted  the 

lives of the people in the Outer Islands.  Devolving the powers to govern and manage 

the affairs in the Outer Islands to our people has brought out the best amongst them. 

Some of the islands have managed to administer their affairs properly. As a result, the 

islands  have  flourished.    But  there  are  others  who  are  finding  it  difficult  to  manage 

their affairs. On my island, there were a number of areas which were of great concern 

to me. 

</span></div><div><span>For  example,  Health,  Education,  Justice  and  Police  are  all  professional  services.    In 

managing these services as well as the Doctors and Nurses, I do not see how a group 

of people could possibly have the know how to decide what salary is appropriate for a 

particular job. I believe, such responsibilities be confined to the experts in Rarotonga. 

They know what to do and how to assess. Maintaining the schools and the like are the     

types  of  jobs  which  can  be  managed  by  the  local  authorities.  The  Agriculture, 

</span><span>Ministry of Works and other devolution projects should be under MOID. I am hopeful 

</span><span>that the Minister will look into this matter seriously.  If the people who are given the 

responsibility of overseeing these areas are qualified, then there will be no problems. 

Otherwise, we will have serious repercussions on some of the Outer Islands.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>260 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I notice that there is an increase of in this Budget and  $100,000 has been allocated for 

Mauke.    I  can  also  see  increases  for  Atiu,  Mauke  and  Mitiaro.    Even  though  these 

increases  are  there  they  are  not  enough  for  the  development  of  our  country.    I  have 

been pondering over organic food production.  I will fully support this idea because it 

will benefit the people.  But I do not think we are able to make any changes because 

the Budget is already set. We will have to wait until the next financial year. 

</span></div><div><span>The other area I am looking at is the Justice and the promotion of law and order on the 

island of Mauke.  Justice has $150 allocated for it, and Law and Order has $312.  In 

order for these to improve we need to increase this budget allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Please carry on with your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  M.  TAIA:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Another  area  I  wish  to  talk  about  is 

regarding the Mayor, the  Island Council and the Member of Parliament.    In the last 

administration,  the  Mayor  was  completely  isolated  from  the  Island  Council,  and  the 

Member of Parliament was also isolated from these two.  Maybe the Mayor thought 

</span><span>that because the people of the island elected him to the position of Mayor, he should 

</span><span>be higher than any other authority.  I would like to ask, who then elected the Member 

</span><span>of Parliament? The pigs or what!  Doesn’t he realise that the Member of Parliament 

</span><span>has  been  elected  into  the  highest  court  of  this  country.    I  strongly  suggest  that 

Members of Parliament should be included in the administration of the island.  I can 

see the present Members of Parliament now are well versed with what is going on and 

with administrative matters.  Their worth should be put to good use. That is why they 

were elected to this House.  

</span></div><div><span>Maybe  in  so</span><span>me  districts  in  Rarotonga,  you’re  alright,  unlike  Mauke,  we  have  some 

</span><span>difficulties.  My desire is for all the authorities to work together.  It is a common sight 

on Mauke after elections for politics to prevail.  In my observation in this House, I can 

see that these negative impacts from politics are gradually phasing out. We are saying 

that there should be unity among us but it is only through our work that unity can be 

seen.   

This will be the last day of our sitting and I would like to say to you all, thank you for 

the love and kindness which I have found in you since the day I entered Parliament.  

Maybe you people will say I am dumb if I say, let us go to church.  I am sure if we do 

that regularly, it will assist us to know exactly how we can govern our  country well 

and do what is right in Parliament.  If we are to rely on our physical capabilities, we 

are bound to fail. This is what I wish to say, May God truly bless us all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member for Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, the Greetings have fully 

been expressed to all. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  my  support  to  the  allocation  for  the  Ministry  of  the  “sister” 

</span><span>islands.    I  have  diff</span><span>iculty,  Mr  Chairman,  with  the  term  “Outer  Islands”  because  it 

</span><span>sounds like we are out of sight and out of mind.  That is why, Mr Chairman, I prefer 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>261 

</span></div><div><span>the term “sister” islands.  However, for the sake of our Budget,  I would refer to the 

</span><span>allocation of MOID </span><span>–</span><span> Ministry of Outer Islands Development. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like,  Mr  Chairman,  to  support  the  views  expressed  by  the  Minister  of 

Outer  Islands  with  regard  to  the  devolution  process  whereby  the  devolution  policy 

framework, the legal framework and the human resources development framework be 

looked at properly before we devolve to the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>However, before I give my views on the devolution, let us come back to the Budget.  I 

see there is an increase of about $800,000 that will be given to the Outer Islands this 

year. Of this, Mr Chairman, we know that $1.4 million will go to Health, $2.6 million 

will go to Education, $3.7 million to the Economic Development and $1.8 million for 

</span><span>the good governance of the country.  I’m not so sure if this is  enough for the Out</span><span>er 

Islands but $9 million I will accept as the allocation for this year. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  breakdown  of  the  Outer  Islands,  as  stated  by  the  Honourable  Member  for 

</span><span>Manihiki, it was a pity that we didn’t get this information earlier.  However, I am one 

</span><span>of those that went and sought the information and it was readily available. 

</span></div><div><span>I also support his view and I am sure the Minister of Outer Islands today will support 

the  view  that  maybe  in  future  that  before  the  allocation  on  MOID  is  designed  we 

should  get  all  the  Members  of  the  Outer  Islands  involved  in  the  initial  stage  of  the 

Budget formulation.  Because, Mr Chairman, there may be some Members from the 

Outer Islands who will not be part of the Budget discussion because they are on the 

other side of the House.  I think they should be given the opportunity to take part in 

discussion of the Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Thank you Teina.  Yes, they should have the same input into it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> However, their views, Mr Chairman, must come in consultation of 

their individual Outer Islands Local Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  if  I  may  just  concentrate  on  Health  and  Education.    We  are  going  to 

give almost $4 million towards the Health and Education of the Outer Islands and if 

we just take Education, Mr Chairman, there is $2.6 million  that  will be  allocated to 

the Outer Islands.  The question which will always arise is, is this enough?  And I am 

</span><span>sure all the Honourable Members will say “No, it is not enough”.  However, if I may 

</span><span>remind  the  Honourable  Members  over  the  last  twenty  years  we  have  given  this 

country more than $70 million towards the development of education in this country.  

With that allocation, Mr Chairman, we have to ask, what is the professional status of 

our  teachers  in  our  country  over  the  last  twenty  years?    What  is  the  Mi</span><span>nistry’s 

</span><span>financial  contribution  towards  the  private  schools  over  the  last  twenty  years?    And 

have we considered the fact that there are some people who have sent their children 

overseas  to  be  educated.  Mr  Chairman,  we  should  ask  ourselves  as  Honourable 

Members. Have we invested properly into the education of this country?  We still hear 

that Parent Teachers Associations are fundraising to help with their schools.  We have 

</span><span>just  received  some  financial  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  to  help 

</span><span>with school buildings and apart from parents paying taxes into the economy, they are 

still  sending  their  children  overseas  to  be  educated.    That  is  why  I  asked,  Mr 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>262 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Chairman, as what the value is of the $70 million we have invested into this country.  

Where did it go to? 

</span></div><div><span>That is why, Mr Chairman, I would like to time my talk on education with regard to 

the principle of devolution.  There is a line of thought that we give the allocation to 

the Outer Islands and if they run out of money then who cares?  Mr Chairman, I think 

</span><span>that’s  not  a  responsible attitude.  If  an  island  takes  their  allocation  for  the  Education 

</span><span>Vote Item and put it on the road and the young children suffers the education, are we 

going to  say  who cares? Or are we as Honourable Members of this country  making 

sure that we prevent such a damage from happening to these innocent children?  

</span></div><div><span> Mr Chairman, I agree with the process of devolution but we have to be very careful 

with it.  The policy framework must be in place, the legal framework must be in place 

and the human resources framework must be in place before we devolve to the Outer 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your second speech Honourable Member.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Within the framework of the devolution 

</span><span>process  we  must  work  closely  together  with  our  Mayors,  Island  Councillors,  CEOs 

and all the Government workers in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>We should not worry too much about who is supposed to be the most powerful person 

on the island. Or who should do this or that. Rather what is the end result, who will 

benefit. We must have the spirit of co-operation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, my friend, Tai Hermann has been mentioned in this House.  I wish to 

inform Honourable Members of this House that he is a good friend of mine. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  How good? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>  And  I  am  one  of  the  reasons  why  he  is  the  Mayor  of  the  Island 

today.  However,  I  believe  there  is  some  misunderstanding  with  regard  to  the 

responsibilities and principle of devolution and I am sure that we can work together 

for the benefit of the island of Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>With  that,  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  support  the  Vote  Item  of  the  Ministry  of 

Outer Islands with the hope that next year we will be talking about the Ministry of the 

</span><span>“sister” islands.  Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Honourable Member for Rakahanga, your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  In terms of the devolution process, the 

island of Rakahanga is ready to take on the responsibility.  I want the Minister to hand 

that  over  to  us.  We  do  not  want  to  wait  for  the  next  three  years.    They  have  been 

</span><span>waiting, ready to take on the responsibility.  They don’t know about the other islands 

</span><span>but Rakahanga is ready to work. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>263 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  sure  Manihiki  is  also  ready.  Why  are  we  hanging  on?    These  two  islands  are 

ready to take on the challenge.  I can recall when we were at the Retreat which was 

held  at  the Rarotongan  Hotel,  we were  asked whether the  Island Councils  would be 

able  to  run  their  own  islands.    The  Secr</span><span>etary  correctly  replied  at  the  time  that:    “to 

learn to swim, just throw a person in the sea and he will soon learn to swim.”  This is 

</span><span>what the Secretary said. Who knows, they might teach us how to manage these new 

concepts.  Maybe  they  can  show  us  a  thing  or  two.    If  there  are  islands  who  are 

doubtful  of  their  capabilities  they  can  wait.  Those  islands  that  are  ready  to  take  on 

their responsibilities give it to them. This is what I wanted to say because the people 

of  Rakahanga  and  the  Island  Council  of  Rakah</span><span>anga  are  ready.    I  don’t  think  this  is 

</span><span>only from Rakahanga but probably Manihiki, Penrhyn and also Pukapuka. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  on  the  Member  for 

Ruatonga-Avatiu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span> Greetings to you Mr Chairman.  To the Clerk and Interpreters, 

to  the  Opposition  and  their  Leader,  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  all  Honourable 

</span><span>Members on the Government side, Greetings to you all in the Love of God. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the MOID Budget and also to the Minister responsible for 

this Appropriation.  I can see it has been a difficult task to allocate these funds to the 

various  islands.    I  do  not  have  very  much  to  say  on  this  Vote  Item  but  hearing  the 

Members  representing  the  Outer  Islands  taking  on  this  Vote  Item,  I  would  like  to 

speak on behalf of the Island of Palmerston.  I look at this Appropriation of around $9 

Million Dollars and I hope Palmerston is part of this Appropriation.  I would just like 

to ask the Minister to keep in mind that we have people on this island. Although, there 

are not many people on that island. I would like to see some consideration in the area 

of Education for this island. The school was burnt down sometimes ago and I do not 

know if anything has been done about it. I know that a teacher has been sought. The 

children on the island must be educated.   

</span></div><div><span>In terms  of the Health, there is  a need to  look  into  the hospital, doctor  and a nurse.  

Likewise, their electric supply.  There are people living there and maybe the Minister 

could visit this island to see what is going on. This island does not have an airport and 

boats hardly travel there.  Sometimes ago, there was a boat designated for this island. 

</span><span>It was called the “RAVAKAI”.  May the Honourable Member Tapi Taio can look into 

</span><span>this area and visit this island. 

</span></div><div><span>I think it would be a good idea for us to look into the possibility of building an airport 

on  this  island  for  emergency  purposes  so  that  a  plane  can  land  on  the  island.    I  am 

looking forward to travelling to this island in the very near future.  So I support the 

Appropriation  for  the  MOID  with  the  wish  that  the  Island  of  Palmerston  is  also 

included in this Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR MINISTER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

</span><span>The Honourable Member for Mapu-Teenui. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  U.  SIMPSON:</span><span>  Kia  Orana  Mr  Chairman  and  your  Staff  and  Honourable 

Members  of  this  Parliament.    The  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  all 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>264 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Members  of  Government,  Kia  Orana  in  the  name  of  our  Lord.    The 

Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader and all the Members of the Opposition, Kia 

Orana  in  the  name  of  our  Lord.    Kia  Orana  also  to  our  people  listening  in  to  our 

discussion this afternoon.  Through you Mr Chairman, I would like to send Greetings 

to  the island of Enuamanu.  Kia Orana to  all the traditional  leaders.  The leaders of 

religious organisations, the leaders of local Government and the people of the island 

Kia Orana.  Kia Orana also to all public servants and also the business people on the 

island.   

I give my support Mr Chairman to the Appropriation for the Ministry of Outer Islands 

Development.    With  regard  to  the  allocation  for  the  island  of  Atiu  we  see  there  are 

various allocation of funds although the funds are not sufficient.  Maybe in the near 

future we will be able to provide a little more support. 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to the Health Department on the island of Atiu we are doing pretty well. 

We  have  a  doctor  and  a  staff  nurse.  The  only  area  we  are  lacking  is  in  medical 

supplies. 

</span></div><div><span>I  can  see  there  is  an  allocation  for  medical  supplies  and  I  hope  this  is  going  to  be 

</span><span>enough  to  buy  all  the  necessary  medicines.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Education for providing us with paint for the schools.  The community has done the 

painting.    Today  on  the  island  is  a  group  of  people  doing  their  best  to  improve  the 

electrical  supply  on  the  island.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  Principal  and  teachers  for 

doing their best for our school children. 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to the issue of energy on our island.  The energy supply is good and the 

workers  are  doing  a  very  good  job  supplying  our  electricity  24  hours  a  day.    One 

problem area is the road.  These are not in a very good condition.  There are cracks in 

the seal and potholes all over the place.  These are filled with sand but unfortunately 

when it rains the sand is gouged away.  I hope that the allocation being appropriated 

for Atiu will be sufficient to fix these problems.  Another problem we have had during 

the dry season is the water supply which has dropped drastically.  The Island Council 

has decided to dig another well and provide a pump to siphon the water out and into 

the water tank. Some new tanks have been built to provide more water storage.   

</span></div><div><span>With regards to the condition of some homes on the island.  A number of roofing iron 

has  deteriorated  and  these  homes  need  to  be  renovated.    This  is  a  request  to 

Government to reopen the housing loan scheme because these homes were built using 

loans from this scheme.   

</span></div><div><span>On the subject of the barge for the island of Atiu.  A barge is badly needed. For too 

long the island had no barge.  At the moment they are using aluminium fishing boats 

to unload cargo.  The Honourable Member Tapi Taio knows this because he made his 

own float in Rarotonga to carry his power poles onto the island.   

</span></div><div><span>With  regard  to  the  subject  of  Agriculture,  I  strongly  support  the  allocation  for 

agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Carry on with your second speaking time Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>265 

</span></div><div><span>MR  U.  SIMPSON:  </span><span>In  the  past,  we  have  reaped  the  benefited  from  oranges, 

pineapples, banana, and on Mauke, ginger.  The farmers have benefited from planting 

these produce in the past.  Today we do not see any benefits from these products.  I 

will leave it up to the Minister of Agriculture to look into this area and maybe revive 

some of this produce. 

</span></div><div><span>In  trying  to  support  and  encourage  the  people  of  the  island  I  would  like  to  ask  the 

Government  to  provide  a  revolving  fund  to  enable  them  to  clear  the  land  for 

agriculture.  Today the Island Council has in place a programme involving men from 

the ages of 16 to 59.  This programme commenced in July and will go through until 

December.   The order from  the  Island Council is  that these  young people plant 500 

</span><span>nono</span><span>  plants,  500  Coffee  plants  and  100  Vanilla  plants.    These  figures  are  the 

minimum  figures  and  if  you  think  you  can  plant  more  than  that,  people  are 

encouraged to go for it. They are also planting taro, tarua, maniota and banana.  There 

will  be  an  inspection  held  in  the  middle  of  the  month  and  another  in  the  middle  of 

December.  Then we will find out those people who have not  followed these orders 

and they will be fined.  With regard to the issue of Forestry, the Island Council would 

like to see this revived. 

</span></div><div><span>My last point is  with regard to Crown Lands on Atiu.  There are some lands on the 

island, which have been taken as Crown Lands.  Government has not made use of it 

so the landowners would like it returned to them.  I hope and believe that Government 

will look into this subject.  I give my full support for the Appropriation of MOID. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member for Amuri Ureia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Thank  you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to  you and to  your staff.  Kia 

Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry,  Cabinet 

Ministers, the  Leader of the Opposition  and  your Deputy, to  all the Members in  the 

House, Kia Orana this afternoon.  Kia Orana to our people who are listening in to the 

discussion on the Appropriation before us this afternoon.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank him for all he has found out and conveyed to us with regard to 

MOID and the process of devolution, and also the problems that have come up as a 

result of the devolution process. 

</span></div><div><span>I commend him for slowing down the process of devolution in the Outer Islands.  This 

is very similar to a motor cycle.  As soon as the wheel starts to wobble, you stop and 

fix it.  In the wisdom of the Minister, he did that.  He saw that the motor cycle was 

beginning to  wobble, he stopped it and is  trying to  fix it.   If something  goes wrong 

with it there are a lot of parts that could go wrong.  Maybe in this process that we are 

talking about there is only one loose nut and if we tighten this nut then everything will 

be fine again.  That is why I said earlier that this Minister has wisdom because he sees 

that the motor cycle is not too good so he is stopping and is going to try and fix it.  

</span></div><div><span>So my question is, is it appropriate for the Island Councils to do what Government has 

</span><span>given them to do.  I don’t know what your answer is going to be.  My answer is, yes.  

</span><span>But  the  problem  has  been  that  the  Island  Council  is  too  proud.    The  Island  Council 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>266 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>wanted to take everything pertaining to the island for them to administrate.  Lucifer is 

Satan today.  The Lord God believed that Lucifer would be able to control everything 

in heaven. But he was too proud, like the Councillors. What happened then? Because 

he was so proud he was thrown out to earth and today we know him as Satan.   

</span></div><div><span>I  know  the  Opposition  does  not  care  about  these  fine  details.  They  will  say  that 

everything is fine.  Rakahanga and Manihiki </span><span>are fine. If anything goes wrong it won’t 

be their fault.  It will be Government’s fault, not our problem.  What I would like to 

</span><span>do is to thank the Leader of the corrective side.  He agreed with what the Minister said 

in  so  far  as  the  administration  in  some  of  the  Outer  Islands  is  no  good.    I  know 

Rakahanga is like this.  Rakahanga is not good.  I know that there are things on this 

island that are going wrong but the Honourable Member comes to this House and say 

</span><span>that they are not worried. He doesn’t really need to worry about this because it’s not 

his problem.  It is the Government of the day’s problem.  I also like the views given to 

</span><span>us by the Honourable Member for Mauke. He told us that in the past there was no end 

to  politicking because the people would be  committed and fully involved in  politics 

come  the  next  election.    Now,  he  is  telling  us  that  this  year  everything  is  gradually 

</span><span>getting better..   It’s not the same as it used to be.  I’m not too certain whether he is 

</span><span>saying it is better in this House or outside of this House.  If he is talking about inside 

</span><span>this House, we can see now that the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister is on this side 

so  there  is  no  more  problems  on  that  side.    At  one  time  he  was  in  the  Opposition 

bench  with  your  leader.    I  am  hoping  that  you  all  remain  on  the  corrective  side  as 

Opposition.   

</span></div><div><span>I am not too certain what the Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati is referring to 

when he talked about the 29</span><span>th</span><span>.   Whether he said that on the 29</span><span>th</span><span> everything will be 

</span><span>fine.  I’m not sure.  I have</span><span> no problems if there is a change.  What I am talking about 

is the politics. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  why  I  thanked  and  congratulated  the  Honourable  Minister,  Mr  Chairman, 

because of his wisdom and as a result of that we will see some new policies and a new 

direction in the near future.  I know this Minister well.  He is rather an angry person 

</span><span>sometimes and he doesn’t care, whatever he wants to do gets done.</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I have run out of things to say. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Well you may speak on your second speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Thank you.  Like I was saying, Mr Chairman, I have run out of things 

to say but I was just trying to see who is going to speak after me.  If nobody is going 

to speak I will speak until half past four. 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  would  like  to  send  my  Greetings,  my  love  to  all  the  staff  of  the  MOID  in  the 

Outer Islands, to all the doctors, to the CEOs, to the Government Representatives, to 

everybody in the Outer Islands.  If you are having problems on your islands, if you are 

having problems with your Local Government, with your Island Councils, please ring 

</span><span>the Honourable Dr Pupuke Robati and get him to tell the truth in this House.  I’m not 

</span><span>worried about the 29</span><span>th</span><span> Mr Chairman because when they were campaigning they said 

</span><span>that they would do away with this devolution.  I’m no</span><span>t too certain whether this is the 

view  of  a  lot  of  people  but  I  think  it  is  the  view  of  one,  maybe  two  people  in  this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>267 

</span></div><div><span>political party.  I think it is not the whole party.  What they said however is that when 

they  become  Government  they  will  do  away  with  this  Ministry.    And  now  they  are 

worried because the Minister has stopped the devolution process in the Outer Islands.  

So we cannot be certain why they wanted to get rid of this Ministry, to get rid of this 

process and why at this point in time they want this process to continue. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, we need to  check ourselves in  our debates.  It  is  affecting  our people. 

We  should  not  come  into  this  House  thinking  that  things  are  to  be  done  as  the 

Member for Mauke thinks, as the Member for Rakahanga thinks. What we  do when 

we come into this House is to contribute things, which will be beneficial to the Outer 

Islands.  Now  that  the  Minister  has  stopped  this  process,  the  island  of  Rakahanga 

wants to continue on their own. 

</span></div><div><span>As  I  said  earlier  on,  the  Outer  Islands  Councils  are  appropriate  for  each  of  those 

individual  islands.    They  are  not  people  who  are  highly  trained.    They  were  people 

who came from the villages, they were put into the same group and from there they 

worked for the benefit of their respective islands. But if they become too proud then 

</span><span>we will not be able to achieve much.  I myself am not highly qualified.  I didn’t finish 

</span><span>school.  I have a business of my own.  I started this business.  It is still operational.  I 

</span><span>don’t have any qualifications but I managed</span><span> to keep my business going.  My business 

</span><span>is still going.  But there is no pride involved.  I’m not a proud person to show off my 

achievements and jingle coins in my pockets.  There’s no pride in this.  </span></div><div><span>As  the  Minister  indicated  to  us  earlier  on,  this  group  of  people  who  are  going  from 

island to island will be conducting a conference on the island of Penrhyn.  Then we 

will find out as a result of that conference where we go from there. 

</span></div><div><span>There should not be any conflicts between the Island Councillors and the Mayors. But 

they  started  show  off  and  they  wanted  to  take  over  everything  in  the  Outer  Islands. 

They  wanted  to  be  the  administrators  of  everything.    I  think  I  will  end  it  here  Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  the  next  speaker  from 

Vaipae-Tautu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  K.  IOANE:</span><span>  Kia  Orana  to  you  Mr  Chairman.  To  your  Staff  and  to  all  the 

Honourable Members in this House.  That is sufficient Greetings.  I will come to the 

important subject for the day because we are running out of time. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chair</span><span>man, I won’t thank the Minister yet as I remember the words of Jacob to the 

Angel. He said to the Angel:  “You have to bless me before I let you go.”</span></div><div><span>I  have  a  few  things  to  say.    I  don’t  agree  with  the  previous  speaker,  but  that  is  his 

</span><span>understanding  of  the  issue.    Mr  Chairman,  we  are  criticising  the  Mayors  and  Island 

Councillors who were elected into this office by our people who believed they would 

be  good  leaders.    Mr  Chairman,  we  are  all  criticising  and  saying  that  these  Island 

</span><span>Councillors  are  too  proud  and  are  showing  off.    But  I  think  the  reason  for  this  is 

</span><span>because  we  have  given  the  Island  Councillors  “ghost  money”.    By  this  I  mean,  the 

</span><span>numbers are written in our budgets but the money never got to where it was supposed 

to go. I do not believe that these people are too proud.  They actually want to do some 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>268 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>good  for  their  island.    But  I  think  now  we  will  reap  some  benefits  on  the  Island  of 

Aitutaki because the Assistant Minister is the Honourable Member Teina Bishop.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, with  regard to our Mayor, this is  a man who really wants  to improve 

his island.   

</span></div><div><span>Now I want to come back and ask a favour of the Minister, because I believe we are 

friends.  I have a problem in Aitutaki.  There is a row of houses in Vaipeka where the 

power cables are strung between mango trees, coconut trees and kapok trees.  I think 

Mr Chairman if the Minister was to see this job, he would agree with me that should a 

hurricane blow one of the trees down there will be a total black out in this area. This 

area I am speaking of is about five hundred meters.  I think it would only require less 

than  ten  power  poles  to  solve  this  problem.    So  I  would  like  to  ask  my  friend  the 

Minister to look into this area. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, Mr Chairman, with regard to the water supply in my area.  We call it water 

but it is not, it is seawater.  I request if we may be provided with a machine to extract 

the salt out of the salt-water.  I understand that the Akitua Resort acquired a machine 

</span><span>like this for about $500. Mr Chairman, these are our people.  If you are in this district 

</span><span>and you want to take a shower what you are doing is really taking a swim in seawater.  

I  am  here  in  Rarotonga  enjoying  fresh  water  showers,  my  friends  back  in  Aitutaki 

showering in salt water.  So I would like to ask the Minister to resolve this matter as 

soon as possible.  If you do this, you will be remembered and I will thank you then. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  We have another five minutes 

to go before I terminate the debate.
