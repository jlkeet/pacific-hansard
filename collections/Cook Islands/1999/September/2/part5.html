</span></div><div><span>And  I  also  believe  that  Tourism  is  about  to  take  off  with  the  new  flights  that  Air  New 

Zealand  is  creating  and  with  other  airlines  coming  in  I  see  prosperity  just  around  the 

corner.  There are so  many  other possibilities Mr Chairman.  Just  imagine the value of 

our  Manganese  Nodules  at  the  bottom  of  our  ocean.    It  is  valued  at  American  Dollars, 

705 Billion Dollars </span><span>–</span><span> this is a Thousand Million Dollars </span><span>–</span><span> US$705 Billion.  Mr Chairman 

if a group of Inve</span><span>stors were to come here and say: “We would like to secure the right to 

</span><span>your  Manganese  Nodules,  and  how  about  we  deposit  1  Billion  US$  on  one  condition.  

That is we enjoy the right, together with you - to mine the Manganese whenever we are 

</span><span>ready?”  Mr Chai</span><span>rman, these are not fantasies. There are already people coming into this 

country offering to market the right to our Manganese Nodules and these run into billions 

of dollars. 

</span></div><div><span>Now that is just the beginning. It gives us the indication that down there in the bottom of 

the ocean, in our waters are billions of dollars worth of minerals. Worth so much that we 

will outstrip countries like Nauru in value for the future.  I am quite sure if the right price 

is struck we would start to see the benefits of this valuable mineral deposit in our lifetime 

and the easiest way is to market the rights.   

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  what  I  consider  to  be  the  backbone  of  our  economy  I  treat  Tourism, 

Manufacturing  and  exports  as  the  backbone  of  our  economy.    Mr  Chairman  I  do  not 

consider  retailing  to  be  the  backbone  of  this  country.    I  also  venture  to  say  that  this 

country  can  sometimes  be  described  as  a  nation  of  shopkeepers.    These  shopkeepers 

dominate the Chamber of Commerce.  My appeal to the shopkeepers is to tone down their  

politica</span><span>l  interference.    Settle  down  and  let’s  work  together  to  develop  this  country.  

</span><span>Somehow  while  we  in  Government  are  doing  our  best  to  stabilise  the  country  these 

shopkeepers  continue  to  stir  the  Chamber  of  Commerce.    Their  self-proclaimed 

importance is not justified for what they are doing.  They need to be reminded from time 

to  time  that  no  one  asked  them  to  be  shopkeepers  or  retailers.    They  are  there  for  the 

money.    They  are  making  good  money  and  they  should  stop  making  a  nuisance  of 

</span><span>themselves.   

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  the  Development  Investment  Board  Mr  Chairman.    I  do  have 

reservations about the makeup of the Board.  As an Honourable gentleman I do not wish 

to name people but the composition of the Board ought to be reviewed and I would like to 

see some changes.  The Chief Executive seems to be doing a splendid job although from 

time  to  time  he  has  jumped  into  the  political  arena.    I  put  that  down  to  youthful 

exuberance.  The fact that he and his family supported DAP - I will not hold that against 

him.  They are permitted to make mistakes and I am sure that has nothing to do with his 

</span><span>official function.  But from what I hear this young man is doing well so let us encourage 

</span><span>him to do so. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your third speaking time Deputy Prime Minister.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>161 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Thank you.  If there is anything I would caution the management 

of DIB  about  a number  of things.   In our evaluation of this budget  we discovered they 

granted exemptions worth $200,000 in this last financial year.  That is far too excessive, 

that is  a major dent  in  the revenue of the country.   I caution the Executive of DIB that 

they  should  stop,  they  should  not  grant  exemptions  easily  which  will  be  detrimental  to 

collecting revenue for the benefit of this country.  The outcome of this excessive granting 

of  exemptions  is  that  we  might  have  to  change  the  law  to  prohibit  DIB  from  giving 

exemptions  in  the  future.    They  have  also  made  some  hairy  decisions  in  immigration 

matters.  An example has been given to me where a person came as a visitor and wanted 

employment.    But  the  normal  requirement  by  the  Department  of  Immigration  is  if  you 

want  to  come  and  work  you  have  to  go  back  to  your  country  of  origin  and  apply  for  a 

permit before you are allowed to come back here to work.  This policy has consistently 

been  enforced  by  the  Department  of  Immigration.    When  this  person  was  stopped,  he 

went to the DIB and obtained a work permit because under the laws that established the 

Development Investment Board they have the power to override other departments.  This 

person did not bring an investment.  This person took a job off a Cook Islander.  Do you 

call  that  investment?    Do  you  call  that  a  sound  decision?    I  say  no.    So  this  is  a  clear 

notice to the Executive of DIB.  Be cautious.  Some of your mistakes are alarming.  DIB 

should not be used as a means for people to bypass the Ministry of Immigration.  I also 

want to caution the Board members and the Executive of DIB to watch out for conflicts 

of  interest.    It  is  starting  to  look  obvious  in  some  instances.    There  have  been  some 

horrific  examples  in  the  past  where  people  working  for  Government  discovered 

investment opportunities through their work and ended up being involved in it.  I want to 

serve notice that this Deputy Prime Minister does not tolerate that.   I am quite sure the 

coalition Government will not tolerate it so notice is out, no more, over and out. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally the comment made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the instance of 

the Power Board in Aitutaki.  I just want to say that we are also alarmed about what has 

happened.  I hope it is a change for the better but again the clear message is this, the CIIC 

makes the decision and Cabinet and Government get blamed for the results.  I also want 

to serve notice that I am totally against privatisation of the Ports Authority and my reason 

is  we  have  to  protect  the  revenue  of  the  country.    Devanning  must  take  place  on  the 

</span><span>wharf,  so  we  may  police  smuggling  and  drugs  into  the  country.    At  least  while  the 

</span><span>devanning  is  taking  place  on  the  wharf  it  is  monitored  and  inspected  and  in  the  future 

when a drug dog is brought over that drug dog will go right through it. 

</span></div><div><span>So I urge those shop keepers who are demanding the privatisation to please slow down.  

</span><span>I’m not with you.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I support this Vote Allocation.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The  Honourable  Member  for 

Nikao-Panama. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>162 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  to  you,  Mr  Chairman.    To  the  Clerk  and  to  all  the 

staff of Parliament </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana.  Kia Orana to the Prime Minister, to the Deputy Prime 

Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to us all, 

the Honourable Members of this House </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to us this afternoon.  Kia Orana also 

to our people listening in to our discussions this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>We have all heard the view presented before I rose to speak and I think they are all good 

points.  Kia Orana also to the Chairman of the Development Investment Board and to all 

the staff members. To all our friends who have brought their investment into our country, 

Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  come  back  now  and  speak  especially  to  the  Cook  Islanders  trying  to  better  our  

country.    I  was  listening  to  the  views  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Ministe</span><span>r  and  I  don’t 

</span><span>completely agree with what he was saying.  I have already formulated my views before I 

came to Parliament today, especially to Cook Islanders who have invested in our country.  

I  believe  what  these  people  are  doing.  They  are  trying  to  take  the  opportunity  of 

embracing these people who have lost their jobs to give them the opportunity to work.  I 

know  there  are  some  disadvantages  with  these  people.      But  I  feel  that  the  advantages 

seem  to  outweigh  the  disadvantages,  particularly  in  providing  jobs  for  our  people.  We 

also know that there are foreigners </span><span>who own businesses over here.  They’ve elected the 

</span><span>Cook  Islands  as  their  place  of  residence.  These  people  invested  here  to  benefit  both 

themselves  as  well  as  our  people.    In  our  Government  Ministries,  the  number  of 

employees have shrunk because a whole lot were transitioned.  Yet these investors have 

started businesses and are now employing locals. That is why I said we should look after 

these people who are prepared to come in and invest here. 

</span></div><div><span>I also want to acknowledge the presence of tourists in our country.  This is another class 

of people who are prepared to come here.  While here, they spend their money. There are 

locals  who  sell  their  agriculture  products  to  hotels.    Planters  who  sell  their  products  to 

hotels can asses the rise and the fall of the number of tourists visiting us by the demand 

from the hotels. 

</span></div><div><span>There  are  also  a  number  of  local  entrepreneurs  like  Helena  Tavioni  who  is  now  into 

</span><span>fashion. Helena is running a business for herself and at the same time she is employing a 

couple of locals. She produce for both the local as well as the overseas markets.  That is 

money coming back into this country.  In her business, she managed everything. She is 

doing her own selling and her own promotion.  There are a lot of people in our country 

who have their own private businesses like myself for instance.  I have been working in 

the business that I am doing now for 36 years.  My business has never been bankrupt and 

</span><span>I haven’t even channelled my r</span><span>evenue from my business out of the country.  I used it to 

support my family.   We should have the confidence in ourselves. The harvest is great but 

</span><span>there are a few labourers to harvest. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also venture to say that we should not depend entirely upon foreign investment.  

We should utilise what we have.   These investors must use their money  here and then 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>163 

</span></div><div><span>use  the  spill-over  to  improve  our  country.  We  will  be  able  to  make  money  out  of  our 

handcrafts,  carvings and other local products.  We can export them overseas which will 

be money diverted into our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>There  are  times  we  know  what  to  do  but  we  are  afraid  to  go  to  the  bank  and  make  a 

commitment to  borrow some money to  start a business.    I started off like that.   It  was 

difficult for me to go and </span><span>see the Bank but if you’re honest there is no need to be scared 

</span><span>of borrowing from them. These are some of the thoughts which I wish to share with our 

people.  However, at the end of the day, you will have to elect what exactly you want to 

do.  There are so many ways and so many ideas today but it is up to us to put those ideas 

into practice. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  This is your second speech Honourable Member.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>I don’t want to see a  conflict between one group of people  and 

</span><span>another.  I want us to help each other.  If we are not sure what to do, ask.  There is no 

harm in asking for help.  These are my views,  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  for  a  new  speaker.    The 

Honourable Member for Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara.  You have the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Mr  Chairman,  Clerk  of  the  House,  all 

Honourable Members </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>We  heard  the  greetings  from  various  Members.  Now,  I  would  like  to  speak  on  this 

Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  support  the  allocation  for  the  Development  Investment 

Board but with a big question mark beside it.  Of all the allocations we have looked into,  

</span><span>this is the first time that an allocation has a minus in this year’s allocation.  Maybe</span><span> there 

is a good reason why. Compared to last year there is less than $4,865 that we are giving  

to the Development Investment Board. 

</span></div><div><span>The question I pose is that we are at the stage of trying to develop the economy and we 

</span><span>are  giving  less  money  for  this  area  in  terms  of  our  Budget.    Maybe  that  is  what  the 

Development  Investment  Board  asked  for.  If  that  is  the  case,  so  be  it.    We  heard  the 

Honourable Member Robert Woonton talk about the value of our investors from last year, 

</span><span>$41  Million.    So  I’d  like  to  join</span><span>  all  other  Honourable  Members  in  congratulating  the 

Development Investment Board.   

</span></div><div><span>I would also like, Mr Chairman, to support the view that we should look after potential 

</span><span>investors  coming  into  our  country.    I  say  the  word  “Potential”,  Mr  Chairman,  becaus</span><span>e 

</span><span>we’ve  had  investors  come  into  our  country  before  who  were  dreamers.  I  think  the</span><span>Development  Investment  Board,  through  their  criteria  of  working  with  the  potential 

investors,  should be able to look into who the serious investors are. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>164 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>In  regards  to  the  incident  at  the  airport,  Mr  Chairman,  I  believe  the  Development 

Investment  Board can work together with  the  Immigration Department  and Protocol,  to 

</span><span>make sure that these potential investors are looked after. Because I don’t see it a problem 

</span><span>for  the  Development  Investment  Board  to  inform  the  Protocol  that  there  is  a  potential 

investor coming in, and to make sure there are Eis provided.  I believe there is a room at 

the airport  where  we  can entertain these potential investors.  However,  Mr Chairman,  I 

believe  if  we  can  put  this  in  place  we  should  also  extend  this  protocol  to  our  local 

investors  who  have  already  invested  in  our  country.    It  is  my  belief  Mr  chairman,  that 

before  we  look  after  potential  investors  we  should  look  after  the  investors  who  have 

already invested in this country and helped build the economy of this country.  There is a 

</span><span>saying: “It is better the Devil you know than the Devil you don’t”.  So if we can apply 

that, I’m sure we can do this for our investors as well.  However, when we provide </span><span>these 

so-called protocol services to these investors it should not be free. It should be part of the 

cost  for  their  coming  into  the  country  to  invest.  I  am  sure  these  investors  -  if  they  are 

</span><span>serious,  would  not  mind  doing  so.    It’s  just  that  what  they  would</span><span>  like  is  a  welcoming 

environment  when  they  come  into  this  country  and  I  think  this  is  the  point  that  the 

Honourable Member Woonton was trying to make.   

</span></div><div><span>If I may come back to our local investors, Mr Chairman.  I believe it is the function of the 

Development  Investment  Board  to  provide  duties  and  levy  exemptions.    There  are  the 

likes,  Mr  Chairman,  of  Taio  Shipping,  whom  I  believe  lately  has  just  purchased  a  new 

engine for the ship.  I hope that there was an environment given to him in terms of duty 

and levy, to  help  him as a local investor in  this  country.  There is  also  the likes of  Air 

</span><span>Rarotonga, when it’s time to buy a new engine for the plane.  I believe that these planes 

</span><span>service  the  Outer  Islands  in  terms  of  taking  the  goods  and  bringing  our  people  to 

Rarotonga.  We should also be looking at helping those investors in our country.  

</span></div><div><span>The point I’d like to make Mr Chairman, is that while we are looking after the outsiders, 

</span><span>sorry, potential investors to come into our country, we must not forget those investors in 

our  country  who  are  already  contributing  to  the  building  of  our  Nation.  Mr  Chairman, 

there are also the, what I call, the small-time investors who are living in our country. Who 

have made this country as a place for them to live. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your second speech Honourable Member.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, these are the people who have retired overseas but who 

decided to come and live in the Cook Islands to make this place as a home for them.  It 

may be small, Mr Chairman, but they do bring money into this country in order for them 

to  survive.  However, there is  a minor immigration problem  whereby it is  required that 

</span><span>they must leave the country.  I’m not sure whether it is every year, or every two years </span><span>- in 

order for them to come back and live here again. I know a gentleman who buy a ticket, 

gets on the plane, go to Tahiti and then come back again in order to live in this country. 

</span><span>Mr Chairman, all I can see is that we have given Air New Zealand a lump sum of money 

</span><span>as a result of the terms of our immigration criteria.  Mr Chairman, I think this is an area 

the Immigration need to look at.  I am sure this gentleman would prefer to pay whatever 

the  value  of  the  ticket  is  towards  our  economy.    Maybe  instead  of  leaving  the  country 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>165 

</span></div><div><span>we’</span><span>ll make them pay a fee and that fee is equivalent of an airline ticket out of the country.  

Mr Chairman, I am glad to hear that there is a new policy in the pipeline for that.   

</span></div><div><span>Even  though  this  is  Development  Investment  Board  but  Mr  Chairman  because  of  the 

concern  </span><span>of  what  happened  in  the  Power  at  Aitutaki,  I’d  like  to  ask  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Members not to believe what was written in the newspaper.  I am personally disappointed 

about what was written because it is not the facts.  We should try and seek the facts first.  

Find  out  the  relationship  between  CIIC  and  the  Island  Council.  Find  out  the  criteria  of 

how  the  Board  members  are  appointed.    And  find  out  what  happened  in  the  weekend.  

</span><span>And  I’m  very  disappointed  with  what  the  newspaper  has  written.    Mr  Chairm</span><span>an,  if 

Honourable Members  will agree that straight from D.I.B. we go to M.O.I.D. then we can 

do the explanation when we come to the Ministry of Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>If I may just say one fact, Mr Chairman, that the present Chairman of the Board was the 

Chairman  that  was  selected  by  the  Island  Council.  But  somehow,  because  of  personal 

problems  with  the  Mayor  he  was  fired,  from  a  drinking  session,  well  before  a  meeting 

was  done  by  the  Board.    So  Mr  Chairman  all  the  CIIC  has  done  was  to  endorse  the 

appointment of the new Board and may I tell Honourable Members that the new Board 

has been endorsed by the Island Council last Saturday in our meeting and I do not see any 

problem with that. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  sit  down  Mr  Chairman,  may  I  say  to  everybody  that  in  terms  of  devolution, 

while the Central Government is devolving to the Island Council, the Island Council must 

also  devolve  certain  responsibilities  to  the  private  sector  so  that  we  can  complete  the 

principle of devolution.  I do not agree with the idea that while the Central Government is 

devolving  to  the  Island  Council,  the  Island  Council  grabs  everything  and  become  the 

Government.  Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you.  Yes, it is time to stop, but before we go be reminded 

that there are always two sides to every story. 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED AT 2.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>The sitting is resumed.  Be seated please.  The last speaker before 

we adjourned was the Honourable Member for Arutanga, Reureu, Nikaupara.  Are there 

any further speakers?  There appear to be none.  The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS: </span><span>Thank  you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to  you, Kia Orana to 

the  Clerk  of  the  House  and  to  members  of  your  staff.    The  Deputy  Prime  Minister, 

Ministers,  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the  Deputy  Leader,  Members  of  the  House  on 

both  sides  of  the  House,  Kia  Orana  today.    As  this  is  the  first  occasion  when  I  have 

spoken  and  the  Member  for  Murienua  is  in  the  House,  I  want  to  give  him  a  special 

greeting.  I also want to say Kia Orana to the Board members of the DIB and to the Chief 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>166 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Executive Officer and his staff.  Likewise to all the people who are listening to us in this 

House today. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly Mr Chairman,  I  want  to  refer to  remarks made by the Member for Manihiki  the 

Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  I think we should not tolerate any negative attitudes at 

the airport or Port of entry to this country.  Particularly those who come in to invest in 

this  country.    But  even  then  we  should  treat  all  visitors  the  same.    Whether  you  are  in 

Immigration,  Customs  or  Agriculture.    You  are  a  Cook  Islander  and  you  should  greet 

visitors with that Kia Orana spirit.  I support the views expressed by the Deputy Leader of 

the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>With  regards  to  the  Ports  Authority,  there  is  no  politics  being  played  at  the  Ports 

Authority, certainly not by this Government.   Now that he has brought the issue before 

Parliament,  this  Government  is  concerned  that  people  here  are  going  to  lose  their  jobs.  

We  are  concerned  that  the  process  of  privatisation  of  the  Ports  Authority  is  still  in 

progress.  I am happy that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has brought the subject in 

this House so that it can be clarified.  It is our responsibility to protect the well-being of 

each and every Cook Islander wherever he or she works.  It is a responsibility for all of us 

- to make sure that the Port is protected. This is the place where we bring in everything 

from  overseas  by  ship.    We  have  Cook  Islanders  that  operate  their  own  ships,  whether 

international or local shipping.  We have Cook Islanders working on the wharf and it is 

the  responsibility  of  this  and  any  other  Government  to  protect  the  well-being  of  those 

Cook Islanders who work on the wharf or indeed, who are engaged in business activities 

in  our  Ports.    That  is  why  this  Government  has  stepped  in  to  protect  the  wellbeing  of 

Cook Islanders. 

</span></div><div><span>Now coming back to the budget Mr Chairman.  I support the budget even though I think 

</span><span>there is not enough money allocated to it.  I think we are all aware that we haven’t got a 

</span><span>limitless budget and so what has been allocated here will just have to do in the meantime. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to speak on two separate areas.  One is that of foreign investment and the second is 

local investments.  I see in the description of the budget before us on pages 31 and  32, 

having looked at these two foreign investment on the one hand and local investment on 

</span><span>the  other.    I  want  to  draw  our  attention  Mr  Chairman  to  the  section  on  page  31.    With 

</span><span>your permission I would like to read it out.   

</span></div><div><span>It states:  “Foreign investment </span><span>presents many negative factors that must be controlled in 

line  with  Government  policies  on  national  development  and  investment.    While  on  the 

one hand we must encourage foreign investment, we must on the other hand protect our 

own people against exploitati</span><span>on by those investors.”</span></div><div><span>I  am  glad  the  Development  Investment  Board  had  made  this  statement  in  this  budget.  

</span><span>There is a saying that goes something like this.  Beware of the man with a forked tongue. 

</span></div><div><span>This brings me to an example of how the unsuspecting Cook Islander can be crooked by 

con men and con investors.  Let me Mr Chairman relate a story told to me by two people.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>167 

</span></div><div><span>One investor came to our country purporting to invest large sums of money in the Cook 

Islands.    He  approached  a  Cook  Islander  with  land  and  property  valued  at  about 

$500,000.    Somehow  he  managed  to  con  this  Cook  Islander  into  entering  into  an 

agreement. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your second speaking time Mr Prime Minister.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>The Cook Islander provided the land and the Property and 

the  Investor  promised  to  invest  $1  </span><span>–</span><span>  1.5  million.    Having  made  this  agreement  the 

investor then proceeded to the bank and managed to get the bank to agree to loan the $1.5 

million  on  the  chattels  of  the  Cook  Islander.    The  loan  was  sealed,  the  agreement  was 

made  and  the  business  was  developed.    To  cut  a  long  story  short,  the  investor  sold  the 

property,  left  the  Cook  Islands  and  left  the  Cook  Islander  with  nothing.    As  far  as  the 

story  was  told  to  me  by  two  sources,  this  poor  Cook  Islander  has  lost  all  land  and 

property. 

</span></div><div><span>That  is  why  I said  I  am  glad that the  Development  Investment  Board has mentioned in 

here that foreign investment presents many negative factors and this is one of them. 

</span></div><div><span>Another  negative  factor  concerns  Work  Permits.    Now  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 

other  speakers  have  made  reference  to  Work  Permits  being  issued  by  the  Development 

Investment  Board  thus  circumventing  the  proper  channels.    The  result  is  that  many 

foreigners  or  some  foreigners  are  on  our  shores,  purporting  to  be  investors  but  with 

nothing to invest.  But they were given Work Permits and then employed by somebody 

else.  I have had a talk to our Immigration people and to the Chief Executive Officer of 

the  Development  Investment  Board.    Together,  Mr  Chairman,  they  are  preparing  a 

position paper on this  issue, on  Immigration and the Development  Investment Board to 

present to Cabinet.  Obviously there is a loophole somewhere in the laws concerning the 

Development  Investment Board and Immigration.  That has to be corrected.  It must be 

corrected  to  protect  our  people.    Now  I  want  to  repeat  that  Mr  Chairman.    It  must  be 

corrected to  prevent  our  people, to  prevent  our people from  losing their jobs.  Or other 

people  coming  in  and  taking  their  jobs.    And  to  prevent  the  smallest  opportunity  of 

exploitation of our people by outsiders. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  let  us  go  to  the  positive  side  of  investment.    I  am  fully  supportive  of  foreign 

investments.    But  the  type  of  investment  that  we  are  encouraging  now  is  small  time 

investment </span><span>–</span><span> half a milli</span><span>on dollars, $1 million, $2 million, $3 million.  That’s small time 

</span><span>investment.  We must now look for the big time investors.  The people who will invest 

$10 million, $20 million, $40 million, $100 million in this country.  Those are the people 

that we want now. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  The one that was chased away had $40 million. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  You see, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, 

the person that was  chased away belonged to that category.  He wanted to invest about 

$40  million.    I  thin</span><span>k,  Mr  Chairman,  it  is  time  that  we  entered  into  the  “Think  Big” 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>168 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>category.  Let’s have a look at the Hotel at Vaimaanga.  We need big time investors to get 

</span><span>that underway. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Your third speaking time Prime Minister please. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>Let’s have a look at other tourist development projects not 

</span><span>just for here but for the Outer Islands also.  We need to attract people with $10, $20, $30, 

$40 million.  Like the one that was chased away at the Airport. 

</span></div><div><span>Now let’s have a look at our Airport, </span><span>our Terminal.  That needs to be developed.  That 

</span><span>needs  to  be  upgraded.    It  is  going  to  cost  between  $20  to  $30  million.    If  we  don’t  do 

</span><span>anything about it our Tourism Industry will not progress and there are people sitting out 

there  with  this money.    But  when  you come here to  invest we must treat  them well, in 

addition  to  a  smile  with  a  Kia  Orana  spirit  at  the  Airport.    We  must  offer  them  other 

incentives. 

</span></div><div><span>There will be tax incentives which will be part and parcel of any investment programme.  

It has been suggested that overseas countries give citizenship to people who invest large 

sums - $40 million.  We have to have a look at this type of incentive.  People who invest 

here, big money, must be allowed to come in and out of the country freely because they 

have  invested  big  money  in  this  country.    We  are  not  able  to  give  them  Permanent 

Residency because there are laws governing the issue of Permanent Residency.  But let us 

Members  of  Parliament  look  at  the  probability  of  issuing  them  Honorary  Citizenship.  

</span><span>I’m</span><span> not  saying that we  do it.  What  I  am  saying is,  as  Members of Parliament  it is  our 

responsibility  to  look  at  every  way  of  attracting  big  time  investment  and  this  is  one  of 

them.  You see, if I were sitting outside in America and I have $20 to $40 million, and 

then I come here and I want to invest this in the Cook Islands, I want to be able to come 

in and out to make sure that investment is safe.  If the Government says to me, you have 

to follow rigid immigration regulations every time I come into the country, whether it is 

</span><span>every month, then,  I say to  you, “Forget the investment.  I’m not coming here”.  Let’s 

</span><span>look at lifting petty immigration rules as has been said from here. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me look at the local investment.  My time is nearly up.  It has been said that we have 

</span><span>an  office  here  for  encouraging  Small  Business  Development.    This  Small  Business 

</span><span>Development  I understand is  restricted to  Cook Islanders.  While  I support this, I think 

</span><span>we  also  must  “think  big”  in  this  area.    Cook  Islanders  should  be  told  to  in</span><span>vest  in  big 

business.  We have got excellent examples in this House.  The Honourable Member for 

Akao,  the  Honourable  Member  for  Titikaveka.    These  are  examples  of  Cook  Islanders 

</span><span>who “think big”.  I don’t think we should be satisfied with receiving crumbs b</span><span>ecause, Mr 

Chairman, in the future, the opportunities for investing big in the Cook Islands will come.  

The  Development  Investment  Board  should  give  first  opportunities  to  Cook  Islanders 

before  those  opportunities  are  given  to  foreign  investors.    If  partnership  is  to  be 

</span><span>encouraged to secure that foreign investment, so be it. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>169 

</span></div><div><span>But if capital can be raised locally to make sure that a business is 100% owned by Cook 

Islanders, then that should be given the first opportunity.  After all Mr Chairman, we are 

not a country the size of America.  We are not a country the size of Australia.  We are not 

even  a  country  the  size  of  New  Zealand.    We  are  a  small  Island  Nation  with  a  small 

population.  The more opportunities you give out the less you leave for our people.   To 

the  Development  Investment  Board,  I  think  they  should  remember  that.    You  can  only 

build a restricted number of motels, or hotels, or other tourism accommodations - it is not 

limitless.    You  can  only  have  a  certain  number  of  fishing  boats;  they  are  not  limitless.  

Give the Cook Islanders first opportunity Mr Chairman, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Prime Minister.  Are there any further speakers?  If not I 

will put the Question?  The Honourable Member for Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  Honourable  Members  of  this  House,  Kia  Orana.   

Members of the Coalition Government  who are  not  in  the House  - if  we walk  out  now 

there will be no quorum.  I would like our people to hear that there are only six Members 

of the Coalition Government  in  the House, we have the majority.   I would  ask  them to 

pull their socks up. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  Mr  Chairman  to  support  the  previous  speakers  and  with  the  views  of  the  Prime 

Minister that we should look after people who come to our country to invest.  There have 

been  cases  where  countries  offer  Passports  to  people  to  have  free  access  to  these 

countries.  Even though they do not live in these countries for a long. It makes it easier 

for them.    I hope that the Government  is  not  led to  believe that they  give Passports  to 

their  friends  as  they  wish.    No,  I  am  talking  about  people  wanting  to  invest  in  our 

country.  They should be given Passports to have easy access into our country. 

</span></div><div><span>While  we  are  speaking  on  our  Port  of  Entry,  let  me  tell  you  that  I  feel  embarrassed  at 

times when I go to the Airport and I see the quality of the Eis.  Many have a few flowers 

on the strands,  with  leaves, and these were given to welcome our visitors.  I think the 

Minister responsible for  this area can look  into this matter because  I do  not  believe  we 

</span><span>should give Eis  like this to  visitors.  It’s belittling our country. We have  a country  with 

</span><span>plenty of flowers and the Eis should be made properly and given in the spirit which it is 

</span><span>intended.  If there are not enough flowers in Rarotonga then order them to Atiu or Mauke 

</span><span>or  Mangaia.    The  Outer  Islands  have  flowers  that  can  be  sent  to  Rarotonga  and  this 

opportunity  to  supply  flowers  can  be  given  to  them.    I  think  this  is  a  bad  thing  for  our 

business and it is a bad reflection on our country.  These Eis with maybe about 12 flowers 

are lost amongst a lot of leaves and other things.   

</span></div><div><span>We have also heard the Honourable Member earlier on mentioning that we should not all 

plant </span><span>taro,</span><span> we should also be planting flowers.  I think tourists would appreciate if they 

were given a proper Ei instead of the ones with only a few flowers on a string.  These are 

</span><span>the reasons why  I stood up.  I want to  give my support to the Development  Investment 

</span><span>Board and I think this is a very hard working Authority who are toiling for the benefit of 

our people.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>170 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

The Minister in Charge of the Vote. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  When we started with this Vote Item I 

did not think we would be on it for too long. But I can assure you my speech will not be 

very long. There really is nothing much more to say.  They have been around for about 

three years and it is time to see whether they are doing a good job or not.  But everyone 

who  has  spoken  has  praised  this  Board  and  if  they  had  not  done  a  good  job,  then  we 

would not be discussing this Vote Item.  I have nothing new to add.  I would like to thank 

all Honourable Members for their views with regard to this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>The only thing I would like to raise is, in relation to the point of view from the Member 

for  Aitutaki,  the  Honourable  Member  Teina  Bishop.    This  is  about  the  issue  of  the 

requirement for those who wish to live here. Especially the condition  for them to  leave 

the country and then come back again.  I am not sure if this subject has been brought to 

this  House  before  but  I  am  certain  it  has  been  discussed  in  Cabinet.  It  is  best  that  this 

immigrant  pays  the  money  to  the  Immigration  Department  rather  than  paying  it  to  Air 

New Zealand, return to their country and come back again.  As I said earlier if a law has 

been brought  to  this  House along these lines,  I think  it is  a good idea.   Because  I have 

heard a lot of immigrants say they would rather leave the money here than give it to Air 

New Zealand.  That is all I have to say. The remarks from the speakers have been very 

encouraging.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Minister.   I will now put the question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $374,404 for Development Investment Board 

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We will move on to Education. 

</span></div><div><span>  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,581,176 for Education stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there are speakers?  The Minister of Education. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. J. MARURAI:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you, the Speaker of the 

House, to the Clerk of the House and the staff. To all Honourable Members in the House, 

Kia Orana and all listeners listening to us.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly Mr Chairman, I would like to clarify the role of the Ministry of Education.  There 

</span><span>is a misunderstanding that the Ministry is responsible for the educational activities in the 

outer  islands.    It  is  only  true  to  the  effect  that  the  Ministry  is  responsible  for  Policy 

Advice,  Quality  Audit,  Teacher  Development  and  Curriculum  Development.    The 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>171 

</span></div><div><span>management  of  Government  schools  in  the  outer  islands  has  been  devolved  to  the 

Ministry  of  Outer  Island  Development  during  the  reform  process.    Thus  Mr  Chairman, 

the Ministry of Education only manages the Government schools on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>I now refer to the appropriation and I will restrict the rest of my speech to the contents of 

that  appropriation.    The  total  appropriation  of  $3,524,676  has  an  increase  of  $480,523 

over the 1998-1999 appropriation.  The appropriation is shared amongst five Key Result 

Areas.  The first with a $211,755 declares to develop a National Curriculum Framework, 

a  new  Synthesis  and  Teachers  Guidelines  supported  by  Development  Advisors  and 

Resources.  In doing so and because we have aligned our curriculum to the New Zealand 

curriculum  it  is  necessary  to  modify  our  curriculum  to  suit  our  culture  and  social 

economic  conditions.    Some  of  these  involve  writing  Maori  dialect  readers  for  Primary 

schools,  writing  Teacher  Guidelines  for  Secondary  Schools  in  English,  Maths,  Science, 

Maori, Social Science and Health.  Review and Revise the Synthesis for Primary schools 

in  Art,  Music and Physical  Education.   Lastly to  identify, develop  and procure relevant 

resources to support the new syllabus.   

</span></div><div><span>The second Key Result Area with an appropriation of $411,838 proposes in the first part 

to sustain Pre-Service Teachers Training to ensure that there is sufficient future supply of 

qualified  teachers  precipitated  by  recent  resignations  and  immigration.    Secondly  to 

conduct  in  Service  Training  of  current  teachers  to  familiarise  themselves  with  the  new 

syllabus, curriculum and teaching methods.   

</span></div><div><span>The third Key Result Area with an appropriation of $467,718 deals with the expansion, 

development  and  implementation  of  quality  management  systems  in  schools  -  from  a 

programme of school audit and management guidance. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Please carry on Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. J. MARURAI:  </span><span>Most Colleges in the country have already developed their own 

quality  management  system  to  the  New  Zealand  standard.    But  emphasis  in  this 

programme is directed at the Primary and High Schools and the remaining Colleges.  The 

expected  result  is  to  show  that  guidelines  and  training  have  been  received  and  have 

</span><span>increased school management. 

</span></div><div><span>The fourth Key Area with an appropriation of $54,459 is concerned with the management 

and  Review  of  Secondary  Schools,  Qualifications  and  Research  into  a  range  of  new 

qualifications.  The present Secondary School qualifications are available in the range of 

academic  subjects  from  Cook  Island  School  Certificate  to  Bursary.    The  New  Zealand 

qualification framework enables accredited schools, that is those which have achieved the 

New Zealand qualification standard. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>172 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>To  expand  qualifications  to  non-core  areas  like  tourism  and  hospitality  and  business 

studies.    Non-accredited  High  Schools  can  expand  learning  to  include  life  skills  and 

award local qualifications. 

</span></div><div><span>The  final  Key  Area  absorbs  most  of  the  appropriation  valued  at  $2,378,906.    Basically 

this involves appraisal of teachers and the evaluation of student performance within the 

Primary  up  to  the  Secondary  School  level.    Apart  from  recording  performances,  this 

output  will  serve  to  identify  weaknesses  so  that  early  intervention  and  recovery  can  be 

detected. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I will stop here and I will accept questions, queries, and views from both 

sides of the House.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>      Thank  you  Minister.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The 

Honourable Member for Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, Kia Orana to  you in the name of Our Lord.  Kia Orana 

also to the Clerk of this House, to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, to the 

Leader  of  the  Corrective  side,  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Corrective  side  and  to  all 

Honourable Members of this House </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to the foregoing Member who now the Minister of Education.  Greetings in the 

love of our Lord. I give my full support to  you with respect especially to the Education 

Department.  I also extend a special Greetings to you Mr Speaker, the former Minister of 

Education  who  did  an  excellent  job  during  his  time.    I  believe  we  have  a  big 

responsibility in terms of catering the needs of the Ministry of Education. - I believe that 

what  I  have  to  say  will  be  an  indication  to  this  House  of  my  support  to  the  many 

programmes that the Education is embarking upon for the future.  

</span></div><div><span>We have come through several years of trial in a direction which was planned to take the 

Education  system  in  our  country  to  new  heights.  These  were  put  in  place  to  match  the 

standard of education now experienced in New Zealand.  Maybe this project is difficult to 

implement because these are new ideas introduced over here. 

</span></div><div><span>Nevertheless,  I  would  like  to  concentrate  on  the  allocations  for  the  development  of  the 

education in the Cook Islands. For Mauke, we have a budget allocation of $27,803. This 

is found in the MOID budget.  Earlier the Minister stated that the budget in the Ministry 

of Education Budget is only for Rarotonga.  My question is, is the education of the Outer 

Islands  under  MOID?    Except  for  items  like  Policy  Advice  and  Curriculum,  which  are 

determined  by  Rarotonga?  Mr  Chairman,  my  concern  is  that  we  are  vesting  the 

development of the education in the Outer islands in people who are not qualified to do 

that kind of thing. If we are giving responsibilities such as the maintenance of the schools 

</span><span>and other odd work  to  them,  that is  alright  but  we are expecting them to administer, to 

</span><span>manage the schools, including the payment of teachers, settling bills and other technical 

matters. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>173 

</span></div><div><span>The  morale  in  the  schools  nowadays  is  very  low.    We  don’t  have  the  right  people  in 

</span><span>place. The system is not right. The people in charge are not trained to do that. So I feel 

careful, consideration should be made for the way the affairs of the schools in the Outer 

Islands  are  administered.  I  have  seen  teachers  slugging  out  in  the  schools  and  they 

</span><span>sometimes come back home after five o’clock in the afternoon because they are following 

</span><span>the  new  system  that  has  been  introduced  into  the  schools  today.    Yet,  the  salary  the 

teachers are getting is very low. Some teachers who have worked over twenty years, are 

still earning $12,000 per annum.  In terms of the budget for the schools there, I know it is 

not enough. We want the standard of education of Mauke to  be raised equivalent to the 

level of the schools on Rarotonga. New teachers need to be recruited and some retirees 

still have the potential to teach.  They are very good teachers and they should be given 

the opportunity to go back to school to teach.  We want to improve the standards of our 

schools  on  Mauke  but  there  is  no  money  to  bring  qualified  teachers  back  to  school  to 

teach.   I know what  I  am  talking about  because  I  was a  former Principal  of the Mauke 

College.  We have resources sitting there.  We need to bring them back into the school 

</span><span>and utilise their services but we can’t do much about that because of insufficient funds.  

</span><span>Also  I  trust  that  the  salaries  of  the  teachers  will  be  reviewed  quickly  by  the  Island 

Councillors.    And  I  know  that  they  do  not  have  the  knowledge  to  do  this  sort  of  work 

except  for people who have been involved in  the teaching profession would understand 

what the rewards or payments should like. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on Honourable Member for your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span>  Therefore to the Honourable Minister of Education, I plead with you to 

look at this matter carefully. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I would like to look at the quality, the discipline of the students in the schools. 

In the past, I recall a big difference in the attitudes, the quality and the discipline of the 

children  then  as  opposed  to  the  children  of  today.  Children  nowadays  have  lost  the 

respect  for  authorities,  for  teachers  in  school,  even  in  the  community  at  large.  Today, 

children are smoking and drinking and these are habits unheard of in our days. What are 

we going to do? 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  our  responsibility,  the  parents  to  ensure  that  these  children  at  school  attain  the 

</span><span>highest quality of discipline at school and in our homes.  But they must be disciplined in 

the  homes  first.      At  the  rate  they  are  heading  we  the  parents  will  encounter  some  real 

drastic consequences. I believe that it is important that somebody should be appointed to 

discipline our children in the schools. Likewise in the community, such as a Minister of a 

Denomination.  

</span></div><div><span>When I was in New Zealand recently, I went to some of the schools and they have started 

a  programme  like  this.  I  want  to  know  if  there  is  an  Act  in  Parliament  that  has  been 

</span><span>created  by  Parliament  that  if  a  parent  apply  corporal  punishments  to  their  child,  or  a 

</span><span>teacher hits a child at school, they will be prosecuted.  I want to know if there is such an 

Act.  There  are  certain  things  that  children  do,  that  they  need  to  be  punished  in  that 

manner.  There are some children you only have to speak to and they will obey you.  The 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>174 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>word  of  God  says:    “The  one  God  chastises,  He  also  loves”.    We  have  all  experienced 

</span><span>being disciplined by our parents, and we cannot deny that fact. May be the total ban on 

corporal  punishments  introduced  into  our  society  should  be  confined  to  those  countries 

who propagated it.  They have a different culture.   

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to propose the establishment of a Technical School in the future when 

the financial situation of our country improves.  I am considering the fact that our system 

of education is more in theory rather than practical education. There are Members among 

us today who do not have any academic qualifications but they are qualified people who 

work with their hands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Your  third  and  final  speaking  time  Honourable  Member.    Please 

carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span>  I would like to encourage Government today to consider these matters as 

we enter into the new Millennium.  I am talking about agriculture and planting, we need 

to  put  our  young  people  into  these  activities  for  the  benefit  of  our  country.    So  if  this 

happens  we  do  not  need  to  send  our  students  overseas  to  study.    They  can  be  trained 

locally. 

</span></div><div><span>My last concern is our language in our schools, the Maori Language as we have discussed 

for the Tauranga Vananga.  In support of previous speakers, I would like to encourage the 

use of our Maori Language in schools.  Some of the schools teach Maori up to Grade 3, 

then English is gradually introduced.  Today the moment the child enters Pre-School the 

learning of English starts.  This has been discovered to being a disadvantage, especially 

when they graduate to senior classes.  I believe that if they are trained properly in their 

mother tongue, they will have very little difficulties when they learn a second language. I 

have seen this happen in a trial  in  Mauke.  The  children who were well versed in  their 

mother tongue found it much more at ease learning a second language. I trust that there 

are  some  teachers  among  us  in  this  House  who  understand  what  I  am  talking  about.    I 

also know that parents are speaking English to their children at home. Unfortunately they 

speak very broken English with poor pronunciations and tenses. 

</span></div><div><span>So it is  becoming a difficult task for teachers to  teach the  correct  English.   If we teach 

</span><span>them properly at home they will speak properly at school. 

</span></div><div><span>The last class  I taught  before  I retired was  an  Upper Fifth.   I found that  because of the 

poor quality in the English they adopted at home, the tenses in their written compositions 

were  very  poor.  This  is  a  very  important  area  Mr  Minister.    We  need  to  have  a  proper 

linguistic programme in place. I think someone mentioned yesterday about including our 

traditions  and  customs  into  the  syllabus.    I  think  there  is  not  enough  time  given  to 

teachers to teach our traditions such as weaving, carving and the like.  I believe our local 

</span><span>history should be taught in the schools.  Our teachers are able to teach the history of other 

</span><span>countries but we are still not able to teach the history of Rarotonga, Mauke, Atiu and the 

other islands in the group.  We should know first our own identities, our origin and how 

we developed to be the people we are.

</span></div><div><span>I have come to the  end of my speech this afternoon Mr Chairman.  The Budget  for the 

Ministry  of  Education  is  already  s</span><span>et  for  our  approval.    So  what’s  the  use  of  continuing 

with this debate? Let’s stop the debate and endorse it.</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    The  Honourable  Member  for 

Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  VAEVAEPARE:  </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  you  Mr  Chairman  and  to  the  staff  of  our 

Parliament.    Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  our  Parliament  today.    To  the 

Prime Minister and the  Deputy Prime Minister.   A happy birthday to  the  Leader of the 

Opposition  and  Kia  Orana  to  the  Deputy  Leader  and  to  Honourable  Members  of  the 

Opposition.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to give my support to the allocation for the Ministry of Education.  We see 

that  it  is  nearly  half  a  million  dollars  over  the  last  appropriated  sum.    I  would  like  to 

congratulate  the  Minister  of  Education  the  Honourable  Jim  Marurai.    I  recall  when  we 

were both in Form Five.  We had to share the same desk.  I would like to ask him to move 

closer to me before the results of the by election is released.  Even if he moves to this side 

he will still be the Minister of Education.   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  glad  to  see  the  Budget  allocation  here  and  I  agree  with  what  the  Honourable 

Member  for  Mauke  said.  I  appreciate  the  fact  that  we  have  increased  this  budget  by 

nearly $500,000 which I believe will be used to increase the salaries of the teachers.  We 

are all aware that the biggest problem we have had with teachers in the past is because of 

the reduction in  their pay.  This  is  why  I am  glad that this extra amount is  going to  be 

used  to  pay  for  the  increases  in  their  salaries.    If  we  were  to  compare  what  is  in  this 

allocation for this Ministry with other Ministries of Government, we must keep in mind 

that, like Health, Education is  an important  element  in  the development of our country.  

The principle still applies to someone who is not paid well for a task you expect him to 

do.  The task will not be done properly. So if we are to improve the standard of education 

in any way we need first to improve the pay for our teachers.  The Honourable Member 

Mapu  Taia  mentioned  earlier  the  morale  of  the  teachers.    This  is  the  main  reason  the 

morale is not good because the money that they are being paid is too low. As I was saying 

</span><span>earlier  with  regard  to  the  salary  scale  I  would  also  like  to  say  there  is  still  the  political 

</span><span>element in the salary scale.  If  you are a teacher  from the Government side you will be 

looked  after  first.    With  regard  to  the  issue  of  promotion  of  teachers  it  should  be  done 

properly. If it is based on merits then we will see that our teachers will perform better.  I 

am pleased to see there is an allocation to improve the teaching of our future teachers.  I 

think we are all aware that there are a lot of teachers who have taken early retirement and 

a  lot  have  left  the  country.    So  I  need  to  stress  the  importance  of  teacher  training.    I 

suspect that the reason why the Teachers Training College was re-opened was due to the 

shortage of Teachers in the schools. Another aspect is the School Committees. They are 

</span><span>supporting  the  Government  in  running  the  schools.    There  are  some  instances  where 

</span><span>Government  is  not  able  to  provide services to  the schools and this is  where the parents 

and committees come in to help. One area that surprises me is that there is no mention of 

Private Schools such as the Catholic or the Seventh Day Adventist in this appropriation.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>176 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>We are all aware that the St Joseph Primary School and Nukutere College do not restrict 

the  entries  to  Catholic  children  only.    There  are  children  from  right  across  our 

community. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your second speech Honourable Member.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. VAEVAEPARE:</span><span> Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister for an allocation to 

support these Private Schools. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also  like to  thank all the Catholic Churches in  the Cook  Islands because in  the 

past all the parishes in the Cook Islands have put money aside to help these schools. The 

financial support from the Ministry has never been sufficient.  That is why every Sunday 

in  every  parish throughout  the Cook  Islands there is a donation asked of the Church to 

support  these  schools  because  if  this  support  is  not  made  available,  then  these  schools 

</span><span>can’t operate. I would like to ask the Honourable Minister to look into this very </span><span>carefully 

</span><span>because we don’t have</span><span> just Catholic children going to these schools.  Children from other 

denominations are also attending. 

</span></div><div><span>I  move  on  now  to  the  transport  for  our  school  children.    I  see  some  children,  Mr 

Chairman, not going to school because they cannot afford the bus fares, especially in the 

Primary schools.  This is a hard thing for people who have no way of earning a living.  If 

there is no money for the bus fare, then that child does not go to school for that day.  We 

are  all  aware  that  in  the  last  couple  of  years  during  the  period  of  transition,  a  lot  of 

parents lost their sources of income. 

</span></div><div><span>I see this happening in our village Mr Chairman.  In our village there is a young man who 

is  an  expert  on  computers  but  he  is  finding  it  very  hard  to  send  his  children  to  school 

</span><span>because he doesn’t have a job.  So I would like to ask the Minister to look into that area 

</span><span>and to provide free transports for the children. 

</span></div><div><span>I  feel  sorry  for  the  Outer  Islands.  I  support  the  views  of  the  Honourable  Member  from 

Mauke.    It  may  be  the  same  for  other  islands  but  maybe  the  allocation  for  Mauke  is  a 

little bit more than the allocation for Mangaia.  I would like to ask the Minister to look 

</span><span>into that.  The figures in this Appropriation Bill look really good but I don’t know about 

</span><span>the  actual  figures.  I  would  like  to  ask  about  the  loan  that  was  granted  by  the  ADB  to 

renovate the schools in the Cook Islands.  They have never been able to carry out those 

</span><span>repairs to the schools. I think this money is somewhere.  I’m not too sure where.  If only 

</span><span>this money was given to provide free buses for the kids it would be so much better. 

</span></div><div><span>Our roof of our Pre-School in Matavera is rotten and  I went to see Eric about it but he 

told me that there is no money to help.  Maybe next week I will go and see my friend, the 

Minister to help us. Yet the carpenter for the Education is from the village of Matavera. If 

</span><span>only  this  money  from  ADB  was  invested  there,  a  few  thousands  of  dollars  would 

</span><span>complete the job.  We only need about $3,000. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>177 

</span></div><div><span>I hope that the money that is being appropriated in here is spent properly because I can 

see that the spirit behind the whole appropriation is a good one.  Therefore, Mr Minister, I 

support this appropriation and hope that you will take heed of our requests.  

Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  It is time to stop.  Oh, two more 

</span><span>minutes.  I call on a next speaker.  You’ve </span><span>got two minutes.  I will put the question. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Do you wish to speak Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Yes, Mr Chairman.  I want to speak about the previous Minister of 

Education.
