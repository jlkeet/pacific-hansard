<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $374,404 for Development Investment Board  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The last speaker yesterday was the former Prime Minister but he is not in the House so I 

call for the next speaker.  The Honourable Member for Manihiki, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to you and also to the Clerk 

and  all  the  staff  of  Parliament.  Greetings  also  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime 

Minister  and  all  Cabinet  Ministers.    Congratulations  to  the  Honourable  Member  Dr 

</span><span>Terepai  Maoate  who  celebrated  his  65</span><span>th</span><span>  birthday  yesterday.    Through  you  Mr  Speaker 

</span><span>and on behalf of all the Members I would like to extend to  you a happy birthday.  The  

Minister of Finance is saying that this is the right age for retirement, but I say, no, this is 

the age  when he is mature enough to take control of this country.  A special Kia Orana to 

all our people who are listening this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman  I  stand  in  support  of  the  appropriation  given  to  the  Development 

Investment  Board Corporation.  As  I see it, the Development  Investment Board was  an 

innovation that has been created to make it easier for investors to invest in our country.  If 

</span><span>I  can  recall  correctly  it  was  set  up  in  1996  and  before  that  the  process  of  starting  a 

</span><span>business in this country was very bizarre and extremely contorted.  As the former Prime 

Minister  yesterday  stated,  it  was  the  prerogative  of  Cabinet  to  approve  any  overseas 

investor  in  this  country.    Now  this  power  has  been  devolved  to  the  Development 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>156 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Investment  Board to decide who can invest in our country and who cannot. Previously, 

you  could  not  help  thinking  that  there  were  some  political  overtones.    If  you  are  a 

political favourite you can invest in the country.  Now we have removed that obstacle to 

invest  in  the  country.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  DIB  to  asses  the  people  who  are 

wishing to invest in our country, to conduct due diligent investigations into the history of  

those people who want  to  set  up  businesses in  our country.  Through the DIB too,  the 

likely investors are assured of their investment, instead of having to appease Ministers of 

the Crown for their investment,  the local bodies or appeasing the church.  It is a one-stop 

shop  before  you  can  start  a  business  in  the  Cook  Islands.    I  would  congratulate  the 

members  of  this  Board  on  the  DIB,    especially  the  workers  in  the  DIB  and  the  Chief 

Executive Officer Mr Rohan Ellis.   

</span></div><div><span>This  is  a  very  young  man  who  is  very  capable,  well  educated,  confident  in  what  he  is 

doing.   I remember when he was first appointed as the Chief Executive of DIB.  There 

was some criticisms directed at this young man because perhaps he was young at the time 

he  was  appointed  or  perhaps  his  parents  were  on  the  wrong  side  of  a  political  party.  

What he has shown the country is that he is well worth the appointment.  He is worth his 

weight in gold to the position he was given.  His performance as previously stated by the 

Honourable  Members  of  the  House  has  been  outstanding  and  has  made  the  Japanese 

Government  send  a  special  delegation  to  the  Cook  Islands  to  investigate  further 

investments in this country.  There were also letters of commendation, high regards for 

this  young  man  in  what  he  is  doing.    If  I  am  correct,  Mr  Chairman,  the  Development 

Investment  Board  has  brought  in  over  $41  million  worth  of  investment  in  this  country.  

So I see that the Development Investment Board is worth every penny it is allocated in 

this budget. What is more important Mr Chairman, is it has removed political interference 

to investors to this country or political favourtism to investors who wish to invest in the 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>I  certainly  hope,  the  present  Government,  the  incumbent  Government  will  not  interfere 

with  any  possible  investors  to  this  country  because  already  Mr  Chairman,  they  are 

sacking Board members left, right and center.  Such as the Power Board in Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  This is your second speech coming up Honourable Member.  Please 

</span><span>continue. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank you.  These are the kinds of political interference that will 

deter our people from pushing on and developing our country.  As politicians we are not 

experts or specialists in investments.  Let experts deal with it and we just approve their 

investments. 

</span></div><div><span>Quite recently too, Mr Chairman, there was interference with the wharf being privatised 

and ten people were to be sent home because some people want to privatise our Harbour 

</span><span>Board.  I ask the question, Mr Chairman, haven’t we sacked enough people yet?  Or are 

</span><span>we just sacking people who support the DAP and replacing them with NAP and the CIP 

supporters? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>157 

</span></div><div><span>Let  us  look  first  at  the  qualifications  of  the  people  we  employ  before  we  start  sacking 

them due to their political inclination.  This country will be in turmoil if we do that kind 

of  thing.    Look  at  the  Chief  Executive  of  the  Development  Investment  Board.    We 

criticised him and when we gave him a chance to prove himself, he  did that beyond our 

expectations.  I can only hope, Mr Chairman, that the present Cabinet, the Government 

will  support  the  Development  Investment  Board  in  its  functions  because  without  the 

investors  coming  into  our  country,  without  new  money  injected  into  our  economy,  our 

economy will be stagnant. And we will probably go back to the early depressive days we 

experienced in the mid nineties. 

</span></div><div><span>Right now we need to support our Development Investment Board because there are good 

signs that the economy is gradually moving upward. 

</span></div><div><span>Both  sides  of  this  House  should  support  anything  that  will  help  our  economy  grow.  

Develop our nation into a more wealthier country than we have experienced in the past. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I had the privilege of meeting a gentleman, a QC from Sydney, who has 

been visiting our shores for the past 18 years and he has decided to invest in this country.  

Through  the  work  of  the  Development  Investment  Board  that  he  is  convinced  that  the 

Cook  Islands  is  a  good  place  to  invest  money.    Sadly,  Mr  Chairman,  he  was  not 

welcomed  when  he  came  to  invest  in  this  country.    He  was  not  welcomed  when  he 

arrived  at  the  Airport.    I  see  the  lack  of  co-ordination  on  the  part  of  what  the 

Development  Investment  Board  are  doing  and  what  our  Immigration  Department  is 

doing.  On the one hand we are saying welcome to the Cooks and bring your money here.  

</span><span>Spend it here, while on the other hand we are saying no, we don’t want you.  You ar</span><span>e a 

</span><span>foreigner.  We don’t want  you.  So I will ask Government, Members of the Cabinet, to 

</span><span>please  co-ordinate  the  functions  of  the  Government  bodies  to  attract  investors  in  our 

country.  Let us be consistent in what we want.  If we want investors in this country then 

we should welcome them to this country  through our Immigration. 

</span></div><div><span>Luckily though, Mr Chairman, the man being a QC understands the laws of each nation 

and has respect for our laws.  He and his wife wanted to get back on the plane and fly out 

of this country together with all the money which they wanted to invest here.  In spite of 

</span><span>what we invest in the Development Investment Board to attract more investors on the one 

</span><span>hand, it takes one small Immigration Clerk at the airport to chase them away. 

</span></div><div><span>So I ask, Mr Chairman, to this House,  where is the consistency in attracting visitors?  Do 

we have a clear mandate whether we want investors or not?  If we do want investors then 

let us welcome them through our airport, our Port of entry. 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  don’t  have  an</span><span>y  problem  at  all  with  the  Development  Investment  Board  and  I  can 

only  commend  what  they  are  doing.    I  also  see  the  Development  Investment  Board 

</span><span>working with our Tourist Authority to promote this country overseas. I am aware of the 

</span><span>achievement  they  have  made  in  the  short  time  they  have  been  formally  formed  as  a 

statutory  body.    Not  only  did  they  help  with  the  farmers  in  the  pearl  industry,  but  also 

those in agriculture.  The Hon. Tupou Faireka mentioned yesterday his gratitude towards 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>158 

</span></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the Development Investment Board for the exemptions given to those farmers who need 

machinery and equipment to carry out their work. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on Honourable Member for your third speech. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  I know that they have done some promotions in Japan and quite 

recently  across  Australia.    They  have  exposed  a  lot  of  our  products  to  possible  buyers 

overseas.    Through  the  help  of  the  Development  Investment  Board  a  lot  of  our 

manufacturers  and  our  producers  have  been  exposed to  overseas markets  and now they 

are aware of what we can produce here.  A classic example was mentioned earlier in this 

House regarding the  </span><span>Nono</span><span>  juice, the miranda  citrofolla.   Likewise, we can do that with 

other products produced here.   I can only hope that they will get the support from  both 

sides of this House to carry on with what they are doing. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  ask  the  Prime  Minister  of  this  country  to  look  into  this  matter  regarding  our 

investors  and  to  make  them  welcome  when  they  come  into  our  country.    After  all,  Mr 

Chairman, the buck stops  at  his  desk.  He has the final  say.   Likewise, to  look  into the 

Power Board of Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>What happened to the devolution process that we have been preaching in this Parliament?  

We  are  doing  totally  the  reverse  of  what  we  have  been  saying.    Devolve  power  to  the 

Outer  Islands, the local  bodies.  Now we are  going around and taking that  power away 

from  them  again.    If  we  want  to  devolve  the  powers  to  the  Outer  Islands  to  the  Local 

Government  and  local  bodies,  then  let  us  do  it  honestly  and  without  interference.  

Likewise, the powers we have given the Development Investment Board.  Thank you Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

The Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  To you Mr Chairman, to all Honourable 

Members  of  this  House.    The  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Members  on  the 

Government  side  and to  the  Leader of the Opposition  and all the Opposition  Members.  

</span><span>Happy  Birthday  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    Congratulations.    And  for  the  short 

</span><span>duration of time that he is not in the House but in Pukapuka, Papa Inatio Akaruru, until 

you return my friend.  Kia Orana.  To all of our people listening out there, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  stand  in  full  support  of  this  Vote  Allocation  for  the  Development 

Investment  Board.    Mr  Chairman,  these  are  very  interesting  times.    With  the  right 

approach this country is ready to take off on a major economic flight.  The most critical 

and  important  ingredient  is  political  stability.    Each  Member  of  this  House  has  a 

fundamental responsibility to ensure that there is political stability regardless of whether 

</span><span>he or she is in Government or the Opposition.  Whatever has been happening in the recent 

</span><span>past  each  one  of  us  has  a  responsibility  to  place  the  interests  of  this  country  above 

everything else.  With political stability the investors will feel safe coming in with their 

money, knowing that it will be safe to invest here.  That they can trust the Government 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>159 

</span></div><div><span>and  they  can  trust  the  people  of  this  country  and  repatriate  their  money  whenever  they 

wish.  Mr Chairman the climate is right to introduce more incentives, more incentives to 

make  people  want  to  invest  here.    It  is  time  to  cut  the  taxation  for  investment,  in  fact 

remove it completely.  I think what is needed is for major incentives to say to investors 

that anyone bringing in half a million dollars upwards should be entitled to invest in our 

country and  pays no tax up to 10 years.  You will be surprised, Mr Chairman, how many 

multi-millionaires  are  wanting  to  do  this.    All  they  want  is  for  us  to  prompt  them  and 

encourage them.  So I would like to serve notice to this House that this will form part of a 

number  of  major  incentives  that  this  Government  will  bring  back  to  this  House  by  this 

December.   

</span></div><div><span>I  totally  concur  with  the  Honourable  Member  for  Manihiki,  Dr  Woonton,  about  the 

shabby treatment of people at the airport by Immigration Officers.  The simple rule, Mr 

Chairman,  is  that  these  people  should  treat  people  as  they  would  like  to  be  treated 

themselves  -  </span><span>with  decency  and  politeness.    Maybe  part  of  the  Government’s  new 

</span><span>incentives, and I serve notice on the Prime Minister as Minister of Immigration, that we 

should  set  up  a  red-carpet  lane  with  brass  fences  and  glittering  desks  to  welcome 

investors in that lane.  Honestly, if we are forewarned about these people I am quite sure 

as Deputy Prime Minister I will be happy to go to the airport to meet these people.  They 

ought  to  be  made  to  feel  welcome.    The  shabby  treatment  by  public  servants  can  be 

frustrating  and  ruin  the  chances  of  investors  wanting  to  help  our  people.    So  there  is  a 

clear  warning  to  public  servants  to  conduct  themselves  professionally,  especially  those 

people working at the  airport, the immigration and customs officers.  Their rudeness can 

reflect upon all of us.  And of course we as a Government and as a country should show 

our appreciation for the good work of these  young men and women when they perform 

their duties in a professional way.  We should applaud them as well.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  am  very  excited  with  the  popularity,  with  the  explosion  of  the  </span><span>Nono</span><span>

industry.    As  you  know  the  New  Alliance  Party  vigorously  campaigned  for  the  </span><span>Nono</span><span>

growers during the election campaign. It is great  to see the industry appear to be on  a 

massi</span><span>ve take off, to see the interest that’s been generated in our community at the present 

</span><span>time. In our community we see the export markets opening up and this is  really exciting.  

Mr  Chairman  we  have  to  compliment  the  father  of  the  </span><span>Nono</span><span>  industry,  Danny  Mataroa, 

</span><span>and  his  offsider,  Papa  Ta  Tukaroa,  as  the  champions  of  this  industry.    These  two 

</span><span>gentlemen  should  be  recognised  by  the  Nation  as  creative  and  innovative.    They  are 

pushing this industry and is about to take off. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your second speech Deputy Prime Minister.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you very much.  And there is also the great development of 

the black pearl industry for the Northern Group islands. On my last visit to Manihiki, in 

my observation, there are a number of millionaires who are pearl farmers on that island.  

</span><span>There are a lot of wealthy people there and I believe the wealth is spreading to the island 

</span><span>of  Tongareva  and  it  is  good  to  see  prosperity  there.  They  ought  to  be  encouraged  to  a 

maximum.
