</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I have a lot of views on the Ministry of Education but let me just say I bet 

you that everybody is  going to  speak on this Vote  Item because it is  one of those Vote 

Items that attracts the attention and invites votes during an election.  This is a good Vote 

Item to  discuss because  there are a lot of parents out  there listening in  to  us discussing 

this and they want to know what we are going to do for our children.
