<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $514,406 for Culture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member for Nikao Panama was the last Member speaking.  Do you 

wish to continue with your second speech?  Meitaki.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Greetings to you Mr Speaker, to the Clerk and to all the staff 

members.  To the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, greetings to you all.  

Greetings  to  the  leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the  Deputy  Leader  and  all  the 

Honourable Members in the House.  Greetings also to our people who are listening in 

this afternoon.  A word of greeting to those who are grieving over the loss of  their 

loved ones,  may God comfort you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, yesterday I was talking about those carvers who are making and selling 

their crafts.  I was speaking on this matter yesterday so I would like to encourage all 

our womenfolk in  the country to  go back to  the things that we used to  do including 

patchwork.  We are used to these kinds of activities. The only ladies I see carrying out 

this work nowadays are in Arorangi and Matavera.  Maybe I should start this kind of 

project  in  my  constituency  Nikao.  There  are  a  lot  of  women  who  are  hand-sewing 

</span><span>tivaevae</span><span> while others use the sewing machine.  I know we used to sew another type of  

</span><span>tivaevae </span><span> called </span><span>taorei. </span><span> When we went to campaign in Aitutaki the women folk who 

</span><span>used to look after the Women’s affairs in Aitutaki requested me to see their art work. I 

</span><span>discovered that  the women of Aitutaki  were trying to  revive old skills  possessed by 

</span><span>women in the past. They told me that they are trying to teach the young girls how to 

</span><span>do  patchwork  as  was  done  in  the  olden  days  rather  than  concentrating  on  sewing 

machines. I will encourage the Ministry of Culture to see how we could get women to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>135 

</span></div><div><span>go back into sewing which is part of our way of life.  These are the things which will 

help to enrich our culture and traditions.  I would like these things to be revived.  

</span></div><div><span>Another  issue  that  I  would  like  to  encourage  our  people  is  planting  crops  following 

the phases of the moon. I have heard a few people say that they have planted kumara 

and  sweet  potato  but  the  harvest  was  very  poor.    Let  me  assure  these  growers  that 

there is still a lot  to be gained from the customs of our forefathers. They have trialed 

and followed the phases of the moon and it worked. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman that is all I have to say.  Perhaps there are other Members who wish to 

speak on this subject.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Member for Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  TAIO:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Greetings.  

Greetings also to the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader. I do not have 

</span><span>much to say.  I just rise to give my support to the Vote Item for the Culture Division.  

</span><span>We  all realise that this is one of those important areas in our lives. 

</span></div><div><span>We  are  lucky  nowadays  that  there  is  a  written  record  of  our  history  from  1906  but 

there are others who have records prior to 1906.  Maybe some people lost theirs due to 

the big fire to the old administration building.  That was most unfortunate.  So I wish 

to  encourage  the  Minister  responsible  to  take  good  care  of  all  the  archaic  and  old 

documents  recording  our  history.    Some  still  need  to  be  compiled  by  his  staff 

members.    We  all  know  the  fire  which  gutted  the  old  building  in  Avarua.  Now,  we 

should be more prepared.  A proper chamber or a vault will be required to store these 

national  treasures  and  protect  them  from  any  fire.  There  are  all  kinds  of  priceless 

documents  here  and  in  debating  the  appropriation  for  this  Ministry,  I  want  to  make 

sure that i</span><span>f a fire erupts the information we are talking about will be safe. I don’t want 

</span><span>to be part of that problem.  So we must ensure the protection of these documents. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  LDS  Mission  because  they  have  records,  even  tapes, 

containing  information  as  far  back  as  1906.    These  were  micro-filmed  and  some 

people are lucky because the information that was collected protected their interests.  

</span><span>If  it  wasn’t  for  those  existing  documents  they  could  have  lost  their  lands.    We  the 

</span><span>Members of Parliament should look at how we can utilise this appropriation to receive 

the best value </span><span>–</span><span> most especially to ensure that the documents that we are talking about 

are preserved for the next 100 years or more.  If we are not prepared to do this then 

we  are  only  wasting  our  time.    This  budget  will  also  affect  the  people  of  the  Outer 

Islands. They may have their own archival storage for documents on the history, the 

developments  and  the  work  on  their  respective  islands.  I  support  them.  The  same  

emphasis  should also  be placed on the </span><span>Marae</span><span> -   our traditional meeting  places.  Mr 

Chairman, some people  are using this as a rubbish dump.  There are tourists coming 

into  our  country  who  would  love  to  see  these  sites.  I  would  like  to  encourage  the 

</span><span>Minister  responsible  to  put  signs  on  these  areas  to  show  visitors  that  these  are  land 

</span><span>marks of the history of these islands.  Sign used to mark these places but because of 

the ruthlessness or the irresponsible attitude of our young people they destroyed this.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>136 

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>So I would like the Minister to bear with me.  I do know that it will cost money but 

there is some importance in having to erect some signs around these areas. 

</span></div><div><span>This is all that I have to say Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member for Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  M.  TAIA:</span><span>    First  of  all,  greetings  to  you  the  peacekeeper  and    the  Clerk.  

Greetings  to  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition  and  to  your  Deputy  Leader,  and  to  all  the  Honourable  Members  in 

Parliament this afternoon.  Greetings to you all in the name  of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to take this opportunity to greet our people who are listening 

in  to  our debate this  afternoon because  I believe  this is  an important  vote item.   To 

support my views, before I speak on this matter, I would like to make this chant: 

</span></div><div><span>“Praise God to  those who dwelleth  on high, praise be to  those who dwelleth  below.  

</span><span>Let us give praise to the heavens above, that the foundation of Avaiki may stand tall 

an</span><span>d let the southern breeze bless them all”.</span></div>
