<div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Please be seated Honourable Members.  This sitting is resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Member  for  Amuri,  do  you  wish  to  continue  with  your  speech?  

Please continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P. TEITI:   </span><span>Before  we went for  a break,  I  was talking about  the importance of 

submitting to the Minister things we want done for our constituency.  I  will not ask 

the Minister because he can hear me. The areas the tourists are interested to visit in 

Aitutaki are the </span><span>marae</span><span> and other tour spots.  But the </span><span>marae</span><span> we are talking about are 

covered  by  the  bush.  What  we  are  interested  in  are  tourist  attractions.    Today    the 

tourists are only cycling around the island without checking out these tour highlights.  

I think Government should aim to develop Aitutaki because nowadays we have three 

flights  to  Aitutaki.    Often  those  flights  will  be  full  of  tourists.    The  Minister  can 

</span><span>understand  me.    And  he  knows  what  is  required  for  Aitutaki.    We  are    winning  the 

</span><span>tourist dollar and therefore, there is a need to improve these tourist attractions. 

</span></div><div><span>The </span><span>marae</span><span>  need to be restored. My colleague Kete was referring to the statues with 

three legs. In saying that, I was trying to figure out where the third leg is.  I used to go 

around  the  island  of  Rarotonga  three  or  four  times  a  week  but  I  have  not  seen  any 

statues with three legs.  Sure there were a couple of people from my home island who 

came to Rarotonga and made untoward remarks about these two legged statues.  They  

were concerned  mainly about this tall statue which I think we all know.  If there is 

anybody who has seen this statue with three legs,  it is not  a statue but a ghost.  To 

me,  the  statue  was  placed  there  to  decorate  or  to  draw  attention.  Not  to  worship.  

Today,  our  people  are  making    huge  handcrafts  like    drums  for  instance    to  earn  

money.  When we talk about culture, in Maori it is Taporoporo.  It is like a English 

word.  I  do  not  understand  the  meaning  of  the  word  taporoporo.  I  agree  with  the 

Honourable  Member  from  Mauke  when  he  said  that  we  should  establish  a  Maori 

language to enable all of us to understand what we are talking about.  

</span></div><div><span>We have lost some of our traditions and culture.  For example, eating our staple food. 

Today when we have breakfast we eat bread, when we have lunch we eat bread and 

when we have dinner we eat bread.  We have bread in all our meals. Our traditional 

foods    our  forefathers    depended  upon  for  their  livelihoods  are  now  disappearing.   

That  is  the  result  of  having  to  depend  on  imported  foodstuff.  Today  people  are 

complaining  about  high  blood  pressure,  hypertension  and  so  on. When  these  people 

with  high blood pressure, hypertension  and diabetes visit  the doctor, the  doctor will 

refer them to our staple food. It is easy for the Doctors to associate certain ailments to 

the  types  of  food  we  eat.  So  if  you  want  to  get  infected  by  high  blood  pressure, 

hypertension and so on keep on eating imported food but if you want to stay healthy 

eat our local staple  food.    

</span></div><div><span>There is a very important  facility which has practically disappeared from our homes 

and that is the earth oven.  I think I am the only one who uses the earth oven while 

you  Honourable Members depend on the electric oven.  The Leader of the Opposition 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>144 

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>is asking me how I bake my bread and whether I use firewood.  No. I use diesel.  If 

</span><span>only    he  had  waited  for  me  to  finish  my  speech,  then  I  wouldn’t  make  a  derisive 

</span><span>comment like that. I am following the policies of the Conservation not to damage the 

</span><span>trees or the vegetation. So I don’t use firewood, I would rather use  diesel to bake my 

</span><span>bread  otherwise, I will deplete the island of trees.   

</span></div><div><span>Conservation is a big issue today.  There are other key issues affecting our society but 

allow  me  to  divert  our  attention  back  to  the  preservation  of  our    customs  and 

traditions.    As  I  was  saying,  many  of  us  are  using    electric  oven  to  cook.  There  is 

nothing  wrong  with  that  but  in  concentrating  on  these  imports,  we  tend  to  do  away 

with our traditional ways of cooking. 

</span></div><div><span>And  another  thing  that  I  wish  to  highlight  is  the  Maori  language.  There  are  certain 

periods during the course of the year when they speak Maori in the schools. There are 

two Maori languages in New Zealand.  One is the New Zealand Maori and the other 

one is Cook Islands Maori and they are interested in recruiting Cook Islands trained 

teachers so that they can teach our Cook Islands language in schools.  I trust that our 

schools are doing the same thing.  You see Mr Chairman,  our children are born into a 

</span><span>society  with    English  as  our  second  language.    When  they  grow  up  and  you  talk  to 

</span><span>them in Maori they couldn’t even understand what you are saying.  </span></div><div><span>On a particular day, my brother and I went for a drive. We came to a spot where we 

</span><span>couldn’t </span><span>turn the car around, so  we got out to move the boulders. My brother stated 

that the boulder could possibly be part of a </span><span>marae. </span><span>I replied that I was not interested to 

know  whether  that  was  a  </span><span>marae</span><span>  or  not.    All  I  wanted  was  to  free  the  vehicle.    My 

brother  was  reluctant  in  removing  the  stones.    Maybe  he  thought  that  we  would  be 

haunted.    You  see  Mr  Chairman,  at  one  time  a  bulldozer  was  clearing  the  road  in 

Aitutaki  when  they  came  across  a  particular  area.    The  bulldozer  tried  to  push  the 

boulders but it coul</span><span>dn’t.  That was a part of a </span><span>marae</span><span>.  You know, the  bulldozer just 

stopped  and  never  moved  again.    The  owners  of  the  </span><span>marae</span><span>  came  and  made    some 

remarks about the incident. He was actually talking to his ancestors. After a while the 

bulldozer fired up again.  You see, the </span><span>mana</span><span> of the </span><span>marae</span><span> still exist. But we must not 

allow such forces to control our lives.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    You  have  concluded  your  second  speaking  time  and  into  your 

last one.  Carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P. TEITI:</span><span>   There are   </span><span>marae</span><span>  in  Aitutaki  which still  haunt  us because  people 

still believed in them.  There are some which do not posses any  </span><span>mana</span><span>.   Sometimes 

ago, we were touring and we found coconut husks on a </span><span>marae</span><span>, meaning the </span><span>mana</span><span> of 

the  </span><span>marae  </span><span>  had  died  and  disappeared  to  allow  people  to  walk  there  and  collect 

coconuts. I would like to request the Minister to order his workers  in Aitutaki to clear 

all the </span><span>marae</span><span> on the island of Aitutaki. The tourists visit these areas every day.  We 

need to clear these places.  So that these places will become a highlight in their trips 

and that it will become a story for them to tell when they return home.  Mangaia and 

Mitiaro are the other islands with a lot of historical tour spots. As a local I was really 

</span><span>excited to see these places. No doubt the tourists will also be interested. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Minister  of  Finance  is  saying  that  you  are  not  allowed  to  visit  any  place  in 

Mangaia without permission. In Aitutaki  we have tour guides. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>145 

</span></div><div><span>So  this  is  all    I  want  to  say    to  the  Minister.    We  do  need  some  kinds  of  financial 

assistance for the island of Aitutaki. Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  I call on the Honourable Member for Avatiu/Ruatonga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>   Greetings  to  you Mr Chairman and to  all the staff members.  

Greetings in the name of God.  To the Leader of the Opposition, may you have many 

more  birthdays  to  come.    On  the  Government  side  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy 

Prime  Minister,  to  all  Honourable  Members  on  the  Government  side  </span><span>–</span><span>  Greetings  to 

you all this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the allocation under the Honourable Minister Jim Marurai.  

The  reason  why  I  supported  this  allocation  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  Honourable 

Member  has  been  in  this  post  for  about  4  months.    I  believe  that  he  will  be  able  to 

discharge the responsibilities of this office efficiently. The Minister noted that this is 

the  projected allocation for Tauranga Vananga.  Yesterday, he mentioned about the 

</span><span>money  required  for  the  construction  of  a  complex  in  Takuvaine.    On  both  counts,  I 

</span><span>give my support. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to our Culture, we have on our island a man called Michael Tavioni.  I have 

spoken to this man and he proposed the construction of a proper training facility to be 

set up by Government  to train our young people in the carving and other traditional 

skills. Michael has the skills to carve wood, stones and bones.  He also tattoo. 

</span></div><div><span>On the Maori language, I know  we all have our experiences at school where when we 

were caught speaking Maori, you got punished. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  if  you  wish  to  apply  for  a  job  you  need  to  acquire  a  good  command  of  the 

English language. It is obvious that in that sense, the Maori language is not essential. I 

am not saying that we ignore our Maori Language. We should hold on to it.  In the 

investiture  of  our  Ariki,  Maori  is  crucial.    However,  I  think  we  are  following  the 

foreign concept of using the Courts to decide who the rightful title holders are.  Our 

culture is changing with time. What is important is to preserve our Culture. 

</span></div><div><span>I wish to  speak on the Auditorium.  We have all had  strange experiences when we 

used to perform in the old Constitution Park. The condition of that complex was very 

bad. When the Cultural Center was planned and developed, people began to criticise 

and complain about the huge expenditure on this complex.  However, I see that this 

complex is the </span><span>marae</span><span> for all the people of the Cook Islands. If this building had not 

been    built  we  would  still  be  performing  in  a  makeshift  leaking  building  at  the  old 

Constitution Park.  I am happy with this complex. Even though the cost is quite high, 

we now have a proper place to show our culture.  So I strongly support the allocation 

for  the  Tauranga  Vananga  and  I  would  like  to  encourage  the  Minister  in  his  

demanding portfolio.  And please consider the request from Michael Tavioni. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  The Member for Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>146 

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  greetings  to    all  of  us    this  afternoon.    Before  I 

embark on my speech, I would like to acknowledge the birthday of the Leader of the  

Corrective Division.  Happy birthday to you.  I like the name Corrective Division.  In 

some of the vote items we debated, we were trying to correct them.  And so, if we get 

to    cases  like  that,  let  us  refer  to  the  other  side  of  the  House  as  the  Corrective 

Division. But if they oppose the votes, let us refer to them as the Opposition side.  

</span></div><div><span>I  rose  Mr  Chairman  to  give  my  support  to  the  Appropriation  for  Cultural 

Development.  If we look at this there has been an increase in the appropriation over 

that of last year by $99,069.  I am not too certain Mr Chairman - maybe the Minister 

can elaborate whether there is a appropriation for Culture in the Outer Islands within 

the Budget for MOID. But looking </span><span>through this  Bill, I can’t see any.  I hope that the 

</span><span>allocation given to Culture Development will also be extended to the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Under Sectoral Goal 2, Output 4, it says  “to identify and protect sites of cultural and 

</span><span>historical  significance  and </span><span>the maintenance of a register for these sites”.   And if we 

</span><span>look at the gross appropriation for Output 4 it is $41,631.  I would like to speak on the 

issue of the </span><span>Marae</span><span> in our country.  So if we were to look at this sum of $99,000 and  

</span><span>we  clean up  all </span><span>Marae</span><span> in our country this amount would not be sufficient.  I am not 

</span><span>certain how, but  maybe as a plan we could start on the </span><span>Marae</span><span> of Aitutaki or Mauke 

and  then  come  to  Rarotonga.    I  would  like  to  correct  Mr  Chairman,  the  impression 

given by the Honourable Members of this House in thinking that our </span><span> Marae</span><span> are  only 

for  the  tourists  to  appreciate.    While  this  is  important,  we  should  be  cleaning  the 

</span><span>Marae</span><span> to preserve for our children and the future generations.  There is social benefits 

as well as economic benefits in this aspect of our society. So I believe Mr Chairman 

with regard to the subject of </span><span>Marae </span><span>that cultural development can work together with 

Tourism  and  the  Ministry  of  Education.    I  also  think  Mr  Chairman,  that  a  related 

project  can be included in the school curriculum and taught to our children.  This is 

why I rose.  I want to give my support to the Minister, Mr Chairman.  Even though 

there  are  other  important  outputs.    This  is  one  particular  area  I  want  us  to  do 

something. Let us work on this projec</span><span>t.  Don’t come back next year and talk about the 

</span><span>marae </span><span> again. 

</span></div><div><span>When  the  time  comes  to  clean  these  </span><span>Marae  do  </span><span>not  to  send  people  to  Aitutaki,  we 

know how to clean our </span><span>Marae.  A</span><span>ll you need to do is send the money and we can do 

the  work.    When  we  come  to  the  appropriation  for  Tourism  I  will  again  submit  my 

request to the Minister of Tourism to give some money for this purpose.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, we are moving into the year 2000.  Maybe if the staff of the Ministry of 

Outer  Islands  Development  worked  together  with  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  the  tour 

operators and the school  children,  I think we can do a better job. There is  a saying 

</span><span>that:    “If  you  want  to  know  where  you  are  going,  you  must  know  where  you  have 

come  from.”    As  we  move  into  the  year  2000  it  is  important</span><span>  that  we  clean  up  our 

</span><span>marae</span><span> so that our children and all our young people will know where they came from.   

Those are my views Mr Chairman.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

</span><span>speakers?  There appear to be none.  I will ask the Minister of Culture to sum up and 

answer any questions from the Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>147 

</span></div><div><span>HON. J. MARURAI:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  To you, the Clerk, your staff, the  

Honourable Members of the House and all our people who are listening in, Kia Orana.  

Special  greetings  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  for  his  birthday.  May  you  have 

many more. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to the appropriation I would like to give my regards and appreciation to 

all the speakers who contributed your views.  Your suggestions are noted.  A lot of the 

debate  centered  on  the  outer  islands  but  I  am  sorry  to  advise  that  the  Minister  of 

Cultural  Development  since  the  commencement  of  the  reform  process  is  not 

responsible for cultural developments in the outer islands.  I have already checked in 

the  MOID  appropriation  and  I  have  not  found  any  appropriation  for  that  purpose.  

Nevertheless as a Minister I will try to give some time for the outer islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Minister  Tupou  Faireka  mentioned  about  introducing  the  Maori 

language in the schools.   I think the emphasis was on cultural teaching.  There is in 

existence  a  Maori  and  Culture  programme  in  schools  up  to  Cook  Islands  School 

Certificate.  I suppose if this is to be promoted as a special subject the curriculum has 

to be reviewed to accommodate this subject.   

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Kete Ioane mentioned about the three legged statue.  I am 

told that the Secretary of Cultural Development is of the same view.  Perhaps you can 

suggest to her what you want to be done about it. 

</span></div><div><span>I acknowledge the other references made by other speakers to the subject of cultural 

preservation.  If  you have read  Part Two of this  documents there are references in 

output 4 to  6 about  those.  Again  I  will try  and  do my best  as Minister to  see them 

achieved. 

</span></div><div><span>Once again thank you for your contributions.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I shall now put the question. 

The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $514,406 for Culture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Development Investment Board.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $374,404 for Development Investment Board  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman.  To 

the  staff  of  the  House,  Kia  Orana.    Kia  Orana  to  the    Honourable  Members  of  the 

</span><span>House and to our people who are listening in this afternoon. A special greetings to the 

</span><span>Leader of the Opposition for his birthday.  As he was talking about his age earlier on I 

believe it is time for him to  retire, including his colleague next to him. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>148 

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman we are all aware that this is an appropriation we never discussed when 

we get to in the past.  We just pass it.  This is an uninteresting subject, it is not vote 

catching.    So  year  in  and  year  out  this  Vote  Item  is  one  of  the  ones  that  is  never 

debated.  But at the same time Mr Chairman,  like PERCA it is a very important Vote 

Item.  It is a very important section and one easily misunderstood.  So I will try and 

explain the role and function of this unit if only to enlighten some of those who do not 

understand its functions. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman the Development Investment Board was established in 1995 or 1996.  I 

think  it  was  in  September  of  1996.    Prior  to  that  it  was  called  the  Development 

Investment, it was not a board, and it was a body prior to the Development Investment 

Act of 1977.  And that body prior to the establishment of this Board was responsible 

for monitoring investments in the Cook Islands.  Because of the need to broaden this 

organisation it was felt that a new Board needed to be put in place.  And to establish 

that  body  an  Act  was  enacted  in  1996,  an  Act  to  promote  trade,  investment  and 

businesses  in  the  Cook  Islands.  To  promote  and  monitor  foreign  investments  in  the 

Cook Islands by establishing a Development  Investment Board.  The first Chairman 

of the board  was Mr George Ellis. 

</span></div><div><span>After his term expired he did not want this to be extended so he retired and the new 

Chairman  is  Mr  John  McFadzien.    He  was  also  a  Member  of  the  Board  when  Mr 

George Ellis was Chairman.  There were also five Board Members established by this 

Act.  Mr John McFadzien is the Chairman.  The Members were Tupu Araiti, Nooroa 

Ina Tou, Vaine Wichman, and Mrs Helen Tatuava.  According to the law there should 

be no less than three and no more than five Members, so the composition of the Board 

Members of the Development Investment Board consists of five Members. 

. 

If you look at the qualifications of these Members, John Mcfadzien is a lawyer, Tupu 

Araiti is the Deputy Secretary of MFEM </span><span>–</span><span> he has an MBA.  Vaine Wichman has also 

got  an  MBA,    Helen  Tatuava  is  a  Company  Director  for  Cook  Islands  Marketing 

Services Ltd and Nooroa Tou has been working in the banks.  I think he was at one 

stage  employed  by  the  National  Bank  of  New  Zealand  and  the  European  Pacific 

Banking Company and  recently Westpac.  So  you can see, Mr Chairman, that these 

people, all these people are business oriented which consider is essential for the type 

of work they are doing. 

</span></div><div><span>Strange enough, Mr Chairman, in the Act it does not specify what the qualifications of 

the Board Members are.  So their selections in a way were accidental although they 

</span><span>turned out to be suitable for the jobs they were empowered to do.  I won’t go into all 

</span><span>the various successes they have had.  Suffice  to say that they did a very good job in 

attracting new businesses into the Cook Islands.  According to their figures, the total 

value of new business registrations is $44.3 million since they have been in operation 

for a couple of years.  I remember saying in one of the reports in this House that we 

were not  in  a position to know the benefit of their work until  a few  years down the 

road.  But I notice in the Government revenue for this year that there are substantial 

increases in certain areas,  mainly in Company Tax and VAT.  So this  suggests that 

</span><span>the  benefit  of  their  efforts  is  now  being  realised.    I  expect  in  the  future  for  those 

</span><span>benefits to increase. 

. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>149 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Chairman, I think we should congratulate the Members of this Board because 

the job they are now doing is now becoming one of our major sources of revenue even 

</span><span>though we don’t see the benefit directly.</span></div><div><span>Before I sit down, Mr Chairman, I would like to thank the Members of this Board and 

their  previous  Chairman.  Some  of  the  previous  Board  Members  have  retired  but  I 

Thank them.  Regards to the present Executive Officer who is running this Board.  I 

think apart from the five Board Members there are only about three workers in total. 

So the benefits they are achieving on behalf of the Crown are more than the number 

of workers in this unit.  So congratulations are in order for this unit. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Minister.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The 

Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>H.ON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I will not prolong our debate on 

this  matter.    First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Minister  of  Finance  who 

</span><span>elaborated on the functions of this Department.  We understand that the Development 

</span><span>Investment Board is meant to encourage the growth of the economy.   According to 

</span><span>the  reports  and    the  Minister’s  comments,  it  appears  that’s  exactly  what  has  taken 

</span><span>place over the last financial year.  I too would like to congratulate  the Chairman of 

the  Board  and  the  Members,  especially    the  Officer  in  Charge  of  the  Development 

Investment  Board.    There  is  a  significant  increase  in  the  Company  Tax  for  this 

financial year compared to the previous one.  The previous year indicated $1.8 million 

</span><span>and this  financial  year indicated $3.2 million.   So that’</span><span>s quite an achievement and  I 

fully  support  the  words  of  appreciation  and  congratulations  to  the  Development 

Investment Board and the Ministry from the Minister.  That is a job well done. 

</span></div><div><span>I  take  note  in  one  of  the  Outputs  indicated  under  this  Vote  item,  where  there  was 

mention of promoting products by way of exports overseas.  I am interested to know 

what the Board is talking about here.  Are they talking about some of the things that 

</span><span>we don’t know?  There are quite a few things that we already know which w</span><span>e export.  

I would like to know what these products are that the Development Investment Board 

would like to promote as far as exporting is concerned. It is only beneficial if they are 

promoting  some  of  the  things  that  the  producers,  the  farmers,  the  growers  are  

producing.  They need to have these information and the information must be shared 

so that everyone understands each other. 

</span></div><div><span>Those here who are familiar with the Development Investment Board, we know that 

this is one avenue where new businesses including Cook Islanders who want to start 

up  new  businesses,  can  go  through  to  get  established.  The  Development  Investment 

Board  can  be  utilised  and  entrepreneurs  should  take  advantage  of  what  the 

Development Investment Board can provide.  Many of our business people, especially   

the ones who want to start up new businesses, are not fully aware of what advantages  

the Development Investment Board can provide. 

</span></div><div><span>And I would like to advise any new business or any new venture to apply through the 

Development  Investment  Board  for  exemptions  on  building  materials  or  equipment.  

Often in the past our people realised too late that they could have gone through the. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>150 

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Development Investment Board in order to get these exemptions.  They found out too 

late that you have to apply for exemptions to bring all these equipment and building 

materials  instead  of  trying  to  do  up  a  business  without  taking  advantage  of  these 

</span><span>incentives.  First you have to apply first before starting a business.  You don’t get it 

</span><span>any other way. And probably one of the failures in the system for our own people is 

not knowing about it. This may be due to inadequate promotions and advertisements.  

I know they spend a lot of time  promoting our country overseas and I wonder if they 

are  doing  the  same  kind  of  promotions  for  our  people.  I  know  you  have  a  lot  of 

savings from exemptions to the materials and equipment that you bring in and even to 

the  compositions  of  the  products  for  your  business.  A  lot  of  these    can  save  you 

money  before  you  can  even  start.  Even  today  if  I  can  recall  the  Amendment  from 

Development Investment Act to Development Investment Board - there was an added 

clause  to  include  expanding  part  of  a  business.  If  there  is  a  need  to    extend    the 

business you can again apply for exemptions on materials for that purpose.  This is an 

important amendment to the original Act because it allows expansion of any business. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Your second speech Honourable Member.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    In  addition  our  people  should  realise  that  the  Board  can 

</span><span>also exempt a business from taxation and can provide a tax hold for a certain period.  

It  can  reduce  taxation  such  as  company  tax  and  perhaps  other  benefits  that  can  be 

provided  under  the  Development  Investment    Board  Act  as  far  as  taxation  is 

concerned.    You  only  have  to  visit  Rohan  Ellis  at  the  Board  to  provide  all  the 

information necessary either for a new business or a business that you want to expand.   

</span></div><div><span>I want to encourage our people to go through this Board especially those wanting to 

start a new business. Including those wishing to expand their businesses. Our people 

must be fully aware the Board is waiting for any Cook Islander who wishes to start a 

new business or start a business with an overseas investor in a joint venture.  I can see 

that the Board has done a lot of advertising and as a result of that we see the increase 

in  company  tax  in  our  revenue.    I  do  hope  that  when  our  Ministers  travel  overseas 

they will assist by promoting this element in our economic development.  I think  all 

you have to do is to take a copy of the Act and if anyone asks  you for anything the 

answer should be there.  

</span></div><div><span>I remember when I went to the Seminar in Sydney I took about ten copies and shared 

them  out  to  whoever  wanted  a  copy.    This  is  all  a  simple  way  of  advertising  our 

investment opportunities in the Cook Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. I call on the Minister of Internal 

Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Mr  Chairman  I  rise  to  give  my 

support  to  this  Appropriation.  More  so  I  give  my  thanks  to  the  work  this  service  is 

giving to the country.  I concur with the previous speakers for praising the C.E.O. of 

this Department, Rohan Ellis, the staff and the Board Members.  I would like through 

</span><span>you  Mr  Chairman  to  say  thank  you  to  this  Department  on  behalf  of  my  people  in 

</span><span>Manihiki  and  Tongareva.    Through  this  Department  a  lot  of  support  and  assistance 

were  given  to  the  Pearl  Farmers  of  these  two  islands.    More  so  for  the  people  of 

Manihiki in recovering from the devastation of Cyclone Martin. A special exemption 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>151 

</span></div><div><span>has been given to the pearl farmers for the importation of their pearl farming materials 

from  New Zealand and  abroad.   I  can  guarantee our people that the development  of 

pearl  farming  on  these  two  islands  has  really  been  boosted.    Apart  from  that  I  have 

had an association with the C.E.O. in dealing with some business companies that have 

been  in  operation  in  the  last  twelve  months.    As  we  heard  from  the  Minister 

responsible for this Vote Item the revenue we are collecting from the services of this 

Department is threefold now.   

</span></div><div><span>You see the work carried out by these people is not that simple.  Although we are in 

need of foreign investment in our country it is not that simple to accept  them. They 

have  to  apply  due  diligence  to  their    work  to  ensure  that  these  people  who  wish  to 

come here and start a business are genuine.  The past Government has opened up our 

investment policies for any foreigner who wish to start a business here to set up their 

business. 

</span></div><div><span>I am very happy to say that for three to four years nothing degrading or negative has 

been brought to our notice from the services of this department.  All we have heard 

for the last few years is that the business has increased and likewise the revenue.  This 

</span><span>is reflected in our appropriation for this financial year. Right now  there are more than 

</span><span>three groups of people on our shores looking for potential investment in our products 

and they are in  negotiation not  only with  Government but  with  the private sector as 

well.    The  onus  of  approval  and  the  analysis  of  the  background  of  investors  rests 

totally  with  the  staff  of  this  service.    I  give  them  my  support  from  not  only  the 

Government but from the private sector as well, in ensuring that no business people 

are allowed to take advantage of our people. They must not be here only to gain but to 

ensure that benefits is generated for  our country and our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Again I give my full support to this appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Member Sir Geoffrey Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you, to our staff 

working for us in this House and greetings to everybody.  Greetings also to the Prime 

Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Members and Honourable Members on the 

Government bench.  Greetings to the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy and to 

all Members on the Opposition side, greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to greet our people listening in to the debate this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the appropriated sum for this department to enable them to 

carry out their responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>I think I can say with honesty Mr Chairman that there probably is not one allocation 

in the budget that one could say is enough  for the requirements of each activity that 

</span><span>we are budgeting for.  But I believe the Minister of Finance had a fair answer to that 

</span><span>problem.    I am  sure there is  not  a stronger answer than that  -  there is  only so  much 

money that we have available for the budget.  The cake is only of such a size that the 

problem is dividing it in such a way that everybody feels they have been given enough 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>152 

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>to  work  with.    We  have  to    cut  it  in  such  a  way  that  Government  policies  for 

development  and  promotion  are  attended  to.  Given  therefore  the  importance  of  the 

work  of  the  Development  Investment  Board  and  due  to  the  type  of  work  the  Board 

does, it is highly likely that if the question were put to the Board today, they are likely 

to say the amount we are appropriating for them falls short of what they would say is 

sufficient.    This  amount  however  Mr  Chairman  is  only  a  little  less  than  what  was 

appropriated  last  year  for  the  Development  Investment  Board.  </span><span>–</span><span>  Mr  Chairman  I  am 

sorry.   

</span></div><div><span>Could I suggest Mr Chairman that it would help Members in the House if the sign on 

</span><span>your  table  says  “Speaker”  when  in  Parliament  and  “Chairman”  when  we  are  in 

Committee?  I am looking at the sign and I am reading “Speaker”.  I just throw this as 

</span><span>a suggestion for you Mr Speaker and Mr Clerk-at-the-Table. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to extend my thanks and offer congratulations to the Development Investment 

Board  members  and  also  to  its  Chief  Executive  who  is  a  very  young  man,    and  his 

staff.  All of them are very young and enthusiastic people.  In order for the Board to 

be  able  to  carry  out  its  functions  it  was  necessary  to  devolve  from  Cabinet  certain 

</span><span>functions by Cabinet to the Development Investment Board.   

</span></div><div><span>Previously  any  investment  or  business  undertaken  in  the  Cook  Islands  which  has  a 

foreign element, and applying for exemptions could only be granted by Cabinet alone. 

The Legislation that established the Development Investment Board transferred those 

authorities  from  Cabinet  to  the  Board  of  Directors.    I  believe  the  Board  under  the 

chairmanship  of  Mr  George  Ellis  did  an  extremely  good  job  in  carrying  out  their 

functions  as  per  the  statute  establishing  them  and  the  amount  of  money  made 

available to them.  Since his resignation from the Board Mr George Ellis was replaced 

by Mr John Mcfadzien.   I want  to  congratulate  him and the current  members of the 

Board for carrying out their functions.  

</span></div><div><span>One of the reasons for devolving this power which were formerly held by Cabinet was 

to ensure that there was an independent body, an independent house, where decisions 

were made without political influence.  On that Board Mr Chairman were people from 

the public and none of them were public servants.  None of them were politicians.  I 

believe  all  of  them  who  have  been  on  that  Board  have  carried  out  their  duties 

diligently  and  with  integrity.    This  body  is  in  a  sense  an  attempt  to  establish  an 

independent one stop investment shop. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Please carry on with your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Previously  there  used  to  be 

long delays between filing of the application by a foreign investor to the time he was 

able to achieve all the approvals required before he can start his business.  Many of 

these investors gave up hope and told us how much of their time and money had been 

wasted going from one place to another to get approvals.  A foreign investment in the 

Cook Islands was a difficult procedure. 

</span></div><div><span>And they kept saying too that they were not certain just exactly what they were going 

to get.  In other words, there was no certainty as to what is available to them and what 

is  not  available  to  them.    Sometimes  it  was  a  matter  of  carrying  the  favour  of  a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>153 

</span></div><div><span>particular  Minister  or  a  Member  of  Cabinet.  Now  we  have  avoided  all  of  those 

problems.  Foreign investors can go to the Development Investment Board and know 

exactly what they can get from there.  There is transparency and certainty.  Political 

interference is not available. 

</span></div><div><span>An  important  part  of  the  function  of  the  Development  Investment  Board  is  to  assist 

the development of the private sector in our country.  An important tenet of the reform  

is developing the private sector as the engine of growth. In this process for developing 

the strength of the private sector we are looking not just at Rarotonga.  We are looking  

at the whole nation and in so doing the Development Investment Board is interested in 

both foreign investors who may come and establish themselves on their own or in a 

joint venture, as well as developing local entrepreneurs.  This is a very  important part 

of their responsibility. 

</span></div><div><span>In  connection  with  this  latter  responsibility  of  the  Development  Investment  Board, 

there is running in the same building with the Development Investment Board a Small 

Business Development Centre.  Now I think it is appropriate that the message is sent 

out widely to our people that there is this Centre available.  It is keen to develop local 

</span><span>entrepreneurs,  to  teach  them  business  skills  and  to  teach  them  such  skills  as  would 

</span><span>assist  them  in  not  only  starting  a  new  business  but  in  improving  what  they  already 

have.  I am sure, Mr Chairman, we  Members of Parliament would like to see our own 

</span><span>people  become  owners  and  managers  of  our  growth.    We  are  not  saying  we  don’t 

want any foreigners, nor are we saying we don’t want any foreign capital.  All we are 

</span><span>saying  is  that  more  time  should  be  spent  in  developing  our  own  people  to  become 

owners  of  our  own  richness.  This  Small  Business  Unit,  was  established  to  do 

precisely that. 

</span></div><div><span>The Development Investment Board has two other important functions. One of them 

is to promote trade to and from the Cook Islands. The Development Investment Board 

therefore  has  been  involved  with  Government  in  establishing  trade  agreements  with 

our  neighbours  in  the  Pacific.  They  promoted  several  Trade  Missions  overseas  and 

very successful too.  For example, Mr Chairman, at the opening of the Pacific Trade 

Centre in Tokyo a team of Cook Islands business people under the leadership of the 

Chief  Executive  of  Development  Investment  Board,  Rohan  Ellis,  attended  the 

opening.  During that time there was a week of trade promotions. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your last speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  And  I  got  a  number  of  very 

complimentary reports, Mr Chairman, of the presentations made by our team.  I have 

had several letters written to me from various business quarters in Japan as well as the 

Foreign  Affairs  of  Japan.    One  other  particular  function  that  they  performed,  Mr 

Chairman,  was  the  general  promotion  of  the  Cook  Islands  as  a  sound  investment 

venue, as a sound investment place.  But to a larger than lesser extent in that activity 

the Members of this House are more responsible.  There is more that remains for us to 

do than there is for the Board itself. Several surveys have been undertaken to indicate, 

</span><span>Mr Chairman, that foreign investors desire a place of political stability.  I believe that 

</span><span>we, the Members of this House, are fully responsible for ensuring that.

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Excuse  me  please.    It  is  time  to  stop.    You  can  carry  on 

tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you.  I will carry on tomorrow.  I will take my seat  

now.</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much.  I  call  on  the  Minister  in  Charge  of  the 

Vote.

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>PARLIAMENT RESUMED AT 4.55 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call on the Minister in Charge of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I wish to report: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Appropriation Bill is still progressing very nicely through the 

Committee Stage. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Before  we  have  our  closing 

prayer,  just reminding the Executive Committee of our meeting immediately after the 

adjournment.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>Would an Honourable Member please lead us in prayer?  Thank you.
