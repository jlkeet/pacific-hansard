</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  recommend  to  the  Minister  to  send  Officers  to  the  Outer  Islands  to 

collect information - as they used to do in the past.   By doing that, they will be able to 

meet  up  with  our  elder  folks,  compose  songs  and  chants  and  so  on.    They  can  also 

obtain  and  record  information  relating  to  the  various  </span><span>Marae</span><span>  on  each  of  the  Outer 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to encourage the Minister to send his staff out and collect crafts such as 

</span><span>the </span><span>rito</span><span> hats from the Northern Group islands.  They have a new way of making these 

rito hats. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on Minister for your second speech.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Collect all these information and these handcrafts.  Place them 

in the  Museum for our future generations to see.  In Manihiki and Penrhyn now, they 

are carving the pearl shell.  So these arts could  be collected, brought into the Museum 

and displayed to portray the skills of the respective islands.  

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, I would like to encourage the work of those people who are creating activities 

whereby  our  National  Auditorium  can  be  utilised.      For  instance,  Eddie  Wichman  

used  the  National  Auditorium  for  dance  competitions;    Sonny  Williams  who  is 

creating programmes and utilising the  facilities of the National Auditorium.  All these 

activities  assist  to  keep  our    culture    alive.    For  once,  the  National  Auditorium  was 

packed with people  who came to see the performance of the school children.  Many 

people just milled around the outside because the hall was full. I was overjoyed to see 

our children performing on the stage.   In addition, I really admired a large number of 

</span><span>papaâ€™a pupils who actually performed that night.</span></div><div><span>There  is  value  in  our  Culture  and  we  must  condone  the  policy  of  Government  in 

reviving our traditions  and Culture.  Today we  have  a beautiful center to host these 

activities.  Although this allocation  may not  be enough, for now this may do to assist 

the developments and the promotion of our culture and heritage.  

I give my strong support for this allocation for Cultural Development. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  Are there any further speakers?  

</span><span>There appears to be none. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Leader of the Opposition. On behalf of the Members of the House, we wish 

you a Happy Birthday today Honourable Member.
