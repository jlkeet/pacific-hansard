<div><span>(APPLAUSE) 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    I  am  sure  my  wife  would  be 

</span><span>happy to hear you say that, Mr Chairman.  I’m only 65.  </span></div><div><span>To you, your staff and Honourable Members and the people listening in </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, this is one aspect, which is unique in our society and that is our culture, 

our identity.  We value this so much and it becomes a part of us to show to the world 

what  we  really  are.    Mr  Chairman  with  the  birth  of  a    new  born  child  comes  the 

realisation  of  a  culture  in  which  the  child  is  nurtured.  It  might  be  difficult  for  us  to 

accept  this,  yet,  if  we  recall  the  growth  of  our  children,  they  are  still  small  and  yet 

they  know  how  to  dance.  This  is  one  thing  which  capture  the  imaginations  of  the 

tourists  who  come  to  the  Cook  Islands.    Often  we  are  referred  to  as  a    naturally 

talented race. I trust, Mr Chairman, that when our children are born, regardless how 

much money we appropriate for this  Ministry to enhance our culture, our children are 

already inbred with certain cultural attributes which in later years will become more 

</span><span>and more pronounced. 

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  offer  my  support  to  the  documentation  of  our  history,  recording  events 

which made land marks in the progress of our country, compiling information relating 

to  our  customs  and  traditions  and  collecting  artifacts  and  handcrafts  for  archival 

purposes. We want to safe guard these things to ensure that there is no repeat of the 

devastation  which  occurred  at  the  old  administration  block.  As  mentioned  by  the 

previous speaker, we should be grateful to the Mormons for microfilming a lot of our 

history. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of our language the Maori Language, I know that we are all destroying our 

original mother tongue.  Even in this House, Members tend to mix their speeches to 

simplify what they want to say. Although there are complaints about the mixing of the 

language  in  our  speeches,  it  does  not  really  concern  me  because  the  receiver  of  the 

message still understands what you want to convey. The unfortunate thing is that our 

own  Maori  Language  is  disappearing.    I  have  no  difficulty  with  the  mixing  of  the 

</span><span>languages  because  these  words  are  coined  from  English  like  the  word  “time”  and 

</span><span>frequently used  by us.   I  support that money should be put aside for the purpose of 

preserving our Language.  

</span></div><div><span>The other issue  I would  like to  address  is  the  Library and Museum.   In  our country 

today,  there  are  two  main  public  Libraries  and  Museum.    One  is  operated  privately 

and the other require appropriations from this House to operate it.  I am particularly 

concerned  about  the  Library  at  the    Culture  Center  (Tauranga  Vananga).      I  would 

prefer  to  see  Government  either  run  both  complexes,  hence  provide  funding  for  the 

both or they both operate privately.  

</span></div><div><span>As we all know this is one area which I used to complain a lot.  The Auditorium has 

</span><span>always  been  a  sore  point  for  me  whenever  I  debate  in  this  House.      When  it  was 

</span><span>started we predicted that this was going to be a major problem, a major concern to this 

country.  I have been advised that when these buildings were constructed the design 

and construction work was not the best.  I think there has been a lot of corrupt work 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>142 

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>during the construction of that building,  hence  resulted in  a poor design and poor 

construction.    The  concern  I  would  like  to  relate  to  the  Minister  and  to  this 

Government, is that I understand there is going to be a lot of maintenance work on at 

the Culture Centre. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  So I’d like to express my views 

</span><span>and  say  that  sooner  or  later  there  will  be  a  major  need  to  renovate  these  buildings.  

And since its completion and utilisation we have yet to see a better financial return for 

these  buildings  in  our  annual  Budget  statements.  For  that  reason  Mr  Chairman,  I 

believe that the only way we can see better utilisation of these assets is to privatise it. 

</span></div><div><span>The  question  has  been  raised  whether  the  Culture  allocation  in  regards  to  the 

requirements and needs of the Outer Islands is sufficient.  I think this is a very good 

question Mr Chairman.  It should not only be confined to Culture, the question should 

be whether the $9 Million Budget for the Outer Islands is sufficient to look after the 

affairs  of  the  Outer  Islands.  This  is  one  area  I  am  really  concerned,  Mr  Chairman. 

</span><span>What is in this Budget?  What can this Budget do for the needs of the people of the 

</span><span>Outer  Islands?    That  is  the  saddest  part  in  my  view  and  I  think  Members  from  the 

Outer  Islands should be  looking at  this matter.    They  should be duty bound to  raise 

those  matters  while  we  are  talking  about  the  Appropriation  Bill.    And  if  I  have  any 

qualm, it is the allocation for the Outer Islands and how that is going to  benefit  the 

people out there.  Would this fund be enough to cover the needs of the Outer Islands?  

If  we  are  to  concentrate  on  the  restoration  of  the  customs  and  the  traditions  of  our 

islands, would this  money  be sufficient? And if we need to  document the history of 

the Outer  Islands then the Ministry should bring the Orators or the  </span><span>Tumu-Korero</span><span> to 

Rarotonga where they can record their  chants and  songs, the legends and myths of 

the people. Do not send the officers in the Ministry because they know nothing about 

the  customs  in  the  Outer  Islands.    That  is  what  we  have  been  doing  over  the  years. 

That is all I have to say on this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. Are there any further speakers?  

There appears to be none.  The Member for Amuri-Ureia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  you  and  to  all  the  staff 

members  and  the  Honourable  Members.  To  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime 

Minister,  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  all  the 

Honourable Members, Kia Orana.  Greetings also to our people who are listening in to 

our  debate  this  afternoon.        This  is  not  the  first  time  we  have  debated  a  Budget 

allocation for the Ministry of Cultural.  We did it last year, the year before  </span><span>–</span><span> in fact  

every  year.  I  was  wondering  if  the  Minister  responsible  is  listening  to  the 

recommendations and requests by the various speakers.   This is why we are here,  to 

raise questions and make recommendations but the answers still lies in the hands of 

the Minister responsible. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Excuse me Honourable Member.  Sorry to interrupt but it is time 

</span><span>to stop.  This Sitting is suspended until 3.00pm.
