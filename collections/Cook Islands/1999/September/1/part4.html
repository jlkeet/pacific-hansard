<div><span>(APPLAUSE)  

</span></div><div><span>I  brought  this  into  this  House  to  show  us  the  beauty  of  the  knowledge  of  our 

ancestors.  This  chant  shows  that  our  ancestors  already  know  the  existence  of  an 

unseen God.  We must not forget that the Almighty created Man to rule the lands. So I 

thought this chant is most appropriate for us this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>We  heard  the  previous  speakers  who  have  spoken  before  me.    I  fully  support  their 

views and their recommendations.  I believe that with this allocation the Outer Islands 

will  also  be  included.  I  have  studied  the  MOID  budget  and  I  could  not  even  find 

anywhere in the Budget that states that our tradition and culture are embraced under 

other  appropriations.    Maybe  by  my  raising  this  matter  now  the  people  who  are 

responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  Budget  could  identify  a  vote  item  for  this 

purpose for the Outer Islands in  future budgets. 

</span></div><div><span>In October 1997 we cleaned and restored some of the </span><span>marae</span><span> on our island.  It was a 

big job.   The people on  the island united to  preserve our traditional values.  I would 

like to  acknowledge the  Government  support through the Council in  this project  for 

the carting of sands, gravel and stones, as well as  the JCB to help remove some of the 

boulders.    I  have  also  raised  this  matter  with  the  Koutu  Nui  for  the    possibility  of 

establishing a fund to assist restore these sites on the Outer Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>Although this was not forthcoming we got support from some people who helped the 

payment of the Government machinery.  Mr Chairman, I would like to encourage the 

</span><span>restoration of all the </span><span>Marae</span><span> on all the islands of the Cook Islands so that this will be 

</span><span>used  as  tour  highlights  for  the  tourists  when  they  come  here  to  visit.  I  believe,  the 

Ministry  of  Culture  would  like  to  know  the  traditions  of  these  </span><span>Marae.    </span><span>There  are 

people in the tribes and amongst the families who own these sites and who are well 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>137 

</span></div><div><span>versed  with  the  histories  of  these  places.    Maybe  we  need  to  have  these  legends 

documented.  I  believe  there  are  elderly  people  in  the  Cook  Islands  who  are  well 

versed  in  their  culture  where  we  can  obtain  information  from  them.  We  should 

capture  their  knowledge    because  the  moment  they  depart  this  life  they  would  take 

everything with them.  Their know how would disappear. Some people may say we 

are  wasting  our  time  on  this  matter  but  this    information  is  invaluable  for  future 

references.    I  believe    we  who  are  alive  today    originate  from  those  ancestors  who 

lived and met on those </span><span>Marae. 

</span></div><div><span>I recall sometimes ago, a young man came to Akatokamanava to collect information 

regarding the culture and history of the island of Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span> Do you wish to carry on Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span>  Yes please. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your second speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:  </span><span>These research involved the excavation of some areas in Mauke. In 

</span><span>doing these, they were able to find a buried  village where they dug.  In this area, they 

found artifacts such as graters made out of the mother pearl, fish hooks, needles and 

other  amenities.    This  young  man  was  able  to  determine  when  the  island  was    first 

settled.  He estimated that the settlement of Akatokamanava happened around 900 to 

1000 AD.  All this knowledge, this information that has been acquired I believe will 

be  important  for  our  children  and  our  future  generations.    Because  you  are  also  the 

Minister of Education, I am persuading you to advance the teaching of our culture and 

the  Maori  language  the  schools.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  former  Minister  of 

Education, who is now our Speaker, for putting in place  a programme to teach Maori 

language  in  schools.    When  I  retired  from  teaching  in  the  year  1996,  I  saw  the 

syllabus for the teaching of Maori customs and traditions.  I still feel that we need to 

promote  these  areas.  New  methods  must  be  developed  to    enhance  our  Maori 

language  in  the  schools  because  if  you  walk  into  a  classroom  in  Rarotonga  the 

prominent  language  spoken  is  English.    Activities  such  as  weaving,  sewing  and  

</span><span>carving are all features of the lifestyles of our forefathers. Maybe in today’s world it is 

</span><span>essential  that  our  children  pass  English  based  syllabus  but  what  will  happen  to  our 

Maori syllabus?  As I have already outlined I believe strongly that we should support 

the teaching of our Maori language. 

</span></div><div><span>Today  when  we  speak,  we  refer  to  the  islands  in  the  North  as  the  Northern  Group 

</span><span>Islands.  In Maori we say “</span><span>Te Pa Enua Tokerau”.</span><span>  But in the traditional compass or 

</span><span>wind directions of our ancestors, we start the compass from  the  “Akarua”   which is 

</span><span>the East. In the Bible it tells us that the winds came from the East and parted the Red 

</span><span>Sea.  Today we call the East “Marangai”.  So the importance of what I am trying to 

</span><span>say is that we must be able to  teach our children exactly  where the North is and what  

the East  is  in  Maori.  This  example is  to  prompt us to  realise the importance of the 

Maori  customs  and  language,  and  to  teach  these  in  the  schools.    I  know  that 

</span><span>Enuamanu  has  a  group  of  people  who  are  writing  down  their  history  and    their 

</span><span>language.    There  is  also  a  similar  programme  established  on  Akatokamanava  and  I 

believe that what these gentlemen are doing could be utilised  for the benefit of our 

country.  I  am  wondering  if  they  could  be  brought  into  the  schools  to  enhance  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>138 

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>teachings of these subjects.  Part of the project that these people are carrying out is on 

genealogy.    Some  people  come  up  with  different  genealogies  and  they  realised  that 

some  genealogies  differ  from  others  and  they  are  now  able  to  identify  the  correct 

records. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on with your last speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA: </span><span>So I think it is appropriate for Honourable Members in this House to 

look  at  these  suggestions.    My  last  thought  on  this  issue  is  with  regard  to  our 

language.    A  project  has  been  developed  to  establish  a  Cook  Islands  Language  to 

enable  everyone  to  understand  each  other.    My  personal  opinion  is  that  we  use  the 

language of the Bible as the Cook Islands language.  The reason for this is that if we 

read the Bible from  Genesis to  Revelations, we will find all the different  dialects  in 

our country in the Bible. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of the individual languages on each of the islands these be retained in their 

proper  places  on  the  islands.    We  should  respected  these  and  use  them  on  the 

individual islands. When I was teaching we found it hard in the schools because  the 

</span><span>questions  we  were  composing  in  Maori  had  to  be    in  the  language  spoken  in 

</span><span>Rarotonga.    So  when  the  children  answered  these  questions,  especially  on  Mauke, 

they  found  it  difficult.  They  made  a  lot  of  mistakes  because  they  were  unable  to 

understand the questions properly.   But  when the teacher translated this  Rarotongan 

dialect into Maukean, it was easy for the children to answer the questions.  I believe it 

will be a very good thing if a group of appropriate people can look into this matter.  

As  Honourable  Members  of  this  House  we  speak  in  our  own  languages  and  I 

appreciate  that.    I  found  it  an  honour  to  listen  to  all  the  different  languages  in  this 

House.    I  also  believe  that  we  will  all    keep  that  respect  for  our  languages  and  I 

strongly support the appropriation before the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

I call on the Honourable Member for Vaipae Tautu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR K. IOANE: </span><span>Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman and also to your staff members.  Kia 

Orana also to all Honourable Members of this House.   

</span></div><div><span>I have some views to register on this appropriation. I believe this sum is not going to 

be adequate because I also know that there will be a need to restore the </span><span>marae </span><span>on our 

islands.  On Aitutaki which has a lot of  </span><span>marae</span><span> we have all kinds of tales associated to 

them. Today Mr Chairman these marae are convened with the bush.  So I would like 

to  ask  the  Minister  to  look  into  this  matter.  We  need  to  clean  them  up  and  to 

document  the  histories  of  these  places  so  that  our  tourists  will  be  able  to  learn  the 

values  of  these  historical  places.  Maybe  the  stories  of  the  marae  can  be  written  and 

sold to the tourists so they will know the stories of the marae.  Secondly Mr Chairman 

I would like to see our carvers assisted.  I think this is a very good idea. At the same 

time, I would like to mention the views of the people of Aitutaki in  opposing these 

huge  carvings,  statues.    We  call  ourselves  god  fearing  people  but  when  these  large 

</span><span>carvings were made, they had three legs and I do not think this is a very good thing 

</span><span>for our tourists to  see.  Some of my people told me that when they  came here from 

Aitutaki they saw massive statues infront of the auditorium.  I do not know whether 

the  carver  knew  whether  our  ancestors  made  carvings  in  this  way.    I  would  like  to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>139 

</span></div><div><span>question the principle behind this form of display by Government.  The request from  

my  people  is  to  destroy  these  artifacts.    On  the  island  of  Aitutaki  to  welcome  the 

tourists to the Aitutaki Resort are two such statues, they have three legs each.  I would 

like to ask the Minister responsible - we have a new Minister so everything should be 

new </span><span>–</span><span> can we cast these idols away?  This is a request from my people.  So I believe 

Mr  Chairman  the  best  display  we  can  offer  our  tourists  is  the  natural  beauty  of  our 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>We see some of these papa’a ladies laughing.  I don’t know what they are laughing at.  

</span><span>I just want to highlight our concern Mr Chairman. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

I call upon the Honourable Minister of Internal Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Good  afternoon  to  you,  good 

afternoon  to  Honourable  Members  of  the  House.  Kia  Orana  to  our  people  who  are 

listening in to the broadcast of our debate.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman  I rise to  give my  support to  this  appropriation for Culture  and also  to 

</span><span>give my congratulations to the staff who are working in the Ministry of Culture.  To 

the Secretary Mrs Carmen Temata, and your staff members, Kia Orana to  you all in 

the name of our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to support this appropriation to areas that I think will be of benefit to our 

people.  As the Minister outlined to  us there is  an increase in  the allocation for this 

year  as  opposed  to  the  allocation  for  the  Ministry  last  year.    The  reason  being,  the 

need  to    hire  a  person  to  look  after  the  archives  of  the  Ministry.    I  would  like  to 

encourage the Minister to look for a person of such caliber.  I believe there is only one 

trained archivist in the Cook Islands and that is Mr George Paniani.  I am not too sure 

whether  somebody  is  being  trained  or  whether  there  is  a  European  lined  up  for  this 

job.  All I know is that someone should be put in place because I am aware that a lot 

of  records  have  been  taped  and  filmed  over  the  years  and  we  need  to  have  these 

materials processed to last. 

</span></div><div><span>I always  enjoy watching short clips of old footages of the lives of our people in the 

past.  It is interesting to see what their lives was like then and  a lot of these are  in the 

archive. 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  would  like  to  encourage  the  Minister  to  continue  collecting  these  information.  

We  should  also  be  recording  our  language  today  even  though  it  has  changed 

somewhat.  I believe that it should be recorded today and I am quite certain that we 

are  also  culprits  in  destroying  our  language.    It  is  not  just  our  children  who  are 

bastardising  our  language  </span><span>–</span><span>  that  is  mixing  it  with  phrases  from  other  languages.  

Many strange phrases have crept into our language recently.  We hear it everywhere 

including the TV.   Our  children are us</span><span>ing  phrases such  as  “</span><span>thank  you ra</span><span>”, or “</span><span>okay 

ra</span><span>”.  This is  happening to our language today.  It sounds more like pidgin English. 

</span><span>And so I would like to recommend to the Minister responsible to create a programme 

</span><span>to address this problem.

</span></div><div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Our orators should  be more active in this field. The School must also do their part.  

We  have  in  our  midst  this  afternoon  a  number  of    Honourable  Members  who  are 

proven orators and one of them earlier on presented a chant for us. The Honourable 

Member from Mangaia, Papamama Pokino is saying that he has another Orator from 

</span><span>the island of Mangaia in Mataora Harry.  I don’t know whether to believe everything 

</span><span>this gentleman says.  There are two other persons that I would like us to recognise and 

that is Papa Ota Joseph and Tepoave Raitia.  

</span></div><div><span>One thing about these two orators is that they came from Tupapa.
