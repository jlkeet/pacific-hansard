<div><span>(MUCH NOISE) 

</span></div><div><span>Excuse  me.    Silence  please.    I  have  been  advised  that  there  are  two  Ministerial 

Statements.  One by the Deputy Prime Minister and one by the Prime Minister so this is 

</span><span>not a debate on the Deputy Prime Minister’s Statement but a Statement of his own.</span></div><div><span>So I ask the Prime Minister please to continue with his Ministerial Statement and if any 

of  you  wish to  debate these two Statements  you know what  to  do.  It  is  in the Standing 

Order.  Thank you Prime Minister.  Would you please continue? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  J.  WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  will  continue.    My  name  was 

stated i</span><span>n the article this morning.  I will repeat that because my microphone wasn’t turned 

</span><span>on.  My name was mentioned with the implication of nepotism.  I said  I am happy that 

with  this  article,  that  Florence  Syme  has  published  this  article  this  morning.    Nothing 

must be hidden from the public.  They are entitled to know what the entitlements are of 

the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and also the Leader of the Opposition 

</span><span>who  is  entitled  to  the  same  provisions  as  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    That  is  the 

</span><span>provision  for  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition to receive support staff.  The Civil List Act does not stipulate who should be 

employed by the Prime Minister, by the Deputy Prime Minister or by the Leader of the 

Opposition.  This has been in place for a long time.  The fact that I am Prime Minister, 

and  the  Honourable  Norman  George  is  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  and  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition is Dr Maoate, does not change the provisions of the Civil List.   

</span></div><div><span>What I did not like in the article is the citing of the names of people without asking those 

</span><span>people  for  their  names  to  be  published  in  the  paper.    That  is  an  infringement  of  the 

</span><span>privacy  of  the  individuals.    My  brother’s  name  has  been  mentioned  together  with  his</span><span>

family.  I want to tell this House and the people of this country that my brother and his 

family have looked after my property for the past five years.  They will continue to look 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>183 

</span></div><div><span>after my property whether the Civil List pays them or not and I am not going to employ 

someone else to replace them - just because this article was published.  I want to repeat.  I 

am  not  going to  employ anyone else or  get  anybody else to  replace my brother and his 

family to look after my property just because there is entitlement under the Civil List Act. 

</span></div><div><span>A  certain  person  has  brought  up  the  question  of  nepotism  in  the  Paper  by  the  name  of 

Wilkie Rasmussen.  I am glad he mentioned this.  I am  glad Mr Wilkie Rasmussen has 

been  cited  in  this  report  because  the  question  of  nepotism  must  be  addressed.    I  want 

people  who  look  after  my  property  to  be  people  that  I  can  trust  implicitly.    And  the 

people I trust are my immediate family and my extended family.  I can leave and feel safe 

with the doors wide open and I am quite sure that the Leader of the Opposition would do 

exactly the same.  And the Deputy Prime Minister is doing exactly that.   

</span></div><div><span>Now the question of threats.  Threats to my life and the life of the Deputy Prime Minister.  

I  was  not  going  to  make  any  statement  regarding  this  but  the  fact  that  this  has  been 

brought up prompts me to confirm in this House that what the Deputy Prime Minister has 

said is true.  And this is why I was quite firm that my family must look after my property 

while  I  am  not  there.    I  trust  them  implicitly.    I  want  to  tell  you  Mr  Speaker,  the 

Honourable Members of this House and the people of this country, that it is not the threat 

on my life I am concerned about.  What I am concerned about is the threat to the security 

and  the  stability  of  this  country.    Also  the  concern  as  to  whom  are  behind  this  threat.  

Everybody in this House should be aware of this.  I want to ask the question, who are the 

people behind this threat?  What are they afraid of?  After Pukapuka, if there is a change 

of  Government,  I  am  sure  the  threat  will  go  to  the  other  side.    That  is  what  I  am 

concerned about.   It is the security and stability  of Government  and the security of this 

country that is at stake.  They can shoot me.  They can shoot the Deputy Prime Minister. 

But the country will be in turmoil.  After that what will happen to this country is anarchy, 

anarchy will prevail.  As I said Mr Speaker, I did not want to bring up the question of the 

threat on my life and the life of the Deputy Prime Minister.  I repeat. It is not our lives 

that  matter,  it  is  the  stability  of  Government  and  the  security  of  this  country  that  is  at 

stake.   

</span></div><div><span>Finally,  I  want  to  thank  Florence  Syme  for  bringing  this  particular  issue  to  our  notice.  

</span><span>Thus allowing these two Ministerial Statements to be made and thus telling the people of 

</span><span>the country that there is  a threat on the stability  of Government and the security of this 

country.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Prime Minister.  Yes?  I call on the Honourable Member for 

Muri Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  rise  with  the  intention  of  invoking 

Standing Order 86.  Before I do so Mr Speaker, may I take this opportunity, seeing this is 

</span><span>my  first  time  to  speak  since  you  were  installed  with  the  honourable  position  of  the 

</span><span>Speaker  of  the  House,  to  congratulate  you.    In  my  view,  Mr  Speaker,  the  Government 

could  not  have  appointed  a  more  honourable  person  and  a  more  capable  person  to  that 

highest office in the country.  Not to say that there is nobody else as capable of carrying 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>184 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the position.  You, yourself Mr Speaker, I am confident has the mana and capability and 

prestige to carry on this most honourable position. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  short  time  you  have  sat  in  the  Chair  you  have  already  demonstrated  those 

capabilities.  To your wife and family, my congratulations. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  the  seriousness  and  importance  of  the  issues  raised  in  both  Ministerial 

Statements  compelled  me  to  move  that  both  statements  be  printed.  Both  Statements  be 

tabled in order that the Members of the House have the opportunity to express their views 

on the issues raised.  Mr Speaker when the opportunity presents itself I myself will speak 

on the statements because I want to express my full support of the Deputy Prime Minister 

and the Prime Minister respectively.  Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Statements be Printed and Tabled 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Do I have a Seconder to the Motion?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Mii Parima Member for Tamarua. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
