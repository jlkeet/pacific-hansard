<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Interrupted debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,581,176 for Education stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The last Member speaking was the Minister of Finance and you have eight more minutes 

to go on your first speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you  on  this  beautiful 

morning.    Kia  Orana  to  the  staff  of  this  House  and  to  all  Honourable  Members  of  this 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman I only have time to give my Greetings.  Now I would like to speak on the 

Ministry of Education.  As the Minister of Education explained yesterday, this Vote Item 

we are discussing is for Rarotonga alone but there are certain areas where the Ministry in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>185 

</span></div><div><span>Rarotonga will have a link to the Outer Islands.  These areas if I remember correctly are 

concerned  with  setting  up  of  Curriculum,  Policy  Advice,  Development  of  teachers  by 

way  of  Training  and  ensuring  they  are  up  to  a  sufficient  standard  to  teach  our  children 

and for the Provision of Quality Audit.  It appears from those areas that the responsibility 

of looking after our schools in the Outer Islands are vested with the Ministry of the Outer 

Island Development.  But let me repeat. Even though the responsibility of overseeing the 

Education  in  the  Outer  Islands  is  vested  in  the Ministry  of  Outer  Islands  Development, 

the  fact  remains  the  monitoring  of  standards  to  ensure  that  the  same  standards  of 

Education  for  everybody  in  Rarotonga  is  also  available  in  the  Outer  Islands  -  remains 

with the Ministry of Education in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Even  now  Mr  Chairman  there  are  frequent  visits  made  to  the  Outer  Islands  by  certain 

officials from the Education Ministry, these officials being Inspectors.  In the old system 

they were called Inspectors.  They still continue to travel to the Outer Islands to ensure 

that  the  Outer  Islands  conform  to  Government  policy  as  outlined  by  the  Education 

Ministry  over  here.    So  even  though  the  Education  in  the  Outer  Islands  appears  to  be 

independent it is not totally independent.  There is a very good reason Mr Chairman for 

devolving  some  of  the  responsibilities  of  the  schools  and  other  Ministries  to  the  Outer 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I think you will recall Mr Chairman that about eight or ten years ago there was a 

report  recommending  the  Outer  Islands  to  have  more  say  in  the  Education  of  their 

children.  If  I  remember  correctly,  the  intention  was  to  form  School  Committees  in  the 

Outer  Islands  to  enable  the  parents  to  have  more  say  in  how  their  children  are  to  be 

educated.    That  is  how  the  devolution  of  the  Education  Ministry  to  the  Outer  Islands 

authorities arose.  That was not the only reason Mr Chairman.  One other reason was to 

allow a budget allocated to a school in the Outer Islands to be utilised by that particular 

island.  We know that in the past the entire Education Vote used to be lumped under one 

Education Vote for the whole of the Cook Islands and administered from Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Your second speech Honourable Minister, please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Yes in the past there used to be one lump 

</span><span>sum  for  all  the  Education  Vote  administered  from  Rarotonga.    There  were  not  any 

</span><span>specific allocations for each island.  So each island did not know what sort of money is 

available  for  them  to  utilise  for  their  Education.    So  it  was  easy  for  the  Ministry  in 

Rarotonga if they have a shortfall in a particular year to use the money that would have 

gone to help the schools in the Outer Islands  - to be used here to  cover their shortfalls.  

The  sad  part  is  when  each  island  sees  a  figure  in  the  Estimate  allocated  for  certain 

activities in the Outer Islands, when they come to utilising it, they suddenly find there is 

no money available.  It has been spent somewhere else. 

</span></div><div><span>And secondly, because the Head of each section in the Outer Islands is responsible to the 

</span><span>Head of a Ministry in Rarotonga, they didn’t care what happened in that particular island.  

</span><span>For example, if a parent has any complaint he goes </span><span>to the teacher.  The teacher doesn’t 

</span><span>take  any  notice  of  him  because  his  boss  is  in  Rarotonga.    If  any  matters  of  discipline  

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>186 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>developed, disciplinary measures could not be conducted on a particular island.  It had to 

be  referred  back  to  Rarotonga.    For  example,  if  a  teacher  goes  to  school  and  signs  his 

name  and  goes  home  he  cannot  be  disciplined  on  the  island  because  his  boss  is  on 

Rarotonga.  If the person responsible for disciplinary action goes up to him and says you 

only  worked  for  one  hour,  that  culpri</span><span>t  can  say,  ‘you’re  not  my  boss,  you  can’t  tell  me 

what  to  do”.    In  the  old  days  when  the  GR  was  the  agent  of  the  Public  Service 

</span><span>Commission in the Outer Islands, he was the person responsible for disciplining all public 

servants.  Unfortunately, he has no jurisdiction over permanent staff.  He has no power to 

sack public servants.  All he can do under the law at the time was to prepare reports, send 

it to the head of that Ministry and to the Public Service Commission.  Sometimes it used 

to take about two years to reach a decision on the report made by the GR.  Meanwhile, 

the  culprit  is  continuing  to  offend.    The  only  area  where  the  GR  had  some  power  was 

with  regard  to  wage  workers  because  the  GR  was  responsible  for  certifying  the  pay  of 

weekly workers.  So if a weekly worker does not go to work on that day, the GR had the 

power  to  dock  his  pay.    Whereas  being  a  permanent  staff,  his  pay  was  prepared  in 

Rarotonga. So the GR on each island did not have any responsibility over his pay.  As a 

result,  if  permanent  staff  offended  there  is  no  way  he  could  be  disciplined  by  the  GR 

except if a recommendation comes from Rarotonga to do so. 

</span></div><div><span>So now when the overseeing of the Public Service is handled on each island there is room 

to discipline. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Sorry  Minister,  </span><span>I  am  just  checking  how  many  times  you’ve  been 

</span><span>speaking.  This is your third speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Mr  Chairman,  I  thought  I  had  better 

explain because listening to the Member for Mauke yesterday he seemed to want the old 

system  </span><span>brought  back.    I  am  not  surprised  it’s  not  working  in  Mauke  because  if  I 

</span><span>remember correctly that is one of the islands who did not support the move to devolve.  

</span><span>Yes,  Mr  Chairman,  and  I  am  not  saying  that  the  devolution  that’s  not  working  on  an 

</span><span>island should be abolished.  But those islands that are working well under the reform of 

the devolution should not be penalised for the sake of those that are not working.  So if 

</span><span>those islands who don’t agree with devolution and want to be controlled from Rarotonga, 

</span><span>I say to them you are free to do so. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>But don’t touch those islands that are happy under the new system. 

</span><span>I know that now I am no longer the Minister of Outer Islands Development and my good 

friend, the Minister, Tepure Tapaitau is the new Minister of Outer Islands Development.  

</span><span>But I have a responsibility for controlling their budget and if they prove they can’t handle 

</span><span>their function properly, handle their Budget properly, it is easy for me to transfer the lot 

</span><span>to Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, in my Budget Statement I mentioned the possibility of conducting a review 

of the Health and Education Ministry. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>187 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Oh, excellent.  Excellent.  25 per cent would be nice. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  To ensure the use of the amount of money we are allocating these 

two  Ministries  because  if  all  the  Members  study  the  Budget  carefully  you  will  find  the 

bulk of our allocation is directed at these two Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>The idea of the review is to determine whether we are getting value for money. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  this  is  no  reflection  on  the  two  Ministers  who  are  now  handling  those 

portfolios.    The  idea  of  the  review  was  brought  up  to  determine  whether  the  reform  is 

functioning or not.  But I want to tell you, Mr Chairman, it is only fair that the two new 

Ministers be given an opportunity to look into the functions of their respective Ministries 

before a review is to take place.  I would like to tell the House that I think the review is 

warranted for all Ministers to determine the effect of the reform on their activities. 

</span></div><div><span>As you may recall, Mr Chairman, when the reform took place the reduction in the Public 

Service was based on what is happening outside of our country.  In fact, it was based on 

what  was  happening  in  developing  countries.    According  to  the  consultant  at  the  time 

there was one public servant per 100,000 population.  Therefore the same condition must 

apply to the Cook Islands.  In actual fact, Mr Chairman, I think the thinking at the time 

was  based  on  what  was  happening  in  Kiribati.    I  think  over  there,  there  is  one  public 

servant  per  1,000  or  10,000  population.    So  the  idea  was  to  base  the  reduction  of  our 

public service according to the model of Kiribati. 

</span></div><div><span>Unfortunately the situation in Kiribati is totally different from what is happening in the 

</span><span>Cook Islands.  For example, I don’t know I haven’t been there, but what I have been told 

</span><span>is  in  Kiribati,  even  though  they  have  other  islands  do  not  have  certain  services  in  their 

Outer Islands.  For example, Mr Chairman, they do not have Education or Health services 

</span><span>in  their  Outer  Islands,  I  believe  it’s  only  on  the  mainland.    But  in  the  Cook  Islands  all 

</span><span>those  services  are  duplicated  in  the  Outer  Islands.    So  the  set  up  over  here  is  totally 

different from Kiribati. In my view, the review should go out to determine the minimum 

number of public servants to carry out the essential services of Government.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Minister.  Your time is up.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Honourable Member for Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:</span><span> Greetings to you Chairman. And Greetings to the Clerk, my first time to 

congratulate you and your staff.  Greetings to the Prime Minister, Deputy and Ministers 

on the other Side.   Greetings also to our Leader, and the Opposition Deputy.  To our two 

lady Members of Parliament, Kia Orana.  Only  the DAP can produce this.   Also to the 

solid  Coalition  Members,  Honourable  Tom  Marsters  and  Tangata  Vavia  from  Mitiaro, 

</span><span>Kia Orana.  And Greetings also to the people listening to this programme this morning. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  to  speak  on  the  Education  Appropriation  Bill  this  morning.    Just  listening  to  the 

Minister of Finance, it seems to me that everything has been going smoothly over the last 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>188 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>few  years.    But  I  can  tell  you  that  Education  has  been  a  very  heavily  debated  subject 

amongst the people of this country for many years.   

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  carry  on  I  would  like  to  greet  all  the  school  children  and  the  teachers  of  this 

country listening today.  I know that Education has been a major concern to you for the 

last few years when the previous Government was in administration. The schools around 

the country have been put on hold in development. In terms of books, pens, papers, chairs 

and  tables  for  the  children  and  the  building  repairs.  From  what  I  understand  there  has 

been  very  little  improvement  done.    At  least  the  Coalition  Government  has  done 

something as a start.   

</span></div><div><span>I want to tell  you about  the Arorangi School because I represent them in Parliament.  I 

have  seen  the  pre-schoolers  of  Arorangi.    They  sit  on  the  floor,  their  classroom  has  no 

louvres and the door is rotten. The teachers who are working are not well rewarded for 

their services and we understand their working conditions have not had any consideration 

for a long time.  As a result some of the children are sent home sick and the teachers had 

to  take  days  off  from  school  because  of  sickness.  Due  to  the  low  salaries  some  of  the 

teachers have left the country to seek better remuneration. If the Minister responsible says 

that there is no money, I would humbly ask you to please consider this issue.  Because I 

</span><span>can see that $120,000 has been budgeted for support services for your office. I don’t want 

to talk about the D.P.M’s one. We all know this matter, including all the Members in this 

</span><span>Coalition  Government.  I  understand  that  in  your  capital  expenses  you  want  twelve 

computers and three copiers.  I think Arorangi School is ready for one computer and one 

photocopy machine.  I will ask you to please look into the classrooms and the playground 

for the pre-school.  I support the Budget because you have  been allocated $500,000 for 

your  Budget  for  the  next  financial  year.    So  I  ask  that  some  of  this  money  be  given  to 

Arorangi School.    

</span></div><div><span>I will not dwell on the article regarding the Deputy Prime Minister.  It is not my business.  

I think it is between him and the Press.  I think this is unfair that it has been published in 

the paper. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE</span><span>:  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO</span><span>: It could happen to any one of us.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  regarding  the  classrooms  in  Arorangi.  The  parents  have  worked  hard  to 

fundraise for our school. I know they have waited a long time to receive assistance from 

Government  but  they  have  been  forgotten,  because  too  much  time  was  spent  on  the 

Sheraton. Today the bulk of our revenue has gone to pay the interest on this outstanding 

loan.   

</span></div><div><span>(INTERJECTION - </span><span>Government Members asking “What interest?”)</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:</span><span>The Government Members are asking “How much interest?” If we were 

</span><span>to  count  we would end up in  the millions  of dollars.   I feel  sorry  for the parents  of the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>189 

</span></div><div><span>Arorangi School. They work hard, earn their money, pay their taxes and the balance they 

take home.  And then the Government still wants some more to purchase timber to repair 

the schools.  So the parents are calling on Government not to rely on them all the time.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your second speech, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  TAIO</span><span>:  If  we  want  our  children  to  have  a  good  future  we  in  this  Parliament, 

cannot turn our backs on them.  These children are our future.  They are the future leaders 

of this country.  At home, we keep our children warm, but when we send them to school, 

they suffer under these conditions which I have just mentioned before.  No windows, no 

louvres and no maintenance. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>I  must  interrupt.  Honourable  Member,  I  must  interrupt  you.    It  is 

time to stop.  This Sitting is suspended until 12 noon. 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED AT 11.30 a.m.</span></div><div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>I call on the Honourable Member for Akaoa to continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  TAIO:  </span><span>I  now  come  to  our  students  in  the  Colleges.  I  humbly  request  them  to 

work  hard.  Sooner  or  later,  they  will  have  to  go  out  and  work  or  go  on  for  further 

Education.  There are things that they need to look at.  For example, there is a need for 

skippers  and  engineers  on  boats.    We  do  not  have  that  kind  of  people  around.    We  are 

also  looking  at  deep-sea  fishing.  The  captain  of  such  boats  needs  to  be  qualified.  

Relevant  training  will  require  more  than  a  year.  They  might  take  three  to  five  years 

before  you  are  qualified.    I  would  appeal  to  them  to  make  careful  consideration  before 

choosing  any  career.    They  should  take  these  matters  into  consideration  when  deciding 

their careers. 

</span></div><div><span>Speaking  about  Private  Schools.    I  have  heard  the  Member  for  Matavera  talking  about 

</span><span>subsidies for these schools.  As he said, children attending these Private Schools are not 

only Catholic children. They come from a cross section of our community. Therefore Mr 

Minister I strongly support the view aired by the Honourable Member and I would also 

request that you take this matter into serious consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>With  regard  to  teachers  in  Arorangi.    Their  request  to  me  is  for  the  Minister  to  please 

look  into  their  dilemma.  They  are  inviting  you  to  speed  up  the  second  phase  of  the 

recommendations for the schools because these teachers are looking forward to have an 

</span><span>increase to their salaries.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>190 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Before I finish my speech this morning I would like to give some words of condolences 

to the family who are grieving today. To Teau Samuel, Mapu Taia from Mauke, and the 

Members of Parliament join me in extending to the family our warmest sympathy. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

The Honourable Member for Avatiu/Ruatonga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS: </span><span>Mr Chairman Greetings to you, to the Clerk and the interpreters. 

Greetings to the Leader of the Opposition and Members of the Opposition.  Greetings to 

the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Members  in  the 

Coalition Government.  Special Greetings to the Honourable Minister Jim Marurai.   

</span></div><div><span>If  we look  back at  the history of this Ministry  Education is  one of the most difficult  to 

improve and one of those highly  criticised. We saw the teachers protesting on the  road 

about their salaries. The biggest problem was the reduction of their salaries.  The country 

went into the reform due to the economic crisis. I support the allocations for the Ministry 

of Education.  I am happy with the particular allocations such as the training programme 

for new teachers.  I will not prolong my views on the Education Vote.  We have heard the 

teachers coming on TV complaining about the buildings which are in disrepair. I believe 

this  can  be  rectified  today.    We  have  seen  the  teachers  at  one  time  leading  a  protest 

calling  for  an  increase  in  salary.    We  know  what  the  Minister  of  the  time  did  and  as  a 

result, </span><span>we haven’t had any marches from the Teachers. We now have a new Minister of 

the Ministry I support him. I would like to encourage him to work hard.  I don’t want a 

</span><span>repeat of what happened to the previous Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>Some  Members  have  spoken  regarding  Private  Schools,  especially  the  St  Josephs, 

Nukutere and the Seventh Day Adventists.  We had requests for Government to subsidise 

this school.  We must bear in mind that Government pays some teachers in these schools.  

Nevertheless, Government should support these schools because these schools are raising 

fund to  support themselves.  Today the St  Joseph School  is  having a Gala Day to  raise 

funds projects for the school.  The other schools around Rarotonga are also fund raising. I 

support  the  allocation  for  the  schools  in  Rarotonga,  and  further  requests  the  Minister 

responsible to please ensure that the needs of our school students are well catered for. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  The  Honourable  Member  for 

Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman  Greetings  to  us  all  this  afternoon.    To  all  Honourable 

Members in the Chamber, Greetings to you all this afternoon.  Greetings to those who are 

not present in the Chamber. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, allow me to congratulate the former Minister who was responsible for the 

</span><span>operation of our schools.  Thank you for work well done.  You have done an excellent job 

</span><span>in  the  past.    Greetings  to  the  Minister  responsible  today.    The  staff  members  of  your 

Ministry are working hard for the benefit of our Education, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>191 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, allow me to give special Greetings to all the teachers who are teaching our 

children  at  school.    To  our  children,  study  hard.  You  will  be  the  future  leaders  of  our 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday  we  were  talking  about  economic  development  and  the  Development 

Investment Board appropriation.  Today it is my view that when we talk about Education 

we are talking about the social investment of the country.  We are investing in the future 

of this country when we talk about Education.  In this investment, the two most important 

elements I can see are the teachers and the students.   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  happy  to  see  Mr  Chairman  in  the  percentage  increase  in  the  budget  this  year,  a 

percentage  of  16%.    Part  of  that  increase  is  for  the  implementation  of  Phase  Two,  the 

increas</span><span>e of the teachers’ salaries.</span></div><div><span>As we all know, Mr Chairman, Teaching is a profession.  It is not a job.  It is a profession 

and  all  of  us,  Mr  Chairman,  in  this  House  are  a  product  of  that  investment  which 

happened so many years ago. 

</span></div><div><span>When I look at the Budget, Mr Chairman compared to last year I am glad to see that there 

is  an increase of 16 per  cent  in  the  allocation of  the Education  Budget  which is  almost 

$500,000.  Therefore, Mr Chairman, I support the allocation of Education.  However, Mr 

Chairman,  as  stated  by  the  Finance  Minister  the  allocation  of  Education  for  the  Outer 

</span><span>Islands. Sorry……, if I may say this, the Sister Islands of the Cook Islands is not included 

in  this  $3.5  million.    I  managed  to  get  hold  of  the  Ministry  of  “Sister”  Islands 

</span><span>Development budget and if we look at the Output 10, 11 and 12, there is a total of $12.6 

</span><span>million allocated to Education for the “Sister” islands.  In actual fact Mr Chairman, the 

</span><span>total allocation of our budget of our own money towards the Education of this country for 

this year is actually $6.1 million. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  apart  from  the  $6.1  million  from  our  budget,  there’s  also  the  allocation 

</span><span>from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  of  $1.6  million  that  will  be  invested  into  the 

Education of this country this year.  Therefore, a total of $7.7 million will be spent on the 

Education of the children of our country.  The Financial Secretary, Mr Kevin  Carr, has 

</span><span>confirmed these figures by the way, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>However,  if  we  look  at  the  total  Budget  allocation  compared  with  the  total  money  that 

will be spent, a 10.7 per cent of our total budget will be allocated towards the Education 

of our children this  year.  Even though, Mr Chairman, that $3.5 million, in the view of 

Honourable Members, will be for Rarotonga, I can see in the activities of the Education 

</span><span>Ministry that the “Sister” islands will also benefit from this allocation.  For example, Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, the allocation of $176,000 for Curriculum Development  in  the Education  -  I 

</span><span>believe, will also benefit the “sister” islands.</span></div><div><span>At  the  same  time  in  the  activities  of  No.2,  the  Teachers  Development,  an  allocation  of 

</span><span>$373,000  I  am  sure  the  “sister”  islands  will  benefit  from  that  as  well.    Likewise,  to 

</span><span>Quality Audit, School Programmes and Policy.

</span></div><div><span>An  interesting  factor,  Mr  Chairman,  is  that  when  we  look  at  the  total  allocation  of  the 

</span><span>Education Budget for the “sister” islands, we will find that of the total budget going to the 

“sister” islands, 3.2 per cent of that will go towards Education.  Sorry, Mr Chairman, can 

</span><span>I correct that please?  It is 31.2 per cent.  So, while the National Budget is giving 10.7 to 

</span><span>the Education of this country, in terms of the “sister” island’s allocation 31.2 per cent will 

</span><span>be allocated towards the Educational activities there. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please continue for your second speech, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I see this as a good allocation 

</span><span>in terms of the “sister” islands, especially the budget of 31.2 per cent.  However, it is my 

</span><span>understanding  that  in  the  devolution  process,  some  islands  would  be  able  to  shift  these 

Education budgets into other areas as they wish.  This is the element of devolution which 

</span><span>I don’t agree with.</span></div><div><span>It is a matter of principle. It is my belief that Health, Education and Justice of this country 

should  be  a  national  concern.    So,  while  I  agree  with  the  principle  of  devolution,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman,  I  feel  if  there  is  an  allocation  for  Health  and  Education,  the  “sister”  islands 

</span><span>Local Government should not be able to tamper with those allocations. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, it is my belief that Education in this country must be equal to Rarotonga.  

And if there is  a need for computer knowledge to be dealt with in Rarotonga, the same 

should  be  available  in  Penrhyn,  Pukapuka,  Rakahanga  and  any  other  island  in  this 

country.  We  should  have  equal  opportunity.  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  support  the 

view that Private Schools should be treated on the same basis.  For the simple reason that 

they  are  Cook  Islanders  and  their  parents  pay  taxes  towards  the  budget  of  the  nation.  

Therefore,  they  should  be  treated  the  same  as  far  as  Education  is  concerned  and  when 

there is any aid of some form that will come to the attention of this country, it should be 

available to the Private Schools as well. 

</span></div><div><span>With that in mind, Mr Chairman, I would like to </span><span>take us back into our history.  Let’s see 

</span><span>who  was  serious  about  this  country  in  terms  of  Education  over  the  last  twenty  years.  

</span><span>With  respect,  Mr  Chairman,  I  have  looked  at  the  ten  years  that  the  Democratic  Party 

</span><span>governed  this  nation.    They  gave  an  allocation,  a  total  of  $37.5  million  towards  the 

Education of this country and the highest they gave to this nation was $5.3 million in the 

1988-89 budget allocation.  The Cook Islands Party in its ten years of Government gave a 

total  of  $67.8  million  to  the  development  of  Education  of  this  country  and  the  highest 

they gave was $10.4 million in 1993-94 allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to clear the air, Mr Chairman that this was the allocation that was provided 

but in terms of the result I will not be able to provide it. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>That’s just it.  You didn’t test it.</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>These  are  the  figures,  Mr  Chairman,  and  figures  don’t  lie  I’m  sorry 

</span><span>Honourable Member.
