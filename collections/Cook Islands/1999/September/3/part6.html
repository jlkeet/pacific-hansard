<div><span>(</span><span>INTERJECTIONS) 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:  </span><span>Maybe  Mr  Chairman,  the  Honourable  Member  can  provide  the 

explanation but this is the way I see it. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> I will. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>  But  the  key  factor  is  Mr  Chairman  that  a  total  of  $67.8  million  was 

allocated  towards  Education  in  the  last  ten  years  and  this  year  from  our  budget  we  are 

giving a total of $6.1 million. T</span><span>hose are the figures.  But let’s look at the reality of the 

</span><span>situation.  We have heard the complaints about the chairs and the school buildings.  As 

such, I tend to ask, where did this money in Education go? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Yes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:  </span><span>If the Honourable Member will have patience,  I was  coming to  that. 

Mr Chairman, despite all these allocations and just recently we had to get aid money to 

help with the Education of this country </span><span>–</span><span> the ADAB loan. 

</span></div><div><span>Sorry the A.D.B. Loan. Therefore, Mr Chairman, that is why I would like to support the 

</span><span>idea  of  the  Finance  Minister  that  there  must  be  some  investigation  or  there’s  got  to  be 

</span><span>some, somebody can help me with the word, a review of the whole Education process in 

the country. That is why I said, I have reservations for the allocation of the Outer Islands- 

</span><span>sorry, to the “sister” islands, </span><span>- with no criteria or no strings attached to make sure that the 

</span><span>money  when  given  for  Education  to  a  “sister”  island,  is  spent  on  Education  and  not 

</span><span>anywhere else. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Chairman, it is my belief that when we spend money on Education it is to 

be  spent  on  teachers  and  the  children.    And  not  transferred  to  the  administration  of  it.  

</span><span>The  teacher  must  be  able  to  feel  that  since  teaching  is  a  profession,  they  don’t  have  to 

</span><span>worry </span><span>about planting; they don’t have to worry about fishing or worry about doing other 

</span><span>commercial activities to help with their home.  But rather that their salary will be enough 

to  sustain  their  life  and  their  family  and  they  will  spend  more  time  at  the  school,  after 

hours, preparing for the Education of our children. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  My view on Education…</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Sorry, your third speech, yes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    My  view  on  Education  is  the  same  that  I 

share  for  Health  and  the  Welfare.    So  finally,  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  ask  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>194 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Finance Minister and Cabinet for a time where there will be another Budget coming into 

the  House.  If  we  are  able  to  come  up  with  more  money  in  the  country,  this  should  be 

diverted towards Education and Health.  That is my request. Not to the Civil List. Those 

are my views, Mr Chairman, and my request, Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I call on the Honourable Member 

for Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>DR. R. WOONTON:</span><span> Good afternoon to  you, Mr Chairman, and to all the Honourable 

Members of the House.  A special Kia Orana to the Prime Minister who has only got, two 

</span><span>–</span><span> four </span><span>–</span><span> six of his Members here.  He should ask the rest of his Government Members to 

get  in  the  House,  and  support  this  Budget.    It  seems  to  me,  Mr  Chairman,  that  the 

Opposition Members are the majority in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  They should be Government! 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>And  should  be  the  Government!    Maybe  the  Prime  Minister  can 

come into this vacant seat over here and then we will be the Government. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank you Mr Chairman, for this opportunity to send my Greetings out to 

people  I  wish  to  take  time  to  greet.  Kia  Orana  also  to  Mr  and  Mrs  Sam  Heather.    My 

condolences to you and the family for the beloved young girl who passed away yesterday, 

they are friends of mine from Arorangi, who live not far from my home. 

</span></div><div><span>With your leave Mr Chairman, I would like to extend a warm greeting to the islands  of 

Penrhyn, Manihiki, Pukapuka and Rakahanga.  I know they are listening to the debate of 

the Budget today because they rang last night.  They have been listening to the debate.  A 

very  special  greetings  to  Papa  Pau,  who  is  in  Tongareva,  and  has  been  listening  to  the 

debate of this House.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I have no difficulty supporting the Vote Item for Education of our children 

in  this  country.    You  yourself  understand  that  the  Port  Folio  of  Education  has  always 

been a contestable one and quite often, a very difficult one at times to administrate.  Our 

</span><span>youth and our children comprise about half of our population.  Even though the amount 

</span><span>in the past has been varied in the allocations from Government, it’s the times that often 

</span><span>dictate  how  much  we  can  spare  to  educate  our  children.    I  fully  support  the  views  of 

previous speakers on Education, that our children are the future of this country.  Where I 

</span><span>am more concerned, Mr Chairman, are the allocations to the Private Schools.  I don’t see 

</span><span>any equality in the use </span><span>of taxpayers’ money to educate those children who are in Private 

</span><span>Schools.  Compare them with those in public schools.  As has been pointed out, and quite 

rightly,  by  the  Honourable  Teina  Bishop  and  several  other  speakers,  these  children  are 

Cook  Islanders  and  they  have  tax  paying  parents.    It  is  our  policy,  the  Democratic 

</span><span>Alliance Party, to  treat  our children  equally  - whether they  are in  Private Schools or in 

</span><span>public  schools.   We  wish  to  extend  to  them  the same  opportunities  as  those  enjoyed  in 

public schools.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>195 

</span></div><div><span>However, I am somewhat a bit concerned with the comparison of the amount of money 

that  has  been  allocated  in  the  previous  ten  years,  or  twenty  years.    While  the  figures 

quoted by the Honourable Teina Bishop maybe correct, he has not put in the increase in 

costs.    As  a  businessman,  he  should  understand  this.    I  am  talking  here,  Mr  Chairman, 

about inflation.  There are teachers in this House who were paid Two Pounds a month.  If 

you are going to state figures that has been allocated to Education in the past years then 

we should qualify our statement by adjusting the cost of living, the inflation rate.  Then 

</span><span>the  amount  is  no  different  from  what  it  was  twenty  years’  ago  to  what  it  is  today.  

</span><span>Because  what  might  seem  a  lot  of  money  at  Two  Pounds  a  month  th</span><span>irty  years’  ago,  is 

nothing, compared to today.  You can’t buy anything with it today.  The figures he quoted 

may seem small for those ten years, twenty years’ ago, but we have to look at what that 

</span><span>amount achieved.  As he rightly pointed out, we are the products of our investment in our 

Education.    A  good  example  is  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  today.  That  has  been  an 

investment by the Democratic Government at that time to get his law degree. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  Together  with  the  Minister  of  Outer  Islands  Affairs,  the 

Honourable  Tepure  Tapaitau,  a  product  of  the  investment  done  by  the  Democratic 

Government.    The  Honourable  Tupou  Faireka,  likewise  was  invested  in  by  the 

Democratic Alliance Party.  Maybe the Honourable Teina Bishop will correct me if I say, 

he  was  too  one  of  the  investment  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party.    The  Honourable 

Member  is  indicating  that  I  was  correct.    But  let  me  tell  you  Dr  Woonton  was  not  the 

investment of the Democratic Party.  It was an investment of Papa Ar</span><span>apati’s time and the 

</span><span>Prime Minister of today, Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Please carry on with your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>So maybe I should be on that side and you people should be on this 

side.    Mr  Chairman  in  all  seriousness  both  Governments  have  invested  seriously  in  the 

</span><span>Education of our people.  Let’s not go back and open old cupboards.  Let us look forward 

</span><span>and see what we can do for our present children.  At the same time recognising the future 

contribution  the  parents  of  our  children  can  give  to  improve  the  school  buildings  and 

</span><span>grounds for the general Education of the children. 

</span></div><div><span>I  support  the  vote  item  for  Education.    I  know  we  all  want  to  have  millions  of  dollars 

poured in but it is what the country can afford.  Quite often parents think the Education 

Ministry should be totally in control of the Education of our children.  Helping our own 

children at home also augment their Education.  I sympathise with a lot of schools, even 

my school in Manihiki.  I know there have been some prospects to rebuild those schools.  

As  I  said  nothing  positive  is  happening.    The  standard  of  Education  in  the  northern 

islands  is  somewhat  lower  than  compared  to  Rarotonga  and  the  southern  islands. 

</span><span>Especially  the  availability  of  resource  materials  like  computers,  calculators  and  library 

</span><span>books.  One of the areas I see for Capital Expenditure in this vote item before the House, 

is talked about and that is the purchase of computers.  I would urge Minister, to increase 

the  number  of  computers  for  purchase  because  if  our  children  are  not  familiar  with  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>196 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>use  of  computers  they  will  be  left  behind.    I  know  computer  can  widen  their  scope  of 

Education.  Maybe the schools should be extended free time on the Internet.  For those of 

us who are not familiar with the use of the Internet channels we can bring the world into 

our  house  or  school  rather  than  you  go  to  the  world.    In  fact  the  use  of  Internet  is  like 

looking  out  of  a  huge  window  to  the  rest  of  the  world  from  your  house.    The  Deputy 

Prime Minister last week mentioned about investing in our knowledge economy.  This is 

a  step  we  should  seriously  consider  and  introduce  in  this  country  -  to  invest  in  a 

knowledge economy.  Perhaps we should look at bringing back our trade schools as well.   

</span></div><div><span>Whatever  number  of  children,  we  have  only  a  small  percent  who  will  become 

professionals.    The  greater  percent  will  be  tradesmen.    I  am  talking  about  engineers, 

refrigeration  technicians;  you  name  it,  all the  trades  people.    Yesterday  the  Honourable 

Tapi Taio had to borrow two policemen to navigate his ship because we do not have any 

schools to teach our children how to navigate.  Mr Tua Pittman and Paiau Pirake are the 

only  qualified  skippers  in  this  country.  We  are  surrounded  by  93,000  square  miles  of 

ocean and yet we have only one qualified Cook Island Ocean going captain. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    The  Honourable  Deputy  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:    </span><span>Mr  Chairman  I  stand  in  support  of  this  vote  allocation.    I  also 

applaud the quality of the debate presented to us in this House, first by the Deputy Leader 

of the Opposition and by the Opposition team in the last few days.  It is wonderful to be 

able to listen to sensible presentations, solid arguments based on facts and it makes you 

want to listen.  Whereas if it if based on cheap unthinking political drama we hear from 

day to day nobody will bother to listen.  Indeed having listened to some of the arguments 

</span><span>put forward by the Opposition it helps us to put our thoughts together and this is what it’s 

</span><span>all about.  To receive quality communication in this House is very very helpful.  I guess 

</span><span>one can say from time to time we can have our political fun but the rest of the time let’s 

</span><span>be serious to see how we can best work for and serve our nation.  I am glad the Deputy 

Leader of the Opposition highlighted the important and late arrival of the concept called 

knowledge economy.  The knowledge economy is an area that relates to information and 

communications.    It  is  concentrated  around  technology  and  represented  by  computers, 

</span><span>represented by the Internet system, represented by television, by telephones as we have at 

</span><span>the present time. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Voice-mail, E-mail, everything else. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>It’s  a  difficult  area  to  define  but  it  covers  the  silicone  chips,  i</span><span>t 

covers the computer system.  So advanced is the computer technology, the sophisticated 

research that today nobody can say that they can have exclusive privacy because at any 

moment  a  satellite  can  beam  a  picture  right  in  here  and  listen  in  to  the  debate  from 

</span><span>Washington DC. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>Yes that’s right.</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>197 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    They  can  get  a  picture  of  you  at  home  in  your  office,  in  your 

bedroom, anywhere.  Such is the advance of technology that nothing is sacred any more.  

So it is a wise decision for a country to gear itself into this modern knowledge economy.  

We  have  to,  otherwise  we  will  be  left  completely  behind  and  the  clear  example  is 

America.  Today it leads the world in this technology. 

</span></div><div><span>The richest man in the world today is Bill Gates.  Bill Gates will be the first trillioneer in 

the world with the amount of money he is making from computers.  It is  all out of this 

knowledge economy, out of the computer software system, it is so massive.  This industry 

is so massive.  In America the two leading traditional parts of the economy are the Auto 

Industry  which  is  the  car  and  truck,  and  the  oil.    Those  are  the  two  leading  traditional 

industries in America.  Now the knowledge economy has taken a third place to rival, to 

match  these  two  huge  areas  in  the  American  economic  system.    Today  the  knowledge 

economy has matched these two big areas and they say that in 1989 in America they had 

33 billioneers.  Ten years later in 1999, they now have 137 billionaires in America and 

growing. Their wealth comes from this area, from the knowledge economy.  So Minister 

of Education, this is a challenge.  I would like to suggest that you get a think tank team 

from the Education Ministry to see how we can upgrade our approach to technology, to 

try  and  upgrade  and  treat  it  as  a  matter  of  urgency.    The  teaching  of  information 

technology be increased to a greater pace in our schools. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Your  second  speech  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Please 

carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  I am obliged Mr Chairman.  The time I am sure has also arrived 

</span><span>when  Internet  and  television  should  be  in  the  classrooms,  every  classroom.    That’s 

</span><span>knowledge  technology.    The  time  has  come,  Mr  Minister  of  Education  when  each 

classroom should be equipped with these.  I am sure that the time has come when some 

subjects  should  be  taught  on  the  television  screen.    There  are  television  Education 

programmes  that  I  understand  are  in  storage  that  could  be  easily  utilised  to  follow  a 

standardised  programme.  At  each  hour  of  the  day  between  say  the  hours  of  8  and  9  a 

certain subject would be taught to all Grade 5 students throughout the country.  So they 

</span><span>turn their monitor on at 8 o’clock to 9 a.m. and a particular subject will be taught and the 

</span><span>teacher should be there to answer any questions afterwards.  Then from 9 </span><span>o’clock to 10 

</span><span>o’clock another subject will come on the screen, another class, and another grade.  You 

</span><span>then  get  this  standardised  teaching  programme  that  cannot  fail  to  get  the  information 

across.    So,  if  there  are  any  fears  about  some  teachers  being  up  to  standard  there  is  no 

excuse this time because they are getting taught by experts on the television screen.  This 

could solve the problem of teacher shortage or of quality teaching abilities.  This could 

solve the problem in the Outer Islands where the Education programme is prepared on the 

television  screen.    All  that  needs  to  be  done  is  for  the  pupils  to  follow  a  timetable  of 

teaching screenings and to be tested and examined on these afterwards. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  think  this  country  is  well  known  and  stands  out  amongst  the  South 

Pacific countries in being one of the best educated in the Pacific. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>198 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>In  Government  today,  Mr  Chairman,  we  should  not  be  ashamed  to  say  that  all  our 

Ministers  have  University  Degrees.    There  is  one  Minister  with  a  Bachelor  of 

Engineering,  one  Minister  with  a  Bachelor  of  Medicine,  a  Bachelor  of  Surgery  and  a 

Master of Public Health, there is one with a Master of Arts Degree and two with Bachelor 

of Law Degrees.  This is a clear indication, Mr Chairman, that well educated people are 

leadi</span><span>ng the  country.    But  I am also  pleased to say  that  while some Members’  ability is 

</span><span>judged  by  the  Education  attainment  that  they  have  received,  others  did  not  need  to  go 

through  this  route.  There  are  very  successful  people  in  this  House  on  both  sides  of  the 

House who have made their mark in other areas other than Education. 

</span></div><div><span>I need mention, Mr Chairman, that perhaps the wealthiest Members of Parliament in this 

House are people who do not have Degrees.  So having Education does not necessarily 

lead to wealth because wealth can be attained with or without.  So it is very well for me 

to  say  that  we  are  lucky  in  this  country  to  have  the  type  of  Members  of  Parliament  on 

both  sides  of  the  House  with  a  variation  of  abilities  which  can  only  be  described  as 

outstanding.  So it is in our aim that while we are on this Vote Item, we should ask the 

Minister of Education and his people to give this area of knowledge economy urgency. 

</span></div><div><span>I  need  to  round  up  my  discussion  on  that  particular  point.    If  you  look  at  the  situation 

involving  tele  medicine,  we  have  the  technology  now  where  patients  can  be  examined 

here  in  Rarotonga  with  a  television  camera  while  a  specialist  can  sit  in  Auckland  and 

inspect the patient.  So instead of flying the patient to New Zealand, that patient can be 

examined and diagnosed by somebody looking at the television screen in Auckland and 

advising the local doctor what the problem is.  What is required to be done is to get that 

treatment  done  immediately.    I  believe  surgery  can  also  be  performed  in  this  manner 

where once diagnosed, a programme can then be put on the screen in the surgery room 

where the surgeon can follow the instructions on how to go about the operation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your third speech Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE</span><span>:  Thank you.  So in conclusion let me say that I hope our youngsters 

will realise that Education is one main door to success.  I heard my honourable friend the 

Member for Matavera say the other day that Private Schools needs our support. I concur 

</span><span>with him and I support his sentiments. Therefore, Minister of Education the Member for 

</span><span>Matavera and I am serving notice on you that we expect more money to be channelled to 

Private Schools in the future. Private Schools is our people.  We are lucky in Government 

that the Catholic Church and the SDA Church have taken on their shoulders to have their 

own  schools  and  colleges.    It  is  nevertheless  our  responsibility  to  help  them  because  if 

they were not doing it the Government, the State will end up having to do it themselves.  

I  am  sure  the  Member  for  Matavera  will  be  comforted  to  know  that  the  Minister  for 

Education is from the New Alliance Party and helping the Private Schools is one of the 

most prominent issues that the New Alliance Party Manifesto campaigned with in the last 

</span><span>Elections.  Who knows, we might be able to get him to highjack some of the money into 

</span><span>the Private Schools.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>199 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  want  to  take  this  opportunity  Mr  Chairman,  to  compliment  the  schools  on 

Rarotonga.    From  the  Secondary  Schools  to  the  Primary  Schools,  for  their  magnificent 

performance  during  the  Constitution  Day  Celebrations. 

  The  richness  of  their 

performances,  the  quality,  the  costumes,  their  ability,  their  dancing  and  singing  was  so 

magnificent  that  it  was  really  memorable.    As  mentioned  earlier  in  this  House  the 

Auditorium  was  booked  out.    There  were  massive  crowds  left  outside  during  these 

performances.  It is the biggest event of the year.  My only regret is they were not able to 

repeat it a few nights later.  It is mindful for us to rely on the schools to give us this kind 

of  impact.    You  know  the  Constitution  celebrations  should  be  the  most  important,  the 

most  emotional,  the  most  patriotic  events  throughout  the  year.    That  one  occasion,  the 

Constitution week, should be utilised to bring everyone together.  I am hoping that once 

the Pukapuka By-election is out of the way, next year we get together. Both sides of the 

House,  together  with  our  Ui  Ariki  and  Koutu  Nui  and  plan  the  next  Constitution 

Celebrations  carefully  so  that  it  is  a  uniting  event.    Rather  than  </span><span>the  divided  that  we’ve 

suffered  over  the  last  few  years.    Let’s  hope  that  the  next  one  will  be  a  truly  patriotic 

event where there will be no disagreements.  Let’s not move into what they used to have 

in  New  Zealand  on  Waitangi  Day.    Let’s  do  the  opposite.</span><span>    Let  us  have  our  differences 

before  that  and  after  that.    Let  us  remain  to  disagree  on  major  issues,  but  on  that  one 

occasion,  during  that  particular  week  let  us  put  everything  aside  and  make  peace.  Be 

happy with one another and give that opportunity to our nation.  To treasure it. To love it 

and to caress it.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman I support the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that trade 

schools  should  be  re-introduced.    Trade  and  technical  training  was  done  successfully 

when we were Government.  Goodness knows what happened to it after we left Office.  

And now one half of that old Government is back in power and I would like to do my part 

to revive this trade and technical training school as soon as possible.  I would like to see 

the Public Works buildings that are lying idle in Arorangi to be renovated and used for 

these trade training courses.   

</span></div><div><span>My final message while we are on the subject of Education is for me to say to our young 

</span><span>people, please steer away from drinks and drugs.  Don’t blow you</span><span>r brains away by using 

all  these  drugs  because  a  knowledge  economy  needs  your  brains  to  be  functioning  a 

</span><span>hundred percent in order to make big money in the computer age.  I also congratulate the 

</span><span>Prime Minister Dr Joseph Williams for asking Mr Don McKinnon on his recent visit to 

increase the scholarship  allocation by the New Zealand Government. That has been put 

into immediate effect.  Thank you Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>Thank you Deputy…..</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman  that  concludes  my  speech  on  the  Education  Vote

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. Greetings to you and your staff and 

to  our  people  listening  in,  good  afternoon.    Mr  Chairman,  we  heard  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister and Prime Minister read their Ministerial Statements before us.  I am sad to hear 

that their lives have been threatened in their own homes.  I do not think this is something 

good and I would like to ask those responsible to forget about it.  I was surprised to hear 

about this and as Leader of the Opposition in this House, I want to tell our people that this 

is not part of our culture.  This is foreign to us.  I believe that we are a Christian nation 

and we are being told time and time again in all the denominations in our country that we 

should  love  one  another.    We  should  not  let  events  that  happen  outside  our  country 

happen in our country.  I do not believe this is a good thing where you are afraid to live in 

your own home and in your own country for that matter.  This is why I am saying to our 

people  to  forget  about  these  things.    There  is  a  time  and  a  place  for  such  things.    My 

concern is for what these Ministers told us earlier today.  I heard them say that the lives 

of their families have been threatened as well.  I am very much concerned.  As to the rest 

of the statement they made, a motion has already been moved by the Honourable Member 

Tom Marsters and that can be deliberated at the appropriate time.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to  give special Greetings to  the Minister of Education the Honourable Jim 

Marurai and to all the schools throughout Raroton</span><span>ga. My understanding is that we’re on 

</span><span>the Education budget for the schools on Rarotonga.  However I think the curriculum and 

syllabus  does  extend  to  the  needs  of  the  Outer  Islands.    I  would  like  to  mention  an 

observation  that  I  have  recently  read  from  a  report  by  Tau  Henare  in  the  New  Zealand 

Parliament.  This refers to the people of the Pacific in New Zealand.  There is particular 

mention about the standard of achievement of Pacific people in New Zealand including 

the Education level of the people of the Pacific, including Cook Islanders living in New 

Zealand.    The  achievement  level  is  low  and  the  Education  level  of  course  is  low.    My 

own feeling is that we could as Cook Islanders in this country, follow the same trend if 

we are not  careful, if we are not  going to  wake  up to  the dilapidated school  system  we 

have today.  In the past the investment into Education is very small compared to what we 

invest in later years but what is most important to me Mr Chairman is the sacrifice and 

dedication of our people, the teachers and parents. It is so high.  When we go back and 

look at the achievements in those days we will find we have very high achievements. 

</span></div><div><span>I  think  there  are  so  many  factors  that  we  have  to  look  at.  We  did  not  only  have  the 

sacrifice by teachers but also the sacrifices by parents.  Also I think a lot has to do with 

the system of the school in those days compared to today.  Whereas corporal punishment 

was a day to day disciplinary tool in all the schools when we were at school, today it is 

against the law.  When you have a job as a teacher in those days you considered yourself 

lucky. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>This is your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Today  Mr  Chairman,  it  does  not 

matter.    You  could  be  part  of  the  Teacher  recruitment  programme.    You  get  your 

certificate and if somebody offer you another job in another Ministry, it is easy for you to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>201 

</span></div><div><span>move  on.    I  was  actually  a  student  teacher  for  one  year  before  I  was  sent  to  Medical 

School.  I considered myself one of the lucky ones in those days even to earn two pounds 

a month. Although there is a need to increase the salaries of the Teachers there is also this 

element that is important in the school system.  When I look at this report that deals with 

the education of our people in New Zealand in relation to our situation here there is no 

doubt  there  has  got  to  be  dedication  and  sacrifice  from  the  parents  as  well.  In  New 

Zealand  children  leave  school  early  in  order  to  go  out  and  earn  money  for  the  family.  

Even  students  who  could  have  gone  to  secondary  or  tertiary  Education  to  achieve  a 

degree.    There  is  an  obstacle,  they  need  money  and  so  they  go  to  work  instead  of 

attending tertiary Education.  We are no different in the Cook Islands today.  There are 

people who have two jobs,  even three jobs.   They  could  have two jobs  plus  planting at 

home.  I am sure I can say there are parents who are lucky to earn money in order to pay 

their power bills, telephone bills and loan. They forget that they have a responsibility to 

make sure their children are at least going to school and doing their homework.  They are 

obliged to  encourage them  to  read their books.  Mr Chairman, many  years ago we were 

getting good value for our small investment in Education, today there is so much invested 

in  our  Education  system.    I  am  asking,  are  we  getting  value  for  our  money  in  our 

Education  system  today?    I  think  about  two  or  three  years  ago  there  was  a  drop  in  the 

achievement of U.E. exams. 

</span></div><div><span>And  I remember standing up in  this Parliament  and  giving my  view on  that  - a sign of 

decline in our Education system in this country.  We have got to have indicators in our 

school  system  to  show  us  that  we  are  either  progressing  or  going  backwards.    I  totally 

agree with the view that our school Education system should be reviewed. I would like to 

demand that these indicators show whether there has been a decline in the achievement of 

</span><span>UE’s and School Certificates.  We must know exactly what our position is because some 

</span><span>times we get carried away aiming high and then we forget the basics.  Although I totally 

agree  and  support  the  idea  of  high  technology  Education  to  be  introduced,  at  the  same 

time  we  should  keep  within  our  limited  resources.  We  must  stay  with  the  basics  and 

provide  for  the  priority  areas  before  we  go  on  with  a  more  expensive  and  a  highly 

technical Education system for our children.   

</span></div><div><span>So  I  would  like  to  support  the  Budget  as  indicated  by  other  speakers  because  there  is 

</span><span>definitely an increase with the sum of approximately half a million dollars. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Your last speech, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I don’t have very much else to say 

Mr  Chairman  other  than  to  repeat  that  in  this  Appropriation,  although  it  doesn’t  have 

</span><span>much to say about the Outer Islands, I understand that it touches on the curriculum and 

</span><span>also the teacher recruitment for the “sister” islands. As some of our Members would like 

</span><span>the Outer Islands to be called.  We have as part of our Democratic Alliance Party policy, 

</span><span>Mr Chairman, the </span><span>idea that if the “sister” islands think that they will be able to control the 

</span><span>Curriculum, the Syllabus and even the Recruitment on each of these islands, in our policy 

we would like to see them involved. However, if they were not able to do that, then we 

would like to see this given back to the Ministry of Education on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>202 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Earlier  I  was  listening  to  what  the  Minister  of  Finance  was  saying  with  regard  to  the 

attitude of some of our teachers on the Outer Islands.  As far as I could tell what he was 

saying is that there are some teachers on the Outer Islands who are trying to shirk their 

responsibilities.    They  wanted  to  operate  the  schools  on  the  Outer  Islands  but  their 

employer or their boss is in Rarotonga.  I think, Mr Chairman, in some cases when  the 

boss is either their father, relative or their friend, then I can see a lot of problems. There 

are a lot of teachers, Mr Chairman, and you are aware of this, who is dedicated to their 

work.  Even though their pay has not been increased.  This has never been a problem for 

them Mr Chairman.  The reason for this is because they have always been working, they 

have dedicated their lives to teaching our children and to better the children of our nation.  

The  sad  part,  Mr  Chairman,  is  that  some  people  who  have  aged  and  they  have  gone 

through  all  these  hardships  but  Government  has  never  considered  them.    Even  up  to 

today. We have not been able to look after them well enough as has been suggested by 

some  of  the  speakers  in  the  House.  I  know  the  type  of  life  that  these  people  are  going 

through Mr Chairman because their working life is no different from a doctor or a nurse 

working in the Outer Islands.  These Ministries are so large that it is always very hard for 

any Government to enable that there are enough funds to meet their needs. 

</span></div><div><span>When I was Minister of Education for one year I tried to bring in a new salary scale for 

the Ministry of Education.  And what  I  wanted to do at  the time was to  ask Cabinet to 

look at one Ministry first and then move on to another.  But when I tried to do this every 

other Minister wanted their Ministries to get pay increases, so that initiative was defeated. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> It is time to stop. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>I was only with that portfolio for one year, I left it, and I didn’t 

</span><span>want to go back to it any more. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> It is time to adjourn.  I call on the Minister in Charge of the Vote. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. J. MARURAI:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed  to
