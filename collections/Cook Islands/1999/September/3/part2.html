<div><span>PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN took the Chair at 10.00 a.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please  be  seated  Honourable  Members.    I  trust  we  have  heard  the 

message  the  servant  of  God  has  brought  to  us.    Before  I  call  on  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister  and  the  Prime  Minister  to  present  their  Ministerial  Statements  I  would  like  at 

this  time  to  take  this  opportunity  to  offer  words  of  condolence  to  the  family  whose 

daughter Teau Samuel passed away yesterday as a result of a motor accident.  We pass on 

to the parents and grandparents our deepest condolences and may the Lord bless you. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you have the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a Ministerial Statement. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Leave is granted Deputy Prime Minister, please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE: </span><span>To all Honourable Members of the House, to the Prime Minister, to 

Sir  Geoffrey  Henry,  all  Cabinet  Ministers  and  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  the 

Honourable  Dr  Maoate  and  his  Caucus  members,  Kia  Orana.    To  the  Honourable 

Member Tom Marsters and the Honourable Member Tangata Vavia, Kia Orana.  To the 

people of the Cook Islands, Kia Orana and to the bereaved family of Teau Samuel, Kia 

Orana.    As  said  by  the  Speaker,  we  also  endorse  his  statement  of  condolences  to  the 

family.  To the publisher of the Cook Islands News, Kia Orana. To the reporter Florence 

</span><span>Syme Buchanan and  your dear husband Tim Buchanan “</span><span>Kata</span><span>,” Kia Orana.  I hope  you 

</span><span>are having a wonderful time this morning. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker in this morning’s newspaper on the front pag</span><span>e - appeared an article released 

about  my  groundsman  and  housegirl.    Since  the  Civil  List  Act  was  passed  in  1984  the 

</span><span>Deputy Prime Minister has been entitled to employ a groundsman and a housekeeper. 

</span></div><div><span>The Civil List clearly gave the Deputy Prime Minister and his wife the absolute right to 

employ  whoever they  want.    It  does not  spell out  limitations as to  age,  relationships  or 

any descriptions whatsoever.  In the period immediately after the coalition Government 

was formed, I did not make use of this provision.  About five weeks ago - not two months 

ago as Florence Syme Buchanan published, I advised the Clerk that my wife and I wanted 

to award the house keeping duties for a temporary period to our three teen age children.  

These  children  aged  between  15,  16  and  17  have  been  doing  house  work  and  ground 

</span><span>work  for  many  years  and  in  the  period  that  we  are  waiting  to  employ  a  suitable 

</span><span>groundsman and house girl we decided to offer the opportunity as job training discipline 

for them.  This is particularly at the request of my wife who is very meticulous about who 

does the housework as she has suffered abuses from house girls in the past.  We have also 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>180 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>suffered  abuse  from  different  groundsmen  whom  we  have  employed  in  the  past.  

Sometimes they do not show up or they go to where the pig pens are and sleep. There has 

been a lot of stealing from the household.  Five weeks ago, I advised the Clerk to employ 

these three teenage children of ours on a contract basis. During school holidays they will 

be  able  to  work  full  time  and  during  school  they  are  able  to  work  before  school,  four 

hours after school and on weekends - Saturdays and Sundays. 

</span></div><div><span>In  arriving  at  this  recommendation  Mr  Speaker,  we  decided  that  there  are  a  number  of 

reasons for doing so and I would like to itemise these.  Firstly the political situation.  We 

have a by election in Pukapuka which could turn the Government around.  We could see 

a DAP Government in power and therefore immediately that happens I lose this privilege, 

which means we do not have to send our groundsman and house girl packing. We do not 

upset  them  immediately  the  result  comes  out.  With  this  arrangement  they  simply  come 

off the payroll because they are already at home. 

</span></div><div><span>And I have explained to you our past problems with thieving, unreliability and also the 

</span><span>fluctuation  of  workers  where  they  don’t  seem  to  last  very  long.    And  quite  clearly,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, this arrangement is temporary because we are waiting firstly for the Pukapuka 

By-election to be concluded.  We are also waiting for this Budget to be finished before I 

plan to approach Cabinet about a review of this situation. 

</span></div><div><span>This  Statement  has  compelled  me  to  advise  this  House  that  recently  there  has  been  a 

threat against my life and that of the Prime Minister.  I received a number of reports and 

the  most  compelling  one  was  one  person  who  was  approached  to  source  a  killer  from 

Australia to come and shoot me. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  to  describe  a  feeling  where  you  no  longer  feel  safe  in  your  home  is 

something that is very difficult to explain.  So, we have a security scare at my home and 

it  is  my  proposal  that  if  we  continue  to  be  the  Government,  I  would  like  to  approach 

Cabinet and the Executive Council to see about security measures. 

</span></div><div><span>It  could  well  be  that  a  future  groundsman  would  also  act  as  a  security  guard  for  my 

property in which case the pay will have to be a lot better than what we are paying our 

</span><span>present staff at home. 

</span></div><div><span>So that is purely one reason why I feel that what we have done at the present time is just a 

temporary measure to cover the services. Perhaps with the intention to change it later on.  

And  of  course,  Mr  Speaker,  there  is  no  better  person  that  you  can  trust  than  your  own 

family.  So in arriving at this decision, Mr Speaker, I was well aware that there will be 

leaks from Parliament, from the Parliament staff.  Indeed one of the staff went and talked 

about  it  openly  immediately  when  she  found  out.    I  knew  that  was  to  be  expected  but 

</span><span>nevertheless  I  decided  that  the  Civil  List  was  quite  clear  about  the  choice.  So  it  didn’t 

</span><span>bother us that this would happen and maybe I am glad it is out because there is nothing to 

</span><span>hide.  And Mr Speaker, we feel that for this one position, for these two positions, this is a 

household staff.  For this particular appointment I am sure that Honourable Members of 

this  House  will  understand  for  that  to  be  left  entirely  to  the  individuals  concerned.    It 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>181 

</span></div><div><span>should not be part of the affairs of the State where everybody has to go through all kinds 

of scrutiny. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I feel that this is a personal area. The law says you can have this and it is up 

to you to decide whom it is you wish to do your grounds and cleaning. I feel the humble 

groundsman and the humble house girl should not become part of the State appointments.  

What do we do?  Get a Higher Services Commission to appoint it?  For goodness sake, 

</span><span>let’s draw the line.</span></div><div><span>Of  course,  Mr  Speaker,  if  there  was  going  to  be  major  difficulties  about  it  we  would 

simply  forget  about  it.  Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  I  mentioned  this  to  the  news  reporter, 

</span><span>Florence  Syme  Buchanan  “Kata”  that  sh</span><span>e  might  very  well  want  us  to  set  very  high 

</span><span>standards. But let me state this.  She can’t even meet all the standards she expects us to 

</span><span>set.  So Mr Speaker, that is the reason for this.  The explanations are there.  I am hoping 

that  there  will  be  more  developments  in  this  area  after  the  by-election  and  when  the 

Budget is finished.  This situation must be looked at.  All I ask is for this matter to be left 

to  my  wife  and  I  to  decide.    It  would  appear  Mr  Speaker,  that  at  every  indication, 

particularly in my personal situation, the State is granting me a small privilege.  There are 

people  out  there  who  will  not  allow  me  to  have  it.    It  is  selfish,  it  is  mean,  it  is 

unreasonable and to a certain extent it is cruel because it hurts my wife all the time. 

</span></div><div><span>We Cook Islanders have a habit of trying to drag each other down and this is just another 

example but regardless of this, Mr Speaker, I intend to serve this country, regardless of 

detractors like this.  I intend to serve my country faithfully until my time is up. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Members for your indulgence. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you and thank you for giving me 

leave to make this Ministerial Statement. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Clerk  of  Parliament  and  your  staff  </span><span>–</span><span>  Kia  Orana  to  you  also.    The  Deputy  Prime 

</span><span>Minister,  Ministers  of  Cabinet,  Members  of  the  Coalition  side  of  this  Parliament,  the 

</span><span>Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Members on the other 

side of the House </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana.  To my very closest friend, the Honourable Tom Marsters, 

Member for Murienua and the Member for Mitiaro, Tangata Vavia and to all the people 

of the Cook Islands </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to associate myself with you, Mr Speaker and the Deputy Prime Minister in giving 

a  special  Kia  Orana  to  the  members  of  the  Teau  Samuel  family.    Our  condolences  are 

with them. 

</span></div><div><span>When  I  read  the  article  this  morning  in  the  paper,  the  article  referred  to  by  the  Deputy 

Prime  Minister,  I  asked  myself,  what  is  the  intention  of  that  article?    What  is  the 

motivation of the reporter in writing that article?  Is there any wisdom in the article?  My 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>182 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>conclusion was, “Yes, there is wisdom in that article”. I am glad that Florence Syme has 

</span><span>written this article because this particular issue is now being brought to light. 

</span></div><div><span>We  all  support  the  principle  of  transparency,  Mr  Speaker  and  the  Deputy  Prime 

</span><span>Minister’s statement this morning upholds that principle of transparency.</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> A Point of Order has been raised.  Yes, Leader of the Opposition, what 

is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  It  is  my  understanding,  Mr  Speaker,  that  a  Ministerial 

Statement should not be debated and if the Prime Minister is to be allowed to debate on 

the Ministerial Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister, I would like to debate it also. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Leader of the Opposition.  I have been advised . . .
