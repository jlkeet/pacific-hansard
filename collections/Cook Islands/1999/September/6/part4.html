<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Interrupted debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,581,176 for Education stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The last member speaking was the Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  You have 

one more minute </span><span>–</span><span> but you did indicate that you had finished but carry on Honourable 

Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Sure  Mr  Chairman  I  did 

indicate that I had come to the end of my speech but today I feel that I have something 

more to add. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you and Greetings to you, your staff members, all Honourable Members and to 

our people who are listening in to our debate.  Greetings to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time Mr Chairman to request the Prime Minister and the Deputy 

Prime Minister to try to pacify the situation in our country which has been blown out 

of proportion. I believe it will affect the Tourist industry  here,  within the region and 

at  an  international  level.    When  I  heard  the  news  over  Radio  New  Zealand  I  was 

concerned.  Two  people  rang  me  and  invited  me  to  sound  out  in  this  House  for  the 

Members to cautious about what we have to say  because it will affect our economy. It 

might stop them from coming here. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Member for Nikao Panama. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to you, to your staff, to 

all  the  Members  of  Parliament  and  to  our  people  who  are  listening  in  to  us  this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>205 

</span></div><div><span>afternoon.    Greetings  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Leader  of  the 

Opposition,  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  to  everybody.    Good  afternoon.  

Greetings  to  our  people  who  are  listening  to  us  this  afternoon,  especially  to  the 

teachers of the various schools in the Cook Islands.  I will not prolong my speech Mr 

Chairman.  We have wasted a lot of time last week speaking about other things than 

what we were supposed to talk about. So, I will dwell on the subject of our teachers. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  the  Minister  responsible.  I  heard  you  speak  last  Monday.  I  am 

encouraging  you to attain the programmes  you outlined.  Mr Chairman, in regard to 

the teachers who are teaching our children, I believe one of the main reason they are 

leaving their jobs is because of their salaries.  Teachers who are highly qualified  have 

moved  to  other  professions  because  of  the  low  salaries  in  the  teaching  profession.  I 

would recommend to you Mr Minister, to consider this matter. They have been trained 

to  teach.    In  the  retreat  of  1997  the  teachers  who  were  there  were  really  critical  of 

some  former  teachers  who  moved  on  to  other  Ministries.  These  Teachers  have  a 

special talent.  They trained to teach. We professed in this House that our children will 

become the leaders of this </span><span>country in the future. Let’s look at the various schools in 

</span><span>the Cook Islands.  They are all fund raising in order to provide the schools with the 

</span><span>necessary resources and to support our children. During the four years I have been in 

</span><span>Parliament this is one area I spent a lot of time debating.   I know that in our school at 

Nikao  we  had  some  money  from  the  Government  to  help  us  with  the  work  on  the 

school.  The major problem right now at Nikao School is the fibrolite roofing iron.  I 

hope you will look at this as the Minister of Education. 

</span></div><div><span>We Honourable Members in  this House should be supportive of the schools  to  ease 

the burden on the parents and the teachers. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I do have another concern which h may not be directly related to this 

vote item. This is in regards to the statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister in 

that they have degrees and Marsters. We in the Opposition are not happy about that. I 

am a full tin of meat and not a half tin of meat.  When I come into Parliament I know 

what  I  am  talki</span><span>ng  about.  I  don’t  expect  us  to  come  here  and  run  each  other  down.  

We’ve been elected by our people to speak on their behalf.</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Do  you  wish  to  take  your 

second speech? 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>    Yes  please.    Because  when  I  went  home  last  Friday  I  was 

still disturbed. We all went to school but some mothers decided early to pull out and 

</span><span>enter into  some forms of earning. And that’s where they are today. Maybe they didn’t 

</span><span>complete their education in their school days but they are able to write their name, to 

add, to  multiply  and to  take away. When we  come into this House we should come 

here  with  the  needs  for  our  own  constituency  and  not  to  talk  about  the  education 

achievements  of  the  Members.  Otherwise  our  people  will  think  that  we  in  the 

Opposition are dumb. There are  people like Napa and Dick Browne.  They have done 

very well for themselves although they did not have any tertiary education. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  my concern. And that is  exactly what  I  did.  I observed what  my parents  did 

and followed them. Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  The Honourable Member for Amuri/Ureia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to you, Greetings to everybody 

in this House this afternoon and Greetings to the  ladies in the kitchen.  Greetings to 

the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  to  all  Honourable  Members.  

Greetings  to  you  all  this  afternoon.    Greetings  also  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition 

and  the  Deputy  Leader,  to  all  Honourable  Members  on  the  Opposition  side  </span><span>–</span><span>

Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  our  colleagues,  Tom  Marsters  and  Tangata  Vavia.    Good  afternoon  to 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  the  people  who  are  listening  in  to  the  debate  this  afternoon  and  I  trust 

that you are enjoying the debate coming from this House.  Greetings to all the schools 

on  the  island  of  Rarotonga  and  to  those  responsible  for  the  schools  on  Rarotonga  </span><span>–</span><span>

Greetings to you all.  Greetings to our many schools in the Outer Islands and I believe 

you  are listening in because this budget appropriation concerns you. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise,  Mr  Chairman,  to  give  my  full  support  to  the  appropriation  for  Education.    I 

trust, Mr Chairman, that they are looking forward to our approval of this allocation so 

that  they  can  fulfilling  their  programmes.  In  the  same  way,  I  would  hope  that 

whatever we request for our respective schools will be realised. I am not sure whether 

every  concern  we  have    will  be  met  with  the  funds  in  this  budget.  Nevertheless  we 

will  need  to  air  our  respective  concerns.  Our  task  in  this  House  is  to  voice  our 

</span><span>people’s needs.  Whether we can achieve that or not, will depend on the availability of 

</span><span>the resources. We are interested in  supporting our schools. I did not here any request 

for  a  new  school  building.  A  number  of  concerns  relate  to  the  attitudes  and  the 

personalities  of  our  children.  Now,    it  is  accepted  that  knowledge  will  increase  and 

there will be a lot of negative impacts. 

</span></div><div><span>I  recall,  Mr  Chairman,  last  year  about  the  lack  of  respect,  the  poor  manners,  the 

negative  characters  and  personalities  of  our  children.  Today,  the  skills  and  the 

equipment  available  to  the  children  are  on  the  rise,  unlike  our  time.    We  now  have 

new technical  equipment such as computers.  During our time subjects were written 

on the Board and you learn from them. Today, although knowledge has increased, a 

more important aspect, which is respect is in disarray.  There is no more respect. We 

used to respect the elders.  I was not surprised because the Bible said that there will 

come a time when </span><span>things will get worst. We shouldn’t use it as an excuse not to  do 

</span><span>anything.  But the Bible has foretold these events. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of  improving the character, the personalities of our children, I doubt if our 

present  system  will  succeed.  We  need  to  reintroduce  corporal  punishments.  If  the 

present  ban  by  legislation  prevails,  this  problem  cannot  be  eradicated.  Soon  the 

Teachers  will  have  to  apply  corporal  punishment  illegally.  One  day  the  students  at 

school will fight against the teachers. 

</span></div><div><span>One day at school in Aitutaki my grandchild came home and said they had a fight at 

school. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>207 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Your second speech Honourable Member.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  I  asked  him  why  they  fought.    According  to  him,  there  were  two 

students who came back home from  New Zealand and brought back behaviours and 

attitudes foreign to us.  It prompted a rift in the school.  In that problem two teachers 

were involved and so were the students.  It made me laugh.  During the fight one of 

the  teachers  was  on  the  ground  and  the  students  were  on  top.    The  children  are  no 

</span><span>longer scared.  They don’t have any more respect because they know that they have 

</span><span>the law on their side. They will not be punished.  The teachers and the parents will be 

scared. The abolishment of  Corporal punishment has transgressed our culture where 

when  children  do  something  wrong  you  smack  them.    Nowadays,  it  is  gone.    All  I 

know is that this rot will continue. 

</span></div><div><span>I listened to the speeches regarding the older teachers.  The younger teachers coming 

into the system are getting more money and the elders are not happy about it.  For the 

benefit  of  our  older  teachers  we  must  realise  the  fact  that  our  achievements  then 

cannot  be  compared  with  the  achievements  today  because  merits  in  education 

determines  remuneration  now.  Nevertheless,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the 

</span><span>years  of  service  and  experience  of  the  long  service  Teachers.    Both  are  in  the  same 

</span><span>profession  but  the  younger  teacher  had  broadened  their  fields  and  attained  higher 

qualifications. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also  like  Mr Chairman, to  comment  about  the isolation of the funds for the 

Outer Island teachers from those on Rarotonga.  As explained by my colleague when 

a new curriculum for Education is  brought  into the country Rarotonga is  the first  to 

receive it and utilise it. The Outer Island Schools miss out.  The administration of the 

finance  for  Education  in  the  Outer  Islands  is  now  under  the  control  of  the  Island 

Council.  I hope the system will now change. But as he said, we are concerned that if 

a vote item runs out of money the money allocated for Education may be used instead 

for that vote item.  However, in Rarotonga the funds will be properly administered for 

the schools on Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>Another things  I would like to  raise, Mr Chairman, is  in  regard to  the teachers who 

have retired but have gone back to the classroom to teach. What is happening today in 

Aitutaki is that senior students are being brought into the classroom to supervise and 

teach junior classes while the Schools is waiting for teacher replacements.  But these 

students  are  not  being  paid  for  this  task.    The  request  has  come  through  from  the 

teachers  for  the  senior  students  to  take  classes  because  of  insufficient  teachers,  but 

they are not being paid.  So I would strongly recommend that consideration should be 

made to the effect that these students be rewarded for carrying out this responsibility. 

At  least  we  should  give  these  children    for  some  kind  of    rewards  or  remuneration. 

Maybe these students are doing this job and they may be recommended to go to  the 

Teachers Training College.  I not concerned about the latter consideration.  First and 

foremost, is the present situation. 

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  things  that  we  have  discussed  is  the  fact  that  there  is  never  enough 

</span><span>equipment for the schools. Together with the shortage of finance. These children are 

</span><span>ours.    Their  parents  is  not  the  Government.  I  don’t  see  any  problem  with  School 

Committees  raising  funds  because  Government  hasn’t  got  enough  money  for  the 

schools.    I  don’t  think  we  should  complain  about  this  fundraisi</span><span>ng.    This  is  an 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>208 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>important  part  of  the  roles  of  the  School  Committees.    We  need  to  raise  money  to 

</span><span>improve the school’s facilities and parents should not complain because these are their 

</span><span>children. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Do you wish to take your third speaking time?  Please carry on 

Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:  </span><span>Thank you.  This is something we are getting used to.  If fundraising 

</span><span>is called for we start complaining and we don’t turn up to these events. These are our 

</span><span>children and we should turn up and support the fundraising. 

</span></div><div><span>I heard some Members speaking about language,  the English and the Maori language 

our children are using today.   It  is  true and it is important  that our children learn to 

speak their own language rather than depending  on the English language.  You see, 

my grandchildren do not understand me if I speak to them in Maori, but if I speak to 

them in English they understand what I am say.   I feel this is the biggest problem we 

have  with  the  children  today.    They  may  think  that  the  English  language  is  their 

mother tongue from their parents and grandparents, but this is not the case.  It is true  

</span><span>that we do need our children to learn to communicate with English speakers. But what 

</span><span>I find sad is that when they meet their own people they cannot speak to them in their 

own Maori language. 

</span></div><div><span>I  know  of  some  people  who  do  not  know  how  to  speak  English  properly  but  when 

they  have  children  they  speak  in  English  to  them,  including  myself.    Yet  when  you 

listen to them you feel like laughing at the kind of English th</span><span>ey have but it’s hard to 

</span><span>laugh infront of them.  These days we need our children to be able to speak their own 

language and to be able to speak English as well.  It is true Mr Chairman that we have 

to discuss these issues today but the major concern is  that some children will benefit 

but  some  will  not.    We  should  not  look  down  on  people  who  cannot  speak  English 

well.  That is what we are doing in the Cook Islands today.  If there is a person who 

cannot  speak English, we mock them.   When  I  was  going to  school  I  never learned 

how to speak English but after I left school then I started to learn to speak English.   

</span></div><div><span>I cannot find fault with what the Deputy Prime Minister said last week.  I believe he 

was giving us his personal point of view on two different types of people.  I can use 

myself  as  an  example.    I  never  got  any  qualifications  from  school,  I  never  learned 

English but I came into this Parliament because I lived all my life amongst my people 

and I worked all my life for my people. This is why they put me into Parliament. We 

should not be compelled to rely on our children because they went to school.  In many 

cases they are highly qualified but do not know the basics in developing a successful 

life. 

</span></div><div><span>There  are  two  young  people  on  Aitutaki  today  who  never  went  to  school  but  today 

they are two of the best mechanics on the island.  This is the nature of mankind, some 

people  are  very  good  academically  and  some  people  are  very  good  practically.  

Looking at it from a broad perspective some people who are ruining our children are 

</span><span>their grandfathers and grandmothers. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>209 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member for Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:  </span><span>Kia Orana to everyone in this House.  To Honourable Members on 

both  sides  of  the  House  Kia  Orana.    Kia  Orana  also  to  all  the  teachers  and  school 

children,  particularly  the  teachers  and  children  on  the  island  of  Rakahanga.  

Sometimes Mr Chairman,  I feel sorry for the teachers when there is a workshop to be 

held.  The  Lecturers  in  some  cases  are  afraid  to  go  to  Rakahanga  so  they  stay  in 

Manihiki and expect the lady teachers from Rakahanga to travel to Manihiki to attend 

that  workshop.    By  right  the  men  should  travel  these  treacherous  route  on  the  open 

boats    while  the  men  sit  in  Manihiki.  So  this  is  a  request  I  would  like  to  put  to  the 

Minister  of  Education  of.  We  should  look  after  and  take  care  of  these  women  who 

have  taken  up  this  profession.  Something  must  be  done  to  help  them  out  when  a 

Workshop is to be conducted in Manihiki.   

</span></div><div><span>I also support the view of the speaker last week who mentioned the protest march by 

the  teachers  about  their  very  low  wages  and  salaries.    They  came  to  Parliament 

protesting.  I suppose this happened because the wages and salaries were much lower 

than  the  normal  public  servants.  When  we  were  in  Government  every  six  months 

</span><span>there would been a pay rise.  This is the truth.  All of the public servants know that 

</span><span>when the Democratic Party was in Government there was a six months pay increase.  

So this is a matter for the Minister to look into and try and ensure that the teachers get 

their  pay  rise.    Pay  them  well  and  then  they  will  teach  our  children  properly.  He 

cannot really say that there is no money because I can see there is quite a lot of money 

in the Ministerial Support vote items.  Maybe this will be an area where the Minister 

could try to use these funds.  If we look at Ministerial Support there is over $700,000. 

If  we  put  all  the  Ministerial  Support  together,  this  is  a  huge  expenditure.    I  think 

Cabinet should look at this and reduce this figure.  Give more to the teachers so that 

they will teach our children properly. 

</span></div><div><span>The Member for Amuri Ureia would like teachers to be able to punish children.  Mr 

Chairman,  I  do  not  agree  that  teachers  on  Rakahanga  be  given  the  right  to  punish 

children on Rakahanga.  Mr Chairman I would like the Act passed by this House to be 

followed to the letter. Any problems in the schools are referred to the Principal and if 

the Principal decides to apply corporal punishment, so be it.   

</span></div><div><span>I support the view that Government should work to support the Private Schools.  I will 

</span><span>go further than that.  As we see, Private Schools are doing quite well. Why don’t we 

</span><span>privatise  all  the  schools  and  in  so  doing  maybe  there  will  be  less  expenditure  for 

education and achieve better results for our children? 

</span></div><div><span>I can’t see any major problem area other than the lack of funding to pay our school 

</span><span>teachers.  This is why we have a lower achievement rate in our schools. 

</span></div><div><span>I  was  pleased  to  hear  the  views  of  Members  last  week  regarding  the  many  people  

who  are  highly  qualified.  This  was  as  a  result  of  the  Democratic  Party  scholarship 

programmes.  I think if I remember correctly there was only one or two who were sent  

</span><span>by the Cook Islands Party Government. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on with your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>210 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  So, I would like to ask the Member for Amuri/Ureia, where  all this 

money was that bragged? Large sums of money allocated by the Cook Islands Party 

Government.    Yet  we  heard  that  most  of  these  young  people  who  were  sent  off  for 

higher education were by the Democratic Alliance Party Government. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  one  complaint  to  the  Minister  of  Education  with  regard  to  the  loan  that  was 

acquired for maintenance to the school buildings. According to the report these funds 

have  not  been  utilised  and  I  have  problems  with  this  because  maybe  if  we  ask  for 

another loan at another stage we will not be able to acquire it.  I am not pointing my 

finger at the present Minister of Education but at the administrators of Education.  So 

to  the  present  Minister,  I  would  humbly  request  the  Minister  to  go  and  visit  the 

Rakahanga  School  because  I  have  asked  on  many  occasions  the  former  Education 

Minister to visit the school in Rakahanga and he never did. 

</span></div><div><span>But there is only one person I would like to show my appreciation and acknowledge.  

That is the former Assistant Minister for Education but he is not here unfortunately. I 

will thank him anyway because he was the only one who has taken up time to visit the 

schools  in  Rakahanga.    I  think  it  is  important  that  the  staff  should  go  and  visit  the 

</span><span>school  in  Rakahanga  although  the  Budget  allocation  for  Education  in  the  Outer 

</span><span>Islands is under the Ministry of Outer Islands Development.  I feel that in order to lift 

the  level  and  standard  of  education  on  the  island  of  Rakahanga  officials  from  the 

Education Ministry should make a visit. 

</span></div><div><span>Yes, sure, we talk about computers.  But in the case of the Outer Islands, especially in 

our case, the electricity only comes on irregularly. So there would be difficulty if we 

introduce  computer  to  the  Northern  Group  islands.    Maybe  it  is  a  good  idea  to 

consider  buying  an  electrical  generator  for  schools.  If  the  school  want  to  use  of  the 

computer, then they will have electricity. I would ask the Minister responsible to see 

to the need of our schools in the Northern Group islands. The School Inspectors or the 

Trainers  should  go  to  the  island  responsible  instead  of  bringing  the  teachers  to 

Manihiki to be trained. And if there is a need to utilise the computers in these islands 

we should also think of buying generators.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  I call on the Honourable Member for Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. WIGMORE:</span><span>  Greetings to you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to the Clerk and to 

all  staff  members  </span><span>–</span><span>  good  afternoon.    Greetings  to  Honourable  Members  on  the 

Government  side,  Greetings  also  to  the  Members  on  the  corrective  side  and  to  our 

people who are listening in to our debate </span><span>–</span><span> good afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Although  a  lot  of  Members  have  spoken  on  the  Appropriation  for  the  Ministry  of 

Education, there are  areas that they have touched which I would love to touch on. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  speak  on  the  Budget  allocation  for  Education,  I  would  like  to  extend  my 

Greetings to the Principal of the Titikaveka College who is working hard to educate 

</span><span>our  students  in  Titikaveka  College.  To  the  Pre-school  teacher  who  is  doing  a 

</span><span>marvellous job in my constituency, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>211 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  give  my  full  support  to  the  appropriation  for  the  Ministry  of 

Education although it is  not  enough.   However, this  is  what  has been requested and 

what  is  required.    A  lot  of  speakers  have  spoken  earlier  emphasising  the  need  to 

establish  a  Technical  Institute  on  the  island  for  engineering,  for  carpentry  and  for 

other  professions.    Right  now,  Mr  Chairman,  I  feel  I  should  raise  this  matter  to 

encourage the education system in our country to raise the standard or the curriculum 

on Agricultural  in  our schools.  Although the Agriculture is  taught  in  our schools,  I 

feel  it  is  not  enough.  I  understand  there  were  some  aid  equipment  sent  into  our 

country to support the Agricultural curriculum in the schools.  That is why I wish, Mr 

Chairman,  to  put  my  emphasis  on  this  area.    If  we  want  to  have  one  period  for 

Agric</span><span>ulture in each school for each week I don’t think that’s enough.  I would suggest 

</span><span>that all students who are interested in Agriculture, should be brought to Rarotonga and 

make them stay in one venue. They stay there and they learn Agriculture work.  We 

maybe thinking, where can we house these students from the Outer Islands? There is 

one  building  that  is  there  that  we  need  to  utilise.    That  is,  the  Research  Station  in 

Totokoitu  in  Titikaveka.    We  should  bring  all  those  students  there  and  they  learn 

everything to do with Agriculture. When they grow up the interest will carry on and 

they will go back and make use of that knowledge. 

</span></div><div><span>Because  I  can  recall,  Mr  Chairman,  this  kind  of  thing  has  been  done  in  the  schools 

before.  A gentleman by the name of Andy Nola did this project.  We can recall when 

this  gentleman  came  here.  He  had  been  working  in  Mangaia  and  he  had  the 

knowledge in agriculture and animal husbandry. I find that in our schools it is hard to 

encourage our  young people to take up agriculture.  There are those who say if  you 

</span><span>want to be a planter  you don’t need a good education.  This is wrong.  It may have 

</span><span>been  the  thinking  in  the  past  but  nowadays  there  are  new  ideas  where  a  good 

education is needed to become a planter.  I am not saying that you need a university 

degree to work on the land. No. But you need some knowledge of how to carry out the 

certain technical  work, especially with the use of fertilisers.  Today, people must be 

educated  and  understand  how  to  use  chemicals.    We  have  heard  of  people  who 

encourage organic agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Please carry on with your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. WIGMORE:</span><span>  Because we know that with organic agriculture we do not need 

to know how to use chemicals and fertiliser. When we talk about organic agriculture 

</span><span>we don’t use chemical.  A lot of time and man</span><span>-labour will be required. On the other 

hand  we  use  chemical  and  fertiliser.    I  am  not  saying  I  do  not  support  the  idea  of 

organic agriculture, but I feel this should be quickly introduced to the Outer Islands.  

Today in organic agriculture food must be naturally grown. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I will speak about school buses.  Although a Member has raised this matter last 

week, I feel I should also register my views. In my constituency of Titikaveka, there 

are families who cannot afford the bus fare for their children and sometimes the child, 

or  children,  cannot  attend  school.  So  I  would  like  the  Minister  responsible  for 

Education to consider looking at this matter seriously because there are students who 

</span><span>are not going to school on some days because there is not enough money in the home 

</span><span>for the bus fare.  Maybe some will say that there is no money to assist the bus of the 

children.  The  Honourable  Member  Pupuke  Robati  mentioned  about  the  Ministerial 

Support in the Budget w</span><span>hich  is about $500,000. I don’t know how the Ministers will 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>212 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>use this fund.  I suggest that this is a good project for this fund. Or maybe we are just 

going to waste this money.  If nothing eventuates in this matter, after the 29</span><span>th</span><span> of next 

month  this  is  one  thing  the  Democratic  Alliance  Government  will  review  carefully, 

and that is how free buses can be reintroduced. 

</span></div><div><span>My last point is on Private Schools.  Because we are supporting the education of our 

children  in  various  schools,  we  should  also  support  Private  Schools,  especially  the 

SDA and the Catholic schools.  Mr Chairman, from these Private Schools, those who 

excel will not be confined working for the SDA or the Catholic Churches. They will 

be working for the Cook Islands.  If there is a contract between Government and the 

Catholic  and  SDA  Schools  I  feel  that  Government  should  honour  the  terms  of  that 

agreement.  This is all I have to say, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  There appear to be none.  Minister would you like to wrap up?   

</span></div><div><span>The Minister of Education. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. J. MARURAI:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Clerk of the House and Members 

</span><span>of Parliament in the Chamber, and to our people listening to us, Greetings to you all.  

Special  Greetings  to  all  the  schools  teachers  and  the  students,    not  forgetting  the 

Secretary of Education and his staff. 

</span></div><div><span>As I said when I introduced the Appropriation for Education, I will accept comments 

and questions from the Chamber.  One of the most debated topics is the Government 

contribution to Private Schools.  The existing Government contribution is divided into 

four  sections.    At  the  moment  Government  is  paying  for  eight  staff  in  the  Catholic 

schools  around  the  country.    Three  teachers  in  the  SDA  Schools  are  paid  by 

Government.  Now,  Government  is  providing  one  hundred  percent  stationery  to  all 

schools.  On Rarotonga the Government is paying groundsmen for all the schools.  I 

believe  that  Titikaveka  College  and  Papaaroa  College  are  sharing  one.    All 

Workshops  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  provides  accommodation  for  all  Private 

Schools. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Excuse  me  Honourable  Minister.    Sorry  to  interrupt  you.    It  is 

time to stop for afternoon tea. 

</span></div><div><span>This Sitting is now suspended until 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED AT 2.30 p.m.</span></div><div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>The sitting is resumed.  I am sorry to keep you waiting.  I call on 

</span><span>the Minister of Education to continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. J. MARURAI:  </span><span>Mr Chairman I was on the topic of Government’s contribution 

</span><span>to Private Schools.  Lately the Private Schools have approached me on the question of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>213 

</span></div><div><span>financial assistance.  On the question then of privatisation it will be disastrous.  The 

Ministry  and  I  are  negotiating  with  the  Catholic  schools  on  a  partnership  with 

Government.    Concurrently,  the  Ministry  is  proposing  a  Private  School  policy  for 

Government.  Perhaps this negotiation with the Catholic schools will be incorporated 

in the forthcoming policy. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I will move on to the ADB loan.  Presently the offering of entitlement to schools 

have  to  be  put  on  a  bid.      Any  requests  have  to  be  forwarded  by  the  Principals 

concerned.    If  the  Arorangi  School  was  not  given  any  assistance  and  the  Takitumu 

School  was,  then  the  fault  is  with  the  Principal.    I  was  told  that  iron  roofing  was 

provided for the Takitumu School.  Unfortunately these were transferred to the Avatea 

School because the community could not use the iron roofing. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. J. MARURAI:  </span><span>For the Takitumu School 98% of the bids are considered.  For 

Arorangi School 95%.  It is expected that a loan will be completed next week. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I will move on to the teacher’s salaries.  In March last year the first phase was 

</span><span>implemented.    The  commencing  salary  of  teachers  is  now  $12,000.    Unfortunately 

there were some teachers who were already on that salary scale.  They were caught up 

by the new teachers so they will be accommodated in the next or second phase.  I am 

</span><span>told it will be implemented in a month’s time if money is available from MFEM.</span></div><div><span>On the question of an Apprenticeship scheme  I was told that this is no longer under 

the Ministry of Education.  At the same time I was told that it is too expensive.  The 

preference  now  is  to  send  students  overseas.    The  scheme  is  now  under  the  Public 

Service Commission. 

</span></div><div><span>The  next  issue  is  about  the  language  in  schools,  Maori.  Already  we  have  a  Maori 

syllabus.  The argument that our children are only speaking  in English instead of their 

mother tongue is the concern of the parents.  The teaching of Maori in the schools is 

part of the Maori syllabus.  The cultural aspects of our society is also included in the  

syllabus.   

</span></div><div><span>To round off, the school buses.  The school buses are privatised but I will meet with 

the Secretary of Education to discuss what assistance the Government can provide.  I 

expect to present a proposal to Cabinet on the question of Private Schools in the near 

future.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  will  now  put  the  question. 

The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,581,176 for Education stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Foreign Affairs.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>214 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,485,694 for Foreign Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  J.  WILLIAMS:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Greetings  to  you  on  this 

beautiful afternoon.  To the Clerk, all the staff members,  Greetings.  To the Deputy 

Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  the  coalition 

partnership,  Greetings.    To  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the  Deputy  Leader, 

Greetings.  To  the  members  of  the  Democratic  Alliance,  Greetings  to  you  all  this 

afternoon.  To my friends the Honourable Tom Marsters and the Honourable Tangata 

Vavia, good afternoon.  For those who are permanently resident in the Cook Islands 

and  to  those  who  came  from  the  Overseas  Constituency,  Greetings  and  good 

afternoon to you all.  I would like to extend Greetings to the head of Foreign Affairs 

and all the staff members within the Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  is  involved  in  a  number  of  activities.  

Basically  it  has  to  do  with  Foreign  Affairs  on  the  one  side  and  Immigration  on  the 

other.    As  far  as  Foreign  Affairs  is  concerned  it  runs  its  operations  here  at  their 

</span><span>headquarters  in  Rarotonga.    In  addition  it  manages  the  affairs  of  our  High 

</span><span>Commission  Office  in  Wellington.    That  office  in  Wellington  is  headed  by  a  High 

Commissioner of the Cook Islands to New Zealand and Australia. 

</span></div><div><span>We have had very distinguished work that has been done by Cook Islanders who held 

the post of High Commissioner.  Now Iaveta Short held this post for a long time and 

</span><span>he  is  responsible  for  putting  the  level  of  the  High  Commissioner’s  Office  in 

</span><span>Wellington at the level that it is today and through his efforts and through his work, 

many  channels  were  opened  to  other  countries,  thus  formalising  Foreign  Affairs 

relationship  with  some  countries  throughout  the  world.    I  want  to  give  my  thoughts 

and  I  am  sure  you  would  join  me  in  thanking  our  son,  Iaveta  Short  and  our  metua, 

Iaveta Short. 

</span></div><div><span>The  other  Office  that  is  run  by  Foreign  Affairs  is  the  Consulate-General  Office  in 

Auckland.  This used to be quite a large office with quite a number of staff.  Because 

of  the  downturn  in  1996,  the  staff  members  were  reduced  to  two.    Our  Consulate-

General  for the past  five  years has been our metua, Papa Bill  Teariki.   He has  been 

ably  assisted  in  this  office  by  Rima  Ngatoa.  This  Office  used  to  have  a  Trade 

Commissioner  which  held  commercial  activities  on  behalf  of  Government  and  on 

behalf of this Office.  But that is no longer active.  A weakness of that Office has been 

the lack of personnel given to look after the affairs of Cook Islanders residing in the 

Auckland district and indeed in New Zealand.  Now, Mr Chairman, I am not referring 

only  to  those  who  live  permanently  in  Auckland.    I  am  also  referring  to  Cook 

Islanders who travel there and find themselves in certain predicaments in Auckland.  

There are people requiring housing help, people requiring finances, people requiring 

all  sorts  of  services.  Because,  when  they  arrive  in  New  Zealand,  they  are  not  sure 

what to do there.  They are lost.  They require help and it is our responsibility to make 

sure  that  that  help  is  made  available.    Now  for  years  and  years  we  have  had  one 

</span><span>person who worked for Social Welfare in Auckland and he made it his responsibility 

</span><span>to help Cook Islanders who find themselves in unfortunate circumstances. This person 

is  Danny  Turia.    Now  those  of  you  who  might  travel  to  Auckland  or  those  Cook 

Islanders  who  might  travel  to  Auckland  and  find  themselves  wanting  for  finance, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>215 

</span></div><div><span>wanting for welfare assistance, wanting for housing assistance and this and that, this is 

the person that you should contact.  Unfortunately, we are going to lose his services 

because he is standing for the General Elections in New Zealand in November. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Which Party? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  He has decided to accept the challenge and to carry the 

flag of the Cook Islands into the next General Election of New Zealand and I am sure 

our best wishes will go to him.  And so with his parting from that scene we need to 

replace the services that have been readily available to Cook Islanders and we see the 

Office as the place to do this particular service. We can find nobody else in the New 

Zealand Social Welfare and other departments to fill the boots of Danny Turia.  This 

part  of  the  Office  is  designed  specifically  to  help  Cook  Islanders  and  we  aim  to  do 

that.  It is intended in the future to divide this Office into two parts.  I beg your pardon 

</span><span>–</span><span> three parts.   

</span></div><div><span>The  first  is  that  of  the  Consul-</span><span>General’s  Office,  to  do  with  Foreign  Affairs.    The 

</span><span>second is to do with Trade Commission.  The third is to do with Welfare and Protocol. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, Members, we are not able to do this now because there is no allocation 

in the Budget for this.  I want to mention this to Parliament, this is going to happen in 

the  future.    We  must  make  budgetary  allowances  for  this  to  accommodate  this 

restructuring in the Auckland Office. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I want to make it quite clear.  The restructuring is not purely for the purpose of 

expanding  Government  or  for  building  a  bureaucracy.    No.    It  is  designed  to  give 

services to people.  While the Welfare and Protocol will cater for the services that I 

have  outlined,  the  Trade  Commission  Division  will  deal  with  commercial  activities 

that would assist business people in the Cook Islands as well as those Cook Islanders 

who are in business in New Zealand requiring our help. 

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  give  my  thanks  to  Papa  Bill  Teariki  for  all  that  he  has  done  for  the  Cook 

Islands and our people who live in Auckland and here.  I know that you will join me 

in giving our appreciation to what he has done for us. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  two  other  Consul  Offices  in  the  Pacific.    One  is  in  Sydney.    There  is  an 

Honorary  Consul  in  Sydney  and  the  other  one  is  in  Hawaii.    The  Honorary  Consul 

there  is  Mr  Bob  Worthington.    Now  soon  I  will  be  giving  you  a  breakdown  of  the 

costs  of  running  these  offices  so  you  may  have  something  to  think  about.    Any 

questions you want to ask I will give you the answer. The figures are not broken down 

in the Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  we  also  have  a  Honorary  Consul  in  Norway  and  the  Office  of  the  Honorary 

Consul  in  Norway  costs  us  absolutely  nothing.    Now  this  is  established  for  the 

purpose of facilitating any trade activities, negotiating activities that we may have in 

Norway particularly in relation to the manganese nodules. 

</span></div><div><span>Now we intend to appoint further consuls, honorary consuls, throughout the countries 

recognised  -  in  the  same  manner  as  the  consular  office  in  Norway.      But  having  a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>216 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>representative for the Cook Islands in that country.  Now the Honourable Member for 

Akaoa  is  a  close  friend  of  our  Consul  in  Norway.    Perhaps  later  the  Honourable 

Member Tapi Taio could tells us more about the activities of this man in Norway and 

in  relation  to  the  mining  of  manganese  nodules  activity.    I  am  sure  our  people 

listening in to this broadcast would appreciate some explanation what is happening in 

Norway, especially in connection with the mining technology. 

</span></div><div><span>Now there is another Member in this House who has been familiar with the history, as 

well  as  the  development,  of  mining  of  nodules,  not  only  in  the  Cook  Islands  and 

Norway but throughout the World.  Now this Member, the Honourable Tom Marsters, 

the Member for Muri Enua, travelled on the very first Russian Research Vessel.  He 

spent four months on that Research Vessel.  He was closely associated with the work 

being done by that vessel.  And ever since then, he has taken a very close interest in 

the manganese nodules.  This began in 1974.  I can well recall when they returned and 

</span><span>the Captain of that Research Vessel came into the then Premier of the Cook Islands’ 

</span><span>Office  with  the  Honourable  Tom  Marsters.  They  reported  their  findings  of  the 

Research Vessel on the manganese nodules.  The Captain, if I can recall rightly, said:  

</span><span>“You  have  wealth  under  this  ocean  of  untold  proportions.    And  your  country,  Mr 

</span><span>Premier,  could  be  one  of  the  richest  countries  on  earth.”    And  Sir  Albert  replied:  

</span><span>“Will I see this wealth in my lifetime?”  And the reply came back from the Skipp</span><span>er:  

</span><span>“I  am  sorry  Mr  Premier,  it  is  a  generation  or  two  away.”    And  that  time  was  a 

</span><span>generation  and  a  half  away.  And  the  time  is  possibly  right  if  we  are  to  follow  the 

</span><span>prediction of Professor Bisrokov.  The time is now.  “One to two generations away, 

</span><span>Mr Prem</span><span>ier.”  And that time is now.  And the Research Vessel was called, I am sure 

</span><span>the Honourable Member for Rakahanga remembers that vessel very well - it was the 

</span><span>Russian Research Vessel “Vitiase”.  It would be of considerable interest to us in this 

</span><span>House  and  to  the  people  listening  to  us  if  the  Member  for  Muri  Enua,  if  in  his 

speaking time, could recount the history of the manganese nodules.  You will find Mr 

Chairman, I have dwelled on the manganese nodules, the Consul Office in Norway for 

a bit of time.  I do so to bring to our attention that we have to do something about this.  

I am sure the Honourable Member for Manihiki will be interested in travelling on the 

delegation to Norway because the shelves concerned under the ocean are the Manihiki 

Plateau and the Pukapuka Plateau.  Perhaps if the Honourable Member for Manihiki 

could,  in  his  speaking  time,  explain  what    the  Manihiki  Plateau  and  what    this 

Pukapuka Plateau are.  

</span></div><div><span>I know we have got a long time to go until Wednesday and if I talk for the rest of the 

day I am sure Members will be quite happy. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>You won’t finish your Budget if you do that.</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>I am nearly finished.  Now the other activities of Foreign 

Affairs  is,  if  you  look  at  the  Budget  there  is  $53,000  to  pay  for  certain  overseas 

functions.  Now these are subscriptions to our membership fees in this area.  The first 

is  the  South  Pacific  Forum,  then  there  is  SPREP,  UNDP,  UNESCO,  PIDP,  FAO, 

UNFCC  and  the  Law  of  the  Sea  Convention.    Now  I  said  I  would  give  you  a 

</span><span>breakdown of the Budget so if you have your pen and pencils ready I will give it to 

</span><span>you now. 

</span></div><div><span>Head Office expenditure is $363,235;

Foreign Affairs Budget.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Mr Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any further speakers?  The Member for Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you,  to  Honourable 

Members  of  the  House,  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  all 

</span><span>Members  of  the  House.    Special  Kia  Orana  to  our  people  who  are  listening  in  this 

</span><span>afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>With  your  leave  Mr  Chairman,  may  I  extend  to  my  constituency  of  Manihiki  our 

heartfelt sympathy for the loss of a mother who passed away over the weekend, Mrs 

Pauline Baker.  To her children, the Baker family, may God console us all in our time 

of  need.    Mrs  Pauline  Mareko  will  always  be  remembered  as  the  girl  with  the  big 

laugh,  the  big  smile,  so  our  sympathies  go  to  all  the  family,  to  her  brothers  in 

Manihiki and her parents in Auckland. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, before us is the appropriation for Foreign Affairs.  I wish to thank the 

Prime Minister for giving us a breakdown for this appropriation.  I do not see any area 

where  funds  are  allocated    to  the  security  for  members  in  office  that  is  the  Prime 

</span><span>Minister’s office and the Deputy Prime Minister’s office.  After all we understand our 

</span><span>Foreign Affairs is to deal with our security with New Zealand.  This is one area in our 

internal self Government we have designated to the New Zealand Government for our 

Foreign  Affairs.    Only  last  week  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  then  followed  by  the 

Prime Minister stated to the nation that their lives have been threatened.  I would like 

to raise the question of whether the New Zealand Police have been alerted to this, by 

our Foreign Affairs.  That is if the threat to their lives was real or just pure suspicion.   

</span></div><div><span>I  also  sympathise  with  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  who  earlier  stated  his  concern. 

This kind of threat to our politicians, if these threats were real, have been reported to 

the New Zealand Police or to Foreign Affairs to look into this matter.  As I understand  

at  this  stage  it  is  all  hearsay  rather  than  a  factual  threat  to  their  lives.    There  are 

negative repercussions regarding this kind of outrage in this House.  It would reflect 

to  the  rest  of  the  world  that  we  have  an  unstable  Government,  we  are  an  unstable 

</span><span>people,  we  are  subject  to  physical  threats  of  an  assassin’s  bullet.    If  there  is  a  real 

</span><span>threat then let us investigate this threat.  I am sure through our High Commission in 

</span><span>Wellington  we  would  be  able  to  provide  some  assistance  through  the  New  Zealand 

Government.    The  Prime  Minister  also  said  we  do  have  several  High  Commission 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>218 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>offices.    I  was  waiting  for  him  to  tell  our  people  in  this  House  who  our  current 

Commissioners are and who will be replaced. 

</span></div><div><span>Except for the High Commissioner in Hawaii Mr Bill Worthington who has been the 

consul  for  many  years,  he  has  not  named  anybody  else  who  is  holding  these  public 

offices.    Of  course  I  agree  with  the  Prime  Minister  that  the  former  High 

Commissioner  to  Wellington  has  been  an  excellent  ambassador  to  this  country.    Mr 

Short  has  been  highly  commended  by  other  ambassadors  in  New  Zealand.  

Unfortunately  Mr  Chairman  our  High  Commissioner  who  was  in  Canberra  did  not 

enjoy  the  same  kind  of  commendations  like  our  Wellington  High  Commissioner.    I 

would  like  the  Prime  Minister  to  tell  this  nation  how  much  money  was  paid  to  our 

former Canberra High Commissioner as a settlement out of court.  After all our people 

want to know.  It will also save a lesson to the current Prime Minister, Deputy Prime 

Minister and Cabinet when they next appoint a High Commissioner to these overseas 

posts to choose the right person.  We don</span><span>’t want anybody who will come back and sue 

</span><span>this country.  Especially after our experience with the Canberra High Commissioner.   

</span></div><div><span>The  Prime  Minister  also  mentioned  the  long  serving  Trade  Commissioner  in 

</span><span>Auckland, Mr Bill Teariki.  I have had some personal experiences with this gentleman 

</span><span>and I think he served his country well.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your second speech Honourable Member.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I can only hope that the Auckland 

rumour  is  wrong  that  he  is  taking  early  retirement.    If  it  is  true  then  he  deserves  to 

retire because he has served his country very well. 

</span></div><div><span>I  looked  at  the  divisions  earmarked  for  the  Auckland  office  and  I  am  in  favour  of 

Foreign Affairs and the Trade Mission area.  The most important area to our people is 

the Social Welfare division of Foreign Affairs.  Particularly where our people are new 

in  Auckland,  this  division  of  Foreign  Affairs  will  be  there  to  help  with 

accommodations or even some kind of employment.   

</span></div><div><span>Again  I will caution the Prime Minister to  choose the proper people to  work in  this 

office because there have been some rumours in the press that certain characters have 

been  earmarked  for  these  jobs.    Some  characters  have  rather  shady  pasts  and  our 

Government should put in place people with impeccable reputations, with no history 

of  any  criminal  activity.    That  will  reassure  our  people  that  the  Prime  Minister  of 

today  is  doing  an  excellent  job.    The  day  he  makes  the  wrong  choice  people  in 

Auckland will hang him. 

</span></div><div><span>It  will  be  fair  if  the  Government  of  the  day  consult  the  Opposition  before  any 

appointment to these offices are made. 

</span></div><div><span>Even  though  it  is  not  in  this  Budget,  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  also  like  to  raise  a 

question  that  we  are  all  aware  of.    This  is  in  relation  to  the  Association  of  APEC 

</span><span>countries meeting in Auckland next week on the 14</span><span>th</span><span>.  I am just surprised there is no 

</span><span>invitation  extended  to  this  country  to  be  represented.    After  all,  we  are  part  of  the 

Pacific.    I  will  urge  the  Prime  Minister  to  make  representation  to  the  New  Zealand 

Government for us to be there as an observer.

</span></div><div><span>I  have  no  difficulty,  Mr  Chairman,  in  supporting  this  $1  million  plus  allocated  for 

Foreign Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  on  the  Honourable 

Member for Murienua. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to all Members of 

Parliament.  May you allow  me, Mr Chairman, to extend my Greetings to our people 

who are listening to our broadcast. 

</span></div><div><span>Because  this  is  the  first  time  to  speak,  I  would  like  to  extend  my  Greetings  to  my 

people in my constituency in Murienua.  I would like to thank you very much indeed 

for giving me the opportunity to come back into Parliament.  We will be having our 

wrap up get-together for the last Election, I just want to remind you. This will be very 

soon. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings also to our friend in the Public Gallery. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, my last  greeting will be to  Pukapuka.  Mr Chairman,  I would  like to 

send  a  special  Greetings  to  the  Honourable  Inatio  Akaruru.    Mr  Chairman,  whilst 

probably  most  of  us  here  would  expect  me  to  express  similar  sentiments  to  Tiaki 

Wuatai, because of the situation that we have all found ourselves under at this present 

time,  I,  Mr  Chairman,  would  like  to  send  a  special  one  to  the  Honourable  Inatio 

Akaruru.    The  reason,  Mr  Chairman,  is  because  I  consider  the  Honourable  Inatio 

Akaruru  and  myself  as  the  last  of  the  honourable  Cook  Islands  Party.    I  am  talking 

about  the  management  body  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party.    I  was  looking  through  my 

records the other night, Mr Chairman and sadly I picked up the list of the members of 

</span><span>the Cook Islands Party that were issued membership cards. I’ve got mine right here, 

</span><span>signed by the Secretary-General of the Party then, the later Papa Mana Strickland and  

dated,  the  10</span><span>th</span><span>  November  1964  -  mine  and  Inatio  </span><span>Akaruru’s  names  were  there.  

</span><span>Because, Mr Chairman, a year later Inatio Akaruru assumed the position of Secretary-

General of the Cook Islands Party.  And on the 19</span><span>th</span><span> day of January 1968 he stepped 

down because he was contesting for the first time in his political career for the island 

of Pukapuka.  A contest, Mr Chairman, that he successfully won. And that same day, 

on the 29</span><span>th</span><span> January 1968 I, nominated by the Founder of the Cook Islands Party, Sir 

</span><span>Albert Henry, seconded by Keu …………. now, Keu Mitchell of Av</span><span>atiu, became the 

Secretary-General  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party.    Two  months  ago,  Mr  Chairman,  the 

Honourable Inatio Akaruru and I would have been members of this great family for 

35 years.  I have already served 31 and a half years as Secretary-General of this great 

body of people.  Undyingly, loyally, faithfully Inatio Akaruru and I have served this 

great body of people and I was hoping, Mr Chairman, that the Honourable Inatio will 

accept his political career on the high.  I would have preferred the Honourable Inatio 

to have exited on the high as Deputy Prime Minister of this country, a position that he 

held for quite a while.  It is for that reason and for that reason alone that I wish the 

Honourable Inatio Akaruru alone all the best in the coming by-election.  Inatio, you 

</span><span>will  always  be  a  great  friend  and  I  admire  you  for  all  the  things  you’ve  done  as  a 

</span><span>Member of Parliament in this House. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>220 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I stand at this moment to lend my full support to the Appropriation for 

Foreign Affairs.  As a former member of Government, the Cabinet that initiated the 

reform,  I had sad moments.  Although the reluctance was there, I also saw the need 

for the reform programme to go ahead because the benefits will be seen in the years to 

come. I said one of the saddest moments, because we had to dramatically scale down 

the Auckland Office.  I saw the Auckland Office especially as a great benefit for our 

people.    Over  30,000  of  our  people  live  in  New  Zealand.    About  15,000  live  in  the 

Manukau area, not the whole of Auckland. Just in the Manukau area alone there are 

</span><span>about 15,000 of our people.  Now there’s a million people in the wider Auckland area.  

</span><span>Imagine,  Mr  Chairman,  our  15,000  people  would  be  gobbled  up,  would  disappear, 

would be gone in this big mass of people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please carry on for your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:</span><span>    Therefore,  Mr  Chairman,  you  can  imagine  the  kind  of 

problems that our people concentrated in this area, the kind of problems they would 

go through, because they are caught up in this multitude of people.  This Office was a 

big help for our people.  Not only in Auckland, but New Zealand at large. When we 

</span><span>decided  to  scale  the  Auckland  Office  down  I  was  sad  because  I  could  see  the 

</span><span>implications, the effect it would have on our people.  In fact, Mr Chairman, the call 

was to abolish the Office altogether but I am glad that the Cabinet in its wisdom at the 

time decided not to but at least keep a skeletal staff to at least keep the Office going.  

Because  there  are  many  areas,  there  are  many  areas  that  our  people  need  help.  

</span><span>There’s the problem of housing, there’s the problem of work opportunity, there’s the 

</span><span>problem  of  medical  and  other  social  problems.    Where  are  they  to  go  to  seek 

assistance?    If  they  went  to  a  Samoan  Consulate  they  don</span><span>’t  speak  the  Samoan 

language.  If they went to other consulates they don’t understand the culture and the 

</span><span>way  our  people  think.    It  is  therefore  only  practical  that  we  have  our  own 

representation amongst our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Having had a look at the current Budget, Mr Chairman, I think there is room now to 

revisit this area, re-look, revisit the Auckland Office, work with a view to expand it 

again.    Both  in  welfare  and  protocol,  as  well  as  commerce  and  trade.    There  are  so 

many  advantages  with  having  a Trade Office  in  our Auckland Office.   We can take 

advantage of reduced prices through concessions by way of bulk ordering. If we the 

individual Ministries were to go their own sweet way, buying their own little things, it 

would be costlier for them compared to pooling together under one umbrella and bulk 

ordering.  We used to do that before, Mr Chairman.  At one time, I remember, I think 

the first Trade Officer we had there was a fellow called Strong.  And that position was 

taken over later on by one of our own, Nga Unuia.  And he did a great job.  Everytime 

I was in Auckland I checked on him, not necessarily because of protocol affairs, but 

because he and I grew up together in Avatiu.  And we talked about our old days.  And 

in  the  process  I  would  ask  him  how  the  work  w</span><span>as  going  and  he  would  say,  “fine”.  

And sometimes in the office I would see what he’s doing.  And he’s got a big list of 

Ministries’ all over Auckland, in all divisions of activities right in front of him. He has 

</span><span>immediate  access  to  everything  that  the  Cook  Islands  needed.    And  of  course,  the 

</span><span>personal  touch  is  very  important.    Nga  used  to  co-ordinate  the  requirements  of  the 

</span><span>Cook  Islands  Government  initiated  by  Treasury.    Everybody  sends  their  order  into 

Treasury  here  and  the  Treasury  sends  the  order  down  to  Nga,  then  Nga  canvasses 

Auckland, or New Zealand and even Australia to see which is the best price you can 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>221 

</span></div><div><span>get, the best product you can get for the orders from the Cook Islands.  And always, 

and I reiterate always, Nga gets the best deal for us.  Therefo</span><span>re, I’d like to urge and 

</span><span>encourage  the  Prime  Minister,  as  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,  to  please  seriously 

revisit this area.  It is for the sake of our people and if it is for the sake of our people, 

we should all be getting our heads, our hearts and our supports together to ensure that 

our people overseas, even our people over here are given the best service. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I hear the Prime Minister make mention, vaguely, about the possibility 

of  offices  elsewhere  in  the  World.    If  this  is  the  plan  of  Government  it  has  my  full 

support also.  Whilst the World is getting smaller through computers we need to be in 

touch with the World personally also.  We need to be positioned in strategic areas of 

the  World.    The  last  thing  we  need,  Mr  Chairman,  is  to  be  left  behind  in  ten  years 

time.  We  need  to  look  where  the  more  important  organisations  are  based.    We  talk 

about LOME.  We talk about the United Nations.  We talk about SPC.  We talk about 

ESCAP and it goes on.  But if we are not able to sit opposite the person concerned, 

the most important person concerned in those organisations and expect to have formal 

responses by way of e-mail on the other side of the World, forget it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Your last speaking time, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span> But what happens there, Mr Chairman, the e-mail will be put in 

</span><span>the tray called “Bring Up”.  Instead of the “Action Tray” and 10 years later it is still 

</span><span>waiting for it to be called up.  But if you are able to sit across the table of the Director-

General of LOME, the chances are that your request will be actioned pretty smartly.  

So Mr Prime Minister, you should be looking at places like Belgium, The seat of the 

</span><span>E.U.,  the  European  Union.    That’s  where  all  the  countries  with  big  money  are 

</span><span>concentrated.  You  should  be  looking  at  China.    China  has  become  our  biggest  ally 

now.  One of the biggest allies this country has, by virtue of our signing recently, a 

full  diplomatic  relations  with  that  country.    Not  a  token  relationship,  Mr  Chairman, 

but  a  full  diplomatic  relations  have  been  established  with  the  Peoples  Republic  of 

</span><span>China.    In  the  short  time  that  we  have  had  the  relationship  with  China,  we’ve  seen 

</span><span>benefits,  monetary  benefits  filter  into  this  country.    And  a  good  example,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman,  is  the  bridges  that’s  being  built  on  th</span><span>e  Vaimaanga  side  of  the  Island.  

</span><span>That’s  through  a  half  a  million  dollars  grant  from  the  Republic  of  China.    Now 

</span><span>imagine  also,  Mr  Chairman,  if  we  had  somebody  sitting  right  in  Peking  and  able  to 

talk with the President of China on a daily basis.  I think the benefit would multiply 

</span><span>many times.  I’m saying this, Mr Chairman, because I know of Western Samoa, our 

</span><span>neighbour Samoa.  When they established relations, diplomatic relations with China, 

they sent a man right into the heart of China.  In a short time the roading programme 

in  Samoa  took  off.    Their  National  Stadium,  the  Apia  Park,  was  rebuilt.    The 

reclamation  programme  on  their  wharf  and  their  Harbour,  was  Chinese  sponsored.  

The renovation of their Fono, that is their House of Parliament, was Chinese assisted.  

Those are only a few of the projects that I am aware of,  Mr Chairman, at this point in 

time.  But I believe there are many more.  That is why I say, Mr Chairman, we should 

be looking at this time at strategic areas.  I am not talking about opening up embassies 

</span><span>in any place.  I don’t even suggest at this stage, Mr Chairman, that we set up an office 

</span><span>at the U.N.  Because apart from it being, in my belief, a costly exercise at the U.N., I 

</span><span>believe there are benefits, big benefits to be derived for this country if we establish in 

other areas such as LOME and maybe in China.  Because with China we have access 

to  the  whole  of  Asia.  With  New  Zealand  we  have  access  to  Australia  and  our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>222 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>neighbours  in  the  Pacific.    Maybe  one  last  area  we  should  seriously  look  at,  Mr 

Chairman, is Fiji.  Closer to home.  Because in Fiji are the offices of a whole lot of  

international  organisations.    So,  there  we  are,  Mr  Chairman.    I  challenge  the  Prime 

Minister  and  the  Cabinet  to  revisit  this  area,  Foreign  Affairs,  in  terms  of  our 

representation in the outside World.  And if it is within the reach of our Budget in the 

future then I would urge and encourage you to seriously look at establishing offices in 

certain areas of the World.  I think we have a strong standing at the international level 

in  terms  of  Foreign  Affairs  by  virtue  of  credibility  being  brought  about  through  the 

visitations  by  our  people  to  overseas  countries.    By  the  calibre  of  debate  that  our 

people have engaged in overseas, therefore maybe the time is right to seriously look at 

representation for us in some of these places in the world.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  once  again  I  give  my  full  support  to  the  Foreign  Affairs  appropriation.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Deputy Prime Minister you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    I  stand  in  total  support  of  the 

Foreign  Affairs  vote  allocation.    Before  I  speak  on  the  matter  let  me  first  greet  you 

and Honourable Members in this House both in the Government and in Opposition.  I 

particularly want to thank the Leader of the Opposition and his team for providing us 

with the numbers today because we are short by two members.  This kind of gesture 

</span><span>does  not  escape  Government’s  attention.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  Leader  of  the 

</span><span>Opposition and his team.   

</span></div><div><span>In  expressing  my  views  on  this  allocation,  I  wish  to  thank  the  previous  High 

Commissioner to New Zealand Mr Jon Jonassen and his wife Diya.  Mr Chairman in 

the  short  time  that  Mr  Jon  Jonassen  was  in  Wellington,  he  has  captivated  the  Cook 

Islands  community,  built  up  a  strong  relationship  between  us  and  other  embassies.  

Our only regret is that he had to leave to take up a teaching post in Hawaii.  I am sure 

had he been given more time to serve in Wellington John would have achieved greater 

things for us.  Also I want to pay tribute to Mrs Teremoana Yala who has been acting 

as caretaker for the High Commission in Wellington.  Although her husband has taken 

up a church position in Palmerston North Mrs Yala has agreed to look after the office 

in the time that the High Commissioner has not been appointed.  She has to travel to 

Wellington by train every Monday and each weekend, she has to go back to be with 

her husband and family in Palmerston North.  I also want to say that during the time I 

was  in  Wellington  recently  she  did  a  magnificent  job  looking  after  me  and  my 

delegation.   

</span></div><div><span>I also take this opportunity to thank and compliment Mr Bill Teariki in Auckland, our 

Consul General, for his magnificent work that he has completed in Auckland over the 

past ten years.  Together with Rima Ngatoa they did a great job there and that office 

in fact has become an office with great potential to serve our people into the future.  

</span><span>There is so much space in the Auckland office.  There is a big conference room and so 

</span><span>many office spaces.  I am quite sure any travelling Member of Parliament could utilise 

it to do the work he has to do - to take interviews, to prepare letters, to meet people. 

There is enough space there to cater for that activity.  This is also a great venue for 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>223 

</span></div><div><span>entrepreneurs  or  business  people  instead  of  going  to  places  that  cost  money,  if  you 

want somewhere to do your work.  They have so many computers that should be able 

to be made available to them of course by arrangement with the Consul General. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, in looking at our Foreign Affairs vote item it gives me an opportunity 

to  say  to  the  House  and  our  people  listening  in  that  the  most  difficult  task  facing 

Government  is  appointing  diplomats  to  represent  us  overseas.    We  need  quality 

appointments, we need people who are educated so they understand the workings of 

the  diplomatic  community.    So  there  are  career  opportunities  in  Government.    I  am 

afraid many middle level executive personnel are ignoring that, they are not shaping 

themselves for diplomatic services. They can only come from the public service. 

</span></div><div><span>It  also  occurred  to  me  that  from  time  to  time  if  our  business  community  are  not  so 

busy  playing  politics,  generally  being  anti  community,  they  could  be  considered  for 

diplomatic posts.  Perhaps they should take diplomatic training at Trader Jacks. When 

you  look  at  it,  in  America  they  appoint  business  leaders  to  become  ambassadors 

overseas.   I would like to see this happen in this country but look at the choices we 

have.  The only one with the right qualifications at the moment is Piri Puruto.  That is 

</span><span>just a joke my bro’ won’t mind it.  It is a call of frustration to say shape up, there are 

</span><span>opportunities  from  the  business  community.    Let’s  look  at  business  leaders  to 

</span><span>represent us in these posts.  So I do urge our middle to senior level public servants to 

start  to  shape  up  for  a  career  in  the  diplomatic  service,  take  the  right  courses  to 

upgrade your standings. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman I shall stop to give the Leader of the Opposition a chance to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana again to everyone 

this afternoon.  Firstly I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for giving me 

some time to speak.  I think it is appropriate because we are trying to help them.  It is 

only right that they help us as well. 

</span></div><div><span>I was looking around the House earlier at two Members whom I have not seen in the 

House today.  I was asking the Honourable Dr Woonton if these people were sick and 

he said he has not provided them with any certificates yet.  I would like to thank the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  recognising  our  role  in  making  up  the  quorum  for  the 

House.  Maybe it is an appropriate time for me  to ask where this post is  of Roving 

Ambassador. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe this is also an appropriate moment for me to ask the Minister responsible for 

this portfolio, the Prime Minister, whether what he has said and has been recorded in 

the newspapers with regard to the post of Roving Ambassador, has been implemented 

or will be implemented.  

</span></div><div><span>I was listening to our colleague, the Honourable Member from Murienua encouraging 

</span><span>the  Prime  Minister  to  try  and  realise  the  dreams  he  has.    I  heard  that  it  might  be  a 

good  idea  for  us  to  have  an  office  in  China,  maybe  an  office  in  Belgium.  I  hear 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>224 

</span></div><div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Members in the House saying that it might be an idea for us to have an office in East 

Timor to help these people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  we  have  already  heard  of  the  Auckland,  the  Wellington,  the  Sydney 

and  the  Honolulu  Office.    Mr  Chairman,  what  is  going  on?    Have  our  people  not 

suffered  enough?  Particularly  in  regards  to  the  office  that  was  established  in 

Canberra?  I hear there was a settlement outside of Court.  I thought that this would go 

to  Court  because  this  is  stealing  public  money.    Was  I  wrong  in  saying  that  Mr 

Chairman?  This is one of the worst things that has happened to us. And if we are to 

let  this  go  the  Democratic  Alliance  Government  would  like  to  investigate  when  we 

become Government. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  ask  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the 

Government of today not to waste money setting up offices all over the world.  I think 

we have had enough problems with the Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  This is 

a disease that we need to get rid of.  Aitutaki has had its problems in the last couple of 

days.    I  heard  that  people  are  concerned  with  the  Port  Authority,  the  Airport 

Authority,  especially  the  landowners.  So,  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  I 

</span><span>ask  you  to  deal  with  our  home  problems  first.    Look  at  these  problems.    The  Cook 

</span><span>Islands  Investment  Corporation  is  alive  again.    I’m  concerned,  the  people  of  this 

</span><span>country are concerned.  I think we should look at these problems at home first before 

we start thinking of an </span><span>office in China, an office in Belgium. Don’t worry about the 

manganese.  We’ll just give this to Tapi and he will take care of it.  We’ve waited 30 

</span><span>years.  We can wait another ten years. 

</span></div><div><span>My biggest problem, Mr Chairman, is to look at these reciprocal arrangements that we 

can  put  in  place.    These  are  the  areas  that  I  think  we  should  look  at  and  get  our 

Auckland Office involved.  These are the aid programmes, the trade agreements and 

reciprocal agreements between communities. 

</span></div><div><span>We have been involved  with  the  Lome Convention during our time in  Government.  

We know the ins and outs.  We know the problems within and the problems without 

Lome.  There are other countries with the same status as ours.  There are others who 

want to join in. All these matters are in the pipeline and our presence in Belgium will 

not  make the slightest difference.   I  can assure  you of that. Our interests will all be 

pooled together for deliberations. There are about five countries who will be involved.  

We will not be discussed individually but as a group of countries. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Your second speech Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  I have maybe two minutes to go and I would like to speak 

on the subject brought up by the Honourable Dr Robert Woonton with regard to the 

statements made by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister.  I think this will 

have some adverse effect on our tourist industry.  My suggestion is, Mr Chairman, for 

the Prime Minister to set up with the Police an investigation into it and come up with 

a report so that the whole thing is  ascertained.  Get something done about it so it does 

</span><span>not  continue  to  be  a  complication  to  our  tourism  industry.    I  urge  the  Minister  of 

</span><span>Tourism to help do something about it. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you.  I will have my other turn tomorrow</span><span>.

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Yes,  you  can  continue  tomorrow  with  your  second  speech.    I 

noticed that for the last two sitting days the Leader of the Opposition has always had 

the last say. 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Minister in Charge of the Vote, the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported to Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
