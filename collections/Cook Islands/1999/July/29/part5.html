</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Before  we  go  on  to  the  next  part  of  our  business  for  today 

Honourable  Members,  I  would  first  like  to  congratulate  all  Members.  Firstly,  to  all 

former Members of Parliament who have been returned to Parliament, and to all the 

new Members of Parliament, especially to our two-sister Parliamentarian, Kia Orana.  

I am certain that we are all happy to see an increase in the women in our Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>Because this is my first opportunity to speak, I would like at this point to say Happy 

Birthday to the youngest in our family - Henry Puna who has his 50th birthday today.  

Let us move on. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member for Pukapuka/Nassau, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Part of Standing Order 5 be suspended to allow the House to  

transact other businesses and for the election of the Deputy Speaker  

to be taken at some future date 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. Is there a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Upoko Simpson 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers?  The  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Honourable  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  First, congratulations to you Mr 

Speaker on attaining this very prestigious position and I think this is a better position 

</span><span>for you.  Don’t go to Wellington.  Here, I am able to keep an eye on you.  I believe 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>8 

</span></div><div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>that  this  honour  that  has  been  bestowed  upon  you  is  something  which  you  have  the 

ability to discharge effectively. 

</span></div><div><span>So, to you Mr Speaker and to your staff members, Kia Orana. Kia Orana also to all the 

Honourable Members of this House.  Kia Orana to the Prime Minister of this country, 

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Kia  Orana.  To  all  Honourable  Ministers  and  to  all 

Members  in  Government,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    To  all  of  you  who  are  thinking  of 

coming to this side, Kia Orana also to you.  Kia Orana to all our Members on this side 

of the House and especially to our beautiful Mama Members of Parliament, Kia Orana 

to you all.  I would like our people to know Mr Speaker that these two ladies are in the 

Democratic Alliance Party and there are no ladies on the other side of this House.   

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  to  all  the  people  in  the  public  gallery.  I  can  see  that  you  have  arrived  to 

support  us  in  Parliament.    Kia  Orana  especially  to  all  the  Mama  supporting  us,  the 

</span><span>men in Parliament and our two lady MP’s. Kia Orana to the few men who are here to 

</span><span>offer  their  support.    To  our  people  who  are  listening  in  to  us.  To  those  people  who 

were on the road to express their disappointments, Kia Orana. Greetings to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I don’t know what direction we have for the businesses of this House this 

afternoon, but we are here.  I don’t know why we did not make the appointment of the 

</span><span>Deputy Speaker this afternoon because we on this side of the House are ready for that.  

We have nobody to contest this appointment.  We made our recommendation for the 

Speaker  of  the  House  and  was  not  successful.    But  for  the  position  of  the  Deputy 

Speaker we are ready to give our support to whoever Government wish to nominate.  I 

am registering our support so we do not want to waste the time of our people in this 

House.   

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  sit  down  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  extend  my  Greetings  to  the  Prime 

Minister  for  </span><span>stepping  down from  this  most Honourable position.  I don’t know how 

</span><span>this has come about, but I am very suspicious Mr Speaker.  Anyhow Sir, maybe you 

</span><span>have decided that you’ve had enough in running our country.  </span></div><div><span>I do not know who will be appointed today to lead this nation but I am sure we will 

make an appointment that will be satisfactory to those people who are on the road this 

afternoon expressing their feelings. It was hard for me to see these people raising their 

placards and voicing their opinion. This is the first time such an event of this nature 

has occurred and I feel this is not a good sign.  I think my time is up. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span>Point of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>There is a point of order on the Floor. What is your point of order 

Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:  </span><span>At least the Honourable Member has said his time is up so I 

will  not  bring  this  point  of  order  before  the  House.    He  was  talking  about  wasting 

</span><span>people’s time but he was wasting our time.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Are there any further speakers?  There appears to be none so I will 

now put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>29th July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>9 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We shall move on to the next business. The Honourable Member Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span>Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order No. 220 be suspended in order that the Bill  

on Notice may be presented forthwith 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>May I call for a Seconder to the Motion?  

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? There appear to be none.  I will now put the question.  The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

I have a Message to read to the Honourable House.
