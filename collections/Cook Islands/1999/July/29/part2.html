</span></div><div><span>DR. WOONTON: </span><span>Mr Chairman, I do have that consent from Mr Short. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:</span><span> May I have it please?

to this Honourable House. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>Can you confirm whether you have the consent of Mr 

Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span>Yes, I have here his written consent.   

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>The  name  of  Mr  Ngereteina  Puna,  OBE  has  been 

nominated  by  the  Honourable  Inatio  Akaruru  and  I  have  the  consent  of  the

</span></div><div><span>3 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  J.  MARURAI:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  Honourable  Members  of  this  House,  it  is  my 

pleasure to second the nomination of Mr Ngereteina Puna as Speaker of this House.   

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:</span><span>    The  name  of  the  Honourable  Ngereteina  Puna,  OBE 

has  been  nominated  by  the  Honourable  Inatio  Akaruru  and  seconded  by  the 

Honourable Jim Marurai and I have evidence here that he has consented to that.  I now 

call for further nominations?  If there is none, can a Member move that we close the 

nominations? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>Clerk of the House, I would like to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the nominations be closed</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Mr Clerk, I second that. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>Moved  by  the  Honourable  Tepure  Tapaitau  and 

Seconded  by  the  Hon.  Tupou  Faireka  that  nominations  be  closed.    I  would  call  for 

voice votes. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The election of the Speaker will now move forward and I would like to ask the Clerk-

Assistant to give out the ballot papers. We will decide on the Speaker using the ballot.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Mr Clerk, I’d like to request that the voting for both the 

</span><span>Speaker and the Prime Minister be shown either by raising of hands or by standing.  In 

fact Mr Clerk, I so move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the above be the procedure for the election of both the Speaker and the 

Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>Motion has been moved. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> And I second the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>We will now proceed with the election of the Speaker 

by rising in your seats or by vote of hands.  Yes, I shall hear the Honourable Terepai 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I stand to oppose the Motion.  I 

believe that Members should be given their right to vote by secret ballot and I think 

</span><span>there’s  nothing  wrong  with  that.  And if that is  according to  the  </span><span>Standing Orders of 

this House, I certainly would like you to implement that.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>4 

</span></div><div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Mr Clerk ......(inaudible)</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE: </span><span>The Honourable Member Dr Maoate has the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Excuse me, I’m the first on the Floor.  Mr Clerk, I’m in support 

</span><span>of  the  Motion  that  we  rise  or  have  a  show  of  hands.  I  think  you  could  test  that  by 

asking  the  majority.    This  is  a  voting  procedure,  we  are  not  satisfied  with  a  secret 

ballot  and  if  it  is  a  Standing  Order  which  requires  us  to  do  as  demanded  by  the 

Opposition then an indication from us by voting in the affirmative shows that we must 

suspend the Standing Order.  It is our wish to have the election procedures by rising to 

our feet or by a show of hands and quite clearly you should put that to a vote.   

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:</span><span>  The Honourable Dr Woonton will be the last person to 

speak on this.   

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Mr Chairman, Clerk of the House, it is not within your powers 

to suspend any Standing Orders of this Parliament.  Unless we vote for the Speaker of 

this House only then, we would be able to change or suspend any Standing Orders of 

this House.  There is no Constitutional Power vested in you Mr Chairman.  As Clerk 

of the House you do not take any amendments or suspend any Standing Order of this 

House.  So therefore, I will insist for you as Chairman of this meeting this morning to 

follow  the  Standing  Order  No.  10  of  the  Parliament  of  the  Cook  Islands.  This 

stipulates the election of the Speaker of this House to be conducted through a secret 

ballot.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS: </span><span>Mr Clerk, could you allow me, just a short moment please.</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:</span><span>  I have indicated that the Honourable Dr Woonton will 

be the last speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  already  we  are  experiencing  a  domineering 

attitude from the crowd on the other side. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>I would ask the Honourable Member to resume his seat. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span> I will insist strongly Mr Clerk that you follow the rules of the 

House, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:    </span><span>I  would  ask  both  Honourable  Members  to  take  your 

seats.  The procedure of the House is straight forward and the Motion has come before 

the House. I want to go further and proceed with the work of the House.  The work of 

the House is that we proceed with the election of the Speaker and we have a Motion 

but I will not accept the Motion as of now. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span> Thank you Mr Clerk. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>We  proceed  with  the  ballot.    I  will  ask  the  Clerk-

Assistant to distribute the papers and I would like to advise the Honourable Members 

to  indicate on your ballot  paper the 2 name of your choice  - the first name is Iaveta 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>29th July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>5 

</span></div><div><span>Short.  Any form  that denotes that the name coins  to Iaveta Short will be taken, Mr 

Short,  Iaveta.  I just want  to  make this clear and the same applies to the Honourable 

Ngereteina  Puna.  Ngereteina  or  Puna  will  be  sufficient.  I  would  encourage  you  to 

write the names as given to you but in the event that a ballot paper may be returned to 

me with other names for that person, then we will consider that.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask the Honourable Inatio Akaruru if you can be the scrutineer for Mr 

</span><span>Ngereteina Puna and for Mr Short’s scrutineer to be the Honourable Dr Robert 

</span><span>Woonton.   

</span></div><div><span>We now proceed with the counting of the Ballot.   

</span></div><div><span>(Ballot counted by the Clerk Assistant and scrutinised by the Hon. Pupuke 

Robati for Mr Iaveta Short and Hon. Inatio Akaruru for Mr Ngereteina Puna) 

</span></div><div><span>The result is 13 in favour of Mr. N. Puna, and 12 in favour of Mr I Short:
