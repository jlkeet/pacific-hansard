</span></div><div><span>Thank  you  very  much  and  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Williams,  Prime 

Minister-Elect. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to reply to this 

Motion.  First,  let  me  congratulate  you  for  your  appointment  as  the  Speaker  of  this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>29th July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>15 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament.  From your performance so far you sound as though you have been in the 

Chair for a long long time. 

</span></div><div><span>If  this  is  the  way  you  are  going  to  run  the  businesses  of  the  House,  our  Parliament 

sittings will be very short.  Congratulations.   

</span></div><div><span>To the out going Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Henry and Lady Henry, Kia Orana.  I 

said before that the act that you did in stepping down is a very noble and dignified act.  

I am sorry that it has to come this way, but such is the political game.  I salute you Sir 

for all the work that you have done for this country.  For your illustrious career that 

spanned over a period of 30+ years.  Despite our indifferences in the past, despite the 

</span><span>criticisms that I hurled at you, politically of course, I and the rest of this House, I’m 

</span><span>sure all of the Members will join me in saluting you for what you have done for this 

country.   

</span></div><div><span>The Cabinet Ministers, Kia Orana also to you.  The Leader of the Opposition, thank 

you  very  much  for  your  confidence.    To  all  the  Members  of  the  House,  particularly 

this  side  of  the  House,  thank  you  for  the  confidence  that  you  have  in  me  to  be  the 

Prime  Minister  of  this  country.  To  our  people  in  the  gallery,  inside  and  outside 

Parliament, a very very big Kia Orana to you all.    

</span></div><div><span>I want to make a special Kia Orana to my two colleagues sitting on the other side of 

</span><span>the House. Although we’re divided, the future may bring us together again, that’s my 

</span><span>hope. I want to tell this House and I want to tell the people of the Cook Islands, that I 

</span><span>didn’t want this job. I haven’t s</span><span>lept for more than 2 nights. This has been forced upon 

me by circumstances, political events. The man that should be standing here is sitting 

on the other side.  But when it came to the decision that was given to the two of us, he 

forced it on me.  But I want to give him the satisfaction in knowing that the decision 

that  he  made  was  the  right  one  because  Caucus  would  have  voted  unanimously  for 

</span><span>me.   But thank you colleagues.  It’s not going to be an easy job.  Particularly where 

there’s so much division in </span><span>the nation and so much division in this House, but I am 

satisfied that one move is to unite the Cook Islands Party. That is what we have done.  

And  I  pray  that  the  Cook  Islands  Party  will  stay  united  now  and  in  the  future.    

</span><span>There’s a lot of hard work ahe</span><span>ad as the saying goes, </span><span>united we stand, divided we fall.   

</span></div><div><span>I’m asking this House to follow the example of the Leader of the Opposition when we 

</span><span>passed this Motion of confidence in me.  That is the sign we need, to be united in this 

House.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I must tell this House that the past 2 days have been a very difficult one 

for my wife, Jill - </span><span>sitting in the gallery there.  And I’m sure it’s been a very difficult 

</span><span>time  for  all  of  us  because  this  has  been  the  period  of  political  upheaval,  of turmoil. 

There has never been a General Election like this in the history of the Cook Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Very soon,  I’ll be seeing His Excellency, the Queen’s Representative for the second 

</span><span>time  in  a few days. I’m hoping that he won’t  look  at  me as though to  say, what  the 

</span><span>heck are you doing here?  

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>16 

</span></div><div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Finally  Mr  Speaker,  thank  you  Members  of  Parliament  for  the  confidence  that  has 

been given to me.  It is the highest honour that anybody can be given and the highest 

privilege - to occupy the highest office in the land. And for that, I am humbled.  All I 

have to say is that I and the team will do our best for the people of the Cook Islands. 

Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Prime  Minister  elect.  Before  I  call  on  an  Honourable 

Member for the adjournment Motion, may I say to the out-going Prime Minister, the 

Honourable  Sir  Geoffery  Henry  and  Lady  Henry,  God  bless  you  and  thank  you  for 

your service to our country.  

</span></div><div><span>And  to  the  Prime  Minister  elect,  the  Honourable  Dr  Joseph  Williams  and your dear 

wife, Jill, may God bless you as you take on this responsibility in running our country.  

</span><span>Thank  you  very  much.  Just  before  I  call.................  I’m  sorry  Honourable  Inatio 

</span><span>Akaruru, I just want to make this announcement. 

</span></div><div><span>That the Clerk, his staff and I are planning to run a series of workshops for our new 

Members  of  Parliament.  Therefore,  I  will  just  give  you  this  advance  warning.    In 

1994, we did a similar workshop programme.  The Clerk has just indicated to me that 

the workshop will run on Wednesday 18th, Thursday 19th and Friday 20th of August. 

So if you can put  that in  your diary. The Honourable new Members, please because 

you  will  find  this  workshop  very  very  useful  as  you  begin  your  political  career,  we 

need you here. 

</span></div><div><span>The Clerk will get in touch with each one of you in due course. Honourable Members, 

we have come to the end of our sitting for today and I would like to congratulate and 

thank you all for your support and co-operation in my first day in Parliament.  I now 

call upon the Honourable Member Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span>Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House do now adjourn until Wednesday the 25th of August  

1999 at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Just a brief comment on this Motion. Our people know we are near to the Constitution 

Celebrations, the day the Cook Islands became Self Governing.  We would all like to 

</span><span>be able to help with the Constitution Celebrations Committee to celebrate the day we 

</span><span>became Self-Governing.  Besides that Mr Speaker this will also be an opportune time 

</span><span>for the new Prime Minister and his Cabinet to set Government’s pr</span><span>ogramme in place 

in  preparation  for  when  we  once  again  sit  in  this  House.    For  the  new  Members  of 

Parliament this will be an opportune time for you to go through the Appropriation Bill 

presented to us and also to go through the Estimates.  When we come back then we 

will be able to discuss that in order that we have a Budget in place,  so that the work 

of the country does not stop.  I believe both sides of the House would like to support 

the  Motion  and  if  the  Opposition  would  like  to  stay  back  they  can  and  we  will  go 

</span><span>home. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>May I call for a Seconder to the Motion?   

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>29th July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>17 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tepure Tapaitau.   

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  I call on the Honourable Leader of the Opposition Dr Terepai 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana again.  Mr Speaker I stand 

to  express  my  disappointments  to  this  Motion.    Not  because  we  are  to  adjourn  but 

because of what the Honourable Inatio Akaruru just said to us a while ago, that is to 

delay  the  debate  of  the  Budget  to  the  25th  of  next  month.    I  think  it  is  a  sign  that 

shows failure.   

</span></div><div><span>However I am not sure whether the Prime Minister elect is aware of the move but if so 

I am already disappointed with this.  What are we going to do?  Are we going to dance 

in  the  next  few  days?    Are  we  going  to  celebrate  the  new  Prime  Minister  by  doing 

nothing except  dancing?  Where is  the responsibility of dealing with  the Budget Mr 

Speaker?  Where is the priority of this Government?  This is the most important thing, 

to run the country, to pay you and to make sure that money is appropriated and things 

are done properly. I have seen some abuse already.  I have already seen that.  There 

are people driving cars when they are not supposed to, expenditures are being made 

that  should  not  have  been  done.  This  is  an  opportunity  when  the  Budget  should  be 

debated.  We should be on our feet doing that.  What are we doing now?  Come on 

Prime Minister elect, put your weight on this unnecessary Motion.  

</span></div><div><span>I  do  not  blame  anybody.    These  are  the  people  who  have  been  running  the  country 

before.    They  have  already  changed  the  Prime  Minister  in  the  House  and  they  have 

</span><span>changed  the  procedures.    Let’s  get  these young people on to  the job.   These are old 

</span><span>tactics, I want to get rid of those old tactics.  The workshop, the celebrations, all those 

things  are  a  waste  of  money.    We  should  be  concentrating  on  the  budget  instead  of 

talking about these things.  I am concerned with the motion because of the element of 

contempt the Honourable Member showed in his motion. He mentioned about getting 

other  business  prepared  to  be  brought  into  the  House.  We  already  have  the  most 

important business before the House.  If we were coming into Government then there 

is justification for that to be delayed a little for us to look at.  But this is your budget, 

why delay?  Is there anything wrong in the budget you prepared that you do not want 

us to go through now?   

</span></div><div><span>Maybe the Mayors in the Outer Islands still expect money to do their job and you have 

</span><span>not been able to appropriate that yet. Tell me, what is the excuse for the delay? Tell 

me.  This is such an important business. I think we should be dealing with within the 

next couple of weeks.  This is already showing the failure of this Government in this 

House.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition. The Honourable 

Paora Teiti.   

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. Congratulations to you in your new position 

</span><span>and may the Lord help you in your new job.  To the Prime Minister elect Kia Orana to 

you  in  the  name  of  our  lord  and  may  He  bless  and  help  you  in  your  new  position.  

Honourable Members in the House, Kia Orana to you.  Kia Orana also to the ladies in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18 

</span></div><div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the gallery.  I won’t be long Mr Speaker.  I did not really intend to speak but because 

</span><span>of the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition I had to speak.  When I speak 

in this House I always try to remember what I am saying in relation to what happens in 

the future. 

</span></div><div><span>This is not the first time the Honourable Member has said we are spending too much 

time  on  celebrations.    And  that  we  do  not  spend  time  discussing  important  issues.  

Earlier  he  said  we have been wasting time without realising what  he said.  Yet  he is 

wasting our time. 

</span></div><div><span>In the explanation presented by the Honourable Member, Inatio Akaruru I believe that 

we  are  all  adults  and  we  are  wise  enough  to  understand  that  this  will  give  the 

opportunity to the Prime Minister alone and to the Cabinet to go through and plan the 

work  of  Government  for  the  future.    It  will  also  give  us  time  to  celebrate  our 

Constitution Day.  This will give us an opportunity to study the Appropriation Bill and 

the Estimates so that when we do return we will know what we are speaking of.  In 

</span><span>order that we don’t speak about bananas and </span><span>tarotarua </span><span>but the Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  why  I  rose,  Mr  Speaker.    I  believe  if  you  say  something,  you  should  try  to 

figure out  whether somebody is  listening to  what  you are saying or whether you are 

listening to yourself. 

</span></div><div><span>It  would not really matter, Mr Speaker, if we were to discuss the Appropriation Bill 

today  or  not  because  the  work  will  still  go  ahead  and  we  can  come  back  into  this 

House whenever it is deemed appropriate for us to come back. If I was to become a 

Minister, Mr Speaker, then where would I find the time to go through and look at all 

the business that is required of me.   Because we are going to be coming back on the 

25th  August.  This  gives  me  a  lot  of  time  to  prepare  myself  if  I  was  to  become  a 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>This is very clear, Mr Speaker, and I would like to move that I be the last speaker on 

this issue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you.  I  now  call  on  the  Honourable  Member,  Aunty  Mau 

Munokoa, the Member of Parliament for Nikao. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Mr Speaker, my village people and I would like to thank the 

Lord for your appointment as Speaker of this Honourable House. Thank you also to 

the staff of this House. It is your responsibility to help the Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to you, to the Honourable Sir Geoffrey Henry and to Aunty Louisa.  I 

would like to thank and commend you as you have put your very prestigious title into 

a very humble position.  I believe that this is the will of the Lord and also your will, 

for your Party to be united. 

</span></div><div><span>We will leave that matter there. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>29th July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>19 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  now  say  Kia  Orana  to  you  Prime  Minister-Elect  and  to  your  dear wife and  to 

your family and to your children. Kia Orana also to all the Honourable Members on 

my side.  My Leader, my Deputy Leader, and all the Honourable Members would like 

to congratulate you Prime Minister elect and we trust that you and your Party will be 

able to lead our country well. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  come  back  now  to  the  issues  mentioned  earlier.  With  regard  to  the 

comments  made  by  my  Leader  on  the  finances  or  appropriation.   I think my friends 

that we should all realise that we came into this House to discuss the finances of this 

country and you should also realise that we are the Opposition in this House.  What he 

said  is  quite  true.    Although  we  are  going  through  a  period  when  we  will  be 

celebrating  the  self  governing  status  of  our  country,  had  we  become  Government  I 

would  like  to  assure  you  that  we  would  not  leave  the  Budget  too  long.    We  would 

have one week off and then go into the deliberations for our Appropriation.  Maybe 

the Appropriation that we have before us are just figures without the actual money.  I 

strongly support my Leader. 

</span></div><div><span> That  is  alright,  we  will  be  debating  the  Appropriations  on  the  25th  August.  

Tomorrow we will start the celebration of our Constitution and I would like to submit 

to you that some of the Members who are talking about going out to celebrate would 

</span><span>not  turn up, even those from  the Government side. They don’t all come to celebrate 

</span><span>our Constitution Day.  I only see our Prime Minister and some of the Ministers but not 

all  Members  are  there  to  celebrate.    Although  our  team  is  small,  meaning  the 

Opposition side I make sure that we are there to celebrate this day. 

</span></div><div><span>I haven’t seen the program yet.  Maybe tomorrow we start.  The school children will 

</span><span>be performing at the Auditorium and I would like everybody to come over to celebrate 

the day with our children. I was in New Zealand just recently, Mr Speaker. We were 

there with you Mr Speaker. We were talking about our culture in our country. I shared 

our culture with the participants at that CPA conference. 

</span></div><div><span>Let us all join together in thi</span><span>s celebration. On the 25th, let’s all come back for some 

</span><span>lively  debate.  Those  of  our  people  who  came  to  witness  the  swearing  in  of  the 

Members, the election of various leaders of the country, we jointly wish to thank you 

very much. I would like to thank you dear friends who have come into the Parliament 

Chamber this afternoon. I have to speak in my own tongue but we have the Interpreter 

over there to interpret for the sake of those who are not able to grasp what I am saying. 

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member  for  Nikao/Panama.  I  now  call  on 

the  Honourable  Member,  Robert  Wigmore,  Member  of  Parliament for Titikaveka to 

make his maiden speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. WIGMORE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. Kia Orana to all Honourable Members 

of Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen. To all the people listening in around the Cook 

</span><span>Islands. Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise,  Mr  Speaker,  to  give  my  support  to  the  views  aired  by  our  Leader  on  the 

Opposition side.  First of all I would like at this time to extend to you on behalf of my 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>20 

</span></div><div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Constituency,  our  congratulations  to  you  Mr  Speaker  for  your  appointment  to  this 

position as Speaker of the House. 

</span></div><div><span> I  would  also  like  at  this  time  on  behalf  of  my  constituency  to  extend  to  you  the 

Honourable  Dr  Joseph  Williams,  our  congratulations  for  being  elected  as  Prime 

Minister for the country.  To the out-going Prime Minister, Honourable Sir Geoffery 

Henry  and  Lady  Henry.  Thank  you  for  the  great  job  that  you  have  done  for  our 

country, may God bless you.  To our radio listeners, I would like to say Kia Orana to 

you  all  and  I  understand  that  there  are  a  lot  of  you  out  there  listening  in  to  this 

broadcast.  And because I am new in Parliament and I will say right now even though 

I have been here for a very  short time,  I feel I  have already got the taste of the place.   

</span></div><div><span>I will not prolong my debate Mr Speaker.  I am concerned that we will be delaying the 

debate on our Budget  for some time. Three weeks in fact. Our job Mr Speaker is to 

take  heed  of  the  needs  of  our  nation.  I  am  not  complaining  that  we  have  to  take  a 

break, rather I am concerned with the length of the adjournment. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to respond to the views aired by my friend earlier with regard to money, 

bananas and </span><span>tarua</span><span>. I would like to say that bananas and the </span><span>tarua</span><span> should be rated first 

and the money last because you have to export your produce first before you can reap 

the dollars. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  also  heard  the  views  about  our  Constitution  Celebration  and  we  are 

encouraged to go there and participate in this celebration.  Let us all go and support 

this event.  Then we can all come back and deal with the Appropriation Bill. May God 

bless you all.</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member  Robert  Wigmore.    Are  there  any 

further speakers?  There appears to be none.  I will now put the question.  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>We now close our meeting with a prayer. I call an Honourable Member to lead us with 

</span><span>a prayer.
