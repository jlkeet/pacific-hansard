</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Minister of Finance Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>10 

</span></div><div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK OF PARLIAMENT: </span><span>Short Title Reads: Appropriation Act 1999. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Would you name the date and time for the Second Reading of the 

Bill, please? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:  </span><span>During the next sitting of Parliament Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister of Finance. The Second Reading of 

the Appropriation Bill 1999 has been ordered for the next sitting of Parliament. While 

the  Clerk  is  giving  out  your  Estimates,  we  shall  move  on.  Our  next  item  is  the 

suspension of Standing Order. I now call on the Honourable Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Standing Orders be suspended to the extent necessary in order 

 that a Motion of confidence can be dealt with forthwith 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. I call for a Seconder to the Motion.   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara, 

Honourable Teina Bishop. 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers  to  the  Motion?    There  appear  to  be  none.    I  will  put  the 

question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We will move to the next item on the agenda, which is the Motion of confidence.  I 

now  call  on  the  mover  of  the  Motion  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  Sir  Geoffrey 

Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.  A.  HENRY:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  Greetings  to  all  Honourable 

Members and to our people here to observe our meeting this afternoon.  Greetings to 

</span><span>you all.  Greetings to you Mr Speaker. We offer you our sincere respect for the honour 

</span><span>you attained in the position you now hold. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  that  you  have  returned  from  the  Queen’s  Representative  after  claiming  the 

</span><span>freedom of speech and all privileges on behalf of this Honourable House, I commit to 

you  our  acknowledgment  of  your  appointment  and  give  our  support  in  our  future 

deliberations. Should there be a Member in the Opposition who becomes a nuisance 

you  have  the  authority  to  expel  them  from  this  Chamber.  Do not  be like the former 

Speaker Raututi Taringa. He was very sympathetic of the Opposition and reluctant to 

exercise that power.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to move: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>29th July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>11 

</span></div><div><span>That this House has Confidence in the appointment of the Honourable  

Dr Joseph Williams as Prime Minister of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  let  you  know  Mr  Speaker  that  the  caucus  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party  met.  

There were 11 of us. On that day, the 11 gave their Confidence to the Honourable Dr 

Williams.  This  morning  the  caucus  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party  has  dropped  to  9. 

However, the 9 remaining Members of the Cook Islands Party through me, are united 

in  the  Motion  that  the  Honourable  Dr  Joseph  Williams  be  the  Prime  Minister.  The 

combined caucus of the Cook Islands Party and the New Alliance Party also supported 

the same Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Again Mr Speaker, I am moving: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House express its confidence in the Honourable  

Dr. Joseph William to be Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Point of Order Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> A Point of Order has been called Honourable Geoffrey Henry. The 

Honourable Dr Robati, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>We don’t seem to be following our Orders for the Day Mr Speaker.  

If there is a Motion, let’s have it included on the Orders of the day. </span><span>I believe that our 

last business is the Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you very much Honourable Dr Pupuke Robati. We approved 

the  Motion  to  suspend  Standing  Orders  to  the  extent  that the Motion of Confidence 

can  be  dealt  with  forthwith  and  the  Motion  was  carried  without  any  dissension.  

Therefore this gives this Honourable House the ability to receive this Motion from the 

Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Member. Are there any other . . .Yes, Prime Minister, continue 

with your speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. I thought, Mr Speaker, that now 

this Honourable Member is sitting on this side of the House he would support us. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Mr Speaker, Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  I  can  see  that  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Robert 

Woonton  has  been  seated  beside  the  Honourable  Dr  Joseph  Williams.  Likewise  the 

Honourable Dr. Robati.  Maybe this is a pre-planned move by these members. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>Point  of  Order.  Irrelevancy  in  Debate.  Would  the  Prime 

Minister please come back to the matter on the Floor?  He is irrelevant. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>12 

</span></div><div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  Well  as  I  have  pointed  out  earlier,  in  the  combined 

meeting of both the NAP and the CIP Members, we all gave our unanimous support to 

the appointment of the Honourable Joe Williams as Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Mr Prime Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Norman George 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr  Speaker,  I  have  the  honour  and  privilege  to  second  the 

Motion. The whole country and the people in Parliament and around Parliament today 

</span><span>are anxious  that this  matter be dispensed with as quickly as possible, so let’s get o</span><span>n 

with it. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  A  Motion  has  been  moved  and 

seconded.  Would you please take your seat?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a request of the Honourable House that you allow me to put the question.  You 

all know whether you are going to vote yes or vote no. That would eliminate the need 

to have painful debate because I feel it is a simple matter. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>It’s not simple.  No, you are not going to get away with it.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Excuse me Honourable Member. Order. That is my request. My first 

request  to  this  Honourable  House  as  your  new  Speaker.  So  the  Motion  has  been 

moved and seconded and I will put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>Mr Speaker, you didn’t give us a chance and I don’t think 

that’s fair.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  being  able  to  have  patience  with  your 

decision.  Otherwise, we would have a problem in the future. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  extend  to  the  Honourable  Dr  Williams  congratulations  for  being 

</span><span>nominated by the Members on Government’s side. We shall wait whether everybody 

</span><span>is supportive of this nomination. I am suspicious that there are a couple who will not 

give their support to you because when these people came with their placards I saw a 

couple  of  them  keeping  a  close  eye  on  those  particular  Members.  So  Honourable 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>29th July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>13 

</span></div><div><span>Member, Joe Williams, now is the time for you. I know this is a big task, it is a big 

resp</span><span>onsibility.    This  is  the  time  to  test  your  integrity  in  this  position.    Don’t  be 

</span><span>lopsided in  your decisions.  Consider our position from the Opposition.  I will warn 

you because so far you people have 13 Members and on the Opposition side we have 

12. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker.  Point of Order Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Because if you people wish to travel in the future you will 

have difficulties. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  What  is  your  Point  of  Order  the  Honourable  Member,  Tepure 

Tapaitau, Member for Penrhyn? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.  Mr  Speaker,  is  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition today allowed to make a political statement in this House rather than this 

House, Mr Speaker, dealing with the Motion as to the election of the Prime Minister 

of this country?  I thought, Mr Speaker, that all those opportunities and chances have 

arisen in the past over the television and the radio. Three months have gone past and 

we  are  here  today  to  address  the  question  of  the  election  of  a  new  Leader  for  this 

nation. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  have  thought  Mr  Speaker  that  they  would  rise  in  the  House  to  make  their 

nomination  so  that  the  Honourable  Members  can  get  on  with  the  business  of  the 

House as quickly as possible.  That is the Point of Order Mr Speaker and I ask that the 

matter  of  the  election  of  the  Prime  Minister  be  dealt  with  forthwith,  Mr  Speaker.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister. The Point of Order is upheld. This 

is  the reason  why I have asked if we can go straight into the election. However,  the 

Leader  of  the  Opposition  has  already  started  to  make  a  statement.  Will  you  please 

carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr speaker. I can safely say now that you are 

</span><span>No.1.  The only thing I can say is that I didn’t see what his Point of Order was.</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Irrelevancy Mr Speaker.  He knows what it was. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  I  rose  Mr  Speaker,  to  congratulate  the  Honourable 

Member, Dr Joseph Williams.  Now is there anything wrong with that?  Maybe they 

want me to criticise him because of the people who are outside of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Will you please carry on Leader of the Opposition? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  This  is  a  good  Motion  but  I  feel  sorry  for  the  Prime 

Minister because he was forced to move this Motion to make it look good. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>14 

</span></div><div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July 1999 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  hope  that  we  will  be  able  to  work  well  under  your  leadership  as  new  Prime 

Minister. All I ask is that you remember us because if I leave this Chamber, everybody 

on this side of the House will walk out with me. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Leader  of  the  Opposition.  Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  There appears to be none.  I will now put the question and I am asking the 

Honourable Members to please, stand in your seats when you vote.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Those in favour please stand.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much Honourable Members, and to the contrary please stand.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>The result is 13 in favour of the Motion, and 12 against.
