<div><span>PARLIAMENT RESUMED 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>The Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>   Mr Speaker, I wish to report that the Companies Amendment 

Bill is progressing slowly in the Committee of the Whole. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I would like to  move that this sitting be extended 

until the completion of the third reading of Companies Amendment Bill.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister. Can I have a seconder?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tangata Vavia</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T.  MAOATE:</span><span>Mr Speaker, I wish to speak to the Motion.  I don’t see the 

</span><span>reason behind the extension of this sitting. I know that the Government Members are 

not happy with my prolonged debate on these Clauses.</span></div><div><span>HON. I AKARURU:</span><span> Point of Order.  The Motion is that we extend the sitting. The 

Motion is not about the anger of the Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  The point of order is in order 

Honourable Member.  Please come back to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I am totally opposed to the Motion 

that is being put forward by the Minister of Agriculture.  Why, because I feel sorry for 

you and for your staff.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Before you continue, let me put the question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: ……..</span></div><div><span>Please take your seat Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Am I going to speak or not? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Please take your seat. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I want your ruling Mr Speaker please. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Will you please sit down? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> I have obeyed your ruling. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  have  not  put  the  question  yet.    I  will  now  put  the  question.  The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Member  please  take  your  seat.  Now  we  have  a  business  to  debate.  

Remember  that  when  the  Speaker  speaks,  the  Speaker  must  be  heard.    Now  the 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>Mr Speaker, I don’t want  to  give up my right  to  speak. I 

</span><span>stood up at the right time and I obeyed your orders. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> You are arguing with the Chair Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> What is your ruling Mr Speaker?  I have the right to speak 

because there is a Motion on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  As the Mover of the Motion 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> You have the right to  speak, but  look  at  the time. You are correct 

Honourable Member but time will not allow us to debate this.  We have to make the 

</span><span>decision before 9 o’clock.</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  I  apologise  for  what  I  said  but  because  the  Motion  was 

made I argued for my rights. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Take your seat Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 41</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1909 

</span></div><div><span>I now resolve Parliament into the Committee of the Whole 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 13 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you for your earlier ruling.  I 

would like to send greetings to my Constituency of Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> We are now on Clause 13. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> I will come back to Clause 13. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order.  Under Standing Orders our sitting must be 

on the air.  If the debate is no longer on the air I am asking that the House adjourn. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 13 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Mr Chairman, are we on the air now? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Yes, we are. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Coming  to  fees  with  regard  to  the 

relevant  Section  in  the  Companies  Act  of  1970  and  1971.    If  we  are  looking  to 

increasing the fees we will see it is an increase of more than 1000%.  To me this is a 

very  heavy  burden  on  our  people.   These are not  the only changes.  There are other 

changes during the time of the reform. 

</span></div><div><span>If we look at the increase in fees for a work permit it is up to $1000. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order. The fees before the House now have nothing 

to  do  with  Immigration  fees  or  any  other  fees.    I  wish  to  ask  the  Members  of  the 

Opposition, what is wrong with you? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  floor.  The  Point  of  Order  is 

relevant.  It is quite in order. Come back to the Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> I will come back to the Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please  apologise  to  the  Speaker  for  being  too  rough  when 

addressing the Speaker. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 42</a></div><div><span>1910 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> I want to know how I was hard on you. I need to know what my 

fault is. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> I am only asking you to apologise.  The chance to speak belongs 

to the Deputy Prime Minister, not you. You were shouting at me as if I was a dog. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> I apologise Mr Chairman, if I seem to be barking like a dog.  I 

would  like  you  to  understand  why  it  was  like  that.  I  have  seen  in  some  cases  your 

rulings have not been correct. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Point of Order. I draw your attention to Standing Order 206.  If 

Members  of  the  Opposition  cannot  behave  themselves  tonight,  I  want  you  to  apply 

Standing Order 206. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  Before  I  call  on  the 

Honourable  Member  let  me  read  Standing  Order  206.    The  Speaker  shall  order  any 

Member  of  the  House  whose  conduct  is  improper  to  withdraw  immediately  from 

Parliament for the remainder of the sitting. 

</span></div><div><span>That part I cannot do.  I have to be patient with Members of Parliament.  I would like 

to  ask  the  Honourable  Member  Dr  Woonton  to  continue.  We  are  on  Clause  13 

Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> I will apologise if I was harsh earlier because that was not my 

intention.  Clause  13  relates  to  the  table  of  fees  chargeable  to  any  Company.  

Personally, Mr Chairman, I think this is a heavy burden on our people.  Even though 

there has not been an increase in the fees for a very long time as we can see tonight it 

is nearly a 1,000 per cent increase demanded by the Bill tonight.  I have no problems 

with the fees of $10 or $20.  I have no problems with those.  With most of these fees 

there will not be a heavy burden on our people but there are some fees that are over 

$1,000  that  these  Companies  will  be  expected  to  pay  every  year.    Maybe  to  some 

Companies  this  is  just  a  very  small  amount  for  them  to  pay  but  there  are  some 

Companies,  Mr  Chairman,  who  will  find  it  difficult.    And  we  have  heard  from  the 

explanation of the Minister earlier on that there are 462 Companies that have not re-

registered  and  we  would  like  to  ask  why.    He  also  told  us  that  there  were  only  two 

Companies who voluntarily de-registered but 460 Companies were deliberately struck 

</span><span>off  the  register  because  they  hadn’t  bothered  to  register  or  bothered  to  apply  for  re</span><span>-

</span><span>registration of their Companies.  The question, Mr Chairman, is did we ask ourselves 

whether it is the high fees we are charging that is discouraging these Companies from 

coming forward to register their Companies?  If we look at this carefully enough, Mr 

Chairman, we can see that this Government wants a lot of people to form Companies 

</span><span>in order that the economy of this country be better.  If we hadn’t </span><span>thought of increasing 

the fees for these Companies, Mr Chairman, I would like to ensure everybody tonight 

that these people would come forward and re-register their Companies. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 43</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1911 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  The Point of Order is the question of relevancy. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> I am coming to explain my point. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  The  Honourable  Member,  Mr  Chairman,  is  being  irrelevant 

when he made the statement that these Companies he cited 461 people who have not 

come forward to register because of the increase in fees. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> I said it may well be. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  What  increase  of  fees  are  we  talking  about  Mr  Chairman.  

This  Bill  has  not  yet  been  enacted.    We  are  in  the  process  of  reaching  a  conclusion 

tonight  to  make  the  necessary  enactment  of  this  law  in  this  House.    I  hear  such 

statements, Mr Chairman, being said that people are frightened to come forward to re-

register 460 Companies not coming forward because of their fear for the high fees. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> No, if you allow me to finish. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU: </span><span>Looking back to the principal Act the fees are $1, $2, $5, $10, 

$20.  You know these fees, Mr Chairman. The statements made by employees of the 

Justice Department are to the effect that $1, $2, $5, $10 are not even worth the paper 

and the pen they are written on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  So that is why, Mr Chairman, I raised that Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  That</span><span>’s  a  Point  of  Explanation  Honourable  Minister.  The 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Dr Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Maybe if the Honourable Minister had let me carry on with my 

explanation  he  would  have  got  the  point.    If,  Mr  Chairman,  that  the  figure  that  has 

been used, the 460 odd Companies, have not been able to pay the $2, the $5, or $10 

then how will they be able to pay the $100 that is required of them. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>There’s your answer.</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>If they haven’t paid the $10 that is required of them to do </span><span>then 

</span><span>how  will  they  be  able  to  pay  $100  and  if  460  haven’t  paid  for  the  $10  then  maybe 

more than 1,000 won’t be able to pay $100.  I know this has not been enacted and it is 

not a law now but what I am saying is if 460 haven’t been able to pay $10 then they</span><span>

will not be able to pay the $100. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Order.  Order, please!
