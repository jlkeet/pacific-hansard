<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Marine Resources. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $723,800 for Marine Resources stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. Greetings to you on this beautiful 

day.  Greetings  to  the  staff  members  and  Honourable  Members  in  the  House.   

Greetings to our people listening in to our debate this afternoon. I would like to give 

special  greetings  to  my  people  in  my  Constituency  Tongareva.  I  would  like  to 

acknowledge the message you sent over the telephone during the last few days.  I am 

glad to receive confirmation from the majority of the people of Penrhyn that our seat 

belongs  to  the  Cook  Islands  Party.    Having  received  all  encouraging  messages  you 

sent me while I am in Rarotonga during this time, I say again, greetings in the love of 

God. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of the questions you raised regarding the Fishing Joint Venture, let me assure 

you that it will not  be long before the overseas parties arrive in  Penrhyn to start the 

ball rolling.  They will need to meet with the Island Councillors to sort out the terms 

of  this  venture.    We  waited  for  this  project  for a long time.  There were benefits  of 

similar  sorts  in  the  past  but  those  days  were  gone.    I  am  now  referring  to  the  year 

1985. 

</span></div><div><span>We know what transpired at that time.  You experienced the benefit we reaped for the 

work we did. Now, we will look forward to this new venture when we will reap the 

benefits. Bear with me during these last few days of Parliament and then I will depart 

</span><span>for home and we shall meet again.

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  this  afternoon  I  noticed  that  the  leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  is 

present  in  Parliament.  Yesterday  he  was  not  in  Parliament.  Yesterday  I  was 

complimenting  the  leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  for  the  question  he  raised 

</span><span>regarding  the  types  of  benefits  and  assistance’s  my  office,  the  Ministry  o</span><span>f  Marine 

Resources provide to the small pearl farmers on the island of Manihiki and Penrhyn.  

Mr  Chairman  I  appreciate  the  merit  behind  these  questions.    What  benefits,  what 

assistance have we divulged to the pearl farmers of Manihiki and Penrhyn. I answered 

this question yesterday.  That is, via the training programmes for divers, showing them 

how  to  use  diving  gears  safely.  There  are  also  field  units  on  each  of  these  islands 

where the Ministry can operate from to teach our people how to assemble their lines 

or  ropes.  This  support  also  reached  the  island  of  Rakahanga.    Staff  members  of 

Marine  Resources  are  involved.    The  farms  in  Rakahanga  belong  to  the  Island 

Council.  The Ministry pays the staff members operating the farm. 

</span></div><div><span>This is another form of assistance this Ministry is giving to the people on these three 

islands,  Manihiki,  Penrhyn  and  Rakahanga.    Another  form  of  help  from  us  is  the 

provision  of  access  to  the  people  from  the  islands  of  the  Northern  Group  to  loan 

money  from  the  Cook  Islands  Development  Bank.  The  rate  of  interest  charged  on 

</span><span>these loans is  very low to  enable the people to  pay back the loan when they harvest 

</span><span>their  pearl  shells.  Another  thing  Government  has  done  is  to  remove  the  tax  on  the 

importation of floats, nylons and other material required to assist pearl farmers in their 

farming venture. 

</span></div><div><span>With  these  two  latter  assistance  I  mentioned,  namely  the  borrowing  from  the  CIDB 

and secondly, the exemption of tax, these types of supports have never been extended 

to any of the outer islands. These doors are now being opened to them.  The question 

is  why  is  it  like  this.    It  seems  to  me  that  the  opportunities  are  not  inclusive  of  the 

people  in  the  outer  islands  or  such  benefits  are  only  set  aside  for  the  people  of 

Rarotonga.    If  that  is  the  case,  there  certainly  is  a  deficiency  in  the  system.  A 

deficiency,  Mr  Chairman,  that  needs  to  be  rectified.    I  am  pleased  today  that  these 

doors  have  now  been  opened  and  our  people  in  the  Outer  Islands,  especially  my 

people in Tongareva, Manihiki and Rakahanga are now able to access these funds. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  people  are  now  looking  into  the  possibility  of  moving  the  pearl  industry  to 

Pukapuka and then Palmerston Island, and probably Aitutaki.  The assistance that will 

provide  the  spats  derives  from  the  islands  in  the  northern  group  and  meetings  have 

</span><span>been held to extend the farming of the pearl shells into these other islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, let us have another look at the assistance I noted from the CIDB and the 

Cook  Islands  Development  Investment  Board  which  was  known  as  the  Monetary 

Board.    From  1965  to  today,  we  have  governed  ourselves  for  more  than  30  years.  

Therefore, it is appropriate for me to ask why this system was not extended to those 

Northern Group Islands. What were the Members of Parliament on those islands doing 

at that time? The Member of Parliament for Tongareva, Rakahanga and the Member 

of  Parliament  for  Manihiki.  Those  Members of Parliament were in  the House at  the 

</span><span>time.  Why didn’t they access  these funds for our people?  Even when they were in 

</span><span>Government.    Are  my  people  in  the  North  second  class  citizens  that  they  have  no 

access to this assistance? Or is it because the Members of Parliament at the time were 

</span><span>plain lazy and they didn’t want to do anything about it.</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1871 

</span></div><div><span>You know, I believe Mr Chairman that as a Member of Parliament you have a contract 

with those who put you in.  And those who put you in are your people and I believe, 

Mr  Chairman,  there  are  conditions  laid  down  in  that  contract.    Apart  from  other 

things,  I  am  sure  this  is  one  of  the  conditions  of  that  contract  that  is  to  service  the 

needs of your people.  To look at their problems, their grievances and try and resolve 

them.  I believe that is a valid contract.  I also believe it is a moral and a legal contract 

and that each and every one of those Honourable Members has a duty to abide by that 

contract. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  Mr  Chairman,  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  wasn’t  here 

</span><span>when I was providing those answers yesterday.   That is why I am trying to answer the 

questions again for the second time while I appreciate his presence here today. I thank 

him  for  asking  a  valid  excellent  question.    That  question  reveals  Mr  Chairman,  the 

facility  that  is  available  to  those  pearl  farmers  to  access  and  assist  them  which  is 

ongoing as well as those that has not been tapped yet.  I thank him again. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  I  come  back  Mr  Chairman,  to  the  question  that  was  raised  last  week  by  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati.  That  related  to  the  appropriation  for  the 

</span><span>Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  to  the  sum  of  $141,000  under  Trading  Revenue.    He 

asked where this money would come from.  The Honourable Member failed to realise 

that  the  spats  sold  from  the  hatchery  and  the  Government  farms  in  Manihiki  are 

earning revenue.  He also asked how come the Marine Resources are farming on the 

coral called Amoko in Manihiki and who owned this coral. He is now interjecting to 

correct me that he was actually asking whether we were paying rents. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, in 1992-93 an agreement was made between the Member of Parliament 

at the time and the Island Council.  In addition, through that Agreement, the Marine 

Resources  was  allowed  to  hoist  their  lines  and  hook  them  onto  these  coral  for  their 

farms.    He  is  now  calling  to  me  that  this  coral  does  not  belong  to  the  Councillors.   

</span><span>Why didn’t he do so</span><span>mething about it in 1992?  Why come to this House now and start 

interfering  while  I  am  talking?    Did  he  do  anything  then?      He  asked,  whether  the 

Marine Resources are paying rent for the use of that coral.  I will ask him, are there 

any  other  farmers  holding  their  farms on corals  in  Manihiki  paying rents.  No one is 

paying rent.  Whom is he kidding?  Suggesting that the Marine Resources should pay 

rents.  You know Mr Chairman, the Island Council of Rakahanga use the same coral.   

</span><span>Is the Island Council of Rakahanga paying rents?  They are not. That is the thing Mr 

</span><span>Chairman  that  I  don’t  understand  from  these  questions  the  Member  is  posing.  He 

</span><span>asked, how many staff members from the Marine Resources are working on this farm?   

</span><span>I  don’t  know  how  may  times  he’s  been</span><span>  to  and  from  Manihiki  and  Rakahanga  to 

</span><span>Rarotonga?  Why didn’t he go and check those people who are working from Monday 

</span><span>to Friday?   I thought he would ask me how many people from the Marine Resources 

are working on Pearl Farms on the Island of Rakahanga.  Sometimes they work on the 

farm.  Most of the time they are lying around home and paid by the Marine Resources. 

</span><span>Don’t judge a man by the speck in his eyes.  Because you have a massive tree in yours.  

</span><span>To  answer  his  question  concerning  the  number  of  people  working  on  the  farm  in 

</span><span>Manihiki there used to be eight, and this number has been reduced to six.  In the next 

financial  year  this  will  be  reduced  again  to  three.      He  also  asked  Mr  Speaker, how 

much  money  this  farm  raised.    How  much  profit,  how  much  pearl  was  made?  And 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>1872 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>when were these pearls harvested.  There are a lot of questions that he raised. I think, I 

</span><span>will take all the time now, up to five minutes to four o’clock to reply these matters. 

</span><span>Some of these questions are pointless. Nevertheless, I will try to answer them.     

</span></div><div><span>This  farm,  Mr  Chairman,  was  established  between  1992  to  1993  by  the  Marine 

Resources and accordingly managed until it was sold.  In that period, there were not 

many  technicians  who  were  going  up  to  these  islands.    The  Ministry  of  Marine 

Resources  in  conjunction  with  the Minister arranged to bring some technicians in to 

seed  the  pearl  shells  in  the  islands  of  Manihiki  and  Tongareva.    So  an  arrangement 

was made to secure the loan that was obtained by the Ministry of Marine Resources 

from  the Cook Islands Development  Bank for Pearl Developments. 30% of all pearl 

shells  seeded  will  be  set  aside  in  order  to  repay  that  loan.  When  the  pearls  were 

harvested  and  because  there  were  fewer  pearls  which  survived  the  seeding,  and 

therefore  less  pearl  was reaped from  the harvest,  the turnover for the pearls was the 

</span><span>less than anticipated.  As a result they weren’t able to pay off the loan.  Between the 

</span><span>Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  and  the  Cook  Islands  Development  Bank,  when  the 

loan arrangements was reached, there was a provision which stipulated that if the 30% 

set aside was not able to repay the loan obtained from the Cook Islands Development 

</span><span>Bank, then the onus will be upon the Ministry of Marine Resources to pay the balance 

</span><span>of the loan.   And because this loan was not paid off entirely, the Ministry of Marine 

Resources took over the seeding of the outstanding pearls on the ropes. 

</span></div><div><span>During the seeding process Mr Chairman there were around about 100 smaller pearl 

farmers who just started.   They were not fully equipped with the pearl farming skills. 

And before the seeding process, the Minister of Marine Resources and some officials 

met with the people and assured the people that if the 30% was not sufficient to pay 

off the loan then the Ministry of Marine Resources would meet the shortfall.  When I 

took on the portfolio of Marine Resources in 1994, I saw this arrangements. So I put 

in  place  some  programmes  to  ensure  that  this  farm  would  be  able  to  pay  back  this 

loan.  So, the Chairman took this arrangement into Cabinet, Cabinet agreed to it, and 

this  is  the  arrangement  in  place  to  this  day.  On  the  21st  November  1996,  the  first 

harvest  came from this farm.   There were not that many pearls because the seeding 

was  restricted  and  not  all  shells  seeded  produced  good  quality  pearls.  We  got 

$6,625.00  and  this  was  paid  to  the  Cook  Islands  Development  Bank.  On  the  3rd  of 

June 1997, another harvest was done. This time the sum of $15,272.00 was paid to the 

Cook Islands Development Bank.  On November 26, 1997 Mr Chairman, there was a 

</span><span>very big harvest from this farm.  What was received from this harvest Mr Chairman 

</span><span>was  $176,595.00.   On the 2nd December 1998 there was a small  harvest,  the pearls 

were not that good, and $6,835.00 was paid to the Cook Islands Development Bank.    

</span></div><div><span>In January of this year there was another harvest and we got $175,000 out of that.  So 

the total amount we have been able to generate from this farm is $280,329.  The total 

amount of the loan with interest accruing since 1996 for seeding of pearls is a total of 

$411,815.  As  I  outlined  earlier,  the  total  paid  is  $280,329.  The  balance  today  is 

$338,771. This figure includes interests from all those years. We know the story about 

</span><span>the farm, it has been sold now.  I sold it to the President of the Cook Islands Party, Mr 

</span><span>Henry Puna.  I will explain about this later on Mr Chairman.  First I will answer a few 

of these useless questions, then I will come back to the big one. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1873 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition,  the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party said our 

EEZ  has  not  been  able  to  give  us  more  than  $500,000.    That  is  not  quite  true  Mr 

Chairman.  With regard to the treaty we have in place between the Cook Islands, the 

rest of the region and the United States Government which is called the U.S. Treaty, 

that is administered by the Forum Members of the Pacific.  The body that is looking 

out  for  the  interests  of  the  region  is  the  FFA  and  it  is  receiving  US$16  million  per 

annum. Of the 16 nations in the South Pacific Association, that $16 million has been 

shared out.  Our share is $500,000 per year.   

</span></div><div><span>Out  of  the fees  that we impose for Licences to  distant  water fishing nations such as 

Taiwan,  Korea  and  Tahiti,  we  have  been  getting  in  about    $300,000.    If  we  look  at 

these figures we can see it is nearly $1 million.  This is the explanation to the question 

raised by the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>I will leave this matter but he is wrong when he made his statement and this is actually 

what is happening. 

</span></div><div><span>Here  is  another  question  raised  by  the  leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party.    He 

</span><span>asked  whether  it  is  true  that  I  built  a  home  for  me in  Tongareva?  And what  is  this 

</span><span>building that I built?   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, when the question was asked I looked at the spirit, the real intention of 

this question.  It reminded me of a case that was brought against me on my homeland.  

All the Members in the House and our people listening in to the debate this afternoon 

know that the leader of the Democratic Alliance Party made a false allegation against 

me in Court.  An attempt to castigate me personally, my wife and my children.  The 

allegation  was  that  I  had  stolen  building  materials  from  the  Ministry  of  Marine 

Resources.    These  materials  were  used  to  build  my  home  on  Tongareva,  which  was 

then complete and furnished.  We all know what happened.  We saw it on television, 

we read about  it in  the newspaper in  1997.  The Police arrived on my island.  They 

took photographs of two houses, said to be mine.  These were two kikau huts built by 

my extended family, not  by my children.  The purpose was for any family members 

visiting from New Zealand and Australia to shelter them. 

</span></div><div><span>The  leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  is  calling  out  to  me  now  that  he 

apologised to me at the time.  You know when the Honourable Member apologised to 

</span><span>me I tried to forget it and to leave it there.  

</span></div><div><span>Now, he asked a question, that is, did I build myself a house on Tongareva for me, my 

wife,  and  my  family.  It  awakened  a  sleeping  issue,  which  was  lashed  against  my 

family and me in 1997.  This is a silly and question stupid question.  Am I not allowed 

to build a house on my home island?  Have I committed a serious offence by building 

a house for my wife and children on my home island?  I am saddened Mr Chairman by 

the spirit and the intention behind it.  What else is there? If not a house, what is the 

next  question  he  will  ask  me?    I  would  ask  him  to  go  and  pay  his  own  fare,  go  to 

</span><span>Tongareva and find out for himself.  And then see what projects, what activities have I 

</span><span>been doing for my people from 1994 to this day. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>1874 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>We were debating this Vote Item on the first day last week, Mr Chairman. When I got 

home my dear wife was standing there.  She said, what the hell is he talking about?  

What the hell is he up to this time?  First, they ruin our family name, our reputation, 

now what is he trying to do?  I was saddened Mr Chairman that the spirit behind this 

question  can  be  so  devious.    Questions  into  the  expenditure  on  the  pearl  farm  in 

Manihiki, Mr Chairman had been raised.  Is the next question going to be that I have 

taken the money from the farm to build my house?  

</span></div><div><span>I think it will be appropriate Mr Chairman, if I can invite everybody listening into this 

debate to look into the type of intentions, to see how dirty this can seem to be.  He is 

calling out now that he just asked me a question.  All I have to say is no.  Of course, 

he knows I am not going to say no because I have built a house and my son, Robert is 

staying  in  that  house  managing  our  family  farm  in  Tongareva.  I  have  my  other  son 

who arrived on Monday night  going on the boat to assist him.  He has just returned 

from Australia.  So I am waiting for my other son in New Zealand to come back to go 

back home.  So he is now calling out now that this is a business. Does that mean my 

children are not allowed to stay in their own hous</span><span>e?  Aren’t they allowed to go into 

the sea to farm?  He is calling out whether I have a loan from the Bank. No, I didn’t 

</span><span>get a loan from the Bank.  I used all my investment at the ANZ Bank. My investment 

</span><span>that we have built over the years.  That was the money that we used.  If he wants to 

know  more,  there  was  over  $100,000.    We  used  all  that  to  build  a  house  and  if  he 

wants to be an investigator I will give him the numbers of the accounts and he can go 

and talk to the Manager of the ANZ and find out for himself. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Chairman, I come back to a joint question.  The Leader of the Democratic 

Alliance  Party  asked  a  joint  question  with  one  of  his  own  Members,  Dr  Pupuke 

Robati.  This  relates  to  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  farm  on  the  island  of 

Manihiki.  Now they both asked the same question. Whether it is true that I sold the 

Marine  Resources  farm,  to  the  President  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party  namely  Henry 

Puna.  Mr Chairman, when this question rang into my ear I just could not understand 

what  it  meant.    Because  of  the  childishness  of  this  question,  the  ignorance  of  this 

question,  totally  in  the  dark,  dumb  and  childish  question.    Because  in  1998,  in  this 

very  House  we  passed  a  piece  of  legislation  called  the  Cook  Islands  Investment 

Corporation Act.  You know, Mr Chairman, both of these Honourable Members were 

here.    They  were  inside  this  House.    They were debating this Bill  which became an 

Act  of  Parliament,  an  Act  applicable  to  this  country.    An  Act,  Mr  Chairman  that 

</span><span>removes the jurisdiction of that farm from the hands of the Cook Islands Investment 

</span><span>Corporation.  You  know  that  Act,  Mr  Chairman,  applies  to  the  transfer  of  real  fixed 

assets of Ministries, Government properties in the Outer Islands, into the hands of the 

Cook Islands Investment Corporation. 

</span></div><div><span>They were party to the making of that piece of legislation Mr Chairman and then they 

asked,  did  you  sell  the  Marine  Resources  farm  to  the  President  of  the  Cook  Islands 

Party,  Henry  Puna?    Yet  just  last  year  they  were  party  to  passing  this  legislation 

transferring the jurisdiction of sale of assets in all Ministries in the Outer Islands to the 

</span><span>Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  And they asked this silly question today.  How 

</span><span>come they didn’t know?  Well our people listening to this debate can make their own 

</span><span>conclusions, can reach their own conclusions, can make their own deductions as to the 

mentality of these two Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1875 

</span></div><div><span>You know it did not only stop there Mr Chairman.  Five weeks ago before the farm 

was  sold  or  disposed  of,  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati  made  an 

appointment to see me.  You know, out of courtesy, out of respect, I want to find out 

why he was seeing me.  I told my Secretary to arrange that he meet me at the earliest 

opportunity in my office.  We met, Mr Chairman.  The agenda for discussion was this 

farm  in  Manihiki.    He  was  presenting  a  case  to  me  for  the  Island  Council  of 

Rakahanga to own this farm.  You know immediately, I told the Honourable Member 

</span><span>that I don’t have any authority or any jurisdiction to deal with the farm.  I</span><span> reminded 

him  about  the  1998  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Act.    I  told  him,  Mr 

Chairman,  that  by  virtue  of  that  piece  of  legislation  that  was  passed  last  year  the 

jurisdiction and the authority has been removed from me or the Ministry and placed 

right  squarely  in  the  hands  of  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation.    I  made  it 

</span><span>quite clear to him, Mr Chairman, that I don’t have any right to dispose of the farm. He 

</span><span>asked  Mr  Chairman,  who  was  the  Minister  of  the  Cook  Islands  Investment 

Corporation  Board.    I  told  him  Mr  Chairman,  that  the  Prime  Minister  held  that 

portfolio but  the Prime Minister was not  in  the country at  the time and the Minister 

Papamama Pokino was holding on to that portfolio. Then he said that he would go and 

</span><span>meet him. 

</span></div><div><span>That  is  why  I  a</span><span>m  amazed  that  after  he  has  been  told  I  don’t  have  the  jurisdiction.  I 

didn’t have the necessary authority and yet he asked me whether it is true that I have 

sold  it  to  Mr  Henry  Puna  the  President  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party.  I  don’t  know  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman whether </span><span>he has been to see the Honourable Papamama Pokino and I don’t 

</span><span>want  to  make  it  my  business.That  is  why  I  noted  about  this  kind  of  spirit,  ignorant 

thinking. It is a childish approach Mr Chairman, to raise such a question.   

</span></div><div><span>Now Mr Chairman, the Honourable Member Robert Woonton was saying - at least the 

Member  Dr  Robert  Woonton  used  his  head  that  he  went  across,  and  spoke  to  the 

CI.I.C.  Board. Where he was told that the process has been transparent, notices were 

put in the Cook Islands News throughout Rarotonga, notices were publicised for the 

tender  of  this  farm  on  the  islands  of  Manihiki.    Then  Dr  Woonton  asked  why  the 

Island  Council  did  not  put  in  a  bid.    There  you  have  another  one  of  these  weird 

questions.  Having gone to see the CIIC and having seen the notices advertised or put 

on the boards in Manihiki, he came to this House and asked why the Island Council 

was not invited to make a bid.  What kind of setup are they trying to put up? Mickey 

</span><span>Mouse? Mr Chairman the sale of this farm was advertised in the Newspaper.  It was 

</span><span>published on the Notice boards on the island of Manihiki.  There were several bidders 

to the tender.   There were six bidders altogether.  One of those bidders was from the 

Island Council of Rakahanga.  Four of those bidders were from Pearl Companies from 

</span><span>the Island of Manihiki.  One of the other bidder is a private bidder and Henry Puna’s 

</span><span>name does not appear here?  CIIC started processing these bidders as it is within their 

jurisdiction to receive the bidding.  Processed it and a firm recommendation was made 

</span><span>to Cabinet.   In addition, the CIIC recommended that the successful bidder be the “A” 

</span><span>Seven  Holdings  Limited.      Where  is  it  received  Mr  Chairman  that  I  sold  this  farm.  

</span><span>Are we engaging ourselves in cheap gimmick politics like this? That is why I said Mr 

</span><span>Chairman that the question is silly, stupid, and very childish. Mr Chairman, I feel very 

sorry  for  the  spirit,  for  the  state  of  minds  of  the  Honourable  Members.    One  is  a

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>former  Prime  Minister  of  this  country  and  the  other,  the  Leader  of  Democratic 

Alliance Party wants to become the Prime Minister of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.    MAOATE:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  Thank  you.  I  have  been  putting  up  to  all 

these stupidity that has been expressed by the Minister. I never thought that he would 

go to that extent to look down on us, using those bad words.  Does this reflect the kind 

of personality he is? The way I put the question to him is simple.  All he had to say is 

that  he  did  not  do  it  and  that  it  was  the  CIIC.    We  are  presenting the cases that the 

people  have  asked  us  to  raise.    To  try  to  run  us  down  the  way  he  has  done,  is 

unparliamentary.  He did not even consider that the word he is using is downgrading 

the  status  of  Members  of  Parliament  in  this  House.    Yet,  he  is  a  lawyer.    I  am 

surprised.  Thank you Mr Chairman.   I hope you will not be disappointed to hear me 

to say things like that to him later.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> For as long as the Honourable Minister is answering the questions, 

he is relevant.  In my understanding, he is replying to the question that has been asked. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  he  was  talking  about  his  concern  and  his 

problem  in  regards  to  what  I  have  said.      He  was  saying  that  he  could  not  tolerate 

being called by these names.   You think I will tolerate you going to the Police and 

making false complaints against me.  There you are I am carrying those burdens and 

pain.  You are not carrying it.  I am carrying it, my family is carrying it. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Point of Order, Mr Chairman.   The Minister is very irrelevant, 

he is not talking on the vote.   The vote item we are on now is for the Marine Resource 

but he is talking about personality, nothing to do with the Marine Vote Item before the 

House.   

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>      Mr  Chairman,  there  is  no  Point  of  Order.    Where  is  the 

Clause in here that says there is a Point of Order?  None. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Anyway Honourable Minister, please try to come back to the point 

</span><span>on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Can I have a Point of Explanation?    

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is no Point of Order on the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span> Mr Chairman, with respect to your office, he does not have a 

Point of Order.   Just ask him to sit down.   He does not have a Point of Order.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    This  is  the  last  question  Mr 

Chairman and I will answer it. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1877 

</span></div><div><span>That  is  in  regards  to  my  involvement  with  the  licence  of  the  young  people  of 

Polynesian  Black  Pearls.    The  subject  of  a  corporate  licence  for  these  young  people 

was in  the newspaper.  It  was in  the Cook Island Star.   It was in the newspaper on 

Tuesday the 19th of January this year.  This newspaper is distributed in New Zealand, 

Australia  and  the  Cook  Islands.    This  w</span><span>as  the  headline  “Tongareva  people  pays  for 

their Member of Parliament”.  I remember this article in the newspaper because of this 

</span><span>question that was just raised.  I will not say that I was worried about the question, I 

would say I was pleased.  What was written in the Cook Island Star on 19 January this 

year is all lies.  After I have explained to the House and our people listening in, Mr 

Chairman,  we  will  see  how  this  newspaper  lied.    The  candidate  for  the  Democratic 

Alliance Party gave the information that was received by this newspaper. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Carry on Mr Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>The leader of the Opposition is saying that I did not ask this 

question, I would like to apologise to him for saying he did.  I think it is appropriate 

for  me  to  explain  to  our  people.  The leader of the Opposition  is  correcting me and 

telling me his question was about the lease of the lagoon.  There is no other lease in 

the lagoon but this corporate licence.  I believe the question is in order.  The statement 

on  this  corporate  licence  was  put  in  the  newspaper.    As  I  indicated  earlier  this  was 

done on the 19th of January 1999.  This information which was fed to the newspaper 

was  from  this  son  of  mine,  the  candidate  for  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party,  Mr 

Wilkie Rasmussen. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor.    What  is  your  Point  of 

Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>The person that has been mentioned is not in the House to 

protect himself.  I do not see his name in that article, not even being mentioned once.  

To assume that he is the one is not fair to Wilkie Rasmussen.  I do not believe that the 

accusation that the Minister is putting through is correct.  In fact I would like him to 

withdraw that comment because it is just an allegation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  If we look at the point of order 

</span><span>on  the  one  hand  this  man  is  not  being  accused,  this  is  just  a  notice  or  explanation.  

Nevertheless  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of  the  House  it  is  best  that  we  do  not 

</span><span>mention people’s name.  If I was to order this man’s name be removed it is of no use 

</span><span>because  we  all  heard  it  and  our  people  have  heard  it  but  I  would  like  to  ask  the 

Honourable Minister not to mention his name. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Really there is no point of order.  

</span><span>However I have no malicious intent when I mentioned my nephew’s name. I have no 

</span><span>intention to smear his name in this House or in public.  I have no wish whatsoever to 

</span><span>smudge my own blood  and bone.  I do not  know what  they are upset  about.  What I 

said was what was written in the paper.  That is all I have said, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>1878 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Now coming back to the events that led to the issuing of the corporate licence which 

in  fact  is  incorporated  in  the  lease  for  a  portion  of  the  lagoon.    You  know  Mr 

Chairman  they  smudged  my  name  with  mud  in  New  Zealand,  Australia  and  also  in 

Tongareva  when  I  was  here  in  Rarotonga.      The  mud  read like this.  I, the Minister 

sold the Tongareva lagoon to foreigners.  Mr Chairman, we all know that laws govern 

</span><span>these  lagoons.    If  the  lagoon  is  governed  by  that  particular  island’s  By</span><span>-laws,  I  as 

Member of Parliament for Tongareva or as the Minister of Marine Resources have no 

jurisdiction whatsoever to say to the Island Council to do this or do that.  Simple Mr 

Chairman,  I  do  not  have  any  jurisdiction  or  authority  to  intervene.    With  the  only 

exception that if there is an appeal on the licence not being granted, then the applicant 

has recourse to make an appeal to the Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  don’t  k</span><span>now  if  the  applicant  believes  that  the  decision  of  the  Island 

Council  was unfair to  his  application.  That  is  the only time, Mr Chairman, that the 

Minister  of Marine Resources under the law can look  at  the facts  and decide on the 

appeal, whether the Island Council has been unfair and what was to be done to rectify 

the situation.  That is the only time that the Minister, Mr Chairman, is allowed to be 

involved in the process of granting of licences to access the lagoons of these islands. 

</span></div><div><span>And, Mr Chairman, the process goes further.  If the applicant is not satisfied with the 

decision  of  the  Minister,  then  the  applicant  has  a  request  to  go  straight  to  the  High 

Court.  That is the other provision, that the Court will then be involved.  Other than 

those two occasions, the whole control, management and administration of the lagoon 

rests with the Island Council. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  I  will  leave  that  for  the  meantime  Mr  Chairman.    I  will  come  back  to  tell  the 

House  what  happened  in  the  granting  of  this  Corporate  Licence  to  this  group  of 

people.    Now  Mr  Chairman,  these  people,  the  Directors  of  this  Company  called  the 

Polynesian  Black  Pearls  are  not  foreigners.    These  are  the  children  of  Tongareva.  

Their  mother  is  a  sister  of  Tekake  Williams.    Their  father  is  a  papaa  from  New 

Zealand  and  they  have  every  right  to  farm  in  that  lagoon  like  any  other  Penrhyn 

individual.    Alternatively,  like  what  the  By-Law  says  anybody  of  Penrhyn  descent.  

Although  these  people  were  entitled  to  farm  under  their  individual  licences,  they 

wanted to obtain a Corporate Licence whereby the production of pearls can be made 

on  a  very  very  big  scale.    You  know,  Mr  Chairman,  as  far  as  from  mid  1996  up  to 

February 1997 these people had been to my office from time to time and a lot of faxes 

</span><span>have transpired between my office and them.   

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  individuals  involved  in  Polynesian  Black  Pearls  has  two  sons  and  owns 

two big Companies in Perth, Australia.  One of their sons owns an accountancy firm 

in Perth and the other a security Company in Perth, Australia.  They all want to come 

back home.  Representation  has been going on for I would say something like eight 

months between them and myself.  You know, all this time, Mr Chairman, my reply to 

them  was  this  -  simple.    Tongareva  By-</span><span>laws  of  today  doesn’t  allow  for  a  Corp</span><span>orate 

Licence  to  be  issued.    I,  as  the  Member  of  Parliament  or  as  Minister  of  Marine 

</span><span>Resources,  do  not  have  any  authority  to  issue  a  Corporate  Licence.    I  told  them 

</span><span>repeatedly to go home and submit their application to the Island Council.  The Island 

Council is the only body that can give you a Corporate Licence.  But at the moment 

</span><span>they can’t do it because the By</span><span>-laws do not allow them to issue that kind of licence.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1879 

</span></div><div><span>So if they want to pursue what they wanted they should all go back home, speak with 

the Island Council to  amend their By-laws.  These people were strong and adamant.  

They went  and saw the Prime Minister, Lloyd Powell, and so and so and in the end 

they all came back to me.  You know I am not sure whether they had been to see the 

Honourable  Member,  Dr  Robert  Woonton.    Now  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr 

Woonton  said  that  they did.   They came back to  me.  Their representation  this time 

said to me, that everybody agreed that we should be issued with a Corporate Licence 

except  you.    I  said,  well  you  people  think  that  you  can  get  your  Corporate  Licence 

from  those you have met.  Well go and get it. I knew very well, Mr Chairman, they 

will be advised ultimately that it cannot be done. 

</span></div><div><span>Their representatives kept on going until an application was put to the Island Council 

on their behalf and I was  present  on the island of Tongareva.  That  was on the 21st 

February 1997, Mr Chairman.  The Council decided at that meeting that the matter is 

so important that it should be put to the people.  I admired the wisdom of the Island 

Council  in  taking  that  step.    On  the  25th  February  which  was  four  days  later,  the 

application was made. It was presented to the people at a public meeting.  The people 

came out with a flat no and the Council concurred with the decision. 

</span></div><div><span>On the 27th February I wrote a letter to them in Australia with the Council to let them 

know that the application has been considered and declined.  Considered and declined 

by the people and concurred too by the Island Council.  That was on the 27th February 

1997. 

</span></div><div><span>Now between that date and the 7th of August that same year within a gap of about six 

months there were public meetings held, both in the village of Omoka and Te Tautua.  

</span><span>The Mayor had left the island with the Boy’s Brigade Group to go to New Zealand.</span></div><div><span>Somebody, Mr Chairman, usurped the functions and the power of the Mayor.  That 

Mr  Chairman  was  Pau  Toka.    He  acted  as  Mayor  at  the  two  meetings,  which  he 

chaired.  At those meetings there were petitions that the Corporate Licence should be 

given  to  these  people,  of  Polynesian  blood.  While  all  these  were  going  on  in 

Tongareva, I was fully in the dark in Rarotonga.  As well as the Mayor who was in 

New Zealand at the time.  On the 7th August 1997 I received faxed resolutions from 

the  Mayor  and  the  Island  Council.    This  resolution  told  me  to  amend  the previous 

Motion in order for an amendment to the Tongareva By-laws to be effected and grant 

</span><span>these  people  a  Corporate  Licence  and  before  I  received  the  fax  resolutions  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman,  the  Mayor  actually  telephoned  me.  The  message  was  that  the  Island 

Council has agreed that the law should be amended and that the Corporate Licence 

should be issued.  My reply was that I would not take the words by mouth that he is 

to  commit  it  to  paper  and  send  to  me.    The  Motion  to  amend  the  law  was  then 

commenced.  

</span></div><div><span>This was done by Crown Law and sent to the Island Council of Tongareva for their 

agreement.    It  was  then  finally  ratified.      In  addition,  the  process  for  granting  the 

</span><span>licence  commenced.  Then  on  the  28th  November  1997  Mr  Chairman,  in  Omoka, 

</span><span>there  was  a  deed  executed  to  grant  the  licence  and  other  conditions  signed  and 

executed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  John  Vano.  The  Mayor  executed  the 

contract, the Deed.  That is the licence granted. However, it cannot be handed over 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>1880 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>until such time the Polynesian Black Pearls is able to pay $380,000.00 to the Island 

Council  and  the  people  of  Tongareva.    In  addition,  these  people  the  Black  Pearl 

Polynesian people then left.  

</span></div><div><span>Now  that was on the 28th  of November 1997.  Just  five days short of  the full  one 

year from November 1997 to November 1998 these people went back to Tongareva.   

They  met  with  the  Island  Council.  They  had  a  cheque  with  them  for  $150,000.00. 

They  told  the  Island  Council  that  they  could  not  pay  the  full  amount  then.    In 

addition, that they were not ready to start but when they do start, they would come 

back  with  the  balance,  which  is    $230,000.00.      The Island Council agreed and an 

amendment to that Deed was duly executed.   That is the sequence of the events on 

the issue of this particular Corporate Licence.    

</span></div><div><span>Where then in the sequence of event, and when in the sequence of event, did I issue, 

did  I  give  the  lease  or  the  lagoon  to  foreigners  and  their  investors?  I  thank  the 

questions asked, to give me the opportunity to speak publicly to the nation to explain 

what  has  transpired  and  what  has  transacted.    It  gave  me  that  opportunity  Mr 

Chairman,  to  speak  directly  to  the  people  and  present  the  sequence  of event  as they 

</span><span>have occurred.   When my families in New Zealand faxed copies of the newspapers to 

</span><span>me, I was in Tongareva.  The reporters were asked to consult the people in Tongareva. 

Ask them which they did. The writers who were involved in writing the article rang 

back and said, well we now got the facts. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  at  the  time  when  I  returned  to  Rarotonga  I  was  tempted  to  get  the 

newspaper to present the events, but you know Mr Chairman, how it is, difficult it is 

to deal with the media. You tell them one thing and they get something else printed.   

My other reservations was that at one time, we were here in Rarotonga for Parliament. 

I was told by the people of Tongareva that there was a public meeting conducted. All 

sorts of political insinuations were going on. All the Mayors were in Aitutaki and Pau 

Toka was again the Chairman.  That meeting Mr Chairman started at 8, finished about 

12.00. I was notified at 2.00 in the morning and I got on the plane at 4.00 that morning 

and  went  back  home.    That  was  Monday  night  and  on  Friday  morning,  Friday 

afternoon a public meeting was held where I presented to the people what happened.  

Because one Mr Chairman, one particular Member of the Island Council was playing 

politics.  He twisted the facts and told the people that I have granted the licence and 

the  area  for  the  lagoon  to  be  farmed.  Mr  Chairman,  on  Friday  the  people  was  fully 

</span><span>aware what had transpired.  Mr Chairman again having the opportunity to address the 

</span><span>House and the people on this very issue, I am indeed very pleased. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I sit down, I would like to give some congratulations to a former Secretary of 

Marine Resources, Julian Dashwood, Colin Brown, Raymond Newman for their input, 

their  participation in making the  Ministry of Marine Resources  as it is today.    

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank George Matutu and the various divisional heads, Bertram, 

who  is  in  charge  of  research,  Dorothy  Munro  who  is  now  station  manager  in  the 

</span><span>Tongareva hatchery and all the staff of Marine Resources for all your contributions to 

</span><span>the Ministry.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN</span><span>: Thank you Honourable Minister.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1881 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $823,800 for Marine Resources stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I am sorry I cannot allow any further speakers after the Minister has closed the debate 

on a Vote Item.  So I will now put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $723,800 for Marine Resources stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Ministry of Outer Island Development.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $7,729,385 for Ministry of Outer Island Development stands 

part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Chairman I would like to refer you to Standing Orders.  I think 

your decision is not in order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please take your seat Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  To you and to all Honourable Members 

on both sides of the House greetings to you all in the name of our Lord.  Greetings to 

you Toto Mariri, the candidate for the New Alliance Party in Mauke and Kau Kaiui in 

Mitiaro. We are extending to you our special greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> What is your Point of Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  My request  earlier was for you to  refer to  the Standing Orders.  I 

</span><span>think you made the wrong decision.  I think you should look at the Standing Orders. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please  take  your  seat  Honourable  Member,  there  is  no  point  of 

order. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  we  are  going  to  the  end  of  this  Parliament  and  I 

would like you to give the right decision. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> I know I have given the right decision so would you please take 

</span><span>your seat.  I call upon the Honourable Norman George to continue with your speech. 

</span></div><div><span>I am sorry, Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>1882 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> When I spoke on this Vote Item I was greeting these gentlemen.  

Now, I wish to extend my </span><span>aroa</span><span> to them again. To the candidate for Akatokamanava, 

to  you  Toto  Mariri,  to  Kau  Kaiui  the  New  Alliance  Party  candidate  for  Nukuroa, 

greetings to you all.  I have seen your brochure, we are getting it printed and will send 

them out to you. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Point of order. Mr Speaker, you allowed irrelevancies to persist in 

this House and yet you are not willing to consult the accuracy of your Ruling pursuant 

to the Standing Orders.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  There  is  no  Point  of  Order.  You  may  continue  Honourable 

Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please sit down Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Carry on Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE</span><span>: At this particular time, I wish to start by saying that we in the New 

Alliance  Party  are  the  foremost  supporters  of  the  Outer  Islands  Development.    We 

totally  support  the  vote  allocation  for  MOID,  which  is  channelling  funds  and 

assistance to the outer islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  go  into  details  I  have  a  request  to  make  through  this  House.  There  is  an 

invitation sent out to all Members of Parliament, particularly the Party Leaders, by the 

Mayors of the outer islands inviting us to attend their second Mayoral Forum in Atiu 

next Tuesday the 23rd of March.  I have a humble request to the Mayors, to ask if you 

could postpone your forum for one week because this Parliament will still be sitting 

until the last minute and the last hour.  This will allow the Members of Parliament a 

chance  to  finish  the  business  of  Parliament  and  get  together  with  you  to  hold 

discussions.    If  you  decide  to  proceed  with  your  conference,  the  chances  are  no 

Member  of  Parliament  will  be  able  to  attend.    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman  for  your 

indulgence. 

</span></div><div><span>There is no question that we all support this vote, particularly we the Members from 

the Outer Islands.  And most particularly the New Alliance Party totally supports the 

devolution process.  I think in the last two years of experimenting we have discovered 

</span><span>a lot of trials and errors.   I feel it has helped us form some position probably in favour 

</span><span>of some and not in favour of others. 

</span></div><div><span>This is a process where I don’t think anybody should pretend to have an answer.  That 

</span><span>is why it is very important for Members of Parliament to sit in the Mayoral Forums to 

listen  in  to  how  the  Mayors  and  Island  Councillors  are  experiencing  the  day  to  day 

difficulties.  We also want to see how far they are prepared to reach out to solve these 

problems.  They the Mayors and the Island Councillors, have to demonstrate to us of 

their ability to do better than what Government Departments are doing, or what they 

did previously and what they are capable of doing at the present time.  For example, 

Mr  Chairman,  if  the  Island  Councillors,  if  the  Mayors  can  say  to  us  listen,  we  are 

capable of recruiting our own teachers from overseas and that we are  better at it.  If 

you leave it to the Ministry of Education in Rarotonga, we are not going to get the best 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1883 

</span></div><div><span>teachers  available.    Let’s  handle  that.    If  the  Mayors  and  the  Island  Councillors  can 

</span><span>demonstrate  to  us  that  they  can  recruit  better  doctors,  they  can  have  access  to 

medicine, that there is no need to go through the Rarotonga Ministry of Health, that 

they could do their own ordering. If they can demonstrate that to us with confidence, 

</span><span>then let’s look at it.  Let’s be prepared to give them a go.</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, these are the uncharted waters of the devolution process.  These are the 

areas  that  questions  are  being  asked.  Will  the  devolution  process  be  able  to  do  the 

work that it is supposed to do? How far are they prepared to go?  At the present time 

we know that Government Departments have been devolved so each island has direct 

control of them.  We have to put our heads together, particularly for us in the Outer 

Islands, is this is the way to go?  Is this the best direction to take?  Mr Chairman, the 

constant complaint of our people in the Outer Islands is that they are the poor brothers 

within our united Cook Islands. They are the poor brothers and sisters who are always 

left  behind.    They  are  screaming  for  changes  and  if  these  changes  mean  that  they 

would  operate  their  own  external  activities  from  their  Local  Government,  then  why 

not?  Why not?  If they can demonstrate, Mr Chairman, that they can do a better job 

than  the  Government  Ministries  based  in  Rarotonga,  then  why  not  give  them  an 

</span><span>opportunity  to  do  that.    I  know  Mr  Chairman,  that  the  New  Alliance  Party  is 

</span><span>committed  to  developing  the  Outer  Islands  at  a  much  greater  pace,  at  a  much  more 

vigorous pace than it does has ever been done before.  Mr Chairman, it is the duty of 

all Members of Parliament to bring our poorer brothers and sisters in the Outer Islands 

up to date with the standards of Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>There  is  also  a  challenge  issued  to  the  Mayors  and  Island  Councillors  in  the  Outer 

Islands. I can tell you some of the administrative behaviour of those Mayors requires 

constraint and control.  I think it is important for the Mayors of those islands to realise 

that they cannot act unilaterally on their own.  Their authority comes from the Island 

Council. 

</span></div><div><span>I had an opportunity to speak to one of the Island Councillors on the island of Aitutaki 

in  my  brief  but  beautiful  visit  there  a  week  ago.    He  expressed  concern  about  the 

unilateral  actions  of  their  Mayor  in  acting  on  his  own  without  consulting  the  Island 

Councillors.  The  concern  is  also  of  the  Mayors  just  taking in  the Island Councillors 

</span><span>that will give them a “yes” vote and leaving them out of the picture.  We also have our 

</span><span>problem  with  our  Mayor  in  Atiu.    The  people  are  concerned,  particularly  the  public 

</span><span>servants that he had some ideas about reducing the working hours which will make it 

</span><span>unworkable  for  any  public  servants  to  remain  in  their  jobs  because  he  will  chop  all 

their hours.  It is a waste of time remaining on the island to earn a lower salary and not 

being  able  to  keep  up  with  your  commitments.    He  would  reduce  the  Atiu  Public 

Service  to  nothing  but  I  believe  because  of  so  much  resistance  he  has  gone  off  the 

</span><span>idea, hopefully for good because it will not work.  If you are going to reduce people’s 

hours because of commitments, don’t just come up with st</span><span>upid ideas like that. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, the challenge is for both sides, for both camps.  If the devolution is to 

</span><span>work then please, Mayors of the Outer Islands, Island Councillors of the Outer Islands, 

</span><span>show  responsibility.    Show  an  ability  to  rise  above  politics.    Show  the  ability  to 

</span><span>control our Outer Islands better than the previous system.  Don’t just put the heat on 

Government.    Don’t  just  put  the  heat  on  Members  of  Parliament.    You  look  at 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>1884 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>yourselves as well.  Show us we can have confidence in you.  Sometimes when I look 

at your actions, maybe because you are new and the devolution is new, some of them 

</span><span>have allowed power to go to their heads.  No.  Pull it off.  There’s a lot of nervousness 

</span><span>on  both  sides.  For  example,  if  Government  is  to  release  all  the  fund</span><span>s to  you there’s 

nervousness  about  accountability.    There’s  nervousness  about  your  ability  to 

</span><span>administer  it,  in  view  of  some  of  the  outrageous  announcements  that  some  of  you 

</span><span>make from time to time.  So let’s get together, let’s feel confident.  Let’s suppo</span><span>rt each 

other.  I know what the Island Councils need the most is a good solid budget in order 

to do the jobs that they want to do.  So there has to be an effort on both sides to allow 

this comfort zone to exist so that funds can be channelled.  I know at the present time 

</span><span>there’s a lot of disappointments and nervousness.  So if we can cure the nervousness 

</span><span>to make sure we can see true accountability and responsibility I am sure that the main 

fund from the central Government will open up. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I will be sitting down in about a minute.  I want to give the Honourable 

Member Paora Teiti an opportunity to speak in the last 10 minutes.  However, before I 

take  my  seat  I  want  to  reiterate  my  humble  request  to  the  Mayors.    If  they  can 

postpone their Conference from next week to the following Tuesday the 30th, then we 

</span><span>can be there.  We want to hear them, we want to feel - to be comfortable with them.  

</span><span>We also want to set firm directions.  And I am sure that is the feeling of the other two 

parties.  That is certainly the feeling of the very concerned New Alliance Party.  I also 

want  to  hear  from  you  about  your  ability  to  sustain  being  responsible  for  all 

Government departments, and your ability to go externally. To go outside the country 

and  secure  the  best  available  people  and  resources  to  work  on  each  of  our  outer 

islands.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. PAORA TEITI:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Kia Orana to you, and to the staff of 

this House. Kia Orana also to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and Cabinet 

Ministers.  Kia Orana to the two Leaders in the Opposition and your Members, and to 

Government  Members.    Kia  Orana  also  to  our  people  listening in  to  our debate this 

afternoon.    I  would  like  to  ask  you  Mr  Chairman,  if  I  can  convey  greetings  to  my 

home island, Araura.  

</span></div><div><span>The  vote  item  we  are  debating  now  Mr  Speaker  is  for  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Island 

Development,  and  this  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Island  Council.    Kia  Orana  to  the 

Mayor and to all Island Councillors on the island as you go about doing the duties that 

have now being devolved to you. Kia Orana also to the Government Representative, 

to all the employees of Government who are now working for the Ministry of Outer 

Islands  Development.  Kia  Orana  to  our  elderly  people  on  the  island,  to  our  young 

people  and  the  children  on  the  island,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all  on  this  new  day.    Kia 

Orana  also  to  the  people  of  my  electorates  of  Amuri  and  Ureia,  I  believe  you  are 

listening to me this afternoon.    

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, the different Departments such as the Health Department, the Ministry 

of  Agriculture  the  Water  Works  etc  that  are  under  the  umbrella  of  the  Ministry  of 

Outer Islands Development, Kia Orana to you all.  I would like to start with the Health 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1885 

</span></div><div><span>Department, especially the hospital on the island.  Kia Orana to the two doctors who 

have  gone  for  holiday.  I  do  hope  that  there  is  someone  looking  after  our  hospital 

today. So, Kia Orana to you, to all the staff and patients in the hospital. Before these 

two doctors left for their holidays, I had the opportunity to speak to them. I found that 

they had some problems  during their stay on the island of Aitutaki.  The Ministry of 

Outer  Islands  Development  settled  one  of  their  problems.  However,  there is  another 

matter, which they would like to discuss when they return.   

</span></div><div><span>Today, I heard on the news that the Mayor in Atiu is having problems with the central 

Government because of the mosquitoes on the island.  Even if the mosquitoes are not 

sprayed, they will eventually disappear.  Mosquitoes will breed if there are empty cans 

full of water or bushes harbouring pools of water.   I do not know what is happening 

with Public Health inspectors on other islands, but on the island of Aitutaki inspectors 

</span><span>are  continuously  going  around  the  island  inspecting  the  people’s  homes.    After  the 

</span><span>inspections they would issue a list that will tell you what areas are needed to be looked 

at or cleaned up. Maybe the two Honourable Members from Atiu did not  go to their 

island  to  encourage  the  Public  Health  inspectors  to  conduct  thorough  inspections  so 

there will not be any mosquito breeding areas. If people follow the instructions of the 

</span><span>Health Inspectors, we would have fewer problems.  They are the ones who know how 

</span><span>far to force the bushes back.  Then you will not need the pesticide from Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I will interrupt you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. JACK:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Debate on the Appropriation Bill be Adjourned until  9.00  a.m.   

tomorrow,  Thursday 18th March 1999. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Leader of the House.

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
