</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  We  all have our individual opinions. This  is  mine and what  I 

</span><span>am saying now is that these people are not able to pay the small amount.  They won’t 

</span></div><div><a>Page 44</a></div><div><span>1912 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>be able to pay the big amount and I think that this is the final straw that will break the 

</span><span>camel’s back and the only thing these people will be able to do is to leave the country.  

Mr  Chairman,  it  doesn’t matter what  we try and do to  improve the situation for our 

</span><span>p</span><span>eople, if they don’t have the money they will close their shops, they will go home, sit 

</span><span>back and do nothing.  The point the Opposition  is  driving, is  to give our people the 

incentive to come into business.  We want them to come into the private sector.  It</span><span>’s 

</span><span>not as if I am running down the Minister responsible for this but I can see that there 

are areas in this that are supposed to be there to protect our people.  I can see that the 

time allocated to be implement these fees is before the year of 1999.  I would like to 

ask  the  Honourable  Minister  to  look  at  this  and  give  our  people  time,  give  them  a 

grace  period  otherwise  this  will  become  a  very  heavy  burden  on  the  backs  of  our 

people. 

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  my  views  on  this  Mr  Chairman,  but  I  would  like  to  ask  you  for  your 

permission so I can send my best wishes to my people on the island of Manihiki.   

</span></div><div><span>To my people on the island of Manihiki. Although we have different parties, I would 

like to ask you to take hold of our Prime Minister, look after him and his officials and 

</span><span>his party.   Then after looking after them, then you can let them go.  May God bless 

</span><span>us. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, because we are at 

peace now, I would like through you, Mr Chairman, to give some words of greetings 

to  the Honourable Member, Mataio Aperau.  I think we have been arguing so much 

over the last couple of days that we have forgotten to give our congratulations to this 

gentleman who has been with us for so long a period of time and I would like to give 

my congratulations to him tonight.  I would like to include his dear wife and children 

in my congratulations and as we can see he is still a young man, still strong and we all 

hope  that  he  will  enjoy  his  retirement.      I  would  like  to  thank  him  for  all  the  good 

work that he has done, especially on the roads around Rarotonga. I know that he has 

tried his best to improve the roads in our constituencies, and I also known that if only 

the Ministers had helped him he would have been able to give my constituency a lot 

more  help.  Also,  I congratulate him on the upgrade of the water system that he was 

able to work at with the assistance of the New Zealand Government. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>  With  due  respect  to  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Democratic 

Alliance Party, he is totally irrelevant at this time.  I would like to remind Honourable 

Members  of  the  House,  the  Motion  before  the  House  that  I  moved  was,  until  the 

</span><span>completion of the Bill. That means, if we continue to be irrelevant we will be sitting 

</span><span>here until morning 

</span></div><div><a>Page 45</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1913 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> I now ask Honourable Members, please come to the Clause on the 

Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T.  MAOATE</span><span>: Thank you Mr Chairman. I wasn’t going to speak on the 

</span><span>last two Clauses because I think I might have another minute to go and I was going to 

spend  that  time  congratulating  the  Honourable  Member,  then  sit  down  and  finish.  

Nevertheless, I have to go with the ruling of the Speaker, so please bare with me Bro I 

</span><span>can’t congratulate you anymore.</span></div><div><span>So  I  come  back  now  to  Clause  13.    As  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition  has 

indicated,  there  is  a  big  increase  in  the  fees  here  compared  to  the  previous  fees. 

Although the figures that we are looking at is $100 or $50 some people might think 

this  is  not  a lot of money. But  the point here is  the difference between the previous 

fees and the fees that we are intending to  pass  through this House are hundreds and 

hundreds  of  percentages  in  difference.  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Minister 

Tiki Matapo to explain where this money is going?  Is it going into the public funds or 

into the Ministry of Justice Funds?    My hope Mr Chairman is that this money will go 

to  a  fund  to  improve  the  Ministry  of  Justice.      I  do  not  want  this  money  to  go  to 

meeting the costs of the Prime Minister to the Northern Group today.   These are fees 

to be collected to put in the public funds and I do not want this money to pay for the 

</span><span>Prime Minister’s trip to the North.    </span></div><div><span>HON. I. </span><span>AKARURU:</span><span> Point of Order! There is nothing to do with the Prime Minister 

in this Clause Mr Chairman.  The Leader of the Opposition was quick to pick up the 

</span><span>Prime Minister’s trip as a Government trip. Why didn’t he talk about his spending of 

</span><span>the public money for campaign trip to Pukapuka in 1988?    

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate, please sit down. 

</span></div><div><span> Now continue to speak please come to the vote item on the Clause 13. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T.  MAOATE:</span><span> I want this money to be used properly, I do not want it to 

be  used  dishonestly  because  the  Reform  process  indicates  that  money  needs  to  be 

spent wisely.  The Deputy Prime Minister is using things that happened in the past as 

an  excuse  for  him.      I  want  him  to  say  where  these  fees  are  going.      I  do  not  want 

anything  to  be done improperly.   ADB has been showing us how to  implement  the 

</span><span>reform  process  but  it  is  not  being  followed.    The  Honourable  Minister  of  Marine 

</span><span>Resources earlier on made a stupid remark concerning us.    I do not want the money 

of this country for campaigning purposes. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA: </span><span>  Point of Order, 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the floor.    

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA</span><span>: I ask the Honourable Member to come back to the Schedule of 

the Bill that we are dealing with now, this is nothing to with the Reform.    Nor to do 

with the appropriation of Manihiki.  If you want to, you can deal with that tomorrow 

morning. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 46</a></div><div><span>1914 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  Honourable Member would you 

please come back to the Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank you for the ruling Mr Chairman.  I feel sorry for 

you  Mr  Chairman,  because  these  Minister  are  interfering  with  my  speech.      I  am 

referring to the fees Mr Chairman, I wanted the collection and the use of the fees to be 

transparent  and  accountable.      Because  this  is  what  our  people  want  us  to  prove  to 

them today.   Our people want to know how we are spending this money. I am taking a 

</span><span>trip to the North at my own expenses.   I am going by boat.   Don’t s</span><span>hout like that to 

the Speaker.  How dare you shout to the Speaker like that. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I AKARURU:</span><span> Point of Order. Irrelevancy in debate. Let me remind the Leader 

of Opposition what the Clause is all about.  Table of the fees to pay to the Registrar. 

Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  you  to  ask  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  come  back  to 

Earth.  I know he is suffering from hypertension. Sick people should not be allowed in 

this House.  I am afraid he might collapse.    

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> May I ask the Honourable Member to speak on the Clause.    

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Yes Mr Chairman, I am on the Clause.  And the Clause is 

the  table  of  fees  to  be  paid  to  the  Registrar  of  the  Companies.    And  there  are  the 

miscellaneous fees, which are the lower fee.  And the fees in the case of any Company 

having  a  nominal  share  capital.      That  is  why  I  have  to  raise  the  question  with  the 

Minister in Charge, where these fees are going?  I want a clear indication on that. In 

</span><span>my opinion Mr Chairman, you can’t trust this Government anymore when it co</span><span>mes to 

collecting fees. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Irrelevancy in debate.    If the Leader of the Opposition think 

he  is  going  to  get  away  by  being  irrelevant,  he  is  making  a  bad  mistake.    193 

Irrelevancy in Debate.    

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  Before I call the 

Honourable  Members  to  speak,  I  want  to  ask  all  the  Honourable  Members  that  we 

must try to complete this bill before 10.00p m.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Before I sit down, I want these fees to be accountable and 

not to use it for any other purposes but for the requirements of the Justice Department.  

</span><span>The Minister is  calling out  that’s  what  the Bill  says, I know that.  That is why I am 

saying don’t</span><span> use it for things like sailing to the north. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 13 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 47</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1915 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Justice. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:  </span><span>I just want to make a very brief comment Mr Chairman.  I am 

afraid  the  Honourable  Members  of  the  Opposition  have  not  convinced  me  of  their 

concerns  as  far  as  fees  are  concerned.    The  fees  we  are  dealing  with  are  for 

Companies.  I would like to bring to their attention that lawyers today charge straight 

out $1000 to form a Company.  I want to know what they are doing about those fees?  

Compare  that  to  what  is  proposed  in  the  Bill.    It  is  the  policy  of  this  Ministry  to 

review, amend and update accounts within the Justice Department and to review fees 

annually.  New Zealand does this annually and for us it has taken 30, 20 or ten years. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 13 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>Clause 14: Repeals.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 14 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>First Schedule: The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That First Schedule stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>Long Title: An Act to amend the Companies Act 1955 of New Zealand as applied to 

the Cook Islands by the Companies Act 1970-1971. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Long Title stands part of the Bill.?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be Reported to Parliament without Amendment?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div>
