</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  To all the Honourable Members of the 

House and to our people listening in, Kia Orana.  I hope you are not sick and tired of 

listening to Parliament.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>1888 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I noticed that there are changes here to the Companies Act and that I would have liked 

it  if  the  Minister  would  get  up  and  give  a  more  thorough  explanation  of  these 

provisions.  These  new  sections  are  giving  the  Registrar  of  Companies  some  very 

powerful authority and it is essential that when powers are given to these positions a 

careful explanation is given to us.  You see Mr Chairman, a lot of our people do not 

realise  that  the  safest  away  to  do  business  is  to  form  a  Company.    You  see  if  you 

operate a business privately without registering it, you can get into serious trouble.  If 

you operate from home, say a husband and wife proprietors, and you operate privately 

you  are  in  fact  accepting  all  the  risks  privately.    You  could  be  a  planter,  operating 

planting for exports, you could be a fisherman, but if you operate that business, and if 

you are selling you are in business.  If you do not form a Company, if you have any 

kaiou  and you are taken to court you will be personally liable for that kaiou.  But if 

you  form  a  Company,  say  XYZ  Company,  to  operate  your  business  then  that 

Company will be liable for all of your kaiou, not you.  I was going to say call it ABC 

Company but  my friend Bill Tschan might not like that.  If you form a Company, it 

has  to  be  a  limited  liability  Company  so  everybody  giving  you  kaiou,  because  you 

have  a  limited  liability  Company,  their  liability  is  limited  to  that  Comp</span><span>any’s  share 

</span><span>capital.  You see without a Company being registered the creditors can come to your 

</span><span>home and seize your tools, your boat if you are a fisherman, your tractor if you are a 

planter, your spray machine, whatever you have because those things belong to you.  

They can be taken off you. 

</span></div><div><span>If you form a Company the creditors cannot seize your private possessions but will be 

</span><span>entitled to seize the Company’s assets.   What the Company owns and when it comes 

</span><span>to  bankruptcy  your  Company  can  become  bankrupt  but  you  are  not.    These  are 

measures that I would recommend to people.  It does not matter how small it is, a lot 

of  pearl  farmers  have  done  this,  forming  a  Company  to  safeguard  personal  assets 

against Company debts. 

</span></div><div><span>You are also entitled to a lot of tax concessions if you have a Company whereas if you 

are a private individual you can only claim a limited amount of exemptions under our 

tax laws. 

</span></div><div><span>So it is essential that our people keep up with these laws.  We are now changing them 

</span><span>to require more accountability, more transparency amongst Companies.  That is why 

</span><span>these changes are being made.  While I have the opportunity I have recommended to 

our  people  if  they  are  in  any  kind  of  business,  the  best  thing  to  do  is  register  a 

Company.  Even if you register it for a share capital of $100. 

</span></div><div><span>So there is not much to talk about but to give you an example, Mr Chairman.  About 

two  weeks  ago  I  had  trouble  with  a  client  who  was  facing  an  Arrest  Warrant  as  an 

absconding debtor because a Company decided he owed money and they tried to stop 

him from leaving the country.  The Creditor Company ignored the fact that this young 

</span><span>Cook Islander had a limited liability Company.  They sued him for the debts that he 

</span><span>owed as a private trader.  They touched the limited liability Company</span><span>.  I don’t know 

</span><span>whether they deliberately did this.  I suspect they did because they could not pin him 

down as a limited liability Company.  So they sued him and had their lawyer issue a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1889 

</span></div><div><span>Warrant  to  arrest  him  as  an  absconding  debtor  so  the  guy  couldn’t tra</span><span>vel  to  another 

country where he had a job waiting for him.   

</span></div><div><span>In fact Mr Chairman, I was woken up at 2 o’clock in the morning to try and help this 

</span><span>young man but at that point because of the legal implications I could not help him.  He 

was due to leave at 4 </span><span>o’clock in the morning.  He had to stay back and we had to sort 

</span><span>it out.  Within a week, Mr Chairman, we were able to get all the documents from the 

Registrar  of  Companies  as  mentioned  here  to  prove  that  his  was  a  limited  liability 

Company  and  the  creditor  Company  could  not  pin  the  debts  on  him  privately.    The 

debts belonged to the Company and not to this young man.  So we filed an application 

to have the Arrest Warrant lifted off this young Cook Islander.  We were successful on 

the  basis  that  the  debts  did  not  belong  to  him  even  though  he was the owner of the 

Company.    The  debt  in  fact  belonged  to  the  Company.    So  he  had  to  forward some 

securities personally and he was allowed to leave. He was allowed to go away to take 

on his job in this overseas country.  However, the case is not concluded but it brings 

home the point that if your business is a Company that Company will be responsible 

for all its activities.  That protects our people when they get into businesses.  As I say, 

I  fully  recommend  this  for  pearl  farmers,  for  non-pearl  farmers,  for  planters,  for 

</span><span>fishermen, for any type of people who want to go into trading. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  want  to  advise  the  Minister  of  Justice,  I  would  have  recommended  a  further 

change to the Companies Act for this reason.   Some lawyers try to shift the liability 

away from Companies and put it on the person privately and a lot of our local people 

get  laden  with  debts  that  lawyers  have  cunningly  removed  from  Companies  and put 

the  liability  on  our  people  personally.    Mr  Chairman,  I  have  seen  examples  many 

many  times.  A  legal  Company  that  formed  the  Company  that  registered  the  limited 

liability Company, such as the XYZ Company is the same people that sometimes take 

action for a creditor suing the owner of XYZ privately rather than as a Company.  I 

reckon lawyers who do this should be punished because they formed the Company to 

protect  one  party.    When  another  party  takes  that  person to  Court they switch roles.  

They ignore the fact that the Company is supposed to protect the XYZ client.  They 

</span><span>ignore that and take the person to Court and put the liability on him privately.  That’s 

</span><span>one  area  of  exploitation.    Our  people  have  been  victims.    I  have  seen  a  number  of 

private  individual  Cook  Islanders  getting  lumbered  with  debts  that  they  should  not 

</span><span>have been responsible for.  I’ve seen so many examples.</span></div><div><span>And finally in respect of that I am sure our people will appreciate that whenever they 

</span><span>deal with a Company they must make their payments with Company cheques. All their 

receipts  must  be  with  Company  receipts.  If  you  go  outside  of  it  and  use  personal 

</span><span>cheques  you  will  be  personally  liable  for  your  Company’s  kaiou.    And  you  have  to 

</span><span>mark all your Company cheques.  You have to stamp it with your Company name with 

limited  liability.    LTD  is  not  a  declaratio</span><span>n.    That’s  a  legal  requirement.      If  you  are 

</span><span>trading like the Honourable Paora Teiti as a baker, you have to use Company cheque 

with the name of the Company on it. You start using your personal cheque you will be 

personally liable. 

</span></div><div><span>The same thing will apply to all receipts and all invoices that belong to the Company. 

</span><span>It must be stamped with the Company’s stamp indicating limited liability Company at 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>1890 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the end.  If you don’t use it you are allowing the other parties to sue you personally 

</span><span>afterwards. 

</span></div><div><span>So you use the protection of limited liability Companies, allow it to protect you like a 

</span><span>blanket  around yourself.  Use it because there’s a lot of cunning lawyers around.  If 

you don’t follow it they are going to get you.</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  hope  I  have  done  my  public  relations  bit  on  this  Clause.        In 

conclusion, may I invite you along Honourable Members and all those in Avarua to a 

barbecue around at the Paradise Bar for the New Alliance Party.   I recommend you 

not  to  eat  tin  fish  today.  Save  the  tin  fish  for  Sunday.      Your  host  will  be  the  New 

Alliance Party, and also Mr Speaker I will be excusing myself shortly because I have 

got work out there.    Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.   Are there any further speakers? 

The Honourable Member Mama Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman,  Kia  Orana  to  you  and  your  staff 

Members.     

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  to  support  the  views  of  my  previous  speaker.  I  would  like  to  go  back  Mr 

Chairman  to  the  past.  There  were  big  businesses  which  were  in  debt  to  small 

businesses.   In this example these Companies have got what they want from us.  And 

the next thing, they have become bankrupt.   We the smaller Companies were the ones 

who supported them.  They used our products to assist them. The Honourable Norman 

George indicated that we the little people lose out. Therefore, I would like to ask the 

Honourable Minister responsible for this Bill to consider these issues carefully.   

</span></div><div><span>More  often,  those  who  liquidate  their  businesses  come  back  with  a  new  business. 

Therefore, I would like to remind the Cook Islands people that these types of persons 

are  still  around  and  really,  they  do  not  care  about  us.  I  would  like  to  ask  the 

Honourable Minister to come up with a solution to this problem. If this was in another 

country, I doubt if they would be able to start another Company.  Government should 

look into these matters and devise ways to protect the little business people who are 

being abused. I do not really agree with the views of the Hon. Norman George for all 

kinds of people to set up Companies.  Because in the instant that I have described it is 

the  little  people  who  have  provided  the  lemons,  the  fish  and  the  next  thing  these 

people are declaring bankruptcy so we loose out.   I just like to ask our little people 

that  if  you  sell  things  to  these  Companies  ask  for  the  money  then  before  you  give 

whatever it is that you are selling to them. Because if they go bankrupt then they go 

bankrupt on there own and it does not affect us.   These are my views on this matter 

Mr Chairman, Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Mama Mau Munokoa.  Our next speaker is 

the Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate of the Democratic Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Kia  Orana  to  you  and  your  staff, 

Honourable Members and to our people listening in this evening.   Special Greetings 

to the Minister in charge of this Bill, the Honourable Tiki Matapo.  I would like to say, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1891 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to my friend the Honourable Minister of Education. I was actually listening 

to the fine start of your speech on the second reading, but all of sudden you stopped 

because you saw no one on the Opposition side.  And I would like to say Kia Orana to 

my friend the Minister of Marine Resources who is not in his seat now.  I am prepared 

to make a reply to his comments in the manner he described us in the Opposition in 

</span><span>this afternoon.  However he is not here.  It’s not fair to me to attack anyone who is not 

</span><span>on the playground.  Similar to what he did to my candidate in Penrhyn who is working 

hard  there.    </span><span>The  Minister  of  Marine  Resources  unfairly  attacked  him.  However,  I’ll 

</span><span>give my left cheek Mr Chairman, to him and he can do what he likes with the other 

cheek.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I see here in the Explanatory Notes of this Companies Act that there are 

lots of things here our people need to know.   But I think the Minister in charge took it 

for granted that we in the Opposition would understand the Amendment Bill.  To be 

honest Mr Chairman it is very difficult for me to explain to our people what this is all 

about.  I can clarify what had been submitted to us through the Explanatory Notes.  

</span></div><div><span>Now there are three main subjects in this Clause 5.  Inserting four new sections into 

</span><span>this Clause 5 amends what it says here in Clause 5 is that the Principal Act.  One of 

</span><span>them,  Section  9(A)  which  gives  the  Registrar  power  to  inspect  any  records,  books, 

accounts  of  any  Company  to  ascertain  that  any  Company  is  complying  with  the 

provisions of the Principal Act, or involved in any criminal activities.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA: </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, the time to deal with the Explanatory Note on the 

Bill is in the principle and merits. We are dealing with the Bill itself, we are in Clause 

5 of the Bill. The Honourable Member is cunning and he wants to debate the principle 

and merits by referring to the Explanatory Notes.  We are debating Clause 5. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:    </span><span>It  was  not  my  fault.    He  said  that  he  was  referring  to  the 

Explanatory Note. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>The  Point  of  Order  is  relevant.    So  please  come  back  to  the 

Clauses and stop mentioning about the principle and merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  fail  to  understand  the  Minister’s  Point  of 

</span><span>Order  because  I  am  referring  to  the  Clause  5  in  reference  to  the  Explanatory Notes. 

And it deals with Section 9(A) of Clause 5, Powers of the Registrar, which is talked 

about in the Explanatory Note. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>There is no such Clause he is talking about. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Order please, please addresses the Table.  Carry on Honourable 

Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>1892 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>I am very angry with the Honourable Minister because he 

does not see that I am talking about Clause 5, which is a New Section. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Please do not get angry Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>I am  angry because this afternoon we were not  given the 

right to speak when in fact we have the right to talk on this Vote Item.  Therefore Mr 

Chairman, I do not want the Opposition to be taken for granted again. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Carry on Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Please advise the Minister to keep his backside on the chair 

when I am speaking. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>Point of Order 193.  I have a Point of Order.  Clause 5 of the 

Bill does not have anything to do with the Explanatory Note. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  May I remind the Honourable 

Members that an angry person is a hungry person.  Any angry person will not vote and 

if he votes he votes wrongly.  Continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you for that correct  statement.  The Minister I am 

sure heard that for himself.  Although I said, I am angry, I want him to defend himself 

when I say I am angry.   

</span></div><div><span>We have to  go to  this  Clause 5.  I want  to  ask the Minister to shut up. Oh sorry, to 

keep quiet. Sorry Mr Chairman I got your habit of saying shut up.  I am saying here 

Mr Chairman this Clause 5 gives the Registrar the power to inspect any records, books 

or  anything  from  the  Company  to  ascertain  whether  any  Company  or  officer  is 

complying  with  the  rules.    Under  section  9(A)  it  shows  that  the  Registrar  has  the 

power  to  inspect  those  things,  to  ascertain  whether  a  Company  or  any  officer  of  a 

Company is complying or has complied with this Act. Mr Chairman the Registrar can 

exercise the right to be able to detect offences against this Act.  But I want to say this 

</span><span>Mr Chairman.  The Registrar may authorise a person to inspect a Company’s records 

</span><span>that  were  burnt,  or  destroyed  where  they  were  stored,  maybe  in  the  Government 

</span><span>building that was burnt down. We all know about this very large Government building 

</span><span>that burned down and there was no insurance on it. How can a person if that person is 

instructed  by  the  Registrar  provide  the  books  and  records  of  a  Company  when  he 

cannot  provide  them?  The  building  has  burnt  down?  There  is  a  provision  in  this 

amendment that tells us that if a person is instructed to provide books and records and 

he cannot do so then the Registrar can take that person to Court.   

</span></div><div><span>If we look at the new section 9(B) this provides that the Registrar may direct a person 

</span><span>to make an inspection of any Company’s records.  While that person is doing what the 

</span><span>Registrar wanted there are probably times when the person would divulge information 

to  others  so  others  would  be  able  to  find  out  what  is  happening  in  this  Company.  

There  is  no  guarantee  that  this  will  not  happen  and  if  it  does  happen,  what  are  the 

fines that this person could be fined?  Section 9(B) also tells us that a person cannot 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1893 

</span></div><div><span>divulge information to any other person without the permission of the Registrar or the 

Secretary of Justice.  What would be the punishment for an officer if information was 

divulged?  Section 9(C) provides for any person aggrieved as a result of his refusal to 

give  records  to  the  Registrar  or  is  aggrieved  by  any  act  or  decision  made  by  the 

Registrar may appeal  to  the Court.  This  person that is being asked to provide these 

documents and records has the right to refuse.  If the Registrar demands the person to 

provide the information  they may appeal  to the Court against that decision.  Section 

9(C)(4) tells us that the person who is appealing to Court against the decision of the 

Registrar  wins  in  Court  then  it  will  not  be  required  for  him  to  release  those 

information.  My question is what is the fine for a person who leaks information about 

a Company? 

</span></div><div><span>So  maybe  the  Minister  will  be  able  to  tell  us  what  the  fines  will  be  for  an  officer 

working for the Minister of Justice or the Secretary to  the Minister of Justice or the 

Registrar or Deputy Registrar.  What would the fines be for somebody who leaks that 

information?  I would expect the Minister of Agriculture to stand up and explain the 

rest of this Bill if he can, so that our people will see if he can explain the rest of this 

Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>It’s in t</span><span>here.  Read it! 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  I  cannot  see  why  he  was  opposing  my  reading  out  the 

Explanatory Note.  So I will speak until all my speaking times have been used. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  We already know that. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> So our people will fully understand what is in the Bill.  I 

would like our people to understand what is happening in this Bill and why it has been 

done now when their time is running out. 

</span></div><div><span>Earlier  on  I  heard  the  Minister  for  Marine  Resources  saying  that  we  were  ignorant, 

arrogant, and </span><span>what’s not.</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>He’s got nothing else to talk about.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>   Irrelevancy.  There is no relevance in what the Honourable 

Member is talking about he is referring to the Marine Resources as opposed to the Bill 

before  the  House  which  are  the  Companies  Amendment  Bill.    I  would  ask,  Mr 

Chairman,  that  you  draw  his  attention  and  his  address  to  the  Bill  before  the  House.  

</span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    The  Honourable  Member,  Dr 

Terepai Maoate.  Please come back to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>1894 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I am shocked at the behaviour of 

this  Minister  Mr  Chairman.  He  stood  up,  curbed  his  Vote  to  stop  each  one  of  the 

Opposition Members from talking on his vote item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You are irrelevant Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> He </span><span>wouldn’t let us speak on that Vote Item.</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I draw your attention to Standing Order 206.  

That is, if the Member persists in the manner he has done tonight you have every right 

to exercise that power.     Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I rose to present my views on Clause 5 of 

this Bill.  Mr Chairman, this young man is saying - I am sure you would have seen this 

</span><span>on  television  and  if  you  didn’t  see  it  too  bad.    This  young  man  is  a  leader  for  the 

</span><span>young people.  This young man said that if you want to be a leader you must set an 

example. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> So come back to Clause 5 then. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Allow me to  explore this matter Mr Chairman before I go on to the 

Clauses. What this is saying is that if you want to be a leader you must set an example.   

</span></div><div><span>I agree with the point of view of the Leader of the New Alliance Party, Mr Chairman, 

when  he  explained  what  he  understand  by  this  Bill.    I  think  this  is  the  way  that  it 

should  be  done.  We  should  explain  things  so  that  our  people  will  be  able  to 

understand  what  we  are  saying.  Mr  Chairman,  this  Bill  will  be  detrimental  to  our 

</span><span>people  if  they  don’t  know  or  understand  what  it  is  all  about.    I  don’t  know  if  the 

</span><span>people who made this Bill are aware of the facts that there are some small businesses 

who  are  not  registered  as Companies.  But  as  far as I can see they have brought  this 

amendment to this House so that our people will follow it, otherwise they will get into 

trouble. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I have had no formal education but what I have learnt over the years as 

I  have  been  taught  in  my  church  Mr  Chairman  is  that  whenever  you  say  something 

you  must  say  it  in  such  a  manner  that  people  will  understand  what  you  are  saying.  

This is what I have always done Mr Chairman that is what I do, I explain to our people 

what is in the laws that we have been trying to make.  This will enable our people to 

understand and to warn those who are in business today. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please  come  back  to  the  Clause  before  the  House  Honourable 

Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1895 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> I am speaking, Mr Chairman, on the powers that have been given to 

the Registrar to inspect things according to this Bill.  The Registrar, Mr Chairman, has 

the power to authorise somebody, to order someone, to produce these books or papers 

or  records  or  to  ask  somebody  to  produce  these  in  accordance  with  the  powers  that 

this Bill is giving to the Registrar.  What this is telling us is that if the Registrar is not 

the one who is actively involved then he has the power to send somebody to do this 

and we must respect that authority that is given to that person.  Because our attitude as 

Maori  people  is  such  that  if  we  see  something  done  by  a  person  other  than  the  one 

</span><span>primarily  authorised,  then  nine  times  out  of ten we don’t respect  that person who is 

</span><span>working on behalf of another person.  The Bill is then spelling out the things that the 

person delegated the power can do within the provisions of this Act. 

</span></div><div><span>There are two warnings in this Clause Mr Chairman.  The first one is to us business 

people  and  the  second  one  is  to  the  inspectors  as  highlighted  by  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition.  There is a Clause in this new section that we are looking at which tells 

the  inspector  that  whatever  information  the  inspector  obtains  throughout  his  or  her 

inspection the inspector is not allowed to divulge any of that information.   

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition, of the Democratic Alliance Party is asking what are the 

fines.    What  do  we  want  fines  for?    We  all  know  that  if  anybody  working  for  the 

public service does anything wrong that person goes home.  Why do we have to ask 

what will happen if they divulge that information.  They get the sack. I said earlier that 

I  have  had  no  formal  education  but  I  understand  what  I  am  trying  to  explain  to  our 

people.  And hopefully our people will understand everything about the law that we 

</span><span>are trying to  make.  The fines for Companies who contravene this Bill haven’t been 

</span><span>mentioned.  The  question  raised  was  to  do  with  the  fines  for inspectors who divulge 

</span><span>information.  If those penalties are in this Bill then why weren’t they explained to our 

</span><span>people? And let them know that the fine here is not more than $1,000.  We know that 

the  fine  is  not  going  to  be  $1,000.    It  might  be  $2  or  it  might  be  $5  but  what  it  is 

saying here is it shall not be more than $1,000. 

</span></div><div><span>I know from experience that the fines set out by some laws have been put in place but 

when  people  get  fined,  the  fine  maybe  $10,  $5  and  they  never  get  fined  the  total 

amount that is required by the law. However, what this Act has put in place is to try to 

stop people from making those mistakes. The Leader of the Opposition is saying that 

he  could  not  explain  this  Bill  to  the  people.  And  he  is  qualified!    I  have  no  formal 

</span><span>training and I am explaining this to the people.  I am saying the Registrar or the person 

</span><span>that  is  instructed  by  the  Registrar has the right  to  go into your place of residence to 

look  at  your records, books and accounts. I would like to  say this again.  I want  you 

people to listen. A person that is sent by the Registrar has the right to go through your 

accounts.    

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman today at this time we are full of politics.  Therefore, we cannot explain 

to our people exactly what is happening in these Bills.   This young man is saying, if 

you want to be a leader you have set an example.    Not to get angry like some people 

</span><span>tonight.  If I want to be a leader, I have to be humble and kind.  These are the things I 

</span><span>have to try and attain. It is true Mr Chairman that my voice is very strong but what I 

really  want  is  for  our people to  understand what  is  happening.  Mr Chairman, those 

views.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>1896 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Any other speaker?  The Honourable Minister Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU</span><span>:  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Mr  Chairman,  Clause  5  in  the 

Companies Amendment Bill provides for new sections to be added onto the Principal 

Act.  The Principal Act Mr Chairman as I have outlined last night in my address on 

the merits and principles of the Bill before the House, goes back to the Companies Act 

1955  in  New  Zealand  which  is  applied  to  this  country  in  1970.    The  new  sections 

added in Clause 5 of the Bill are divided into three sectors.  Alternatively, divided into 

three subsections.    

</span></div><div><span>9(A) of this Clause Mr Chairman relates to the powers of inspection of the Registrar.  

This  provision  will  provide  the  Registrar  or  his  deputy  to  access  documentation,  all 

documentation  held  by  a  Company.    Be  it  a  private  Company,  public  Company,  or 

Company registered locally, or a Company registered locally with overseas or foreign 

shareholders.  Subsection 9(A) provides for the power to be given to the Registrar or 

the Deputy Registrar or any officer that he may appoint to examine all records held by 

those  Companies.  This  section  does  not  talk  about  or  include  any  of  the 

documentation  or  the  registration  of  any  record  that  is  kept  by  the  Registrar  of 

Companies.  It  does  not  provide for those records as advanced by the Opposition or 

about records being burnt when Government buildings went on fire.  This provision is 

restricted  to  that  documentation  to  those  records  or  other  documents  held  in  the 

possession of Companies.   

</span></div><div><span>And subclause 7 of 9(A) provides Mr Chairman a penalty for a Company who refuses 

to  allow  those  records  to  be  examined  by  either  the  Registrar  or  his  deputy  or  any 

other officers officer authorised by him. A penalty is provided under that little 7 in the 

Bill.  Therefore,  for  a  Company  to  refuse  to  hand  records  over  to  the  Registrar,  the 

Deputy Registrar or his authorised officer there is a fine provided of $1,000 or a fine 

not to exceed $1,000. And that penalty applies to the Company.    

</span></div><div><span>Then we have a little 8, a subclause little 8 that follows the 7 which provides the same 

penalty for an officer of any Company who refuses to surrender those copies. Again 

Mr Chairman, a similar penalty of a sum of not exceeding $1,000.00 is provided for 

that  officer  of  that  Company  who  refuses  or  who  breaches  section  1  of  these 

provisions.   

</span></div><div><span>Then follows after 8, Mr Chairman, is 9 where it provides the same penalty for those 

in  that  Company  or  who  works  for  the  Company  who  obstruct  the  Registrar  or  the 

Deputy Registrar or any other officers exercising those powers of the Registrar and the 

Deputy Registrar in the execution of their duties.  

</span></div><div><span>Then  we  have  9(B)  Mr  Chairman,  which  relates  to  the  disclosure  of  information 

relating to  that inspection or that examination. Similarly like the other provisions of 

9(A) a penalty is provided for those officers who contravenes 9(B) by the divulging of 

information to outsiders.  And we have 9(C) Mr Chairman, which relates to the rights 

of an agreed applicant making application to the Registrar whose application is turned 

down, to make an appeal to the High Court.   Like other legislation, which has been 

passed in this House in the past, it provides for recourse to an agreed party to go to the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1897 

</span></div><div><span>High  Court  for  a  ruling.  Now  the  Clause  Mr  Chairman  is  straight  forward.  It  sets 

procedures to be followed. It provides for powers of the Registrar to act.  

</span></div><div><span>It provides the same powers to his deputy or any officer he appoints to exercise those 

duties on his behalf.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Justice and Lands, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to the staff of the House, 

Kia Orana to all Honourable Members on both sides of the House, Kia Orana to you 

all.    Kia  Orana  to  our  people  who  are listening in  to  our debate this evening, in  the 

name of our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>I have listened Mr Chairman to the views of the Opposition and I would like to thank 

them for the views they have presented on Clause 5.  I was thinking you were going to 

stop the Leader of the New Alliance Party because he was not speaking on Clause 5. 

</span></div><div><span>But as I listened to what he said, it made sense because he was explaining something 

to our people although it had nothing to do with Clause 5.  He was in a hurry because 

the New Alliance Party was holding something tonight and this is why he wanted to 

</span><span>be excused.  So that’s O.K.</span></div><div><span>I have a few things I would like to say about this Clause that might help clear up any 

confusion.    I  think all Honourable Members are aware that Clause 5 provides brand 

new Clauses to the principal Act. These powers have not been given to the Registrar 

in  the  principal  Act.  We  can  see  that  in  this  Amendment  Bill  we  are  giving  these 

powers to the Registrar. These are very strong powers for the Registrar.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman when the Government building burnt down in 1992 there were a lot of 

records from the Companies section and the Land Court section that were burnt, never 

to  be  able  to  be  replaced.    Later,  these  records  were  reconstructed,  that  is  the 

Companies and the Land Court Section.  Through the New Zealand Government we 

requested some people to come and help us reconstruct these records.    We received 

this assistance from the New Zealand Government.  They sent some people down to 

help the staff of the Justice Department in the reconstruction of these records.  There 

</span><span>were  some  records  which  weren’t  burnt  but  most  were.    In  the  process  the  biggest 

</span><span>thing that happened was for us to go back to the Companies and ask them to help us 

</span><span>reconstruct the records of the Registrar’s office. A lot</span><span> of Companies helped us out but 

there  were  some  Companies  since  1992  up  until  today  who  still  have  not  come 

forward to help us.   

</span></div><div><span>Today, power is given to the Registrar as a result of this exercise. The consultants who 

came to help told us that the best thing to do was to authorise the Registrar to be able 

to inspect those records. 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  true  Mr  Chairman  that  it  has  been  a  long  time  since  these  Consultants’ 

</span><span>recommendations  were  submitted  to  us  in  1995.    It  has  gone  through  two  Solicitor 

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>1898 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Generals and finally with the third one we have today, we see this amendment before 

the  House.    The  principle  behind  this  exercise  Mr  Chairman  was  for  the  country  to 

</span><span>obtain a master record of all Companies and this to be kept in the Registrar’s Office.  

</span><span>This  is  the  aim  in  making  this  Amendment  Bill  and  in  giving  the  power  to  the 

Registrar  to  take  Company  records  in  order  to  help  them set  up a true record of the 

Companies  in  the  country.  They  can  access  whatever  accounts  or  books  the 

Companies have. The Registrar would be able to inspect and gather information from 

any Company.   

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Minister  Tepure  Tapaitau  did  well  in  explaining  the  Clause  and 

subclauses.  I really need not dwell further on it except to emphasise this power now 

given to the Registrar to be able to reconstruct what records have been destroyed by 

the  fire  to  enable  the  Companies  division  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice  to  restore  their 

records.   

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore Mr Chairman, there are provisions relating to the imposing of penalties 

either on a Company or an officer or individuals that may very well hinder or obstruct 

the  powers  of  the  Registrar  to  inspect  documents  within  a  particular  Company.    It 

</span><span>appears  that  the  problem  really  started  after  the  records  were  destroyed  by  the  fire 

</span><span>because of the hindrances and difficulties the Companies Division was facing with the 

Companies,  especially  Companies  not  cooperating  to  provide  records  it  left  us  no 

option but to give that power.  For the information of Members of the House I would 

like to say that in 1997 about 387 Companies were struck off the register, that was in 

1997. 

</span></div><div><span>In  1996  no  Company  was  struck  off,  in  1997  387  and  in  1998  75  were  struck  off.  

Therefore, in the two years we are looking at about 462 Companies, were struck off 

the register. 

</span></div><div><span>The procedure, Mr Chairman, in the past has been that if no Company pays its annual 

licence at  the due time, a notice is  sent  to  that Company to remind them or to warn 

</span><span>them and if they don’t pay or make any effort to pay after six months that Company 

</span><span>will  be  struck  off  the  register.    Mr  Chairman,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  460 

Companies struck off were bankrupt.  No.  You might be surprised, Mr Chairman, that 

so many of them are still operating without a licence.  So I thought there is a need to 

highlight that for the information of the House.  Perhaps then we can really appreciate 

</span><span>the  powers  in  this  amendment  given  to  the  Registrar  to  be  able  to  go  out  and make 

</span><span>sure which Companies are still operating and haven’t paid their licence and those who 

</span><span>have paid their licence.  Because it has been recorded that of the 462, 460 of that have 

been  struck  off  the  list  for  unpaid  annual  licence  and  two  of  that  were  voluntarily 

struck off the list. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  what  I  am  trying  to  highlight  here  is  the  difficulties  the  Companies 

Division came through since the Company records were destroyed by the fire.  There 

are other issues related to this Bill.  The important thing is this - </span><span>I don’t want to dwell 

</span><span>on  that  -  but  really  to  assist  the  Companies  Division  to  set  up  the  records  again  the 

</span><span>way it was before the fire. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are just some of the comments Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1899 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 5 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 6: Annual Return to be made by a Company having a share capital 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 6 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  First of all, I would like to thank 

the Honourable Minister for the explanations that he has provided and I am happy that 

these explanations  were the things that I was thinking of.  He also told us about the 

records that were burnt, reminding us that the majority of the records were lost from 

this  building.    But  when  the  Honourable  Minister  of  Marine  Resources  spoke,  the 

Honourable Tepure Tapaitau, he said that there was no relevance of the burnt building 

to this Clause.  But we know now from the explanation by the Minister responsible for 

this Bill that a large amount of official documents were lost </span><span>due to that fire. I don’t see 

</span><span>where he got his idea from that the mention of this building had no relevance to this 

amendment.  This is why I felt funny with what this Honourable Minister was saying 

earlier this afternoon.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, tonight we see that he is talking about something else and the Minister 

responsible for this Bill is explaining something else.  So whatever he said about us 

earlier on today, is like a slap in the face for him. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Point of Order Mr Chairman.  193.  I rose, Mr Chairman, to ask 

you  to  bring  the  Honourable  Member  back  to  Clause  6  because  there  is  nothing  in 

Clause  6  about  the  Honourable  Minister.    If  he  has  got  something  to  say  to  the 

Minister, please take it outside. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Honourable Member, please come back to Clause 6. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Mr  Chairman,  I  really  hadn’t 

</span><span>finished what I was trying to say but I will have to follow your ruling.   

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my point of view on Clause 6.  This is a short Clause and this basically is 

telling us that Companies that have a share capital must make an annual return.  Mr 

Chairman, the Minister responsible for this Bill explained earlier on that there are a lot 

of Companies that have been struck off the Register. And there are some Companies 

out there that have not been registered. Some are registered but not working and this 

tells  us  that  those  Companies  that  are  still  working  but  have  a  share  capital  must 

submit annual returns. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>1900 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>The  Minister  indicated  that  there  are  Companies  who  may  or  may  not  be  on  the 

Register. And this shows us that those Companies out there that are not licensed or if 

they  are  licensed  are  not  required  to  be  licensed  any  more.  They  however  have  to 

provide annual returns by the 1st July.  I think this will be of some encouragement to 

our  Companies  for  them  to  provide  annual  returns  so  that  creditors  who  deal  with 

some of these Companies will be able to  see what  sort of position these Companies 

are  in.    I  know  that  if  banks  are  lending  money  to  Companies  then  being  able  to 

provide  an  annual  return  to  the  banks  will  enhance  the  chances  of  a  Company 

obtaining credits with that bank. What this Bill require them now is to provide annual 

returns  to  the  Registrar.  Then  the  annual  return  can  also  be  used  to  enhance  their 

position with banks, especially for small businesses.  This will help to give them more 

credibility with their bankers. 

</span></div><div><span>I can remember a gentleman who passed away in Australia, Mr Richard MacDonald. 

He was always helping small business people such as planters, farmers to furnish their 

returns.    When  they  needed  assistance  obtaining  finances  and  things  like  this  Mr 

MacDonald was there to help them.  In addition, this gentleman was always there to 

help them and he was a strong Member of the Democratic Party.    I know that two 

</span><span>gentlemen, David Wright and Trevor Simmons have been helping small businesses in 

</span><span>the  country  for  a  very  long  time,  in  providing  them  with  financial  statements, 

accounting  records,  and  helping  these  businesses  in  any way possible.   I think they 

were also very helpful in helping the small businesses to furnish their annual returns.    

I also know one of our young lady Mr Chairman, Miss Caroline Short who also helps 

out our small businesses.  Mr Chairman, these are my views and I would like to give 

my support to this Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member from Nukuroa, Tangata Vavia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  Kia  Orana  to  you  this  evening,  and  to  all  the 

Honourable Members in this House.  

</span></div><div><span>I rise Mr Chairman to give my support and to register my views on this Clause. We 

can  see  that  this  Clause  is  saying  that  any  Company  having  a  share  capital  must 

provide an annual return.    This Bill is telling us that regardless whether a Company 

has as share capital or not, that Company must provide annual returns to the Registrar. 

This  Bill  Mr  Chairman  is  similar  to  the  Income  Tax  Act  where  you  must  furnish 

returns to the Income Tax Department.   The only difference between Clause 6 and 7 

is that there are some cases that the Registrar may approve the form of annual return 

to  be different  from  that prescribed by the Act.   The reason for this is that in some 

cases the Company could be big, so large that the schedule set out in this Act may not 

be  enough  to  explain  thoroughly  what  the  shareholding  of  a  Company  may  be.   

However,  we  are  being  told  here  in  Clause  6(g)  that  the  Registrar  may  revoke  the 

return if it is either not to his satisfaction, whole or in parts. This is the only difference 

between these two Clauses and maybe we should deal with them together.   Those are 

my views on this Clause Mr Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>1901 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 6 stands part of Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause  7:  Annual  Return  to  be  made  by  a Company not  having a share capital.  The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 7 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span> The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T.  MAOATE:</span><span>   I think this Clause is giving us a warning Mr Chairman.   

I really thought that when the Honourable Member for Mitiaro spoke he would have 

explained to  us  what  those share capital  would be in  the Company that they owned.  

We all know that they bought shares in this Company and I do not know how many 

thousand  shares  he  had,  or  how  many  shares  the  Honourable  Minister  of  Marine 

Resources had.  I thought he would have explained to us.    I was quite surprised that 

there  was  no  explanation  forthcoming  about  the  Aeroplane  Company  they  bought 

shares  in.  Maybe  the  accusation  against  the  Companies  by  the  directors  and  the 

shareholders were all wrong.   I thought there would be an explanation, but I do not 

know  whom  we  should  believe.  Mr  Chairman,  I  do  not  want  to  hear  any  more 

moaning  in  the  future  about  having  shares  in  liquidated  or  bankrupt  Companies, 

because this would have been good example to use in this Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Point  of  Order.    Mr  Chairman,  in  my  view  this  Member  is 

irrelevant.  This Bill before the House does not talk about a particular Company and a 

particular individual.   It talks about registration of Companies, keeping of records of 

Companies.  It  talks  about  Companies  in  general  and  it  does  not  talk  about  any 

particular Company, which he is referring to.  Again Mr Chairman, he is off the track.  

And I would ask the Chair to bring him back to the Bill before the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.      Now  Honourable  Member 

please come back to the Clause of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.    MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  I  mostly  certainly  will  come 

back to the Clause with disappointments.   I would have thought the Minister would 

tell me more about what has happened, so that it is clear. In addition, he said it does 

not relate to this Clause. We then have to seek for other examples that may be relevant 

to  this  Clause.    I  wonder  whom  he  is  afraid  of.  Anyway,  I  will  give  my  support  to 

Clause 7.   

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned by the Honourable of Member of Mitiaro Tangata Vavia, it also comes 

under the Clause 6 that a return will be required at the end of the year.  And that an 

</span><span>annual licence will no longer apply in this case.  So I just like to say to all our people 

</span><span>who have Companies. Although you have no shares in a Company, you are required to 

submit a return on the 1st July each year.  What  will happen if you do not furnish a 

return?  You  will  be  fined  $1,000.    I  just  rose  to  remind  our  people  that  you  are 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>1902 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>required now as we have seen in Clause 6 to furnish an annual return before the 1st of 

</span><span>July  every  year  and  if  you  don’t,  then  you  will  be  p</span><span>enalised  according  to  this  Act.  

Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Agriculture Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    I  did  not  intend  to  speak  on  the 

Clause  but  to  correct  the  last  comment  made  by  the  last  speaker.    There  is  no  such 

penalty  in  both  Clause  6  and  Clause  7  if  anyone  fails  to  file  a  return.    That  is  a 

misleading statement.  That is why I stand up.  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN</span><span>: Thank you, Honourable Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 7 stands part of the Bill</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>Clause 8: Time for completion of annual return. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 8 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>The way I understand it as explained by the Minister, if you 

do  something  wrong  you  will  not  be  penalised.    Under  some  Clauses  there  are 

penalties and under this Clause there is no penalty.  I thought it will be in the Schedule 

but I have not got there yet.  The important thing is if there is no free return.  If you 

make a return there has to be some form of fine or fee.  Everything about the fees is in 

the  Bill.    These  Clauses  are  being  put  in  place  as  a  warning  so  our  people  will  do 

things correctly.  If you are saying that, there is no penalty if somebody breach these 

Clause  then  I  say  that  is  wrong.    So  you  will  have  to  make  up your mind what  you 

want  to  do.  Clauses  6  and  7  are  talking  about  the  various  fines,  which  will  apply. 

Clause  8  refers  to  Sections  130  and  131  of  the  original  Act.    I  have  supported  the 

previous Clauses.  Now we need to provide sufficient clarifications to our people so 

that our people can understand what these Clauses are about.  Our job here is not to 

punish our people but to try to help and encourage them to carry out what is required 

under the law.   

</span></div><div><span>Nowadays  if  you  go  to  the  Justice  Department  to  get  a  birth  certificate,  death 

certificate or whatever, the fee is very high.  That is the trend we are getting into now.  

As I was studying this Clause, I saw a $1000 penalty for nearly all the fines and the 

lowest  is  $100.    I  am  surprised  that  now  we  are  near  the  end  of  the  life  of  this 

</span><span>Parliament,  Government  is  enacting  punishments  to  be  imposed  onto  our  people.  

</span><span>What I was really looking for is to give the people a grace period of one year.  They 

</span><span>are  allowed  to  submit their return and if they can’t within that period then penalties 

can be considered. Don’t force them to this without proper training.</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1903 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of order.  The Honourable Leader of the Opposition as 

always in his line of debate is out of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  Yes come back to Clause 8. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  I will come back to Clause 8 Mr Chairman and Clause 8 

provides that a Company must make a return to the Registrar. When he does that he 

has to pay a fee.  I just want to remind the Deputy Prime Minister we have to make a 

return that is accompanied by a fee payable to the Registrar.  Those are my points Mr 

Chairman.    I  am  sure  you  will  appreciate  my  attempt  to  get  the  message  across  to 

</span><span>those who are in doubt as to what this Clause is talking about.  That’s all.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 8 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>Clause 9: Annual return fees.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 9 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>I  thought  the  Honourable  Member  has  already  spoken  but  anyway  the  Chair 

recognises the Honourable Member Dr Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Actually you made me speak on 

this  Clause.      Clause  9  explains  that  Companies  shall pay an annual  return fee each 

year when they file an annual return.  You know Mr Chairman, when the Honourable 

Tangata Vavia was talking about C</span><span>lause 6 and then Clause 7 the Minister didn’t get 

</span><span>up and point of order him.  Who is the hypocrite here? 

</span></div><div><span>CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please come back to Clause 9. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I am on Clause 9 Mr Chairman.  This Clause abolishes the 

</span><span>requirement  for  Companies  to  pay  any  annual  licence.    Simply by turning it over to 

make a return at the end of the year where a Company pays the return fee.  I will not 

go on to Clause 10, which talks about the licence.  I hope it is clear that in Clause 9 it 

takes away the practice of paying a licence each year and it is replaced by a return to 

be made and fees to be paid on the submission of that return.  I guess our people will 

be quite clear about this but I still maintain these things need to be clarified to small 

businesses and even big businesses.  They need to be fully aware what they have to do 

and to comply with the Act in the future. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 9 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 36</a></div><div><span>1904 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 10: Making false statements 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 10 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Clause 10 amends the principal 

Act  and  inserts  a  new  Clause  relating  to  the  Company  officer  who  makes  false 

</span><span>statements in any document.  Well, that’s breaking the law and by right the Registrar 

</span><span>has the right to prosecute that sort of person. 

</span></div><div><span>And there’s so much under this Clause that needs to be explained but I don’t intend to 

</span><span>go into all that.  But one  thing is certain and that is when a person makes a false or 

</span><span>misleading statement, that’s an offence. Or if he omits or authorises the omissions of 

</span><span>information, this Clause 10 says that that is an offence.  Also, under this Clause 10, an 

officer  or  a  Company  making  or  furnishing  false  or  misleading  statements  are  also 

breaking the law under this Clause.  Even in a situation where there is a meeting and 

an officer of a Company makes a false or misleading statement in that meeting, he is 

also  breaking  the  law  under  this  Clause.    So  any  statement  or  report  made  by  the 

Company  or  officer  of  the  Company  that  is  misleading  or  false,  that  person  or  that 

Company is breaking the rule under the Act, under Clause 10. 

</span></div><div><span>So the message here, Mr Chairman, to me should be quite clear to our people in small 

and big businesses not to try it. Not to make false statements because when they catch 

you, you will pay the penalty outlined in this Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>And I again demand that our people need to know because some of them may not be 

listening to us.  They are busy doing their own businesses.  They should be informed 

of what this Bill is all about and in particular Clause 10. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 10 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 11: New Sections 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 11 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 37</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1905 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Clause  11,  Mr  Chairman,  amends  the  principal  Act.  The 

first  part  talks  about  offences  by  the  Company  about  fraudulent  use  of  property  for 

their own benefit.  And that is referring to Members or officers of the Company.  They 

can also be prosecuted under this Clause if they are to destroy or if they are to conceal 

any  Company  property  that  the  Registrar  requires.    That  is  fraudulent.    Even  if  the 

Company is in liquidation, Mr Chairman.  These will come under this Clause.  If they 

conceal any property, any debt or books or papers belonging to this Company that is 

under liquidation they are at fault.  And even if they have to create a false record of 

</span><span>the Company’s affairs they are also  at fault. If they are to carry on businesses under 

</span><span>these fraudulent practices, they are also at fault under this Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>And  under  461  (b)  that  Clause  deals  with  offences  by  officers  of  Companies  in 

liquidation.  And you will note, Mr Chairman, that there are many sub-clauses under 

this Clause 11 including new sections.  Especially under 461(b) which goes from (a) 

to (j) with all the explanatory notes regarding the offences that people in the Company 

who may be involved in the liquidation of a Company.  For instance, it is a fault for 

</span><span>the  officers  or  the  Company  if  they  don’t  deliver  to  any  liquidator  of  the  Company 

</span><span>books, papers in the custody, under his control belonging to the Company.  It involves 

knowing  or  believing  that  false  debts  are  made.    There  are  requirements  by  the 

liquidator  to  receive  certain  documents,  certain  papers  from  the  officers  of  the 

</span><span>Company and if they don’t comply with these </span><span>requirements they are breaking the law.  

Even  if  the  officers  present  false  representation  of  the  creditors  of  the  Company.  

Under  461  (c)  it  shows  the  falsification  of  records  by  an  officer,  Member  or 

contributor  of  a  Company  who  with  intent  to  defraud  or  deceive  any  person  and  it 

talks about all the things that are destroyed, falsified, mutilated, altered and so forth.  

And under 461 (e) of this Clause 11, Mr Chairman, it tells us the penalties and other 

provisions relating to the foregoing offences. 

</span></div><div><span>And from Sections 461 to 461(d) of this Act a person shall be liable on conviction to 

imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or 

to both.  Clause 461(e)(3) affects the liability of any person under any other Act but no 

person shall by virtue of those sections are punished twice for the same offence.   

</span></div><div><span>Those are my views Mr Chairman, but what is required here is, again for our people to 

</span><span>know more about it.  If they can’t be given any further information or clarificatio</span><span>ns of 

</span><span>these the best  thing would be for them to  get  a copy of these documents because of 

this Amendment Bill.  When it becomes an Act, they need to know exactly what they 

are required; to do about this Companies Act in order for this Amendment Bill to be 

of any use to our people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    The  Honourable  Minister  Tiki 

Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T.  MATAPO:</span><span>    Just a brief, comment I would like to add at this point in time 

</span><span>in  relation  to  the  penalties.      I  couldn’t  help  myself  but  to  get</span><span>  up,  having  heard  the 

Leader  of  Opposition  yesterday,  belittling  the  purpose  of  this  Bill  before  the  House 

</span></div><div><a>Page 38</a></div><div><span>1906 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>and questioning why this was brought in at this time.  And why we are increasing the 

penalties and that our people will suffer as a result of this amendment.   

</span></div><div><span>This is the other side that I want to bring in now. This is also the protection for our 

own  people,  by  creating  the  offences  and penalties imposed in  the event  of the Act.    

In other words this provisions is provided to protect the creditors of the Companies.   

We  know the Honourable Member Mama Mau Munokoa spoke earlier despite what 

the Honourable Member Norman George stated about the consequences some of our 

people has suffered. This is the very point I would like to highlight. Our own people 

are being protected, people with the Companies.  These provisions should be added to 

protect creditors in the Companies.   Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span> That Clause 11 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span> Clause  12,  Provision  with  respect  to  the  default,  fine  and  meanings  of  officer  in 

default.  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 12  stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  I’d  like  to  thank  th</span><span>e  Honourable 

Minister, for the warning he issued to our people with regards to Companies involved 

in unlawful activities. Clause 12 shows that if an officer in default that officer must be 

punished and there are default fines. He should know that if he is in the wrong, then 

he  or  she  must  pay  the  penalty.  I  have  no  problem  with  this  Clause,  so  I  give  my 

support to Clause 12 and 13.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 12 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 13: Table of fees to be paid to the Registrar. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 13 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I think it will be appropriate for all of us to know that at the 

end of this Bill there is a schedule of fees to be paid to the Registrar.  The fee for the 

registration of a Company or the registration of an overseas Company is $100.   The 

</span></div><div><a>Page 39</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1907 

</span></div><div><span>fees  range  from  $50  down  to  $20,  to  $10  and  down  to  $5.      As  an  example,  for  a 

certificate of registration, the charge is  $10. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I will interrupt you Honourable Member. It is time to adjourn 

the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Mr Chairman I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Progress be Reported  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Parliament is resumed.
