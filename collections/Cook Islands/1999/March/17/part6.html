</span></div><div><span>Companies Amendment Bill, Second Reading.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Education, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, to Honourable Members 

of the House and to our people listening in throughout the Cook Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Last  night  we  heard  the  Honourable  Dr  Terepai  Maoate  Leader  of  the  Opposition 

saying that the economy of the country has gone right down into a bottomless pit.  It is 

surprising  that  I  am  reading  here  that  some  of  our  business  people  are  saying 

everything is alright. Let me read this writing to you. 

</span></div><div><span>“The display of economic buffoonery by the Opposition parties just shows us all how 

</span><span>out of touch they are with reality, they have no credibility.”</span></div><div><span>This is what is being said about them.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
