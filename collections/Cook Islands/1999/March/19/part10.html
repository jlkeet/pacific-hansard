<div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span></div><div><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>  Point  of  Order  164,  Sir.    Alluding  to  previous  debate.    No 

Member may allude to any debate of the same question unless such allusion is to be 

relevant  to  the  matter  under  discussion.    The  matter  as  raised  by  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member now has already been discussed during this Session. He’s coming back and 

bringing the debate that has already been done on the same subject.  That’s the Point 

</span><span>of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  May  I  ask  the  Honourable 

Member to come back to the Clause 8? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE</span><span>: I am camping in Clause 8.  If the Minister of whatever Ministry he 

is administering, which is next to nothing, wants to know.  I will tell him what I am 

talking about. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> 106(B) (iii) involves a 5 years penalty imprisonment and $10,000 

fine. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Would you please sit down, Honourable Member? Now Honourable 

Minister what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>   He is calling me names. Why? I represent the people of Mauke 

in this House.  He is totally out of order in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister. Can I ask the Honourable Member 

to withdraw that statement and continue? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2011 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Could he tell me what I said? I would like him to say what I have 

</span><span>said, so I can withdraw it.   I don’t know, I didn’t say anything unparliamentary to you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Now, please take your seat.    I  am only asking you to withdraw it 

and that is all.    

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker. What am I withdrawing?  I would like to 

ask the Member for Mauke, just to be patient.  Sit down I know...(Inaudible) .....Please 

listen  to  me.  The  consequential  result  of  this  Amendment  106(b)  (iii)  relates  to  the 

penalty.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span> Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span> He is alluding to other Clauses in the Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  in  order  to  help  this  Honourable  Member  for 

Penrhyn I will read Clause 8.   

</span></div><div><span>“Clause 8.  Consequential Amendments </span><span>- Section 82 of the principal Act is amended 

by- </span><span>(a) inserting in  subsection (1) immediately after the words “sections  </span><span>83 to 86 of 

</span><span>this Act” the words “or is convicted of an offence under sections 106B(3), 106D(3)(a) 

or  106F(4)  of  this  Act.”  (B)  inserting  in  subsection  (2)  immediately  after  the  words 

“sections 83 to 86 of this Act” the words “or sections 106B(3), 106D(3)(a</span><span>) or 106F(4) 

</span><span>of this Act.”</span></div><div><span>This  Clause  is  saying  we  shall  add  to  sections  82  and  86  these  offences.    What  the 

Amendment is doing is to identify what section 104 is all about.  You have got to be 

dumb to say that.  Please pay attention class. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>He’s the one who’s dumb.</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Please  withdraw  that 

statement. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>I referred to the Member as dumb, I withdraw it as a reflection on 

him although it is true. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman  section  106B(3)  relates  to  the  penalty  because  that  is  what  is  being 

shown  to  us.    If  you  are  confused,  under  Section  106B  that  means  $500  fine  and  3 

years in  prison.  What  is  being done now is  amending this to  add it to  the principal 

Act.  My question is, do we need to go this far in turning a normal election campaign 

activity into a criminal  conduct? This  legislation is  unfit for a democracy.  I am not 

surprised at all as to why Government rushed to put this through.  They did not want 

to talk about section 106A.  You can see they are ashamed of talking about it.  They 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>2012 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>rushed  it  and  tried  to  conceal  it,  let  me  tell  you  I  will  be  on  television  tonight  to 

explain all of this. 

</span></div><div><span>Then  we  move  on  to  section  106D(3),  again  it  increases  the  activities  in  which  this 

Government is criminalising the election campaign because 106D(3) relates to excess 

payment for an election campaign.  This is another criminalising of the due process of 

democracy. So does section 106F, which relates to failing to file a return six months 

after  an  election  to  the  Electoral  Officer.    The  fines  under  section  106F  for  an 

individual candidate is $1000 failure to file a return;  $500 for every day they fail to 

file  a  return.    After  six  months  if  a  political  party  fails  to  file  an  election  expenses 

return  the  fine  is  $5000,  and  $1000  for  every  day  they  fail  to  file.    This  Clause 

Consequential Amendment is making the failure to file a return a corrupt act.  Another 

is criminalising of the election process.  Mr Chairman, the other consequence of all of 

these punitive measures by this Government is that there is nothing to stop them from 

erasing all the Opposition Members by claiming they have been involved in election 

activities  before  the  campaign  period.  These  provisions  are  brutal,  exploitative 

measures of a Government  in  its last moments of power, leaving behind a legacy of 

fear and oppression. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> What is your Point of Order, Honourable Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  164 again. He is going back to Clause 7.  Could you please tell 

the Honourable Member he is taking the debate back to Clause 7, which this Standing 

Order says he cannot allude to issues raised already in the session. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Please come back to Clause 8. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> I am obliged to you and your tolerance and understanding is to be 

applauded.  The Standing Order the Honourable Member is  referring to  is  164.  Let 

</span><span>me read what it says.  “Allusion to previous debate.  No Member may allude to any 

</span><span>debate in the session unless such allu</span><span>sion is relevant to the matter under discussion.”  

</span><span>No Member may allude to any debate of the same session unless it is relevant to the 

matter under discussion.   

</span></div><div><span>Surely any kid understands that I am making an allusion to it because it is relevant to 

</span><span>this debate.  I am asking the Honourable Member for Mauke, to please be patient, take 

it easy, I am covering Clause 8 in detail. Maybe the announcement of our Candidate 

for Mauke, Toto, is  worrying him. What  is  of larger concern is that we never worry 

about these things in the past.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, after 34 years of Self Government we have to bring this in.  This is not 

reform, this is deform.  This is an act of suppression.  It has ruined, for the moment, 

the  enjoyment  of  freedom  we  have  enjoyed  during  an  election  campaign.  It  really 

spoils  it.    I  think  if  everybody  searches  his  conscience  you  will  realise  what  we  are 

facing is a very serious matter. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2013 

</span></div><div><span>You  would  expect  this  Government  to  go  out  with  high  grandstand  finales,  with  a 

high reputation, with honourable reputations in their last moments. Why leave behind 

the legacy of this Clause and its consequential actions?  To turn democratic activities, 

like campaigning into criminal activities, to create political offences for the first time 

in our history is a step back to the Dark Ages.  The consequence of this is that in the 

future you cannot have public meetings.  You cannot send brochures out.  You cannot 

have  Party  conferences  before  the  election  period  otherwise  you  are  liable  to  a 

$10,000  fine  or  five  years  imprisonment.    You  cannot  have  radio  talkbacks,  you 

</span><span>cannot promote your policies.  You can’t do anything because it is sweeping.  It says 

</span><span>you cannot be involved in any election activity, which is very wide and sweeping. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, this is a big blow to  our civil rights.  I know our people listening out 

there  will  be  disgusted  with  this  Amendment.    I  want  the  people  of  this  country  to 

know that this kind of legislation is only relevant in places like Nigeria where there is 

a military dictatorship.  It is also relevant in North Korea where there is a Communist 

</span><span>dictatorship,  in  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  where  there  is  a  Communist 

</span><span>dictatorship.  Mr Chairman, if there were people monitoring our civil liberties in this 

country,  if  there  were  civil  libertarians  in  this  country  they  would  be  marching  in 

</span><span>protest if they heard about this. 

</span></div><div><span>I  want  the  people  of  this  country  to  know  that  the  New  Alliance  Party  will  be 

dedicated  to  removing  these  provisions,  by  removing  this  Amendment  from  the 

Electoral Act.  I hope that this Act will catch the Cook Islands party themselves one 

day because what  you sow you shall reap.  This is a filthy Amendment.  I hope one 

</span><span>day  you  will  face it and we’ll make you eat  it.  I want  the people of this country to 

</span><span>know  that  we  of  the  New  Alliance  Opposition  reject  this  Amendment.    We  will  be 

opposing this Amendment and we will be fighting this Amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please come back to Clause 8. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Because it is the second part that we were not allowed to debate 

that I find </span><span>reprehensible.  The first part about recall is fine.  It’s the second part about 

</span><span>interfering with campaigns that we are really concerned about... 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Chairman.  193 - Irrelevancy in Debate.  I 

think the Honourable Member is debating the principles and merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>Oh, you wouldn’t know.</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Clause 8 is quite clear.  There is no need for us to go back and 

debate the principles and merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> I got his point.  I got his drift. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is no Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>2014 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>Mr Chairman, I got his point.  The hurt is so bad he can’t bear it.  

That’s  why  I  have  to  steer  away  from  where  he  is  hurting  but  these  Conseq</span><span>uential 

Amendments are the most unnecessary changes to our electoral system that one could 

have.  The most obvious thing that I wish to say about this entire exercise is that we 

could  have  done  it  without  legislating.    The  Political  Review  Commission  did  not 

recommend  punishment.    They  recommended  a  shorter  campaign  period.    We  all 

agreed with that.  But to turn it into a punitive Amendment to the Electoral Act.  To 

punish  individuals  and  political  parties  up  to  five  years  imprisonment  and  $10,000 

fine was not asked for.  Why is it necessary?  These changes are uncivilised, cruel and 

harsh.    So,  Mr  Chairman,  this  as  I  said  is  the  most  disgraceful  thing  that  this 

Government has done in its disgraceful 4-5 years in power. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  a  step  backwards.    This  is  a  humiliation  of  our  democratic  process.    I  am 

</span><span>ashamed  to  say  that  people  overseas,  when  they  see  this,  will  say  ‘what  kind  of 

backward country is the Cook Islands’?   Some years ago, we were the shining lights 

</span><span>under the Democratic Party, we were one of the shining examples in the Pacific. 

</span></div><div><span>In  conclusion  therefore,  Mr  Chairman,  let  me  just  say  that  these  are  the  brutal 

activities of a regime that is about to be extinct.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I would like to put forward my own Amendment to 

Clause 8.  What we have here in this Amendment is 8A, 8B, but what I would like to 

</span><span>do  is  to  make  an  Amendment  to  it  as  8C.    Amendment  C  will  say  “Misuse</span><span>  of 

</span><span>Government vehicle or property shall be an offence.”</span></div><div><span>(Much laughter) 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>   Point of Order.  Because this Amendment is firing off into 

the bushes.  I would like you to ask him to come back, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You have gone off the track, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>I haven’t gone off the track, Mr Chairman.  How would he know 

that I have gone off the track if I haven’t explained it?  We are going to agree to A &amp; 

</span><span>B.  What  I want  to do is to include a C.  Because as I see it, this sub-Clause A and 

sub-Clause B, these are traps for our people.  The C would be for us in this House.  I 

know this has come into the newspaper in the last few days and it tells us there are a 

few Ministers of the Crown using Government vehicles. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2015 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  193 - Irrelevancy.  He is completely out of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You are irrelevant Honourable Member.  Please come back to the 

Amendment before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  You are making a mockery of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>If you look at the yesterday’s paper we see there are three Ministers 

</span><span>of  Government  who  are  being  paid  $3,000  transport  allowance  and  they  are  still 

driving Government vehicles. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You are irrelevant. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> This is why I think we should put this Amendment in. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Who are they? 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> And I think it would be appropriate if we put it in because this is 

also consequential. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Honourable Member, please sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order 193 - Irrelevancy. 

</span></div><div><span>I don’t think we should be speaking about an Amendment if it hasn’t been done in the 

</span><span>appropriate manner and I think we will be wasting our time debating any Amendment 

</span><span>that hasn’t been done according to the proper procedure. It is just like the Honourable 

</span><span>Member of Rakahanga to make it up because he had to say something. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Please come back on the Amendment to the Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> If I look at these Clauses, these subsections in this Clause 8, I feel 

sorry  for  our  people  because  I  think  it  is  not  fair.    I  feel  sorry  for  the  Minister  who 

presented  this  Bill,  because  when  we  started  it was going very well, everything was 

fine, but as soon as the Minister of Agriculture took over then everything started to get 

worse.   If only it was left with the Minister who is responsible for this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU: </span><span>Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  Mr Minister...  

</span></div><div><span>TEPURE TAPAITAU:</span><span> 193, Mr Chairman, the Honourable Member is again way out 

of  order.      And  Mr  Chairman,  I  am  sick  and  tired  of  listening  to  this  Honourable 

Member who is coming up with all his slippery and tactical moves.  He has done it so 

many  times, Mr Chairman, in  the past,  and I am  not  going to  tolerate that anymore.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>2016 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>He asks, who am I?  I am one of the Honourable Members in this House who is sick 

and  tired  of  listening  to  him  coming  up  with  all  this  trickery,  slippery  tactics  in 

delaying the passing of legislation in this Honourable House.   And I will draw your 

attention  with  respect,  Mr  Chairman,  to  exercise  some  control  over  this  kind  of 

behaviour in this House.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER</span><span>:  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.        The  Point  of  Order  is  quite 

relevant Honourable Member.   Please come back to Clause 8. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI</span><span>:  Clause  8(C).  Any  Member  of  Parliament  or  candidate  who  is 

misusing Government property or a Government vehicle shall be liable.    

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span> Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  cannot  see  anything  about  Government  vehicles  or  Government 

property in Clause 8, it seems that this Honourable Member is trying to be cheeky to 

this House and to you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Chairman, according to our Standing Orders this is the time that 

we can bring any Amendment to any Clause.   So I want an Amendment.   Therefore, I 

want an Amendment for a new sub-Clause, sub-Clause (c).    

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>    Mr Chairman, Standing Order 240.  Amendments maybe placed 

on  the  Order  Paper.      It  shall  be  competent  for  any  Member  desiring  to  oppose  an 

Amendment to a Bill, to lodge a written copy of such proposed Amendment with the 

Clerk.   Now my question is, Mr Speaker, has he given you a copy of his Amendment?   

Therefore, I put this before you that the Honourable Member is out of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    I  can’t</span><span>  accept  anything  such  as 

this.      We  are  all  Honourable  Members  in  this  House,  and  we  know  the  procedure, 

how to go about bringing an Amendment into this House.   About this piece of paper, 

</span><span>it doesn’t make sense. Secondly, this is not the type of paper you </span><span>use to bring about an 

Amendment to a Bill in this House.    So come back to this Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  This  paper,  I  bought  it  myself,  Mr  Chairman,  because  Parliament 

</span><span>does not have any paper to give to me. Could you explain why not, Mr Speaker? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Your piece of paper will not be accepted, Honourable Member. 

If this piece of paper gets to the newspaper can you imagine the criticisms this House 

will be subjected to in terms of the quality of our work? 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Should I write it, or print it, or type it?   If you like I will type it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order, Honourable Member.    The Honourable 

Deputy Prime Minister. 

. 

</span><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>     This Honourable Member is irrelevant.   He wants to debate 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2017 

</span></div><div><span>an Amendment that isn’t on the Bill.  He is very stubborn.  You’re making a ruling but 

</span><span>he is electing to talk back. I can see him trying to cause an argument like a child.  If 

you look at him he looks old but his behaviour is that of a very silly child. Apply the 

Standing Order 206 and get him out of this House.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  would  like  you  to  withdraw  that  comment,  please  Honourable 

Deputy Prime Minister.   Thank you, Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Please do it 

properly.  We have been in this House for a very long time and we all know how to 

</span><span>maintain the sanctity of this House.  I don’t believe that I should be telling you how to 

</span><span>do things, in accordance with the Standing Orders.  Therefore, I would like you to pull 

yourselves  together  and  let  us  do  things  according  to  the  way  it  is  supposed  to  be 

done.    

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, we are now on this Clause 8, don’t bring anything else and make it messy. 

</span><span>So  I  would  like  to  humbly  request  that  the  Honourable  Member  comes  back  to  the 

Clause in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>I would like to ask you, Mr Chairman, whether you have accepted 

the statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of order 189.  Point of Order! I have a Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Before I call upon the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister I will 

ask the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister to withdraw his statement. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>    If  what  I  have  said  is  abhorrent  to  the  Honourable  Member 

then I have no problem withdrawing it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  (Inaudible). 

Excuse me I have not finished speaking. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, about the Motion made by the Honourable Dr Robati on an Amendment to 

the Clause.  I will have no problem if this is to be put to the vote. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Amendment be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Lost 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 8 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Education Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA: </span><span> First of all, please if I may send my Greetings to Tereora College 

very quickly before I speak on Clause 8.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>This morning I attended the investiture of the Prefects at Tereora College.  I enjoyed 

the  ceremony.    It  is  my  last  official  function  at  Tereora  College.      I  am  please  to 

congratulate, on our behalf, our young people who are the Head Boy Prefect, the Head 

Girl  Prefect,  the  Deputy  Head  Boy  Prefect  and  the  Head  Girl  Prefect  and  all  the 

Prefects.  The Head Boy this year 1999 is P. Solomona, the Head Girl is Jane Bishop, 

the  Deputy  Boy  is  Luke  Christian,  and  the  Deputy  Girl  is  Erin  Matheson.    I 

congratulate these young men and women and the Prefects.  I am sorry I cannot give 

you the rest of their names.  

</span></div><div><span>Now coming to Clause 8.  I listened to the Leader of the New Alliance Party shouting 

at the top of his voice on how he opposed these Consequential Amendments.  These 

provisions  in  the  Bill  are  to  clean  up  the  election  process.    To  make  the  election 

process fair to everybody entering the race.  By imposing a five week election period, 

we  are  also  mindful  of  our  poor  people  who  have  to  suffer  the  burden  of  our 

campaigning  -  calling  on  their  generosity  to  contribute.    Let  us  give  the  people  a 

break, the election period is five weeks. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor.    What  is  your  Point  of 

Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Irrelevancy.  He is talking on Clause 7 and we have gone past that. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you.  I am quite prepared to accede to the Point of Order, 

because  that  is  the  Point  of  Order  raised  against  the  Honourable  Member  Norman 

George but he did not listen to you or the Point of Order.  All I am doing is mention 

the relevant section in Clause 7 that is being amended by Clause 8.  Those three points 

being mentioned here in Clause 8 are amended to clean up the election process but the 

Honourable Member Norman George does not want the election process to be cleaned 

up. 

</span></div><div><span>These  provisions  create  a  level  playing  field  for  politicians  and  people  who  want  to 

</span><span>enter national politics.  What is so unfair about that? It covers expenses - that need to 

</span><span>be checked.  If we are all in agreement with making the future elections of this country 

clean and accountable and transparent, what have we got to hide?  Why are we afraid 

of  these  innovations  for  the  better?    Mr  Chairman,  I  am  disappointed  with  the 

Honourable Member, the Leader of the New Alliance Party.  He wants to live in the 

old  days.    They  were  O.K.  for  the  past.    It  is  time  we  improve  the  process  for  the 

country.    That  is  what  this  Amendment  Bill  is  doing.    The  Honourable  Norman 

George, my friend, is calling out that I am retiring, and what am I talking on this Bill 

for?  I am still in the House and I expect to contribute on behalf of the electors and the 

future  candidate  who  will  be  coming  here.    Especially  to  lighten  the  load  on  our 

people.  I would like Teina Bishop to hear what the Leader of the New Alliance Party 

was saying.  The Cook Islands Party is going to disappoint you.  I know you do not 

heed him.  The New Alliance Party and the Democratic Alliance Party were trying to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2019 

</span></div><div><span>recruit him into their camp but he wanted to run for the Cook Islands Party.  They are 

calling out, No! No! No!  No what? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor.    What  is  your  Point  of 

Order? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:  </span><span>I  have  two  charges  against  the  Honourable  Minister  for  his 

utterances.      Standing  Order  206,  Disorderly  conduct.    By  insinuating  that  Teina 

Bishop will win his seat, he is being grossly disorderly. Secondly, irrelevancy. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>I have a philosophy in life.  Don’t blow the horn until the bread is 

baked and I don’t think you heard me say that Teina is going to win.  I hope he will 

win.  I’m very confident tha</span><span>t he will. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to Clause 8 then, I just want to reiterate the point that all we want to do 

by  making  this  Consequential  Amendment is  to  clean up the election process  and if 

anyone  is  against  cleaning  up  the  election  process  let  him  say  no  when  you  put  the 

question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> You are misusing Government vehicles. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 8 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> May I call for a Division? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Schedules. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I call for a Division. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  I  will  now  call  the  question 

again. 

</span></div><div><span>Those who are in favour please stand.  Thank you Honourable Members. You may be 

seated. 

</span></div><div><span>Against, stand.  Thank you, Honourable Members.
