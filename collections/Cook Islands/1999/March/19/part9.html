</span></div><div><span>That Clause 8 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Chairman,  and  to  all  Honourable 

Members of the House and to our people listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask a question from the Opposition.  We would like to know when this 

Bill would be implemented? 

</span></div><div><span>Last night there was an Amendment to Clause 1 to give confirmation of the date when 

</span><span>the Bill will be implemented.  There are also a lot of changes to Clause 8.  That is my 

main concern.  When will these amendments come into force? Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Are there any other speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  all  Honourable 

</span><span>Members of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>In  reference  to  the  question  raised  by  the  Honourable  Member  Robert  Woonton 

touching on the debate last night. When I brought in that Amendment to Clause 1 into 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2005 

</span></div><div><span>the  House,  the  words  expressed  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  were,  “my  heart  is 

full of joy”. </span></div><div><span>The  matter  will  have  to  go  to  the  Executive  Council  before  the  decision  of  the 

Executive Council is finally made public.  As you know Mr Chairman, that was not in 

the Amendment but after the Amendment was put in last night everyone was happy. I 

know  that.  Rest  assured Honourable Member Robert Woonton  there is  no way that 

Government  will  pull  the  rug  from  under  your  feet,  if  that  is  what  he  is  concerned 

about.  After all, the Amendment was to be fair to everybody.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you,  for  your  comments  Honourable  Minister.  The 

Honourable Member, Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Mr Chairman, thank you. We heard the Minister saying that the 

rug will not be pulled from underneath our feet. I will accept what he said because I 

trust  him  more  than  anyone  in  this  House.  Had  it  been  other  Ministers,  it  would  be 

difficult  to  get  a  confirmation  out  of  them.  His  word  is  his  honour.  Today,  Mr 

Chairman, there is a demand for everything to be in black and white. It has to be in 

black and white - I can take his word as my black and white. I thank the Minister for 

his  commitment  to  us  and  to  our  people  listening  in  that  they  will  not  pull  the  rug 

from  underneath  our  feet  when  the  legislation  comes  into  force.  I  will  not  take  any 

more of your time, Mr Chairman, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    The  proverbial  saying  which 

</span><span>says “whatever is written, is written” is going wrong.</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Greetings to you, Mr Chairman, 

to the staff members in Parliament and all Honourable Members in the House and our 

people who are listening in, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings also to those would-be Members who will stand for the next election, Kia 

Orana. I hope you are listening to what is being debated in the House today.  I was a 

bit late, I really wanted to speak on Clause 7.  Now I will speak on Clause 8.   

</span></div><div><span>Pursuant to Clause 8, Consequential Amendments, the new Members who will be in 

Parliament in the future, the new Government, can implement Clause 8 and Clause 7. 

If  enacted,  these  will  affect  them.   These  provisions will strengthen any weaknesses 

identified in this Bill.  These Clauses we are including in the principal Act are new to 

the  election  process  in  the  Cook  Islands.  There  are  also  some  Clauses  that  will 

override already established provisions in our Constitution.  I like this consequential 

Amendment  because  this  Consequential  Amendment  provision  will  correct  anything 

wrong thereafter.  And also in terms of Clause 7, 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  We  are  no  longer  dealing  with  Clause  7,  Honourable  Member.  

We are on Clause 8. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> But as a consequence of what has been amended in Clause 

7,  this  Clause  8  is  saying  we  can  make  Amendments  as  a  consequence  of  those 

Amendments.    Be  assured  that  if  there  are  mistakes  in  the  implementation  of  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>2006 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>provisions of this Act, Clause 8 is saying we can make Amendments to rectify those 

things that may be a consequence of these Amendments made today. For example. I 

was saying, what has been amended in Clause 1, Clause 2, Clause 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 

and  7  could  become  Amendments  in  the  future  under  this  Clause  8,  which  is 

Consequential Amendments. 

</span></div><div><span>And  I  would  like  to  caution  us,  Mr  Chairman,  for  the  harsh  effects  of  these 

Amendments,  including  Clause  7.  It  will  be  very  hard  on  those  who  may  wish  to 

donate to political par</span><span>ties if they want to assist political parties.  They don’t want to be 

</span><span>exposed because they would be victimised.  We might even find that by restricting the 

use  of  the  media  we  are  actually  depleting them of revenues for their business.   All 

these  things  we  put  through  the  media  have  to  be  clean,  Mr  Chairman,  by  law  or 

otherwise.    And  in  my  view,  Mr  Chairman,  these  are  the  things  that  could  become 

Amendments  in  the future.  There are a lot of difficulties in these Amendments that 

we  have  incorporated  in  this  Bill  that  could  eventually  become  consequential 

Amendments. 

</span></div><div><span>There are quite a few areas, Mr Chairman, in this Amendment Bill in front of us that I 

</span><span>am not in full support of.  Even though I am satisfied with what the Minister has done 

</span><span>in amending Clause 1 to ascertain that there will be a commencement time that would 

be  made  in  the  future.    But  in  view  of  the  fact  that  there  will  be  Consequential 

Amendments, I doubt very much about the contents of some of the Clauses that I have 

failed  to  be  here  in  time  to  express  my  views.  But  I  have  indicated  some  of  those 

points  when  I  was  on  the  principle  and  merits  of  this  Bill.  The  others,  including 

Members of Government, have also expressed their concerns on this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Honourable  Member,  you  are  still  talking  on  the  merit  and  the 

principle of the Bill.  Would you mind please coming back to Clause 8. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Be  guaranteed,  Mr  Chairman, 

that a lot of these things in the previous Clauses will be affected by the consequential 

Amendments  and that is  why I am  saying to you, Mr Chairman, and to Members of 

this Honourable House that I have my reservations about the whole Bill.  A lot of the 

things  that  I  see  here  will  eventually  be  affected  by  the  consequential  Amendments.  

The reason why that has happened is because some of the good things that we should 

do according to the Political Review Commission recommendations is mixed up with 

some of the things that this Government decided to incorporate in this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span> Point of Order. 193. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor,  Honourable  Member.  

Honourable Minister, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  193, Sir. With all due respect to the Leader of the Democratic 

Alliance Party, he is trying to articulate this Clause and be irrelevant at the same time. 

We  need  to  be  relevant  to  the  Clauses  this  House  is  debating  now,  Mr  Chairman, 

</span><span>because it is not this House’s fault that the Honourable Member was late coming into 

</span><span>Parliament.  Everybody knows that we were due to start at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2007 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  The Point of Order is quite in 

order, Honourable Member.  Will you please come back to Clause 8? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Actually,  I  would  like  to 

apol</span><span>ogise  to  you,  Mr  Chairman.    I  thought  we  would  be  coming  back  at  7  o’clock 

</span><span>tonight.   That  is  why I was late.  Because the Minister in  Charge never came to me 

and talked to me about the changes of the programme.  He just implemented it without 

discussing  th</span><span>e  matter  with  me.    I’m  not  sure  whether  he  had  discussions  with  the 

Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  but  I  certainly  didn’t  have  any  discussion  on  the 

</span><span>programme  of  the  sittings  of  this  Honourable  House.    So  I  apologise  to  you,  Mr 

Chairman, for not being up with the programme because I was not briefed about that. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Point of Order.  193. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> However, I will come back to the Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  a  Motion  was  moved  before  the  House.    The 

Honourable  Member  is  totally  irrelevant.    It  was moved in  the House to  extend this 

session twice to 1.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. this afternoon and the Honourable Member 

knows very well, every Member in this House knows very well this House never sat 

after 4.00 p.m. on Fridays.  Thank you, Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Anyway  the  point  is 

Honourable Member, please come back to Clause 8. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I would just like through you, 

Mr Chairman, to tell the Honourable Minister that we have never had meetings in this 

</span><span>Parliament three times a day.  This the first time we’ve done that, Mr Chairman.  I’m 

</span><span>sure you know that very well. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>(Inaudible) 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> And he is trying to say it has never happened before. That 

we have never had a meeting after 4.00pm on Fridays. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Never before have we had three meetings a day. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>The Speaker controls the House, it’s not me.</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> You shut up. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>You’re being out of order.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>2008 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  I am asking under 193 not to address me.  I am merely carrying 

out the protocol of the business of the House and asking the Honourable Member to 

come back to the Clause before us.  It had nothing to do with the explanation on my 

Motion prior to that.  What I am seeking is for the Honourable Member to come back 

to the Clause before the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>That’s not a Point of Order, Honourable Member.  It’s a Point of 

</span><span>Explanation.  Now the point is, Honourable Member, please come back to Clause 8. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    I  probably  need  a  detailed 

explanation  by  the  Minister  in  Charge.    What  does  he  mean  by  Consequential 

Amendments here, so that I can speak some more on it?  Because if I refer to it . . . 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Honourable Minister cannot reply because he has already had 

his speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> No, I am not referring to </span><span>that bad Minister.  I’m referring to 

</span><span>the  good  Minister,  the  Honourable  Minister,  Tiki  Matapo.    I  am  referring  to  the 

Minister  in  Charge  of  the  Bill,  Mr  Chairman  because  when  I  start  basing  my 

arguments in reference to the previous Clauses, the Minister of Agriculture pulled me 

down.  I believe the consequential Amendments have something to do with the other 

Amendments  should  it  happen in  the future.  I would have expected the Minister in 

Charge to pull me down and tell him that this is not the case. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You are not talking on the Clause, Honourable Member.  Please 

come back to the Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  With  your  indulgence, 

Chairman, I am referring to the consequential Amendment, which I feel affects other 

Clauses of this Amendment Bill. That is why I said I am full of joy, as the Minister 

reminded this House a while ago. I accepted with joy the Amendment that he made.   

That would have been a Consequential Amendment in the future, but we are doing it 

now.   I am very happy for that one.  

</span></div><div><span>However, with the other areas that I have quoted, especially in Clause 7 that is what I 

am  worrying  about.  And  I  am  hoping  that  whoever  the  Government  maybe  in  the 

</span><span>future, will deal with that, with that particular unsatisfactory Amendment.  I am sure 

</span><span>the Minister in charge will accept my view on that, its up to the next Government, or 

up  to  the  next  Parliament  to  make  those  changes,  should  those  changes  become 

necessary.   However, as  this has already been passed and will be passed, I  have no 

option  but  to  express  my  view  that  I  am  not  in  total  support of this Bill.   There are 

certain  areas  in  this  Bill  that  I  do  not  support.  Not  because  it  is  not  important  Mr 

Chairman, but I feel it has not properly been put together to satisfy all the Members 

and  all  the  people  of  this  country.    Its  been  strongly  mentioned  in  this  House  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman,  but  it’s  got  to  be  fair  to  the  people,  its  got  to  be  fair  to  the  Members  of 

</span><span>Parliament, and that’s the area I would like to see fairness on both sides.  Th</span><span>at is why I 

</span><span>am  speaking  on  this  Clause  8  Mr  Chairman,  I  hope  I  have  conveyed  my  views  as 

intended.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2009 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Mr Speaker, in speaking on this last Clause of this Bill I want to 

voice my disappointment about the fact that the critical parts of the Bill were rushed 

through the House in our brief absence from the House. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, 193 irrelevancy in debate. Let not the Leader of 

the Oppositions come here and moan inside here.  They have failed to be in this House 

to deliver their responsibilities.  They were not here when the Parliament resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Deputy Prime Minister.  The Point of Order is quite 

in order Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>  I  do  not  know  why  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  is  so  touchy.  

Because there was just a mention to it, before I was going into Clause 8, just a mere 

mention of it to start shooting straight away. Obviously, they have plenty to hide, they 

did not want us to discuss those critical Clauses.   Quite clearly there is a lot of them 

embarrassed  by  those  Clauses  and  they  did  not  want  to  debate  those  embarrassing 

</span><span>Clauses.    I hope they haven’t instigated a recall petition for me for being late.  This 

</span><span>Parliament is running out of patience, because they will be thrown out very shortly. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Members  know  very  well  that  this  House  has  a  lot  of  Bills  to  go 

through this sitting, and they deliberately want to sabotage the work of this House.  

</span></div><div><span>(Inaudible) 

</span></div><div><span>Please ask them to come back to the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> If you are looking for an explanation there, Mr Speaker, I went to 

have goat meat at lunchtime. That is why I did not get here at 1.00p.m.  I was a few 

minutes late. The puakanio (goat) meal was so delicious. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> If you are 10 minutes late, or 1 minute late, or even half minute late 

you are still late. Come back to Clause 8, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I wish you did not help them to hurry it through.  

You know the referees should not catch the ball and run with it.  They should stop the 

player.    Anyway,  Mr  Chairman,  coming  to  this  last  Clause  8  consequential 

</span><span>Amendments.      Shall  we  say  ‘consequential’  or  resulting  from  this  Amendment? 

</span><span>(Inaudible) You shut up! 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>2010 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>The  consequential  results  from  these  Amendments  are  that  the  Cook  Islands  Party 

Government  is  going to  be thrown out  at  the Election.  However, let me look at the 

consequences,  of  adding  condition  numbers  under  Clauses  106B,  106D,  and  106F.    

The biggest tragedy of this Amendment Mr Chairman is the criminalisation of election 

campaigns.  This  Government  has  turned  what  is  an  exercise  in  democracy  into 

criminal acts, into political crimes.  For the first time in this country, this Government 

is  legislating  political  crimes.    The  consequential  actions  of  prosecuting  people  for 

carrying  out  election  activities  before  the  5  weeks  period  amounts  to  criminal 

conducts.  For the first time, we are going to be punished criminally for doing what we 

used to do for the last 34 years of Self Government.  I differ strenuously, strongly with 

the Minister, with the Attorney General when he said that the confusion allows them 

to put this Amendment through.   Let me tell this House where he is wrong. Because 

he is relying on sub-Clause 2 of article 64.  And here is what article 64(2) says.
