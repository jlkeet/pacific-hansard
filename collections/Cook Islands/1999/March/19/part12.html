</span></div><div><span>We will now take the Third Reading.  The Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, before I move for the Third Reading, I  would like 

to thank the Honourable Members who have contributed to the debate on this Bill 

before the House.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Electoral Amendment Bill be now Read a Third Time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  Can I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Utia Matata 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>We call for a Division. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Standing Order 139.  Point of Order, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> What is your Point of Order, Honourable Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    Standing  Order  139  says  Division  Unnecessarily  Called.    Mr 

Speaker,  we  have  already had a vote on Division  called for and the result was clear 

cut. And now they are asking for another Division. I am saying to you that you have 

the final say.  But I am saying this is an unnecessary call for Division. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Order please.  The Floor belongs to the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    I  repeat  Standing  Order  139  says,  Division  Unnecessarily Called 

and I am putting it to you that the Opposition is calling for an unnecessary Division on 

this matter. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> No.  How do you know? We are calling. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  But you have the final say on this one, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I am the one who called for a Division.  I am the 

one who called for a division.  The reason is that this vote might have Constitutional 

consequences.  That is why we wanted the House to vote by Division.  There may be 

consequences.  We want the numbers counted.

seats?
