</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>The Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Chairman  and  all  your  staff  members  for  the 

</span><span>good  work  they  are  doing  for  Parliament  in  this  House.  Greetings  to  the  Prime 

</span><span>Minister  who  is  absent  in  the  Northern  Group  To  the  Minister  who  has  left  on  an 

overseas  mission,  to  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet,  the  two  leaders  of  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1987 

</span></div><div><span>Opposition, to Government Members and to our people who are listening to us on this 

new day, Greetings in the grace of our God. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I rise to give my support to Clause 3 of the Bill and to air my views on 

some  of  the  points  in  it.    Mr  Chairman,  I  know  that  every  single  Member  of 

Parliament in  the House is so confused with the Bill we have in front of the House. 

The only person </span><span>who isn’t confused is the Minister responsible for this Bill. I know, 

</span><span>Mr Chairman, that there are Members of Government who are against this Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>(Interjections) 

</span></div><div><span>Hey, shut up. I would like to thank the Minister responsible for this Bill. I recall a Bill 

which we had previously in  this House, Mr Chairman, where we  - both sides of the 

House  -  all  disagreed  on  it  but  the  Minister  was  able  on  that  occasion  to  explain  it 

satisfactorily  and  we  were  able  to  resolve  our  problems  there  and  then.  We  have  a 

similar  situation  now,  and  again  the  Minister  is  quick  to  respond  and  make  the 

changes to appeal to both sides of the House and ultimately to our people. Once again, 

I would like to thank the Minister for finding a way to make the process smoother. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span> There he goes, off the topic again.    

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Clause 3 lists the grounds upon which electors may conduct a petition 

against you. They include absence from Parliament for a certain length of time, failure 

to  meet  with  your  constituents  and  failure  to  bring  the  requirements  of  your 

</span><span>constituents  to  the  notice  of  Government.  I  know,  Mr  Chairman,  that  we  don’t  all 

</span><span>clearly understand the Bill that we have in front of the House but if the Member for 

Rakahanga understands, good for him because he is clever. 

</span></div><div><span>I recall, Mr Chairman, some people were appointed to look at the subject of elections 

some time ago. These people, who included Stephen Wearing, came here to explain 

the results of their discussions. They clarified most points but there are some people 

</span><span>here who understood it and there are some who didn’t.</span></div><div><span>Looking  at  this  new  Bill,  the  thing  that  worries  me  is  that  this  Bill  will  affect  our 

traditional way of doing things, our system of hospitality - the way we welcome and 

treat people. There are a few things that I am able to do as a Member of Parliament. 

The way I see it, this Bill encroaches into areas of customary hospitality, and makes it 

illegal for me as a Member of Parliament to invite people to my house and to provide 

food  for  them.  It  is  customary  for  the  people  of  my  island  to  provide  food  for  their 

guests. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    The  Honourable  Member  is 

talking about the period of campaign where bribery and things like that are taken into 

account  because  it  may  affect  the  election  result  of  the  candidate  at  election  time.  

This particular Clause is referring to your performance throughout the time you have 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>1988 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>been elected as a Member of Parliament.  It does not refer to the election time only.  It 

refers  to  your  performance  throughout  the  whole  period.  Your  performance  must 

satisfy your constituents, which is why you must be helpful to them. If your conduct or 

behaviour  is  out  of  order,  those  are  the  things,  which  the  Members  of  your 

constituency can take up against you in a petition. That is what this Clause is all about. 

Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  That  is  a  Point  of  Explanation,  Honourable  Member.    Please 

continue on Clause 3, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    I know this Bill  is  not  talking about  the 

election  period  only.  What  I  am  talking  about  is  the  grounds  for  petitions  against  a 

Member of Parliament. I know, Mr Chairman, that if you do not perform, the electors 

can bring a petition against you. What I am talking about are the things that can cause 

electors  to  bring  a  petition against you. I was trying to  explain my understanding of 

this  and  to  explore  the  ways,  in  accordance  to  the  law,  a  Member  could  possibly 

protect himself from these petitions, Mr Chairman.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  The Honourable Member, 

Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  I  raise  the  Point  of  Order  193 

because  the  Honourable  Member  is  irrelevant.    He  is  talking  about  the  campaign 

period  which  is  outside  of  the  period  of  petition,  which  is  one  year  before  election 

time.    That  part  of  the  term  does  not  come  into  the  application  of  the  petition,  Mr 

Chairman.  So the Member is talking about the campaign period which is within the 

one year before election time. It is not relevant to this Clause. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. Continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Mr Chairman, as I said earlier, one of the grounds by which a petition 

</span><span>can be brought against you is, if you don’t attend Parliament regularly. I don’t object 

to this part of the Bill. I don’t think it is a problem if a pet</span><span>ition is brought against a 

</span><span>Member if he does not consult his constituents.  I can’t see any problem at all. Some 

</span><span>Members of Parliament last night said that there was no way of escape for us in this 

</span><span>Bill.  There  is  an  escape.  Let  us  not  think  that  our  people  </span><span>don’t  know  if  we  are  not 

</span><span>attending  Parliament.  They  do  because  we,  in  here,  do  not  trust  each  other  and  are 

always  using  every  opportunity  to  bring  each  other  down.  We  are  not  good  to  each 

</span><span>other. We have no hesitation in pointing out each other’s mistakes</span><span>. It is very easy to 

</span><span>say in here, ‘Jenny Shipley, your Member is not performing well’. It is easy to make 

</span><span>the fact known that you are either attending Parliament regularly, or you are not.  

</span></div><div><span>So, I congratulate the Minister responsible for this Bill. There are those Members who 

</span><span>have  no  qualms  about  leaving  Parliament  when  they  feel  like  it  and  attending when 

</span><span>they want. There is no commitment to stay until the end of the Parliamentary sitting. 

This Bill, however, makes the Member think twice about being absent. It is a problem 

for Members whose constituencies are far away in the Outer Islands, for example, the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1989 

</span></div><div><span>Minister of Marine Resources, who has to go back and forth from Penrhyn. Another 

difficulty is the cost involved, but if Government pays for it, that is all right. There are 

some rules which have been set in this Parliament which allow you to travel to your 

</span><span>constituencies at Government’s expense. If you use all of your allowances or you do 

</span><span>not  go  back  to  your  constituency  within  20  days  after  the  dissolution  of Parliament, 

then you have to pay your own travel expenses.  

</span></div><div><span>Another part of this Bill says that if you file an application to the Court, and it does 

not respond within a certain time, then that is your bad luck. This is a concern. As a 

Member there is little protection for you in this Bill.    

</span></div><div><span>Say,  I  was  taken  to  Court.  My  lawyer,  the  Honourable  Norman  George,  is  the  only 

lawyer whom I can go to because he is the only lawyer whom I know will defend me 

free  of  charge.  Say  it  was  a  candidate  of  his  party  in  Aitutaki  who  filed  a  petition 

against  me.    The  Honourable  Norman  George  would  try  to  make  me  lose.  I  would 

have to get another defence counsel who would most likely cost me a lot of money. If 

he  is  the  defence  counsel  for  that  petitioner,  then  I  will  stand  and  defend  myself  in 

Court against him because he is on the same intellectual level as I am. If the defence 

</span><span>counsel is someone else, then it is likely I will lose because that person will be better 

</span><span>than me.   

</span></div><div><span>(Much laughter)   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  these  </span><span>are  my  views.  I  don’t  see  what  the  difficulty  is.  You  will  have 

</span><span>problems if you do not represent your people. If you do not bring the problems of your 

constituency  to  the  notice  of  Government  then  you  are  in  trouble.  It  is  your  duty  to 

consult with your constituency. If you do not perform then the people have a right to 

bring  a  petition  against  you.  We  should  not  be  afraid  of  this  Bill,  it  should  serve to 

encourage  us  to  perform  well  for  our  people.  Speaking  for  myself,  when  I  go  home 

</span><span>after  a  day’s  hard  work,  I  am  usually  tired  and  I  don’t  have  the  time  to  see  my 

</span><span>constituents. After this Bill is passed, Mr Chairman, I am hoping that the Government 

will  revive  the  Constituency  Fund.  This  Fund  is  necessary  because  when  we  call  a 

meeting  we  have  to  have  some  f</span><span>ood  to  offer  our  constituents.  We  can’t  just  call  a 

</span><span>meeting with nothing to offer. Those are my views, Mr Chairman. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Mama Mau Munokoa.    

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Chairman,  to  all  your  staff,  to  the 

Deputy Prime Minister, the Ministers and all Members of Government. Greetings also 

to our two Leaders of the Opposition, to all our Members on this side of the House. 

Greetings to all of us on this fine morning.  </span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, my views are similar to those of the Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. I 

was not going to speak but I thought I should because as mentioned by him, I am one 

of those Members who practices our custom of giving to the people. It is not because I 

am a Member of Parliament that I do this, as a sort of bribe. No, I have always given 

things to people. That is the way I have always been. It concerns me because I am the 

Member of Parliament for Nikao and will remain so until the General Election. I am 

not treating the people. This is the way I am.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>1990 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>It was mentioned yesterday that one of the reasons that this Bill was introduced was to 

reduce our costs. I think this Bill will affect me and all of us in this House. All of us in 

here  are  people  who  practice  our  Christian  beliefs.  We  are  all  taught  to  love  one 

another, as we were reminded to do so by the Pastor this morning. However, I do not 

believe that this Bill is targeting any of us specifically, rather it is created to encourage 

us  to  do  wha</span><span>t  is  right.  I  don’t  think  it  will  generate  antagonism  amongst  the  people 

</span><span>from my constituency to bring a petition against me - it will come from people form 

outside who will put wicked thoughts in the minds of my constituents. I believe, if you 

are a hard-working Member of Parliament from the day that you are elected, until the 

</span><span>day  you  finish,  I  don’t  think  anyone  will  find  faults  with  you.  I  hope  to  continue to 

</span><span>work to the best of my ability until the day our new Government is elected. These are 

my words o</span><span>f encouragement to everybody. I don’t want to say much more because we 

</span><span>have  all  had  something  to  say  and  I  do  not  want  to  repeat  something  someone  else 

may have said. Thank you, Mr Chairman.    

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Tangata Vavia.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  you  and  all  your  staff. 

Greetings  also  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the  Cabinet,  all  the  Government 

Members and the Leaders of the Opposition as well as your Members. Greetings also 

to all those people who are listening in to our debate this morning. Greetings to all of 

you.    

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I stand to give my support to Clause 3 of the Bill. Mr Chairman, I have 

no  difficulty  with  Clause  8A  where  their  electors  can  petition  Members.  In  my 

opinion, Mr Chairman, it is appropriate that this right be given to them for it is they 

</span><span>who elected you to be their representative in this House. I don’t think it is the right of 

</span><span>the  Leader  of  the  Party  to  remove  a  Member  or  to  repo</span><span>rt  to  that  Member’s 

</span><span>constituency how he or she is  performing.  I believe it is  the right  of the electors to 

make that decision.     

</span></div><div><span>I know we were all confused about the timing of a petition.</span></div><div><span>The  point  is,  we  should  make  that change in  our attitudes.  We  are representing the 

interests of our people.  In the past, Mr Chairman, there is nothing of the sort directed 

at you.  Now there is a piece of legislation here directing a finger at you so that you 

have to be accountable one way or the other.  Mr Chairman, I feel we should have a 

change in our attitude and abide by this piece of legislation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  there  are  four  reasons  that  the  people  will  conduct  a  petition  against 

you.  They cannot raise anything against you or bring a petition against you other than 

what is established in these four points.  The first principle in this Bill states that you 

will be petitioned for irregularity or for habitually failing to attend the sitting days of 

Parliament.    It  is  my  view,  Mr  Chairman,  that  in  the  last  five  years  no  one  will  be 

guilty  of  this  point.    But  if  we  go  further  back,  I  think  as  I  recall  there  is  only  one 

Member  who  fell  under  that  category.    The  only  thing  that  will  offend  against  this 

piece of legislation is if you do not represent the interests of your Constituency. The 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1991 

</span></div><div><span>only time they will raise a petition against you is if you stay away from Parliament, the 

other  two  are  negligence.    If  you  neglect  to  consult  your  Constituency,  you  can  be 

petitioned in my mind I believe if you attend the meetings of Local Governments in 

your Constituency, then you have reported to the representatives of your Constituency 

which  is  the  Island  Council.    It  is  asking  you  at  least  that  you  report  to  your 

Constituency on matters that are significantly affecting your Constituency, not small 

matters  or  issues.  If  it  is  something  significant  that  affects  your  Constituency  then  I 

believe that you should report to your local Government and tell them about that issue.  

I can see that there is no interpretation on what that significant matter can be but I am 

sure the Members will have their judgments on those matters.   

</span></div><div><span>The  number  three  of  these  conditions  is  saying,  if  you  fail  to  report  back  to 

Government  about  those  significant  matters  from  your  Constituency  then  they  have 

another  ground  to  petition.    That  means,  Mr  Chairman,  as  long  as  I  report  back  to 

</span><span>Government that there is no water on my island and the people’s houses are affected, 

</span><span>even if Government does not act on it, at least you have complied with the conditions 

in the </span><span>Act, I can’t see that as being grounds for a petition.  </span></div><div><span>The  fourth  reason  for  raising  a  petition  is  when  you  become  unfit  to  hold  an  office 

</span><span>because of serious misconduct.  Again, I come back to the point that it is entirely up to 

you to decide what standards you want to uphold as a leader of your constituency.  If 

you  purposely  want  to  put  that  standard  down  then  that  will  be  a  cause  for  your 

constituency to raise a petition.  So those are my grounds for supporting that part of 

this  Bill.    And  because  there  has  been  concern  raised  in  the  event  there  is  a  false 

representation  made,  just  because  those  electors  want  to  throw  their  Member  of 

Parliament  out  of  Parliament,  Mr  Chairman,  if  those  false  representations  are 

discovered  and  found  to  be  true  then  those  representations  will  be  prosecuted  not 

pursuant to this Act but subject to the Crimes Act.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  it  is  in  my  view,  Mr  Chairman,  even  if  a  malicious  or  false  petition  has 

been  made  against  the  Member  then  that  false  representation,  if  discovered,  will  be 

prosecuted accordingly. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, Mr Chairman, Clause 8(D)(3) allows the Member to apply to the Court for a 

determination if the grounds for petition have not been established.  So I do not see 

any difficulty in putting this new section into this Amendment but it allows electors to 

</span><span>do what they wish within the time frame allowed by law to check on that Member. 

</span></div><div><span>And  for  us  Members,  really  I  think  it  is  just  performance,  accounting  for  our 

</span><span>performance, that’s what this law is all about.</span></div><div><span>I again give my support to this Amendment.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Chairman, Greetings to you and to all Honourable Members in 

the House.  Greetings to you on this beautiful morning. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>1992 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I am always concerned when I see the word “petition” because this happened to me in 

</span><span>my own constituency sometimes ago.  When it happened, the instigator of the petition 

was from Rakahanga but he was actually manipulated and the petition arranged from 

Rarotonga.  If it were done in Rakahanga, I would not have been too concerned. The 

Island  Council  of  Rakahanga  asked  the  Justice  Department  of  Rarotonga  that  the 

hearings  be done here in  Rarotonga or Manihiki.  Our people knew the damage that 

will  be  caused  by  the  hearings  of  these  petitions  on  Rakahanga.  The  Justice 

Department disagreed.  The Judge arrived and on his arrival, the Mayor of the Island 

told  the  Judge  that  a  request  was  sent  to  Rarotonga  for  the  cases  to  be  heard  in 

Raroto</span><span>nga  but  the  officials  in  Rarotonga  didn’t  adhere  to  their  request.  The  Judge 

</span><span>replied that he was never told about it.  The problem was that the people of Rakahanga 

knew  the  lies  in  the  petitions.  They  did  not  want  these  to  be  inquired  into  in 

Rakahanga.    They  would  rather  that  the  cases  be  conducted  in  either  Manihiki  or 

Rarotonga.  If the Justice wishes to pursue it then he should transfer all the witnesses 

from Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>A young boy signed the petition against the wishes of his own parents and this created 

division  within  the  family.  The  people  knew  that  there  were  some  false  witnesses 

</span><span>organised  by  the  Cook  Islands  Party,  who  brought  false  allegations  but  the  Judge 

</span><span>wasn’t aware of these. The Judge listened to their testimonies and accepted them. The 

</span><span>problem is the organisation of these petitions was done from Rarotonga who dictated 

what to do and who were required to sign the petitions. The Judge ruled that there be a 

By-election.  There was no fault found in my supporters.  Instead, the Electoral Office 

was ruled to be at fault.  The case was appealed but I won. 

</span></div><div><span>Another petition was lodged against me and I lost. So a By-election had to take place. 

My lawyer advised me that if he appeals against the latest ruling the chance was that I 

would win again.  I informed my people and they made it clear that they would rather 

go to the polls again. They wanted to give a lesson to the people in Rarotonga and to 

</span><span>the Judge of the people’s decision.  A By</span><span>-election was conducted and here I am, back 

in this House. This is the problem with superfluous false petitions, manipulated from 

here  in  Rarotonga  and  organised  by  the  administrators  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party.  

They  were  the  ones  who  caused  the  CIP  supporters  on  Rakahanga  to  proceed  with 

those petitions.  That was the first time a Court case related to Election petitions was 

held on Rakahanga.  They wanted that to be last.  In the future, if there is any lodged 

for Rakahanga, then it should be held here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>I now come to the point of regular absence from Parliament.  We have a legislation, 

which states that if you are absent from Parliament for 14 days, you automatically lose 

your seat.  The Bill  says that those who regularly absent themselves from Parliament 

will lose their seats. The Member for the Overseas Seat falls into that category.  But 

the Bill fails to say how regular. How many days or how many months? 

</span></div><div><span>There was another case that we had last year, with regard to the Honourable Member, 

Thomas Hewett.  He had a good reason.  He was needed to be with his wife who was 

</span><span>ill  and having medical  treatment.  Unlike the Honourable Member, Dr Williams. We 

</span><span>hesitated in granting him leave. The fact is, the Honourable Prime Minister is another 

regular absentee. If his absence is because of executing his responsibilit</span><span>ies it’s not a 

</span><span>problem, but if his absence is because he is at home drinking, I think we should look 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1993 

</span></div><div><span>at this carefully.  If we are in Parliament and he is at home having fun with his friends, 

I doubt whether that is right. 

</span></div><div><span>There  was  also  mention  of  the  Honourable  Minister  of  Marine  Resources,  who  is  a 

</span><span>regular  visitor  to  his  constituency.    We  can’t  do  much  about  that  because  he  went 

</span><span>there to consult his people. The provisions of this Bill protect him. But if he is there 

because of his pearl farm then we need to have a re-look at these provisions. I think if 

there was an award to be given to a person who is regularly absent he will get the gold 

</span><span>medal.  The only problem with me is I can’t go because there’s no money to pay for 

</span><span>my fare.   They told me that if I </span><span>wanted to go I had to pay my fare.  So I can’t beat the 

</span><span>Member for Tongareva.   

</span></div><div><span>I told the Speaker of my problem.  I told him that I am entitled to four Constituency 

visits pursuant to the Civil List.  So I will pay my fare and on my return I will claim. I 

told the former Clerk that if my money was not refunded, I would sue him.  The Clerk 

</span><span>told me that if I take him to Court he would take Lloyd Powell to Court.  He’s the one 

who  wouldn’t  give  the  money.  I  told  him  that  the  problem  was  between  him  and 

</span><span>Lloyd, that I wanted him to comply with the law. 

</span></div><div><span>I know that I am entitled to travel four times. The Members are struggling. The law 

requires the Members to consult with their constituencies but now we have been told 

that there is no money.   Sometimes I take </span><span>my visit.  Sometimes I don’t. However, I 

want the Government to comply with the Civil List. If they won’t then change the law.</span></div><div><span>The  Bill  states  that  if  you  fail  to  report  back  to  Government  then  you  could  be 

petitioned.  I am not happy with that.  If only  you have to report back to Parliament 

then  I  will  support  this  Clause.  Who  knows  where  the  Minister  will  be  if  the  need 

arises for the Members to see him. Maybe, he has gone to the plantation. There were a 

couple  of  times  when  I  had  to  see  the  Minister  of  the  Marine  Resources,  but 

unfortunately,  he  was  back  home  in  his  constituency  consulting  with  his  people.  So 

</span><span>there was no way I could get any help.   I don’t blame him because he was doing the 

job  required  of  him.    At  the  same  time,  I  don’t  want  to  be  accu</span><span>sed  of  failing  to  do 

mine.    Likewise  the  Prime  Minister,  but  I  was  told  that  he  was  not  available.    The 

second time I went to see him, he had gone overseas.    

</span></div><div><span>The only Minister I never had any problems getting to see him was the Deputy Prime 

</span><span>Minister.  He  also  organised  all  the  Members  of  the  Northern  Group  to  meet  and 

</span><span>discuss the situation of the electricity in the North. If only all the Ministers are like the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister.    The  Bill  needs  to  stipulate  these  things  properly.    Another 

successful  consultation  was  conducted  with  the  Minister  of  the  Ministry  of  Outer 

Island  Development.  These  are  the  kinds  of  services  that  we  need  to  have.    The 

important  thing  is  the  services  provided  to  our  people.    The  Ministers  should  be 

meeting  with  the  various  Members  to  discuss  the  needs  and  the  problems  of  our 

</span><span>people, like the consultations we have had with the Deputy Prime Minister.  We don’t 

</span><span>need these things legislated.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, the problem I have about the Bill that we have before the House, is the 

manipulation  which  will  derive  from  the  Rarotonga  to  the  Outer  Islands.  The 

constituents may be influenced to conduct all kinds of activities to topple their hard-

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>1994 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>working Members.  Let the Outer Islands do their own thing.     And again, how can 

the petitions  </span><span>be conducted against the Member?  I don’t agree with  this Bill.     The 

</span><span>point that I am trying to raise, Mr Chairman is for us, individual Members, to do away 

with  all  political  influences.  Let  us  unite  in  helping  our  people.  This  is  the  kind  of 

relationship we need to establish among ourselves.  

</span></div><div><span>I  support  the  Member  for  Vaipae  who  said  that  a  fund  should  be  set  aside  to  assist 

Members subjected to false allegations. He might end up meeting enormous costs due 

to  the  mere  frustrations  of  constituents  who  have  been  politically  influenced.  This 

fund  should  assist  Members  whom  petitioners  have  falsely  accused.  Whoever  loses 

the  case  should  be  required to  pay a certain  amount of money into the fund and the 

winning party is rewarded.  I think that is a good idea. So the person who is not guilty 

will not suffer the consequences. The person who brought that false allegation or false 

petition should suffer and pay the expenses that are incurred during the Court process. 

</span></div><div><span>I  further  suggest,  that  if  we  have  a  problem  in  the  Outer  Islands  constituency, 

consulting  the  Minister  responsible  is  not  enough.  These  matters  should  also  be 

submitted  to  Parliament  for  everybody  to  know.    Imagine  that  a  Member  failed  to 

</span><span>perform up to scratch in the first year but the following year he managed to measure 

</span><span>up.  Then  in  the  final  year  he  put  in  a  lacklustre  performance,  does  that  mean  the 

</span><span>people will have to wait until the second year before petitioning him?  That’s too late. 

</span><span>I do not agree with this part of the Bill.  That is why I suggested, instead of consulting 

the  Minister  responsible,  the  Member  should  bring  the  matter  in  here  and  allow 

Parliament to debate it and then the Minister responsible can respond publicly. 

</span></div><div><span>It is also my concern, Mr Chairman, that, because the Leadership Code has not been 

introduced, we continue to have some uncontrollable Members in this House. Never 

mind, when we come into power the first thing that we will do is enact a Leadership 

Code for this country. This is what I wish to happen. It is my personal aim, not that of 

the Democratic-Alliance Party.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Greetings to you Mr Chairman and 

to  all  Honourable  Members  in  Parliament,  to  our  people  who  are  listening  to  our 

debate this morning, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time  to  give  special  Greetings  to  my  Constituency  of  Pukapuka 

Nassau.    I  hope  and  trust  you  had  a  good  time  meeting  the  Prime  Minister  and 

discussing further the devolution process initiated by Government. I would like also to 

</span><span>pass  on  to  the  Prime  Minister  the  Cabinet’s  Greetings  and  I  hope  you  have  a  good 

</span><span>time  with  the  people  of  Pukapuka-Nassau  and  Manihiki.  Yesterday,  you  were 

probably  in  Manihiki  and  Rakahanga  and  today  you  will  be  with  the  people  of 

Tongareva. We, your Cabinet and the Caucus, wish to extend special Greetings to you 

to encourage you on your trip. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I would like to speak on Clause 3.  This is one of the most important 

Clauses  in  the  Bill.    Clause  3  creates  another  Amendment  to  our  Electoral  Act  to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1995 

</span></div><div><span>provide the opportunity to the electors to petition their Members if their Member fails 

to  attend  Parliament  regularly.  Another  reason  for  this  is  for  the  elected  Member  to 

report to the people on any issues that is of importance and would affect the welfare of 

the people of his Constituency.  Failing that, the electors can petition him. Thirdly, if 

the Member is unable to report to Government on issues which could be of benefit to 

the people of his  constituency. The aim is  to  enable all parties to look for ways and 

means to assist the people.  

</span></div><div><span>Fourthly,  Mr  Chairman,  a  Member  can  be  petitioned  if  he  creates  a  situation  which 

will reflect badly on the position of the Member. If he fails to uphold the standards of 

this House, the people can petition their Member.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I am conscious of the fact that the successful Members often focus on 

the  next  election  straight  away.  I  would  like  the  Members  to  be  mindful  of  the 

</span><span>arguments by our people that we haven’t been doing our work. Take your minds back 

</span><span>to  the  years  1996,  1997,  and  1998.  These  were  times  when  our  people  thoroughly 

assessed  us.  We  alone  would  know  how  each  one  of  us  performed  but  maybe  our 

people are accurate in their assessments.  

</span></div><div><span>The issue here is that our people are watching us.  The people are saying that we are 

not doing our jobs. Our people are saying to us Mr Chairman, look, we Mr Chairman 

are paying you paid by us. Your job over there is to see to our needs and to provide for 

</span><span>the  needs  of  your  people.  Mr  Chairman,  in  the  people’s  view,  we  are  not  working. 

</span><span>That  is  why  they  are  complaining.  They  aired  their  views  and  grievances  with  the 

Political  Review  Committee.  The  Committee  placed  those  grievances  in  the  Report 

and  here  is  the  recommendation  before  the  House.    They  even  proposed  for  the 

ordinary Members to be part-timers and for their salaries to be reviewed.  

</span></div><div><span>As the Member for Pukapuka today, I have no problem whatsoever with Clause 3.  If I 

have  been  doing  my  job,  then  there  is  nothing  to  worry  about.  The  only  time  that  I 

should be worried about myself is if my conscience tells me that I have not been doing 

</span><span>my job properly.  Let’s look at the reasons why a Member of Parliament could lose his</span><span>

seat.    The  first  one,  is  that  he  or  she  habitually  fails  to  attend  the  sitting  days  of 

Parliament.    Maybe  our  people  have  seen  Members  of  Parliament  who  were  in  the 

fields, in their plantations, or out fishing or in their own businesses.  They are saying, 

look, you are supposed to be in Parliament speaking for us but you are not. If this is 

</span><span>what we are doing, then this first reason is justified. 

</span></div><div><span>The second ground, as we can see is, if we, as Members of Parliament, are not going 

back  and  consulting  our  constituents  on  matters  that  significantly  affect  them  and 

which come within the responsibilities of a Member. If that is so then it is a good idea 

</span><span>that we do lose our seats because we are not doing our job.  I’m not sure whether we 

</span><span>should blame our people, the constituents or ourselves. 

</span></div><div><span>The  third  ground  here,  Mr  Chairman  is  that  we  are  not  taking  the  concerns  of  our 

</span><span>people,  as  Members  to  Government,  in  order  that  Government  is  able  to  see  the 

</span><span>concerns of our constituents.  Then and only then can Government take it up and make 

it a Government  concern.  If we are not  doing this then we are probably getting old 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>1996 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>and  therefore  failing  in  our  duties,  Mr  Chairman.  We,  as  Members,  Mr  Chairman, 

</span><span>blame our people for what they think. Why don’t we blame ourselves?</span></div><div><span>If  we,  as  Members  of  Parliament,  have  become  unfit  or  our  conduct  is  seriously 

affected, then can we really blame our people, our constituents for bringing a petition 

against us or should we be blaming ourselves?  If we look at ourselves, as Honourable 

Members  of  this  House,  we  are  not  here  because  we  elected  ourselves  to  be  in  this 

House.    We  are  here  because  the  people  of  our  constituencies  elected  us  as 

representatives for them.  We went to them.  We told them that we are the best, we 

will  be  the  best  representative  for  them  in  this  House  and  through  an  election,  they 

have decided that we are the best people to be their representatives in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>It won’t be long before the General Election and this is when we go back to the people 

</span><span>as actors and film stars.  We will be telling our people that they have no choice but to 

elect us because we are the best.  Are we being fair to our people, if, after they have 

elected us into this Parliament, we change our tune and start singing a different song? 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 3 is adding a new Part IIA to the Part II of the principal Act.  This gives our 

</span><span>people  the  right  to  recall  their  Member  and  to  remove  their  Member  of  Parliament 

</span><span>from the House.  The fact is, this is new.  It is something that is different from what 

we  have  been  used  to  since  1965  and  this  is  what  is  causing  some  apprehension 

amongst some people.  But as I said earlier, if our conscience is clear, and we know 

that  we  have  done  the  best  that  we  have  been  able  to  do  for  our  people,  we  have 

carried out the promise that we promised our people on the day that we were sworn in, 

then we have nothing to fear.  Through this Clause, we are showing our people that we 

are willing to be accountable to them. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  I  would,  like  everyone,  Mr  Chairman,  to  support  the  principles  of  this  Electoral 

Amendment  Bill.    The  Seat  in  Parliament  and  the  title  of  Member  of  Parliament 

belongs to the people.  It is they who will say we want this person to represent us.  If 

we accept the principle of this new path then that is what we will be doing. 

</span></div><div><span>I agree with  the point of view of the Honourable Member for Rakahanga because if 

somebody is just trying, for personal reasons, to lodge a petition against a Member of 

Parliament, then they also should be liable.  So as we are now in the Committee stage, 

I think if there are areas that we are not completely satisfied with, then maybe we can 

</span><span>be  able  to  make  some  Amendments.  At  the  end  of  the  day  we  don’t  want  all  the 

</span><span>protection to go to the constituents who have the right to bring petitions but we also 

need to have some sort of protection for the Members of Parliament so that a Member 

of  Parliament  is  not  removed  erroneously.    Some  sort  of  protection  must  be  put  in 

place to protect the Member of Parliament.  The Member of Parliament must not be 

removed haphazardly or through vicious and false petitions.  Therefore, I would like 

to  ask  all  Honourable  Members  to  support  this  because  this  brings  a  new  spirit  and 

this shows our people that we as Members of Parliament are willing to do our duties 

as their representatives. 

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  my  views  on  Clause  3  as  we  insert  a  new  Part  IIA.    Thank  you,  Mr 

Chairman.

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Thomas Hewett. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you this morning.  Kia 

Orana also to your staff.  Kia Orana to our people listening in to our broadcast, in the 

name of Our Lord.  Kia Orana to our Prime Minister who has gone off on business to 

try and help our Island Councillors on islands such as . . . 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> I will interrupt you Honourable Member.  There is no quorum. 

</span></div><div><span>(BELL RUNG AT 10.58 a.m.) 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  You may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEWETT:</span><span>  Kia  Orana  also  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to  the  Cabinet 

Ministers, to all Government Members, to the Leader of the New Alliance Party and 

your  Members,  to  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  and  your  Members.  

Kia Orana to us all in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I will not be too long on this subject before the House, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>I support this Clause 3, Mr Chairman because this Clause gives the right to our people 

to asses us, the Members of Parliament.   In our Standing Orders, there are provisions 

that  if  a  Member  of  Parliament  is  not  in  Parliament  for  14  days,  that  person  is 

automatically  removed  from  the  Office  of  Member  of  Parliament.      This,  Mr 

Chairman,  gives  our  people  the  right  to  look  at  somebody  like  me  as  I  have  been  a 

Member  of  Parliament.    If  I  have  done  something  wrong  then  the people have been 

given  the  right  to  make  a  petition  to  remove  me  from  my  office  as  a  Member  of 

Parliament.    An  example,  Mr  Chairman,  is  if  at  any  time  there  was  a  sitting  of 

Parliament  and  I  am  present  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga,  but  because  of  my  own 

interests  I  went  drinking  and  doing  all  sorts  of  things  rather  than  doing  what  my 

people want me to do, which is representing them in this House. Then Mr Chairman, 

this Clause gives them that right to make a petition to get me removed from office.  

</span></div><div><span>The  way  I  see  it,  Mr  Chairman,  this  is  a  warning  to  Members  of  Parliament for the 

future.  If I do not do my work as a Member of Parliament to bring the wishes of my 

people to Parliament, like I did when I came into this House and opposed the Sunday 

flights,  then  the  people, Mr Chairman, have the right  to  make a petition and get  me 

</span><span>removed from office.  If they don’t like you, Mr Chairman, according to this Clause, 

</span><span>they  can  bring  in  a  petition  and  get  you  thrown  out.  Personally, I have no problems 

with that, Mr Chairman, because I have done everything that my people wanted me to 

do  since  I  was  elected  in  1989.  I  have  been  faithful  to  God  and  to  my  people.  

However, this right should not be put in place Mr Chairman, to let them falsely accuse 

a Member of Parliament.   When I go back to the island of Aitutaki I will point out all 

the things that I have done on their behalf. They need to know what I have done for 

</span><span>them, from when I started in 1989, right up to now.  I again give my support to Clause 

</span><span>3, Mr Chairman. I also thank the Minister and the lawyer or his staff for bringing in 

this  new  Part  II(a)  as  a  warning  for  us  Members  of  Parliament.    Thank  you,  Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>1998 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Marine Resources, Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>    Thank you, Mr Chairman. Kia Orana to you in the name of 

Our Lord, Kia Orana to you all Honourable Members on Government side, and also 

on the Opposition side.  Kia Orana also Mr Chairman, to our people listening in to our 

meeting  this  morning.    I  would  like  to  send  special  Greetings,  Mr  Chairman,  to  the 

Prime  Minister  who  has  now  put  his  feet  on  my  island  of  Tongareva.  You  will  see 

how our people will look after you. And I am quite certain when you return tomorrow 

you  will  be  happy  with  what  has  been  happening  on  those  islands  in  the  Northern 

Group.     

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  since  the  discussion  on  this  Clause  3  began,  it  has  drawn  in  a  lot  of 

interests from Members of this House. You know, Mr Chairman, on Wednesday when 

I  was  speaking  to  the  House  on  the  Marine  Resou</span><span>rce’s  appropriation,  under  the 

</span><span>budget,  I spoke, Mr Chairman, of my strong belief that the office of the Member of 

Parliament is a contractual office with the people of his constituency who put him into 

power.    And  I  also  believe,  Mr  Chairman,  that  one  of  the  main  conditions  of  that 

contract between the Member of Parliament with his people, is that he is required to 

service the needs and settle the problems and grievances of his people. That, I believe 

Mr Chairman, is unwritten.  At least it shows that there is that confidence, that trust 

between  the  two  parties,  that  the  Member  will  abide  by  those  unwritten  rules  and 

obligations. That is why, Mr Chairman, I rose to support, to give my total support to 

the Clause 3 of the Bill before the House. In giving that support Mr Chairman, I would 

congratulate the Honourable Minister Tiki Matapo.  I would also congratulate Cabinet 

and this Government.  Mr Chairman, Clause 3 seals that unwritten contract.  Clause 3, 

Mr Chairman, confirms some of those conditions in that unwritten contract.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, if you look at a simple contract. If there is a breach of that contract then 

a  recourse  is  sought.  The  aggrieved  party  in  that  contract  has  a  recourse  to  seek 

redress. The recourse, Mr Chairman, is, that he brings these provisions into play, i.e. 

the  petition  of  the  electors.  Mr  Chairman,  this  is  like  our  Heads  of Ministries today 

who  have  written  contracts  which  require  them  to  achieve  a  certain  standard  of 

performance.  Before,  Members  of  Parliament  did  not  have  contracts.  It  is  my  view 

that  this  unwritten  contract  is  now  put  into  the  law  as  a  check  and  balance  of  the 

Member of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  let  us  refer  to  Clause  3  subclause  8B  (a)(b)(c)(d).  Those  little  letters 

outline  the  non-performances  on the part of the Member of Parliament. That  is  why 

Mr  Chairman,  as  I  said  earlier,  I  was  indeed  pleased  with  this  legislation  being  put 

before the House today.  Pleased because I have been engaged in performing what I 

believe was my contractual obligation with my people since 1994 when I was elected 

a  Member  of  Parliament.    That  is  why  I  say  repeated  in  this House that there is  the 

need  for  me  to  go  back  to  Tongareva.    I  am  also  pleased,  Mr  Chairman,  that  this 

Clause brings that out. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor,  what  is  your  Point  of 

Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>I have to draw to your attention to the fact that the Cook Islands 

flag flying on the flagpole outside Parliament is upside down.  Could you direct your 

staff to correct this horrible embarrassment.  The Cook Islands flag is upside down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Honourable  Member  you  are  irrelevant.    Sorry,  Honourable 

Minister for the interference.  Please continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>It makes me wonder whether that was a deliberate act on his 

part  to  disturb  my  train  of  thought.    I  was  saying  that  the  legislation  that  we  have 

before the House brings out the question of transparency which is consistent with the 

reform process that has been going on since 1996.  And the Minister in charge of the 

Bill,  the  Honourable  Tiki  Matapo  made  that  point  quite  clear,  when  he  made  his 

presentation on the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Chairman, I have been listening to Members of Parliament who have spoken 

on  Clause  3.    There  have  been  some  valid  points  raised  and  there  are  irrelevant 

comments made. Mr Chairman, the Honourable Norman George, Leader of the New 

Alliance  Party,  raised  three  issues.  The  three  issues  raised  by  the  Leader  of  the 

National Alliance Party, oh sorry, New Alliance Party. And if that was not sufficient 

Honourable  Norman  George,  those  three  points  are  very  valid.    One  refers  to  the 

question that he asked that these provisions outlined in Clause 3 might be ultra vires 

the  Constitution.    And  the  validity  of  the  issue  that  was  raised  was  the  office  the 

Member of Parliament holds is under the Constitution.  I differ from that Honourable 

Member because I could not find any of the other provisions in the Constitution where 

it  supports  that  argument.    Except  of  course,  Mr  Chairman,  an  Amendment  to  the 

Constitution  that  was  put  to  the  House  or  made  law  in  1980,  which  is  Constitution 

Amendment  (No.9)  Act  1980-81.  And  that  refers  to  17(2).    Now,  that  17(2)  of  the 

Constitution  Amendment  Act  (No.9)  1980-81  is  a  transitional  provision.    A 

transitional  provision  from  Members  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  to  Members  of 

</span><span>Parliament  where  the  status  of    “Legislative  Assembly”  was  changed  to  ‘The 

Parliament of the Cook Islands’. Therefore, Mr Chairman, the legislation is co</span><span>nsistent, 

it is not against the Constitution of the country. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, the second valid point he raised is the question of costs not being found in the 

provision.  Quite rightly for him to come up with that argument.  Although that is not 

found in the Amendment, the piece of legislation is contained in the Civil Procedures 

Act  1972,  sections  300,  301  and  302.    Those  three  sections  of  the  Civil  Procedures 

Act 1972 outlines the cost and other costs or fees that goes with an action that is taken 

by an aggrieved party i.e. a Member of Parliament in  this case, if he is not satisfied 

and  he  appeals  to  the  Court  and  the  Court  rules  in  favour  and  awards  those  costs 

according to this Act.  That is my comment on the question of costs Mr Chairman.  No 

doubt the Minister in charge of the Bill will further comment on that question when he 

</span><span>addresses us.  We will come to that. 

</span></div><div><span>Then we are looking at offences, some of the offences that should be created to cover 

treating,  bribery,  undue  influence,  maliciously  bringing  a  petition  and  all  that.    Mr 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>2000 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Chairman, I would like to draw his attention and the attention of the House to section 

8 (5) of the same Clause 3 in the Bill.  You see section 8(5), Mr Chairman provides 

offences  to  sections  78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85  and  86.  And  they  are  offences  that  are 

contained in the principal Act which relates to treating, bribery, undue influence and 

so on and on. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  Mr  Chairman.  I  refer  to  the  comments  from  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr 

Pupuke Robati in  regard to  this particular Clause.  He spoke,  Mr Chairman, about a 

petition, which was carried out on the island of Rakahanga.  He talks about the Mayor 

telling the Judge of the High Court that they should not be coming to the island.  They 

should have listened and stayed in Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Chairman, hearing a petition at the location where the error or the mistake 

has taken place is a normal practice for the Court.  For the Mayor of this island to tell 

the Judge, his Honour, and a Judge of the High Court of this country that he should 

not be visiting, I think is just out of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>That’s high treason.</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>It’s just out of place, Mr Chairman.  The Judge of that High 

Court who went to Rakahanga represents an independent arm of a country’s structure, 

</span><span>of the necessary three set-ups, organisations, which form the nucleus of the political 

</span><span>system  of  a country.  An arm of this organisation,  of the country’s organisation,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman,  that  should  not  be  interfered  with  by  anyone.    Not  even  Government  is 

allowed to interfere with the activities of the Court.  For the Mayor of that island to 

make those comments to His Honour is just not on. This behaviour, Mr Chairman, is a 

borderline  case  of  contempt  of  the  High  Court.  You  know,  Mr  Chairman,  he  was 

</span><span>saying “you listen to the Government”, to come over here to do the petition, there are 

</span><span>problems  and  so  on  and  so  on.    The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  Mr  Chairman,  I  want  the 

people  of  this  country  to  listen  to  me.    The  Government  cannot  interfere  with  the 

activities  of  the  Courts.    The  Courts  are  set  up  to  deliver,  to  judge,  to  decide  and 

deliver an unbiased decision and Government - when I say Government - either one of 

the  Parties  has  no  right  to  interfere  with  the  work  of  the  Courts  and  if  there  is  any 

suggestion from any of the political parties suggesting that they can order the Courts 

or intervene with  the activities of the Court, then there is really going to be anarchy 

</span><span>and a serious breach of the Constitution of this country.  It’s just that, Mr Chairman, 

</span><span>as Attorney General  of the country, I cannot  allow the comments to go past without 

making any comment to the House. 

</span></div><div><span>I give total support to this Clause before the House, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    The  Honourable  Minister  of 

Justice and Lands, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>   Mr Chairman, I wish to  move a Motion.  The draft has been 

circulated for the Honourable Members to see. I move: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2001 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 of this Bill be amended by inserting after sub-Clause (3) of Clause 

8D a new sub-Clause (4) as follows</span><span>: 

</span></div><div><span>8D No. (4) where any application is filed in the Court pursuant to sub-section (3) 

of this Section, the Court may order that security be given by the applicant and 

the respondents for the cost of the hearing of the application and upon hearing 

the application the Court may determine what, if any, further costs may be 

awarded to the applicant on the grounds that the application for the petition was 

frivolous and vexatious. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, just a brief explanation on this Amendment.  The Attorney General has 

touched a bit of it in his speech.  However, the concern for this Amendment brought 

before the House is really to do with the concern towards the cost of the petition.  The 

concern  relates  to  the  costs  to  the  Members  in  the  application  of  the  petition.  

However,  in  this  Amendment  there  are  two  parts  to  it.    During  the  time  of  the 

application  for  the  petition  there  will  be  fees  required  to  be  paid,  which  is  normal.  

However,  at  the  time  of  the  application  and  the  Court  decides  that  the  petition 

proceeds,  then  the  Court  decides  on  a  security  that  needs  to  be  paid  by  both  the 

petitioners  and  the  respondent.    At  the  end  of  the  hearing  of  the  petition,  Mr 

Chairman, whichever way the decision is arrived at by the Court, the Court awards the 

costs to whichever party security was paid from. 

</span></div><div><span>And  of  course,  the  second  part  is  that,  if  in  the  application  it  was  found  that  the 

petition was frivolous or vexatious, then that also gives the Court the right to add an 

extra  award  of  damages  or  costs.      This  is  briefly  my  explanation  towards  this 

Amendment, Mr Chairman and before I sit down, Mr Chairman, I just want to again 

correct the last line of the Amendment.    

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, the deletion of the word  “or” between ‘frivolous’ or ‘vexatious’, the word or 

should  be  replaced  by  “and”  to  read  “frivolous  and  vexatious”.    Thank  you,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.      The  Honourable  Member 

Norman George.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I stand to support this Amendment.   It 

just  goes  to  show  how  we  in  the  Opposition  are  very  effective  in  making  these 

changes.  You will recall, Mr Chairman, that last night I drew this to the attention of 

the Minister and to Members of the House, that the poor Member of Parliament, when 

this petition is taken against them, has no way for them to get payment for his costs 

after  he  is  required  to  make  an  application  to  the  Court  to  review  the  petition.    

Because a Member of Parliament, under this petition could end up spending $10,000-

$15,000.00 to defend his honour and reputation.   Especially under our system where 

we  do  not  have  a  permanent  High  Court  Judge  and  sometimes  in  matter of urgency 

you have to pay for the return airfares of the Judge and his accommodation to come to 

</span><span>the  Cook  Islands.    Alternatively,  you  and  your  lawyer  would  have  to  travel  to 

</span><span>Auckland  for  the  hearing.    Therefore  Mr  Chairman,  an  innocent  Member  of 

Parliament  could  end  up  spending  $10,000-$15,000.00  to  defend  his  reputation 

against frivolous and vexatious petitions by people who attack his personal integrity. I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>2002 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>was  very  happy  when  the  Minister  of  Justice  realised  that  he  and  his  colleagues  in 

Government had forgotten about putting in some protective measures for the Members 

of Parliament, they realised that something was missing but they have to listen to my 

recommendations.  Therefore, I think Members would appreciate this contribution to 

this Bill, and even though this Bill needs panel-beating everywhere, because of all the 

various crunches and dents that is everywhere here.  

</span></div><div><span>The only regret I have is, that it is not taking into account provisions to punish people 

who  bring  in  frivolous  and  vexatious  and  malicious  petitions  against  Members.   

There  are  sufficient  penalties  for  Members  of  Parliament  in  the  Crimes  Act  and  the 

</span><span>Electoral Act.   It’s covered in the Electoral Petitions. I say, whatever is good for the 

</span><span>goose is good enough for the gander.  We have a gaping hole here. These people are 

allowed  to  bring  all  these  petitions  of  recall  all  right,  but  at  least  there  is  a  change 

which allows him to deposit security of costs. Usually, people who do this have plenty 

of  money.    So  it  is  money,  not  punishment  enough,  I  feel.  This  will not  be enough, 

there  should  be  stricter  penalties  and  punishment  introduced  so  that  they  will  think 

twice before they instigate malicious petitions. I am talking about malicious petitions, 

there are instances I am sure, Mr Chairman, where the petition is justified.  I am just 

</span><span>looking at  the darker side of these things, where people take advantage of the recall 

</span><span>provision.  Those are my views, Mr Chairman. Before I take my seat, I would like to 

advise all the Honourable Members, Parliamentary Staff, and all the people listening 

</span><span>in  if  you  are  around  Avarua,  12.00  o’clock  at  the  Punanganui,  the Ruaau Br</span><span>anch of 

New Alliance Party are selling beautiful goat meat.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.    The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Amendment be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 as Amended stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>Sorry, Honourable Members, it’s time to adjourn.</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>      Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported to Parliament.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span> That the Motion be Agreed to?  

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
