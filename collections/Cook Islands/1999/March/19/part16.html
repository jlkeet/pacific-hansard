<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Amendment  Bill    -  Second  Reading.    The 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Mr Speaker and Honourable Members, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Amendment 

</span><span>(No.2) Bill be Read a Second Time 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  today  marks  the  First  Anniversary  of  the  passage  of  the  Cook  Islands 

Investment  Corporation  Act.  The  invention  of  the  Investment  Corporation  was  an 

important innovation in the economic reform programme, which our Government has 

been  pursuing  during  its  term  of  office.  Mr  Speaker,  the  objectives  behind  the 

establishment  of  the  Corporation  was  to  bring  professional  management  of 

Government  assets by establishing a board of private sector persons with substantial 

business experience to oversee those assets of Government.  The second objective, Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, was to foster the privatisation process and ensure Government moved out of 

</span><span>those activities which are best left to private enterprises to provide.  Mr Speaker, the 

Investment  Corporation  Act  is  sweeping  in  its  progression.    The  management  of 

nearly every conceivable Government asset was given to the Corporation.   It includes 

</span></div><div><a>Page 40</a></div><div><span>2024 

</span></div><div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>real estate and cars in the Outer Islands.   It also includes the desks in schools and all 

other  assets,  which  Ministries  manage.    It  includes  management  of  Government 

shareholdings in various companies. It includes the appointment of Directors and the 

giving  of  directions  to  statutory  Corporations,  such  as  Te  Aponga  Uira,  the  Airport 

Authority, the Port Authority and the Cook Islands Development Bank.  However, Mr 

Speaker,  the  ownership  of  the  Crown  Assets  remains  with  the  Crown.  Therefore,  in 

the  disposal  of  an  asset  or  the  privatisation  of  any  function,  the  approval  of  the 

Cabinet  is  required  under  the  Act.      The  aim,  Mr  Speaker,  was  to  create  a  balance 

</span><span>between  the  Government’s  obligation  to  govern,  and  Government’s  desire  to  inject 

</span><span>expertise from the private sector in the professional administration of its assets.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  it  is  now  one  year  from  the  passing of the Act,  an ideal  opportunity to 

review the legislation under which the Investment Corporation operates.   A number 

of difficulties have been identified, Mr Speaker, which this Amendment Bill is trying 

to  address.      First,  one  of  the  objectives  behind  the  establishment  of  the  Investment 

Corporation  was  to  streamline  the  acquisition,  administration  and  disposal  of 

Government  assets.  However,  in  some  respects,  Mr  Speaker,  the  amount  of 

</span><span>bureaucracy has increased. For example, the disposal of the assets requires Cabinet’s 

</span><span>approval.    Therefore,  the  disposal  of  a  car  or  the  sale  of  a  desk  technically  requires 

</span><span>Cabinet’s  approval.  This  Amendment,  Mr</span><span>  Speaker,  will  create  a  new  definition  of 

minor  assets  where  Cabinet  approval  is  not  required.    Second,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is 

inconsistent with Government policy of Devolution, to have such a highly centralised 

management  structure.    Government  has  the  view  that  the  best  people  to  manage 

assets, such as tools, and vehicles are the people who have the day to day use of them.   

It is for this reason, Mr Speaker, that this Amendment removes most moveable assets 

from the direct management and control of the Investment Corporation and which will 

allow Government to vest management in the body which has direct control of them, 

whether  they  be  the  Outer  Islands  Councils,  Vaka  Councils,  Ministries,  or  Crown 

agencies.    They  will  still  be  subject  to  a  power  of  direction  from  the  Investment 

Corporation, which can only be exercised after consultation with it.    The aim is to 

introduce  good  techniques  of  management  on  the  one  hand,  but  develop  day  to  day 

control on these assets on the other hand.  

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, Mr Speaker, at present the Investment Corporation has power to delegate any 

of  its  functions.    In  respect  to  the  assets  which  remains  with  the  Investment 

Corporation,  which  includes  interests  in  land,  this  Amendment  will  allow  the 

</span><span>Investment  Corporation,  to  delegate  its  authority  to  Outer  Islands,  Outer  Islands 

</span><span>Council, Ministries and Crown Agencies.   Fourthly, I will be moving a resolution that 

Clause  10  of  the  Bill  be  deleted  and  replaced  by  a  new  Clause  10,  which  allow 

Cabinet  and  the  Corporation,  by  consent  to  modify  the  statement  of  Corporation 

during the year. Again, Mr Speaker, this is aimed at bringing greater flexibility to the 

legislation.   Mr Speaker, the Investment Corporation administers nearly $150 million 

worth of assets.   There is a need to have a more flexible system as the Corporation 

</span><span>does  not  have  the  resources  or  the  staff  to  manage  directly  all  of  the  country’s 

</span><span>property.  The islands and the Ministry wish to take a management role.    Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>I know of no one who does not support these Amendments.   These Amendments will 

</span><span>bring more flexibility into the legislation and further the goals and objectives behind 

the establishment of the Investment Corporation.

</span></div><div><span>2025 

</span></div><div><span>This,  in  my  view,  Mr  Speaker,  is  good  news  for  Local  Government  bodies  in  the 

Outer Islands and for the Vaka Council here in Rarotonga, whereby some assets of the 

country  can  be  vested  in  their  hands  to  manage.    It  is  my  sincere  hope  that  the 

Honourable  Members  of  this  House  will  see  a  quick  passage  of  this  Amendment 

through this House.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.
