<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Clause 1: Short Title 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Mr  Chairman,  this  gives  me 

concern. We are dealing with the amendment with regard to the Ports Authority. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span> What about the Short Title? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I regret that the conduct or the procedure of this House has 

been confusing.  That is the reason why I am up Mr Chairman.  The Ports Authority is 

also  one  very  important  asset  to  this  country  and  we  are  not  just  talking  about  the 

Rarotonga  Port,  Mr  Chairman.    We  are  also  talking  about  other  ports  such  as  the 

Aitutaki Port. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Point of Order.  Standing Order 193. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the floor, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman. The Honourable Leader of the Opposition 

is  not  talking  to  the  Short  Title,  which  is  Clause  1.    Now  if  he  has  missed  out  his 

chance  to  speak  to  the  principle  and  meri</span><span>ts  of  the  Bill,  he  had  it.    He’s  made  his 

</span><span>speech so  we are moving on to  Clause 1 of the Bill.   The only one confused in this 

House is him.  Not me. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>2044 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister. That is a Point of Explanation I 

reckon Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  I  want  to  tell  the  Honourable 

Minister, Ngereteina Puna before he retires or before the young guns push him out on 

Aitutaki . . . 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please come back to the Clause Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Yes,  I  am  coming  to  understand  that  the  Ports  Authority 

Amendment Act will be including the Port on Rarotonga and the Port on Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>So what’s wrong with the Title?</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  And  I  want  him  to  understand  that  his  people,  the 

Councillors are wanting those assets in their control and he is trying to stop me talking 

about that to make the people of Aitutaki understand it. Because what I can see is that 

</span><span>he wants the Port of Aitutaki to be controlled by the CIIC.  That’s my impression</span><span>, Mr 

Chairman.  That is why he is trying to confuse me. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>It’s not hard to confuse you.</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Because by what he is trying to do is not confusing me, Mr 

Chairman.    He  is  confusing  his  own  people  in  Aitutaki.  Therefore,  I  would  like  to 

support  that  the  people  of  Aitutaki  take  full  control  of  their  port  and  you  know  one 

thing,  Mr  Chairman,  in  this  Amendment  Bill  it  is  talking  about  revenues  that  the 

Government can take from the port to social services. Mr Chairman, I can tell you and 

I can tell the Honourable Minister that every port needs upgrading, maintenance and 

so forth. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the floor, Honourable Member. The 

Honourable Minister of Education, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    Standing  Order  193  again.  Now,  Mr  Chairman,  we  are  talking 

</span><span>about the Short Title. We are not talking about what Government’s plans are for the 

</span><span>Ports and so forth and so forth. Would you please bring this Honourable Member to 

ta</span><span>lk  about  Clause  1  Short  Title?  Whether  he  doesn’t  like  the  words  Ports  Authority 

</span><span>Amendment Act and so forth. That is not a Point of Explanation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  This Point of Order Honourable 

Member is quite in order.  But not the previous one.  So Honourable Member, please 

come back to the clause of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Like I said, Mr Chairman, it is 

very important for the people of Aitutaki to know what this Title is talking about. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>Hey, don’t talk about my people. Talk about the Short Title.</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2045 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>It must refer to what’s in the title under this Short Title.</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  What is your suggestion? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>If  it  doesn’t  reflect  the  Ports  Authority  for  A</span><span>itutaki  and 

</span><span>Rarotonga then there’s something wrong with this title.</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Well what is your suggestion? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  The  Honourable  Minister  is  asking  me  what  is  my 

suggestion.  I am trying to justify my suggestion by bringing up all these requirements 

and after I have talked about it then I will make the amendment to the Short Title.  If 

that is what the Minister wants.  Because it is not my intention to do that.  All I am 

trying to do is to point out that this is an important Bill for the people of Aitutaki and 

the  people  of  Rarotonga,  especially  the  landowners  in  Rarotonga.    So  that  is  my 

concern, Mr Chairman.  I will comply with your ruling.  So I will sit down to allow us 

to move on to the next clause. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  As  far  as  I  understand,  this  Ports  Authority  is  for  Rarotonga  and 

Aitutaki.  I  would  just  like  to  ask  the  Minister  if  Ngati  Uritaua  knows  of  this 

amendment.  Has  Makea  Ariki  and  Karika  Ariki  agreed  with  this?    And  the 

landowners on the island of Aitutaki as well?  Do they know of this amendment?  I 

would also  like to  ask  if Tamatoa Ariki knows what  is  going to be done to his land 

and  harbour?    Has  the  Honourable  Minister  referred  this  to  his  people?      We  know 

now that it is a crime if an Honourable Member does not take issues such as this back 

to their respective constituents. I thought this is the clause I can put my questions in. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Now the question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 2: Consequential Amendments.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  I  heard  the  Honourable  Dr  Pupuke  Robati 

earlier asking if Honourable Members have taken this back to their people because we 

</span><span>have passed a Bill that require Honourable Members to refer big issues to their people. 

</span><span>I think this is a good question.  I think it is a good question because it is relevant to 

what we are speaking about at the moment.  The issue of the Ports is such that there 

are so many problems  with  it.  I think it is relevant to what we are discussing.  The 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>2046 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>problem is that landowners do not want their land to be sold to foreigners and to other 

people.  That is why I was saying that the question raised by the Honourable Member, 

Dr Pupuke Robati is relevant because we would like to know whether this issue had 

been brought to the attention of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that we will not be able to sort this out because there is only one more hour 

</span><span>for this debate.  I don’t believe that this issue has been taken back to the people.   As 

</span><span>we can see in clause 2 of this Amendment Bill, the Port Authority is being required by 

this  amendment  to  give  funds  for  the  Social  Services.        In  addition,  I  think  the 

authority will not be able to work towards improving their Port and still have to cater 

Government expectations.  They are working with limited resources, to try to improve 

the  services  of  that  Port.    How  can  anyone  appreciate  to  serve  Government  if  he  is 

required  to  operate  using  meagre  resources  and  finds  at  the  end  of  the  day  that 

whatever  revenue  generated  will  be  taken  over  by  another  authority  and  put  into 

another area.  That is, in my view a waste of money.   Why not specify what sorts of 

social services this Government is requiring from the Ports Authorities.  Why makes it 

so general? 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of Social Services Mr Chairman, this Government has spent a lot of money at 

</span><span>the Airport VIP Lounge and all over the place. I do not want this revenue to go there.   

I want the revenue to be used for a specific purpose. I am sure by doing that the people 

working in this Ministry and in the Authority will be working hard because they know 

it  will  be  for  the  good  of  the  people.    They  know  for  sure  what  will  happen  to  the 

money earned by them.    How can we expect the standard of the Services, the quality 

of the equipment, to be upgraded if the Government siphon the revenue from the Port 

of Authority.  The Aitutaki Port Authority will be able to conduct their operations if 

Government does not direct their revenue to the Cook Islands Investment Corporation 

here in Rarotonga to spend elsewhere.  As far as I can see now Mr Chairman, the Port 

Authority now includes Aitutaki and Rarotonga. And I am sure the people of Aitutaki 

will want to have the assets of the Ports there transferred to them.  I am sure that is 

what they want to do.  They would also like to retain any funds generated from their 

activities to improve their operations. And the same goes in my view for the Port in 

Rarotonga.    The  landowners  should  be  consulted,  they  should  be  consulted.    They 

should  have  a  contribution  to  it  in  the  decision  making  of  this  Port  Authority,  with 

regards to revenue and so forth.   This is why I am not happy with this clause in the 

Bill  which  says,  that  the  Authority  must  also  give  effect  to  Government  Social 

</span><span>Services  responsibilities.  Yet,  it  does  not  stipulate  what  the  Social  Services 

</span><span>responsibilities  are.  Those  are  my  views  on  this  clause,  Mr  Chairman.    I will give 

some times to my colleagues to comment.    

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> With regards Mr Chairman, to the funds that is to be given to the 

</span><span>Cook  Islands Investment  Corporation, I don’t like this. Mr Chairman, I think if it is 

</span><span>with regards to the Port Authority in Avatiu, then whatever money they can get should 

go  to  the  improvement  of  the  shoreline,  the  roadside  and  improvement  of  the  Port 

itself in general.  If it is about the Port in Aitutaki then I think whatever funds they can 

get should go to the improvement of the Port in Arutanga. I think if the money is to be 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2047 

</span></div><div><span>made  by  the  Port  Authority  of  Aitutaki  it  should  stay  there.    It  should  not  come  to 

</span><span>Rarotonga or to any other islands or even for the travels of Ministers.   I don’t agree to 

</span><span>that.   Maybe for the island of Aitutaki, if that is to pay the Mayor or the Councillors, 

travels then use </span><span>it.   Because this would be Aitutaki’s money.  In terms of the Port in 

</span><span>Avatiu, if it was to go to the Member for Avatiu, then I have no problem with that.  As 

long as the landowners agree and as long as the Uritaua clan agrees.   However, their 

present Member does not travel, so they will be alright. The money that is collected by 

the Port in Avatiu and Aitutaki should be reinvested in those operations.    

</span></div><div><span>As  I  said  earlier  on,  a  lot  of  the  power  and  responsibilities  of  the  Minister  are  now 

transferred  to  </span><span>the  Board  of  the  Corporation.  I  don’t  like  this  because  the  Ports  now 

</span><span>know that they have a Minister to respond to and when this Bill becomes law they will 

not  have  a  Minister,  instead  they  will  have  a  Board.  This  is  why  I  stood  up.    To 

register my objection. In terms of the funds that will be acquired by these authorities, I 

think the money must be reinvested to help upgrade their facilities. I think that if any 

decision is to be made about the Ports, the people or the respective landowners should 

also  be  consulted.  Those  are  my  views  on  this  clause  at  the  moment.    I  oppose  this 

clause.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. I would just like to ask a question 

to the Minister about all the other ports besides Aitutaki and Rarotonga. We all know 

that Aitutaki and Rarotonga are big ports.  There are container ships coming in every 

month  or  every  week  and  a  lot  of  revenue  can  be  made  from  these  ports.  Over  the 

years Mr Chairman, I have seen the Ports Authority taking over the responsibility of 

operating these two ports.  I have never seen them improving the general facilities of 

these two ports. On the other hand, people are being encouraged to plant.  The idea is 

that every once in a while the boats will be there to pick up their produce.  I have seen 

the  barge  on  Mangaia  and  it  is  rotten.    The  channel  itself  is  quite  shallow  at  the 

moment.  If the tide is low this becomes a problem in loading and unloading, even the 

small  inter-island  boats  that  go  there  from  Rarotonga  have  difficulties  too.  The 

question is, what would happen if we encourage the people of Mangaia to plant and 

we then a sizeable boat has to pick up their cargo? The wharf is not up to scratch and 

the equipment requires massive upgrading.  

</span></div><div><span>Today, we know when Tapi’s boat goes to Atiu he has to take care of the stevedoring 

</span><span>duties  as  well  because  we  do  not  have  anybody  there  to  unload  cargo.  We  are  all 

talking  about  improving  these  ports  and  getting  money  from  them  but  there  are  a 

</span><span>number of ports that are not in a good condition and we can’t do anything about it.  In 

</span><span>clause 2 we are talking about revenue from the Ports Authority. How can we require 

this revenue to be transferred back to Rarotonga when the need is there to improve the 

ports  in  the  outer  islands.    How  can  you  expect  them  to  provide  better  services? 

Recently there was a barge taken from Aitutaki to be used in Manihiki.  That barge is 

now gone, sunk and lost.  I am not too sure how much money, thousands of dollars, 

we used to make this barge - about $100,000 I think.  This is one of the areas I would 

like to look at.  We are just jumping around thinking we can take money from the port 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>2048 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>and use it elsewhere.  Meanwhile these little ports are the ones which really need the 

money. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:  </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>There is a point of order on the floor. What is your point of order 

Honourable Prime Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:    </span><span>Clause  2  of  the  Bill  has  nothing  to  do with  the ports of the 

other  islands  and  I  am  not  sure  whether  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is  completely 

confused  with  the  business  of  the  House  this  morning.    I  ask  you  Mr  Chairman  to 

bring the Leader of the Opposition back on to Clause 2 of the Bill which deals with 

the  Ports  Authority.  And  the  Ports  Authority  deals  with  two  ports  alone  and  has 

nothing to do with the other ports of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>The point of order is quite relevant Honourable Member, so can 

you please come back to clause 2 of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. I do not find any interpretation 

clause  here  except  on  the  Schedule  where  some  words  are  inserted  with  some 

explanatory notes beside it.  And the Ports Authority according to this Schedule  and 

amendments  is  not  specifying  the  functions  and  the  duties  of  the  Port  Authority.  

However,  I  have  always  taken  it  that  the  Port  Authority  as  such  only deals  with  the 

Ports of Aitutaki and Rarotonga.  I am merely giving my concerns with regards to the 

limitation of the functions to the port of Aitutaki and the port of Rarotonga with the 

view  to  perhaps  if  the  needs  of  the  other  islands  are  not  dealt  with  then  that  is  a 

concern to me.   

</span></div><div><span>My concern is I am going to Pukapuka at the end of the week.  I want to make sure 

there is going to be a good harbour and there is a boat to take me ashore.  I want to 

arrive in Pukapuka safely so I can be received by the people of Pukapuka because I am 

taking them all the good news and all the goodies I am going to tell them when I get 

there.  Those are my concerns Mr Chairman.  I want to make sure Palmerston has a 

</span><span>good  harbour  as  well  as  Nassau.    Even  Manihiki,  Rakahanga  and  Penrhyn.    I  don’t 

</span><span>mind about Penrhyn.  The boat can be tied to the wharf there. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:  </span><span>Point of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>What is your point of order Honourable Deputy Prime Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:  </span><span>Relevancy  in  debate.  I  know  the  Honourable  Member  is 

running out of things to say on the clause so he is going overboard. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  chairman.  I  was  just  rounding  up  my 

comments and at the same time expressing my concern for the other islands.  For too 

</span><span>long we have concentrated too much on Rarotonga and Aitutaki.  As I said, because it 

</span><span>is financially affordable for the two ports to run their own services, the revenue they 

get  is  enough  to  pay  for  their  operations.    Including  the  wages and salaries of those 

involved. But then we are expecting them to earn revenue for Government to spend on 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2049 

</span></div><div><span>social services. That  is  my concern. The other smaller ports on the other islands are 

not  required  by  Government  to  do  the  same.    That  is  where  the  sad  part  is  Mr 

Chairman.    Yes,  I  know  I  am  getting  away  from  the  Bill  because  I  am  going  onto 

Pukapuka and the other islands but that is the reason.  I would like to ask the Ministers 

and the Deputy Prime Minister to extend the debating time so they will be able to tell 

us what they can supply the ports other than those of Rarotonga and Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  am  asking  again  that  in  terms  of  the  revenue  that  is  to  be  taken  by  the  Cook 

Islands  Investment  Corporation  Authority  and  transferred  to  Government,  must 

</span><span>receive a specification of the sort of social services this revenue will support. I don’t 

</span><span>want  it  to  be  spent  on  the  VIP  Lounge  and  Te  Atukura,  or  places  where  the  social 

services are for their own personal gains. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  I think we have had enough listening to an out of order debate 

by the Lead</span><span>er of the Opposition.  He has repeated himself so many times and it’s not 

</span><span>funny to listen to.  Talking about something that is not in the Bill, in Clause 2 in this 

particular  Bill  is  irrelevant.    Expressing  his  concern  about  other  ports  of  the  Cook 

Islands  </span><span>is  what  they  call  in  Maori    “big  pikikaa”.    I  will  withdraw  that  word.    It’s 

</span><span>unparliamentary.  Not true.  He was only saying this to the people in the Outer Islands 

or  the  listening  public  to  make  them  believe  that  he  is  concerned  about  the  Outer 

</span><span>Islands’</span><span> ports.  The fact of the matter is that he has been to the Outer Islands, or that 

he has been in Government, he has not done one little bit to those ports.  Today he is 

telling the people of the country that he is concerned about those ports, primarily for 

his  political  goals.    A  political  statement  cannot  mislead  the  people  of  the  Cook 

Islands by the Leader of the Opposition.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Mr Chairman, you can see whenever I speak something that 

hurts them, they are up and up and up all the time.  What is wrong with these people?  

I  am  not  even  mentioning  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  not  doing  anything  or  the 

</span><span>Minister of Education for not doing anything.  I’m not even mentioning that.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please come back to the clause Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  I  am  talking  about  this 

</span><span>amendment  in  Clause  2,  Mr  Chairman.  One  part  reads  “Authority  to  give  effect  to 

greater  emphasis  to  Government’s  social  policy  in  the  exercise  of  its  functions  and 

powers.”  You  kn</span><span>ow,  it  talks  about  the  revenue  that  this  Ports  Authority  will  be 

getting.  To be directed to the social services of Government and in another part, it is 

talking about the inadequacies of Parliament appropriations.  So this is something that  

I am concerned about.  That is why I am up Mr Chairman.  To express my concern on 

it and if the Deputy Prime Minister is not happy about that, too bad.   This is what I 

</span><span>think. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>You’re a hypocrite.</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>2050 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  So  it  is  up  to  them  to  make  something  better  for  our 

country,  not  just  to  serve  the  purposes  of  the  social  services  which  they  are  talking 

about.  The country is crying for our Health services and Education which are things 

that are more important than the general social services of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>Point  of  Order.  Don’t  argue  with  the  ruling  of  the  Speaker.  

</span><span>Sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> And you sit down! 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Would the Honourable Members please take your seats. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>The Deputy Prime Minister can’t te</span><span>ll me to sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Now there is a Point of Order on the Floor Honourable Member.  

The Deputy Prime Minister, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>   Yes,  you want  me to  speak on my Point of Order? It seems 

that the Leader of the Opposition has closed his speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Before  I  call  on  the  next 

speaker,  I  wish  to  inform  the  Honourable  House  that  I  will  cease  the debate on this 

Bill at 11.50 this morning. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  staff  of  the  Ports 

Authority in Avatiu because things are not as they used to be.  This Ports Authority is 

being run very well now.  Cargo handling is very good.  All the cargo is dry.  The only 

problem  is  that once the cargo goes to  the Outer Islands, because there is  no proper 

facilities in the Outer Islands, it is difficult to ensure the safety of the cargo.  The ports 

in the Outer Islands, particularly in the Northern Islands are very bad. The worst ports 

are  those  for  the  islands  of  Pukapuka  and  the  island  of  Nassau.    Penrhyn  is  alright.  

</span><span>Yet the Deputy Prime Minister has been a Minister for a long time. But he hasn’t been 

</span><span>able to do anything for these islands. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Irrelevancy in Debate - 193. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Honourable  Member  you  are  irrelevant.    Therefore,  will  you 

please come back to the clause on the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  I am  very much concerned about  the attitude of this Government.  

There is very little developments in the Northern Groups.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2051 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>    Point  of  Order  Mr  Chairman.    I  would  like  to  remind  the 

Honourable Member that there is no mentioning of the Northern Group whatsoever in 

Clause 2.  So if he has got nothing to say you either speak on the Bill or you sit down 

and shut up. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please come back to Clause 2 Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> The staff at the Avatiu wharf is very good and you see them looking 

after the cargo. I would like to compliment and thank them.  Today we see that there 

are  only  two  ports  recognised  by  Government,  that  on  Rarotonga  and  the  one  in 

Aitutaki.  When we become Government, we will also look at the other ports. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Chairman.  Point of Order 193 - Relevancy 

in Debate.  Until the Honourable Pupuke Robati comes to his right sense and debates 

Clause 2, I will raise a Point of Order every time and every moment he goes out of the 

Clause 2 of the Bill.  The Northern Group has no place in Clause 2.  None whatsoever. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  You  have  gone  off 

Honourable Member.  Please come back to the Clause. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  The work is done well but the equipment 

</span><span>of  the  ports  is  not  very  good.    Putangi  Mose’s  policy  will  make  this  better  for  the 

</span><span>people  of  Aitutaki.    So  I  would like the people of Aitutaki  not  to  worry.  This  is  in 

</span><span>Putangi  Mose’s  policy.    In  some  ways,  I  like  Government’s  plan  i</span><span>n  recognising  the 

ports of Avatiu and Aitutaki.  So I will go and ask Andrew Turua what his plans are.  

But I know that he has already planned out things because he is from the Uritaua clan, 

so why should we worry.  So I think in the future these two ports will improve. 

</span></div><div><span>I  think  we  should  thank the outgoing Member for Avatiu because we know that the 

new Member will have new plans.  I would like to congratulate staff of the Ports of 

Avatiu  and  Aitutaki.    If  only  I  would  allowed  I  will  give  you  the  policies  of  the 

Democratic-Alliance  party  for  the rest  of the ports, but  most especially for Penrhyn.   

Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Thomas Hewett. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEWITT:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman,  Kia  Orana  to  your  staff  this  morning.  

Kia  Orana  also  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to  the  Cabinet 

Ministers, to  all Government  Members, to  the leader of the New Alliance Party and 

his  Members,  to  the  leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  and  his  Members,  Kia 

Orana to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>Through you Mr Chairman, I would like to send my Greetings out to my people and 

my  constituency.    Kia  Orana  to  all  my  people,  to  all  the  leaders  and  the  various 

denominations,  to  the  Ui  Ariki,  to  the  Ui  Mataiapo,  to  the  mayor  and  to  all  island 

councillors,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all  in  the  name  of  our  lord.    We  would  like  you  our 

people to know that we are all fighting for you.

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> What is your Point of Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE</span><span>: Thank your Mr Chairman.  The Honourable Member is on 

</span><span>the campaign track He hasn’t even started on the amendment.   Let me speak my mind 

because when I started to be irrelevant a while ago I was pulled up.  Now that’s why 

I’m  sayin</span><span>g  I  cannot  allow  the  Honourable  Member  to  be  sidetracked  because  the 

Government bench continuously interjected my speech for irrelevancy. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member that is a point of explanation.  So 

would you please take your seat? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> So, that is why I want you to pull him back.  Thank you Mr 

Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> And the Honourable Member please continues and come back to 

the clause.   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I come back Mr Chairman to Clause 2 

and  give  my  support.   Clause 2 shows me something different  altogether from  what 

the Honourable Terepai Maoate and the Honourable Pupuke Robati can see.  They are 

talking  about  revenue  that  Government  transfers  from  the  ports  for  the  Members  to 

use for overseas travel.  Nowhere in this Clause would you find anything to that effect. 

They are making all sorts of allegations to make our people believe that what they are 

saying is the truth.  I would like to submit to our people that these are malicious false 

allegations.  This is not what is happening.  This money will be taken back to be used 

on our people on our island.  These two Members have always been trying to mislead 

our  people,  Mr  Chairman.    Clause  2 clarifies the meaning of the Term Corporation.  

Likewise Crown, Financial Year and other terms.  We all know that Financial year is a 

duration  of  a  period  of  12  months  Mr  Chairman.    Within  that  period,  any  revenue, 

which  comes  into  the  public  account,  is  used  in  all  sorts  of  different  places.    And 

today Mr Chairman, I know that the port has employed a number of people and money 

has  been  used  to  pay  them.  Yet,  if  we  listen  to  the  thoughts  of  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, it sounds as if none of the revenue generated by the ports has never been 

injected into the ports again. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 stands part of the Bill?
