</span></div><div><span>Cook Islands Natural Heritage Trust Bill, Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Cook Islands Natural Heritage Trust Bill be now Read a  

Second time. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  speaking  briefly  to  the  principle  and  merits  of  the  Bill  the  Natural 

Heritage  project  was  established  in  1990  to  collect  scientific  and  historical  data  on 

plants and animals of the Cook Islands, including traditional use of plants and animals 

and  to  make  this  information  available  to  the  general  public  and  special  interest 

groups.  To date Mr Speaker, the project has collected and systematically filed a great 

deal of information and published a variety of posters and books for the public.  The 

project  has  prepared  several  books  on  specific  groups  of  plants  and  animals  and  on 

several  natural  heritage  topics.    A  major  ongoing  task  is  the  development  of  multi 

media database on all significant plants and animals.  The database presently contains 

3000 plants and animals and when finished will have 5000, having a basic description 

of  Maori  names.    This  project  collects  and produces information,  which is  available 

and  useful  to  Government  and  non  Government  agencies  involved  in  environment, 

history and cultural developments.  This is what the Natural Heritage Project does Mr 

Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>Since its inception the natural heritage project has operated from the Prime Minister’s 

</span><span>Department, the Prime Minister</span><span>’s Office, the Ministry of Works and environment and 

</span><span>Physical  Planning  and  the  Environment  agency,  Taporoporo.    In  each  case  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 73</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2099 

</span></div><div><span>umbrella  group  provide  salaries  for  its  staff  but  little  for  actual  production  and 

operation.  Furthermore the project has never been comfortable fit with any of these 

bodies.  This is true even with the project under the environment services.  The fit is 

not comfortable.  The environment service operates under the Rarotonga Environment 

Act  and  is  only  concerned  with  Rarotonga  whereas  the  project  covers  plants  and 

animal life throughout the Cook Islands.  Furthermore the collection of data concerns 

flora and fauna and is not the function of Taporoporo.  Over the years the project has 

had difficulty negotiating with overseas agencies for funding because of its lack of an 

independent  identity.    The  establishment  of  a  natural  heritage  trust  by  providing  the 

trust  with  a  separate  identity  for  external  assistance  for  specific  programmes  makes 

available information on plants and animals of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Initially the project will need continued support from Government who ultimately we 

hope this will be supplemented by significant private contributions or by international 

support as well. 

</span></div><div><span>This  Bill  Mr  speaker  establishes  a  Natural  Heritage  Trust  administered  by  trustees.  

The Minister for the Environment appoints one trustee who will be Chairman of the 

</span><span>Board of Trustees.  The Director of the Environment Services, the Financial Secretary 

</span><span>and  the  Head  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  each  appoint  one  trustee.    One  further 

trustee is appointed jointly by the respective heads of the Ministry of Agriculture and 

Marine  Resources.    There  are  also  provisions  for  the  appointment  of  trustees  by 

donors  who  make  significant  contribution  to  the  funding  of  its  activities.    Such 

trustees will hold office for the period of the expenditure of that same donation while 

the other trustees holds office for a period of three years. 

</span></div><div><span>The principal objective of the Trust is the gathering of scientific data and knowledge 

of  nature  in  these  islands.    These  include  study  and  research  on  the  traditional 

knowledge  and  practices  of  Cook  Islanders  in  respect  of  flora  and  fauna  of  this 

country.  A subsidiary objective is to make this information widely available. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  to  achieve  its  objectives  the  Trust  has  a  number  of  powers.    It  may 

establish  Museums,  hold  exhibitions,  publish  pamphlets  and  booklets  and  undertake 

other activities to educate the public about the animals and plants of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Bill  provides  for  the  trustees  to  appoint  a  Director.    The  Director  may  appoint 

</span><span>staff with the approval of the Board.  The strict accounting requirements contained in 

</span><span>the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management Act 1995-96 extend to the Trust.  

The Trust must also furnish its accounts and an annual reports to the Minister for the 

Environment.   This  Report, Mr Speaker, together with  its accounts attached must in 

turn be laid before this Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  Bill  concerned  a  small  but  successful  project  which  has  been  in 

operation  for  nearly  a  decade  and  has  the  full  support  of  the  Minister  for  the 

Environment.    The  Bill  aims  to  give  the  project  a  higher  profile,  an  independent 

</span><span>identity and widen its base of support both locally and internationally and, Mr speaker, 

</span><span>I am confident this Bill will help achieve that object.

</span></div><div><span>With  that  brief  and  clear  explanation  on  the  principle  and  merits  of  this  Bill,  Mr 

Speaker, I hope this Bill before the House will get the support of all Members of this 

House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    May  I  call  for  a  Seconder 

please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Mii Parima 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Mama Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Mr Speaker, to everyone here this evening - Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise, Mr speaker, to give my support to the Cook Islands Natural Heritage Trust Bill.  

These  are the things which were discussed when I went  to  Wellington,  Mr Speaker.  

When  we  went  to  Wellington,  I  took  artefacts,  tapes  of  local  dancing  and  cultural 

illustrations.    Tonight  we  are  talking  about  the  flora  and  fauna  of  our  country  and  I 

think  all  the  people  should  support  the  Bill  because  I  think  this  will  benefit  our 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>You  all  heard  the  explanations  given  to  us  by  the  Dep</span><span>uty  Prime  Minister.    I  won’t 

</span><span>dwell on this because he clarified the appointment of the Directors and the number of 

trustees, including their roles.  Maybe this will be my last opportunity to get to speak 

before the next election, Mr Speaker.  I would just like to say that I am happy with this 

particular Bill, unlike the Bills brought before the House earlier, Mr speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>So I would like to ask and to encourage everyone to support this Bill and to the village 

of Nikao, I would like to say Kia Orana to you all.  To the Orometua of the village, to 

the  Assistant  Orometua,  to  all  the  people,  the  young  people,  to  the  children  of  our 

village.  Kia Orana to you all in the name of Our Lord.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Education. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr speaker.  I would like to seek your indulgence.  This 

</span><span>has got to be my last night.  After this you won’t be listening to me any</span><span> more. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to this Cook Islands Natural Heritage Trust Bill which deals 

with the flora and the fauna of the Cook Islands.  How wonderful. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 75</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2101 

</span></div><div><span>A  few  months  ago  I  was  involved  with  a  workshop  for  young  people  from  the 

Southern Group Islands as they were there at the workshop, studying the birds of the 

Cook Islands.  I was so proud when I heard that there were some birds that are rare but 

found in the Cook Islands.  It was the first time Mr Speaker that I heard of these rare 

birds  like  the  Kakerori  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga,  the  Tangeao  on  the  island  of 

Mangaia,  the  Kuramo  which  is  found  in  Aitutaki  and  a  few  islands  in  the  Tahitian 

Group and the Kopeka on the island of Atiu.  

</span></div><div><span>If this was the first time I heard it, just imagine how many other people in our country 

</span><span>don’t  know  this.    And  I  also  hear  that  on  the  islands  of  Rakahanga  and  Manihiki 

</span><span>alone, we have the Kakaia a Maui.  This is precluded to those two islands only, how 

wonderful.  These are just a few of the birds that I could mention. 

</span></div><div><span>We  still  have  the  flora  of  the  Cook  Islands  and  this  is  something  that  this  Natural 

Heritage Trust wants to be able to show the world.  We know that there are people in 

the  world  today  who  want  to  give  money  for  the  development  of  the  fauna  and  the 

flor</span><span>a. They can’t because the Cook Islands Natural Heritage Trust cannot be identified 

</span><span>as a Trust, this is why we need this Bill.  If I look at the ways that the Board of this 

</span><span>Trust is set out I think it is well done.   I’m happy that there is one person on th</span><span>is Trust 

</span><span>Board that is appointed by the Secretary of the Education Department.  Because in this 

person he will report from the Trustees to the Education Department and therefore we 

would be able to implement some of the plans that the Natural Heritage Trust would 

like to put into the Schools.   

</span></div><div><span>There is just one area that disappointed me and I spoke to our legal advisor.  I see here 

that there are times when we will need the Natural Heritage Trust to turn the value of 

Avana into a reserve.  But they are not been given that authority.  We can see now that 

this is the responsibility of the Tuanga Taporoporo and I would like to see us give the 

Natural  Heritage  Trust  the  opportunity  to  be  able  to  recommend  the  Tuanga 

Taporoporo to consider this option. The Tuanga Taporoporo has that authority but we 

need the Natural Heritage Trust to assist them by making such recommendations.   

</span></div><div><span>As we can see, all that this Bill is authorising is to give the Natural Heritage Trust the 

power to be able to go out, identify, catalogue and to find descriptions in books about 

these  elements  and  eventually  place  these  into  a  data  base  form.    This  Bill  is  not 

giving them the authority to protect our flora or our fauna.  This is why I raised this 

</span><span>matter, Mr Speaker, thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:    </span><span>A  Bill  Intituled:  An  Act  to  establish  a  Cook  Islands 

Natural  Heritage  Trust  with  the  necessary  resources  and  powers  to  investigate, 

identify,  research,  study,  classify,  record,  issue,  preserve  and  arrange  publications, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 76</a></div><div><span>2102 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>exhibitions, displays and generally educate the public on the science of, and traditional 

practices and knowledge relating to, the flora and fauna of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I will now resolve Parliament into the Committee of the Whole.
