<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. JACK: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Second and Third Readings of the Cook Islands Investment 

Corporation Amendment (No.2) Bill be completed by no later than  

10.30a.m. today. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Leader of the House.  May I have a Seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister of Legislative Services Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  Honourable  Members  in  the  House,  our  people 

listening in to our debate, greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to oppose this guillotine motion before the House.  Mr Speaker, we 

have been hanging around for  many months and we did not do much.  Now we can 

see that the Bills  we have before the House are being rushed to  complete.  It  seems 

this  one  is  also  being  rushed  through.    I  really  wanted  us  to  work  together  and  to 

cooperate as we deal with these businesses so that we will all understand it fully in an 

attempt to avoid any misunderstandings.  There have been occasions that we perused a 

Bill  where  both  sides  of  the  House  contributed  and  everybody  was  satisfied.    How 

</span><span>come we can’t do the same with this Bill? </span><span>This Bill is also of great importance.  This 

kind of approach where we guillotine a Bill, which has to be dealt with in one and a 

</span><span>half hour will not receive my support.  That is all I have to say. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate.

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you, to Honourable 

Members  in  the  House  and  to  our  people  who  are  listening  in  to  our  debate,  Kia 

Orana.    Mr  Speaker  I  rise  to  show  my  dissatisfaction  with  what  is  happening  this 

morning.    During  these  last  few  days  of  this  Parliament  there  was  no  proper 

arrangement between the parties on how we could efficiently discharge the Bills.  In 

the past we have discussed some matters in-camera and those arrangements went very 

well.  Every time I address the Honourable Minister of Agriculture </span><span>–</span><span> well, he is more 

satisfied if I address him as the Minister of Legislative Services.  I can see he wants 

everybody  to  know  that  his  authority  extends  to  being  the  boss  of  this  House.    He 

wants to be over the top of you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Leave that Honourable Member and come back to the Motion on the 

floor. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    The  Minister  does  not  care 

</span><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: 

</span><span>about us at all.  If he wants to do something he just does it without due consideration 

for the rest of the parties in this Chamber.  Over the last few days, I observed that if 

the Minister feels like suspending Parliament we have to stop.  Every time he wants 

</span><span>three  sessions  a  day  he  makes  that  decision.    I  don’</span><span>t  think  the  other  Members  of 

Government are happy.  This House is becoming like an ordinary committee meeting.  

I want to assure us our people are not happy.  They have no confidence in the House at 

all.  What I am concerned is the Opposition side which is presently dragged into this 

situation.  The Minister must have thought that by bringing so many Bills in these last 

few  days  of  Parliament  it  will  eliminate  the  detrimental  impressions  of  Government 

activities.  Another example of his doing is the Cook Islands Investment Corporation 

Bill,  thinking  the  people  will  fall  for  that  trickery.    Noticeably,  this  Bill  will  not  be 

completed  today.    Tomorrow  is  the  last  day  of  our  sitting  and  Government  is 

expecting  everything  completed  by  then.    This  is  ignorance  of  the  Leader  of  House 

and  the  Minister  responsible  of  Parliamentary  Services.    They  are  really  good  in 

criticising  the  Opposition  but  these  actions  by  Government  are  really  what  true 

ignorance is.  I do not have any confidence in the Leader of the House as well as those 

Ministers  in  the  back  row  of  the  House.    This  is  one  thing  I  heard  and  what  I  have 

suspected  all  along.    There  are  five  Bills  before  the  House.    It  means  we  have  to 

complete these Bills in two days.  We the Opposition would like to debate these Bills, 

likewise the Government Members. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Bills  we  have  before  the  House  is  very  important  Bills  but  the  procedures  in 

discharging  these  Bills  is  unsatisfactory.    Had  Government  done  their  job  in  the 

manner  adopted  by  the  Honourable  Minister  Tiki  Matapo  I  doubt  if  there  would  be 

any argument from our bench. I suspect that they have been lazing around too much.  

That  is  why  a  large  number  of  Bills  were  not  submitted  to  this  House  earlier.    The 

Minister of Education who will be retiring soon is calling out for me to sit down.  He 

is one of the laziest Ministers I have seen.  That is why our schools have lacked sheer 

developments. 

</span></div><div><span>I am sure that the purpose of this guillotine motion is to prevent our people from fully 

</span><span>grasping  the  intention  of  these  Bills.  They  want  to  hide  the  actual  purpose  of  these 

Bills  so  our  people  will  not  understand.    Because  we  do  not  have  enough  time  to 

contribute to these Bills how can our people know what laws we are making?  We on 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2029 

</span></div><div><span>the  Opposition  would  like  to  question  why  this  Bill  is  rushed  through  this  House.  

Because this Bill just came in last year.  So I raise my strong objection to this Motion 

before the House for the simple reason that we are not giving proper attention to these 

Bills in these last few days and hours of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I will wait and see whether other Members will speak their mind on the point I have 

raised Mr Speaker.  If they want  to  remain silent,  we on the Opposition  bench have 

registered our concern.  Undoubtedly they in Government will not be able to stop the 

Honourable  Member,  Paora  Teiti  and  my  friend,  the  Honourable  Member,  Thomas 

Hewett  from  expressing  their  views.  Government  is  saying  that  they  will  not  speak 

much.    Mr  Speaker  we  all  know  that  no  one  can  prevent  anyone,  let  alone,  the 

Honourable Member Thomas Hewett and the Honourable Member, Paora Teiti from 

exercising their rights. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  On the motion, Mr Speaker.  I am in support of the Leader of the 

Democratic Alliance Party in that we do want the business to be completed.  However, 

for him to insinuate that we are trying to hide the intentions of these Bills, I disagree.   

Had he concentrated on the motion then he would have a lot more time to speak on 

the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Yes, I submit to him that we negotiated in the past over the passage of Bills and other 

businesses  of  the  House.    For  example,  last  October/November  we  went  in-camera 

after  talking  with  them.    Now,  it  is  difficult  for  us  to  treat  the  completion  of  the 

businesses  of  this  House  lightly.  I  cannot  bring  myself  to  trust  him  to  maintain  the 

</span><span>quorum of the House, even if we reached a gentleman’s agreement.  We almost went 

</span><span>three whole days on the Electoral Amendment Bill.  We gave them all that time.  Last 

week I indicated to them the likelihood of a guillotine motion for the rest of the Bills 

coming before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> No.  No. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>    And  I  even  made  a  public  announcement  in  Parliament  last 

week. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> No guillotine. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.V. TAIREA:</span><span>  When we had the adjournment on Friday, I said there would be 

three  sittings  of  Parliament  today.  I  made  it  clear  to  everybody  on  Friday  that 

Government will finish seven Bills.  Three today and four tomorrow if possible.  The 

simple fact, Mr Spea</span><span>ker, is that these are important Bills to consolidate Government’s 

</span><span>Corporations. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  give  enough  time  to  them  to  deal  with  the 

Bills but under the present situation that is impossible.
