<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>The Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Airport Authority Bill be now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Speaking  to  the  principles  and  merits  of  the  Bill,  the  proposed  Amendment  to  the 

Airport  Authority  are  designed  to  align  this  Act  with  the  Cook  Islands  Investment 

Corporation Act.   

</span></div><div><span>Under  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Act,  the  Board  of  Investment 

Corporation appoints the Directors of the Airport Authority and the Airport Authority 

is a subsidiary of the Investment Corporation.  A number of provisions in the Airport 

Authority Act are added or moved to accommodate this change and in particular: 

</span></div><div><span>a)    

</span></div><div><span>The  amendment  provides 

the  appointment  of  directors 

determinations of their remunerations by the Investment Corporation; 

</span></div><div><span>for 

</span></div><div><span>in 

</span></div><div><span>the 

</span></div><div><span>b)     The Investment Corporation may give the authority general directions as to the           

        management strategies to be followed by the authority in the performance 

</span></div><div><span>of the  authorities’ functions;</span></div><div><span>c)    

</span></div><div><span>The  authority  will  have  the  power  to  declare  a  divined  which  is  paid  to  the   

</span><span>Investment  Corporation  in  accordance  with  the  authority’s  statement  of 

</span><span>corporate intent; 

</span></div><div><span>d) 

</span></div><div><span>e) 

</span></div><div><span>Ministerial  approval  will  no  longer  be  required  for  the  Airport  Authority  to 

</span><span>borrow money; 

</span></div><div><span>The current restriction which does not allow the authority to grant a lease for 

any term exceeding 5 years or longer without the approval of the Minister of 

Civil Aviation is removed; 

</span></div><div><span>And  Mr  Speaker,  the  Airport  Authority  will  be  required  to  issue  to  the  Investment 

Corporation annually a statement of corporate intent for approval by the Board of the 

Corporation and Annual Report have to be filed and Fiscal Updates must be provided 

</span><span>to the Investment Corporation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker the amending legislation does not completely remove the authority of the 

</span><span>Minister.    It  is  your  Government’s  view  that  this  amendment  provides  the  draft 

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>2056 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>statement  of  corporate  intent  which  must  be  sent  by  the  authority  not  only  to  the 

Investment Corporation but to the Minister of Civil Aviation as well.   

</span></div><div><span>The reason Mr Speaker why it must also be delivered to the Minister of Civil Aviation 

is  that  the  Minister  has  the  job  of  keeping  an  eye  on  the  Airport  Authority  to  make 

sure that it is giving effect to the social policy of Government, those are crucial in the 

law.  With the consent of Cabinet Mr Speaker, the Minister may require the Airport 

Authority  to  place  greater  emphasis  on  Government  social  policy.    However,  where 

this  occurs,  the  cost  of  doing  so  is  to  be  identified  and  either  deducted  from  the 

dividend  government  receives  from  the  Investment  Corporation  or  appropriated  by 

Parliament.  In this way Mr Speaker, the cost of government policies will be clearly 

identified  in  a  transparent  way.    With  that  brief  explanation  on  the  principles  and 

merits of the Bill, I expect full support from both sides of the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Deputy Prime Minister. Can I have a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. T. Marsters 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I rise to express my views 

on the Bill before the House.  However, before I do so, I would like to send out a few 

words of Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker on Tuesday last, I listened with sadness at the official announcement by 

the  Honourable  Mataio  Aperau  of  his  intention  to  retire  from  politics.  Although,  I 

realised as early as October last year that the Honourable Member was stepping down, 

despite that the announcement last Tuesday, it really hit me Mr Speaker.  Only a few 

days before that I also listened with sadness at the announcement by the Minister of 

Education  the  Honourable  Ngereteina  Puna,  his  intention also  to  retire at  the end of 

this  term  from  politics.    In  both  cases,  I  chose  the  word  sadness.  I  chose  the  word 

specifically, Mr Speaker to illustrate how I really feel about these two gentlemen.  The 

political chapter of these two gen</span><span>tlemen’s lives has closed.  For one especially, for the 

</span><span>Minister of Education, an illustrious one, after all his service to this country.  Many of 

us would know that following University, he came back home, joined the Education 

system, became a Secretary of Education, then a Minister of Education and last week 

all of these have come to an end.   

</span></div><div><span>One  thing  I  quickly  found  out  when  I  choose  to  take  on  politics  as  a  Member  of 

Parliament Mr Speaker, is that it does not matter how popular you are or how much 

good you do, the minorities will always find some faults to discredit you.  

</span></div><div><span>These  two  gentlemen  has  done  so  much  good  for  this  country,  but  we  should  not 

reflect on the very few negatives that may have taken place in their lives and services 

to this country. But rather we should look and dwell on the many many good things 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2057 

</span></div><div><span>that they have done for this country.  People might think that Members of Parliament 

are the wealthy few in this country.  Selfish and sometimes ruthless statements made 

in  the  media  criticising  Members  of  this  House  strengthen  this  thinking.  One  paper 

even liken Members of Parliament to fat pigs being led to their feed troughs.  Those 

are how low some people can go into their efforts to discredit and denigrate Members 

of this House.  Our two friends who are retiring will not escape that kind of criticism.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  I  will  always  remember  the  Honourable  Ngereteina  Puna  as  a  humble, 

kind,  generous person as  well as a deep thinker.  In Cabinet, he is  one of those few 

who  would  say  his  mind  even  if  some  of  us  do  not  want  to  hear  him.  Once  he  has 

</span><span>made up his mind he will not depart from his decision.  That’s how I knew him.  The 

</span><span>important point here Mr Speaker is that you knew it exactly where you stood with the 

man.  For the 6 years I was in Cabinet I found the Honourable Member to be a very 

stabilising force but sometimes the Honourable Member surprises me with his actions 

in  Parliament  when  he  gets  angry.    Because  never  once  have  I  seen  him  lose  his 

temper  in  Cabinet  and  that  would  probably  surprise  a  few.    In  fact,  in  Cabinet  he 

</span><span>demonstrates  the  higher  levels  of  tolerance,  patience  and  wisdom  and  I’m  sure  that 

</span><span>would  surprise  some  also.    As  new  around the block, I am  not  ashamed to  say now 

</span><span>that I have used the Member as a sounding block.  I have used this Minister more than 

</span><span>anybody  else  in  an  effort  to  improve  my  own  lot.    His  advise  has  always  been 

invaluable.  When I described earlier, the Honourable Ngereteina Puna being a kind 

and  unselfish  person  and  when  I disclosed that I used him on many occasions in  an 

effort  to  improve  my  position,  the  decision  he  has  now  taken  in  fact  Mr  Speaker 

</span><span>reflects  the  very  person  he  is.    Sadly  though  this  time  Mr  Speaker  he’s  taken  his 

</span><span>advice from his own self but no doubt he has taken all matters into consideration and 

in my eyes Mr Speaker, this Honourable Member have risen beyond himself - above 

himself.  When I listened to him speak last week, a couple of extensive chitchats arose 

outside  of  this  Chamber.    I  sensed  in  my  own  reasons  two  major  factors  for  his 

retirement.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly he and his wife Jackie would like to spend some quality time in their remaining 

years with their children, grandchildren and their immediate family.  Who can blame 

them for feeling that way now Mr Speaker?  The Honourable Ngereteina Tuakeu Puna 

and his good wife Jackie have served this country faithfully for over 30 years.  20 of 

them in this House.  While the Honourable Member may have been the man in front, 

let us not forget our old saying that behind a great man is a great lady.   

</span></div><div><span>Secondly  Mr  Speaker,  the  Honourable  Member  is  moving  aside  for  the  sake  of  the 

party.  He and his committee on Aitutaki is confident that a young son of Aitutaki has 

been  identified  who  will  be  able  to  carry  the  banner  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party  with 

credit.  He has unselfishly decided that to make way now was the right thing to do and 

yet if the opportunity pass off the adverse effect might happen.   

</span></div><div><span>As  Secretary  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party,  I  raise  my  hat  to  you  Honourable  Member.  

While it happened in a short time, since you made your announcement, the morale in 

</span><span>your electorate is lifted yet to another level.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>2058 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  You will recall the other day when I was 

speaking on behalf of what I felt about the two Honourable Members.  I was trying to 

highlight their performances and the appreciations that this country should give them.  

Then I was rudely interrupted by one of the Ministers.  I gave in to that Point of Order.  

</span><span>It’s goi</span><span>ng on to 20 minutes now since the Honourable Member has spoken on just the 

2 Members  and nothing on the Second Reading of the Airport Authority Bill.  With 

due respect to the Member Honourable Tom Marsters, the time has been reduced for 

speaking time on this Bill.  We will be finishing debate on this Bill at 2.30 and I regret 

</span><span>to  bring  to  your  notice  Mr  Speaker  that  I’m  not  happy  that  so  much  time  has  been 

</span><span>spent on these 2 Members and the campaigning motives of the Government Members. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  would  like  to  ask  the 

Honourable  Member  to  come  back  to  the  subject  before  us.    Some  Honourable 

Members  who  have  spoken  on  this  subject  before  had  never  been  interrupted  but  I 

would like to ask the Honourable Member to come back to the Bill. The Honourable 

Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS: </span><span>Mr Speaker, let me apologise to the other side of the House for 

taking up too much of time.  I realise that now that I may have been a bit selfish with 

</span><span>everybody’s time.  We only have less than an hour </span><span>to deal with this Bill.  I will reserve 

the rest of my address on the two Honourable Members to another time Mr Speaker.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can  I  have  the  next  Speaker  please?  The  Honourable  Member 

Mama Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA: </span><span>Kia Orana to everyone this afternoon. Mr Speaker this Airport 

Authority amendment is not that much different from the Airport Authority Bill.  We 

are  giving some powers to  the CIIC.  I know Mr Speaker that the Airport is  a good 

revenue  generator  for  our  country.    It  has  been  25  years  since  our  airport  started 

working.    When  we  started  with  our  airport,  everything  went  well.  When  the  Cook 

Islands Party Government came into power, they were running our airport.  During the 

</span><span>Democratic Party’s reign, they managed the airport fo</span><span>r 10 years.  Today, if we were to 

add  everything  together  we  would  find  that  the  Cook  Islands  Party  has  had 

management of the airport for 15 years and the Democratic Party Government for 10 

</span><span>years.    So  I  don’t  think  it  is  fair  that  the  Government  of  today  s</span><span>hould  blame  the 

</span><span>Democratic  Party  for  what  they  did  when  they  were  in  government.    I  believe  that 

</span><span>during your management of this airport it wasn’t done properly.  So now, you found a 

</span><span>group of people to do the work for you.   

</span></div><div><span>What  are  you  doing  with  the $25.00 that our people are paying for Departure at  the 

airport?  I know Mr Deputy Prime Minister that $5.00 out of $25.00 is supposed to go 

to  our  environment.    Where  is  the  $20.00  going  to.    I  was  invited  to  the  25th 

Anniversary  of  this  airport.  I  was  there  and  heard  Papa  Percy  Henderson  asking 

Government to give the whole $25.00 back to the Airport Authority.  So I understand 

that not all of this money is going to the authority.  I would like to tell you Mr Speaker 

that  I  have  been  taken  on  a  tour  through  the  airport  by  the  staff  of  the  Airport 

</span><span>Authority.    On the inland side towards Ngariki’s section, we found that the V</span><span>-drain 

</span><span>has cracked in a number of places.  I’m certain that in a couple of years this area will 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2059 

</span></div><div><span>pose  a  problem  for  planes  landing  from  that  direction.    This  is  an  area  that  I  have 

found to be a problem area which has not been fixed for a couple of years. There was 

a time recently when the Prime Minister told us, the landowners,  that he would give 

</span><span>the airport back to us.  I didn’t believe wha</span><span>t he said but we are trying to do something 

about the airport now.  I would like to tell our people that we are not taking the airport 

away but we are doing this to assist the people of this country.  If the Government is to 

by-pass the landowners it must </span><span>realise that we have an interest here.  We don’t want 

</span><span>them bringing a group of people to the airport to operate it without considering us.  It 

is true that the Government has the powers and as I have explained earlier our airport 

was  warranted  so  they  can  get  another  warrant  for  any  other  piece  of  land  for  the 

airport to extend it if they needed.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  the  Government  to  consider  the  landowners  in  terms  of  the  benefits 

</span><span>derived from this airport because if it weren’t for the landowners we will not h</span><span>ave a 

airport.  I  know  and  I  can  remember  that  the  Honourable  Dr  Robert  Woonton 

mentioned once before that this is a good revenue generating business. (Inaudible) 

</span></div><div><span>I am requesting Government to run this operation properly.  I know you will always 

</span><span>succeed in your policies because you have the majority in this House. Now we see that 

</span><span>the CIIC will be responsible for the Government assets. We also see that the Minister 

will now have a minor role in regard to the operation of the airport.  I will suspend my 

speech now and give some time to other Members to express their views. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  you  Mr  Speaker.  Kia  Orana  to  the  Honourable 

Members  of  this  House  and Kia Orana to  our people listening in.   I rise to  give my 

view on the Bill before the House.  This is my personal opinion Mr Speaker. When we 

</span><span>took over the administration of our Airport, it wasn’t easy </span><span>because the New Zealand 

Government  spent  more  than  $2  million.  When  this  airport  was  returned  to  us 

Government and the New Zealand Government made promises. The first one was that 

all revenue generated by the Airport would be returned to the Airport.  Secondly all 

staff  would  retain  all  the  rights  and  privileges  that  they  have  had  in  the  past  while 

working  for  the  New  Zealand  Government.    In  those  days,  the  Democratic  Party 

Government was in power.  It was also agreed at the time because there was not much 

revenue generated by the airport all money or revenue generated by the airport was to 

be returned to the airport.  All the airlines that were using the airport at the time were 

happy with the arrangement.  They all understood that whatever fees they have to pay 

in using the airport would be utilised to improve the airport.  So, ever since we got the 

airport  back  in  1986  most  of  the  revenue  has  always  been  returned  to  improve  the 

airport.     

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>2060 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>However,  when  the  Cook  Islands  Party  Government  came  in,  things  changed  a  bit.  

What  I  was  told  was  that  the  departure  tax  was  taken  by  Government  to  be  utilised 

elsewhere.  We also know that the airport tax was increased from $20-25 and that the 

extra $5.00 was promised for Environment.  We know Mr Speaker that if the revenue 

required  to  improve  or  maintain  the  airport  is  not  made  available,  and  these 

developments  fail  this  airport  will  not  only  be  closed  to  us.  The  International  Civil 

Aviation Authority will close it.  And this will be bad for us.   

</span></div><div><span>Recently we had the 25th Anniversary of this International Airport.  There are some 

problems on the landingstrip.  If these problems are not rectified then this airport will 

be  closed.    So  the  problem  then  is,  if  the  money  is  extracted  and  to  be  utilised 

elsewhere,  then  thi</span><span>s  airport  is  going  to  be  closed.    I’m  not  the  only  one  concerned.  

</span><span>There  are  others.    The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  the  Airport  Authority  voiced  his 

concern about the revenue of the airport being utilised elsewhere. As mentioned by the 

Honourable  Mama  Mau  earlier,  the  standard  of  the  V-drain  on  the  inland  side  is  in 

</span><span>disrepair  and  I  don’t  think  we  can  fix  it.  I’m  worried  because  there  have  been 

</span><span>suggestions  that  the  management  of  this  airport  be  given  to  people  outside  of  our 

country.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we have managed our airport for the last 14 years. Why is it suddenly we 

have to  give the management to  other people who are more capable than ourselves?  

My concern Mr Speaker is that our dedicated people working for this airport will be 

pushed aside and others will be put in their place.  That is if we put in their place other 

people  from  outside  of  the  country.  I  would  like  to  congratulate  all  those  dedicated 

airport  workers,  to  maintain  the  high  standards  required  by  the  Civil  Aviation 

Authority. 

</span></div><div><span>My concern Mr Speaker is that, like many of our assets, we stand to lose rather than 

gain  from  any  sale  of  managements  or  whatever  -  regarding  this  airport.  In 

comparison,  I  would  like  to  draw  your  attention  to  the  saga  of  the  Rarotonga  Hotel 

and the Sheraton Hotel.  All I can see in this amendment is the transfer of power on 

this airport  to  the Cook Islands Investment Corporation and to determine how much 

money  the  airport  has  to  pay  to  the  CIIC.  This  does  not  only  concern  the  Airport 

Authority  in  Rarotonga,  it  also  concern  the  Aitutaki  airport.    On  a  recent  visit  to 

Aitutaki,  the  landowners  of  the  Aitutaki  Airport  voiced  their  concern  regarding  the 

failure of payment for the lease of the Aitutaki airport. The simple answer Mr Speaker 

</span><span>is that there is not enough money to pay the landowners.  It is about time we hand over 

</span><span>the Aitutaki airport to the landowners of the airport to manage that airport.   

</span></div><div><span>I know when the change over from the New Zealand Government to the Cook Islands 

Government  was  made  in  1986,  there  was  a  lump  sum  designated  to  be  paid  to  the 

landowners of the Aitutaki airport, something in the order $80,000.00 I would like to 

put the question to the Minister of Aviation, where is the money that was paid out by 

the New Zealand Government for the landowners of Aitutaki?  I understand that at the 

time  the  money  was  paid  to  the  Trust  held  in  the  Justice  Department.    The  other 

</span><span>concern is the landowners of the airport in Rarotonga.  They raised some very strong 

</span><span>objections  to  the  sale  of  the  airport  or  its  management  to  foreigners.    It  has  always 

been our policy to include the landowners in the management of the Rarotonga airport 

and  it  will  be  in  our  manifesto  this  coming  Election.    Sure  we  have  paid  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2061 

</span></div><div><span>landowners 50 years ago.  However, this airport is over 50 years old. 50 years ago, the 

Government offered some kind of compensation to peaceful landowners.  Today this 

</span><span>airport  is  now  turning  over  a  large  volume  of  money.    It’s  only  right,  it’s  only  our 

</span><span>moral  obligation  that  we  pay  some  of  this  to  the  landowners.    I  d</span><span>on’t  see  anywhere 

</span><span>how this amendment could improve the service the people in the airport is providing 

our people.   How is it going to improve the revenue from this airport, how is gonna 

improve the wish of the landowners?  The bottom line in this amendment Mr Speaker 

is  to  price  money  out  of  the  revenue  derived  from  the  airport.    Our  people  have 

already been penalised by the $5.00 increased on the departure tax.  We will be one of 

the most expensive areas in the Pacific charging $25.00 for departure.  We are already 

one of the most expensive airport in the Pacific by virtue of the landing fees we charge 

compared to our neighbours.   

</span></div><div><span>So  I  would  urge  Government  to  look  at  this  seriously  because  if  we  don’t  leave 

</span><span>enough money in the airport to maintain the standard of that airport, we stand to lose 

an airport as well as the Tourist industry.   Right now, there are areas in this airport 

that  seriously  need  urgent  repairs.  Quite  recently,  they  have  to  upgrade  the  power 

supply to the airport from the Aponga Uira.  Because what we have here is not going 

</span><span>to last us for years.  It will need to be replaced sooner or later.  I have no doubt as to 

</span><span>the capabilities of our young men and women who are working in this airport.   

</span></div><div><span>I  recall  the  time  when  we  took  over  this  asset  from  the  New  Zealand  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Transport The Senior Technician did say in that meeting that he doesn’t see any way 

</span><span>where the Cook Islands will be able to maintain their electronics on this runway and 

the  quality  and  standard  of  the  runway  itself.    Because  of  that  threat,  the  Airport 

Authority  Board  made  sure  that  our  local  boys  are  fully  trained  in  New  Zealand, 

Malaysia  and  Taiwan  to  manage  an  international  standards  for  the  airport.   The end 

result Mr Speaker today is that Cook Islanders are running that airport.  No foreigners, 

only Cook Islanders.  Now we are thinking of giving it to other foreigners.  

</span></div><div><span>What is the matter with us, don’t we believe or trust our people?  Are we selling the 

</span><span>management of this airport to an outsider? Why?  They are saying to our people that 

</span><span>we are not good enough, you get out, and we want foreigners to run it.  That’s what 

happening  to  our  hospitals too.   We have grown up as a nation.  It’s about  time we 

</span><span>recognise  the  capabilities  of  our  people  and  recognise  those  capabilities  by  moving 

</span><span>these  kinds  of  changes.    We’re  just  showing  our  lack  of  confidence  in  their 

</span><span>performances.  I said earlier that it is not the Cook Islands Airport Authority who is 

</span><span>going  to  close  the  airport,  it  will  be  somebody  from  the  outside  such  as  the 

International  Civil  Aviation  Organisation.    If  they  know  that  the  standard  of  this 

airport is not good enough they are gonna close it tomorrow.  We the Members of this 

House  are  aware  that  in  some  flights,  there  is  an  inspector  who  sneaks  into  this 

country and checks the perimeters, checks the quality of this runway and goes out to 

make  a  report  without  us  knowing  what  they  are  doing.    Even  to  the  point  of 

smuggling illegal materials through our security checkout here.  Repeatedly our local 

boys have caught people who tried to conduct such test for us.  And the standard of 

</span><span>our Airport has been up until now. It has been maintained at international level.  

</span></div><div><span>One of the many aspects that we take for granted is that we have an airport and it will 

serve  us.    That  airport  has  to  abide  by  international  regulations  regarding  public

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>liabilities.  In the case of an accident on this runway we will be liable, not the airport.  

The government of this country will be liable.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Before I call on our next speaker, 

I wish to inform the House that pursuant to the Order of the House I will cease debate 

on the Bill at 2.20 p.m. today.  Our next speaker is the Honourable Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Speaker, as I look at th</span><span>is Bill there’s not much difference from 

</span><span>the Bill that we passed this morning.  I read this Bill from the beginning to the end and 

my  question  is  where  are  the  landowners  of  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki?  There  is  no 

mention of the landowners in this Bill, no mention as to whether their opinions will be 

obtained. The only thing that I find here is that we are giving everything to the Cook 

Islands  Investment  Corporation.    I  find  it  very  hard  to  support  something  like  this 

</span><span>because we’re giving this authority to a di</span><span>fferent group of people.  If these were the 

</span><span>landowners, I wouldn’t find that hard to support. </span></div><div><span>We heard of a meeting held in the village of Nikao, which was attended by the Prime 

Minister, and the Prime Minister said that he was going to give back the airport to the 

landowners.  When  will  this  airport  be  given  back  or  when  will  the  landowners  be 

allowed to make decisions for this airport?  I find I cannot support an amendment like 

this  where  there  is  no  regard  given  to  the  landowners  as  to  how  this  airport  will  be 

managed.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  the  Overseas 

Constituency  because  he  was  sacked.  He  opposed  the  selling  of  State  Own 

</span><span>Enterprises. Although a lot of the landowners didn’t agreed with what he was doing in 

</span><span>some instances, I support his opposition to government in the selling of government 

assets.    This  is  why I would like to  thank him because he was a person who placed 

priority    in  the  interests  of  the  landowners.    He  opposed  the  selling  of  assets  of 

government  and  I  would  lik</span><span>e  to  thank  him  although  I  don’t  thank  him  for  a  lot  of 

</span><span>controversial issues he supported. 

</span></div><div><span>I have been looking around to see what I could amend but I might be pulled up again 

</span><span>because  I  haven’t  written  it  down  and  given  it  to  you  Mr  Speaker.  Maybe  later  on 

</span><span>when we get into the Committee Stage- if we get into the Committee stage, maybe I 

will be able to bring in an amendment to put into affect that landowners should have 

the same powers as the Cook Islands Investment Corporation.   I would like to see that 

the  landowners  of  the  airport  of  Rarotonga  and  the  landowners  of  the  airport  of 

Aitutaki share those authorities now vested in the CIIIC.  If this is the amendment to 

</span><span>this Bill I will support it.  Those are my views Mr Speaker.  Because we haven’t got 

</span><span>enough time I would like my leader to speak as well.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  is  the  Honourable 

Minister Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I will take 5 minutes and I give the last 5 

minutes to the Leader of the Opposition before you terminate the debate on this Bill.  

</span><span>But  I  rise  to  support  the  principles  and  merits  of  the  Bill  before  us,  the  Airport 

</span><span>Authority Amendment Bill.  Listening to Members of the Opposition, they seem to be 

unwittingly  showing  us  their  ignorance  of  the  real  purpose  of  the  Cook  Islands 

Investment Corporation Act, which this House unanimously passed last year.  All that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 37</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2063 

</span></div><div><span>this  amendment  Bill  is  doing  is  to  bring  into  line  the  Cook  Islands  Investment 

Corporation Act  1998 with  the Airport Authority Act  1985 so that the provisions of 

the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act can be met.  Let me adjust in a nutshell, 

and try to tell you Honourable Members and our people listening in what the purpose 

of setting up the CIIC Act 1998 was all about.  

</span></div><div><span>Simply put it is to manage the assets of the Cook Islands Crown for the Government 

of the Cook Islands.  And so it is with the Airport Authority when this Amendment 

Bill passes this House.  The CIIC will take over on behalf of the Government of the 

Cook  I</span><span>slands  the  management  of  this  Crown  asset.    We’re  not  talking  about 

</span><span>ownership,  the  Crown  owns  the  airport  but  what  Government  has  expressed  before 

and is still of that view is that we would like the landowners to consider becoming the 

owner of the airport </span><span>in place of Government.  That’s what we were talking about.  Not 

</span><span>about the management. You have read in the newspaper a few weeks ago of a certain 

private  company  wanting  to  come  in  and  join  with  the  operations  with  the  local 

company for the management of </span><span>our airport.  That’s only to do with the management.  

Not the ownership.  I don’t like to sit in here and listen to Members who are accusing 

</span><span>the Prime Minister of being double tongue in his wish to give back the ownership to 

</span><span>the landowners.  I don’t know w</span><span>hether the landowners put forward some proposal to 

</span><span>the government, I’m not aware of it.  Don’t expect all the buildings and all the assets 

</span><span>that are now found on the airport to be just handed over to anybody whether they be 

the  landowners  or  not  for  nothing.    That  could  certainly  reflect  an  irresponsible 

Government.  So my last plead Mr Speaker to Honourable Members in the Opposition 

</span><span>is not to play politics with this important subject.  Don’t bring in the landowners for 

</span><span>your benefit to try and persuade the p</span><span>eople listening to say, “oh, they are a good lot of 

people. When they become Government they’re going to give the airport over to the 

landowners  etc  etc.”    That  is  singing  a  different  tune.  I  can  assure  you,  if  in  the 

</span><span>unlikely  event  that  they  become  Government  they  will  sing  a  different  tune.  Thank 

you Mr Speaker.</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker, I really do not have much time left.  

I  just  want  to  remind  the  Honourable  Minister  that  the  Sheraton  Hotel  which  is  the 

Vaimaanga Hotel today is back in the hands of the landowners.  The Government did 

not give it but it was taken over by the landowners because, you know the rest.  But it 

</span><span>didn’t cost the </span><span>landowners anything to get it back from them.  That is a prime example 

</span><span>of what the failure of this Government is like.  I don’t want to see the Airport or the 

</span><span>Port Authority or any other authority to go through the same thing.  What we raised 

here Mr Speaker is  a fact  of the matter that has happened under the management or 

rather the mismanagement of this Government.  When we are raising this issue here 

with my Honourable Members before me, there are reasons for that because we have 

seen the failures that this Government has done.  They wanted to sell these assets Mr 

Speaker.  This airport.  That was their first intention, and now they really are on that 

route Mr Speaker.  And it cost one Minister to lose his post as a Minister by objecting 

to that Mr Speake</span><span>r and I’m referring to the Honourable Dr Joseph Williams.  </span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>A Bill intituled, an Act to amend the Airport Authority 

Act 1985 to ensure consistency between its provisions and the provisions of the Cook 

Islands Investment Corporation Act 1998. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I will now resolve Parliament into the Committee of the Whole.
