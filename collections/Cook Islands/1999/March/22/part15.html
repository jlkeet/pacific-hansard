<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. JACK: </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 196 be suspended to the extent necessary for the Second 

and Third Readings of the Cook Islands Development Amendment Bill to be 

completed by no later than 4.00 p.m. today. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr T. Hewett 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>I rise again Mr Speaker to show my dissatisfaction to what 

is happening in this House.  This is what happens Mr Speaker when we leave things to 

</span><span>the last minute.  I’m not too worried because they have given us the time so we can 

</span><span>speak.  But we still do not have enough time to go through all the clauses.  This is why 

I rose.  To show my dissatisfaction Mr Speaker.  This is the first time I have seen the 

procedures  of  Parliament  bent  to  this  extent.    We  see  so  many  Bills  and  the  time 

</span><span>provided for each Bill is restricted.  And as far as I can tell, it doesn’t matter how hard 

</span><span>we trade, our people will still  not  be able to understand what is happening.  But we 

will try in the time that has been allotted to us to bring all the main issues out.  It is 

our place, our job Mr Speaker to try and explain issues to our people in order that we 

might be able to help our people understand these things better.  So we will listen to 

what the Minister responsible for this Bill has to say. 

</span></div><div><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 41</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2067 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Cook Islands Development Bank Amendment Bill be now  

Read a Second Time. 

</span></div><div><span>A brief explanation on the principles and merits of the Bill Mr Speaker.  I assure the 

Members  of  the  Opposition  that  I  will  not  take  much  time  of  the  time  available  to 

them for the debate of the principles and merits of this Bill.  Mr Speaker this is one of 

the  4  Bills  dealing  with  Statutory  Corporations.    The  proposed  amendment  to  the 

Cook  Islands  Development  Bank  Act  are  designed  to  align  this  Act  with  the  Cook 

Islands  Investment  Corporation  Act.    Under  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Act  the 

Board  of  the  Investment  Corporation  appoints  the  Directors  of  the  Cook  Islands 

Development  Bank  and  the  Cook  Islands  Development  is  a  subsidiary  of  the 

Investment  Corporation.    A  number  of  provisions  in  the  Cook  Islands  Development 

Bank  Act  are  added  or  removed  to  accommodate  this  change  and  in  particular  Mr 

Speaker: - 

</span></div><div><span>a) 

</span></div><div><span>b) 

</span></div><div><span>c) 

</span></div><div><span>d) 

</span></div><div><span>e) 

</span></div><div><span>f) 

</span></div><div><span>g) 

</span></div><div><span>the amendments provide for the appointment of directors and  

Chairman of the Bank by the Investment Corporation 

the Investment Corporation may give to the Bank general directions as 

to the management strategies to be followed by the Bank in the  

performance of the Ba</span><span>nk’s function</span><span>

the consent of the Board of the Investment Corporation is required for 

any increase in the share capital of the Bank 

to encumber of the shares of the bank requires the consent of the Board 

of the Corporation and to transfer any of the shares requires to  

procedure  laid  down  in  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Act 

to be followed 

it will no longer require the approval of the Minister responsible for the 

Cook Islands Development Bank for the Bank to lease, sublease or to 

develop any land or buildings 

the Bank will have the power to declare a dividend which is paid to the 

Investment Corporation in accordance with Banks statement of  

corporate intent 

</span><span>the Cook Islands Development Bank will be required to issue to the  

</span><span>Investment  Corporation  annually  a  statement  of  corporate  intend  for 

approval  by the Board of the Corporation.  Annual Report have to be 

filed and Fiscal Updates must be provided to the Investment  

Corporation 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the amending legislation does not completely remove the authority of the 

</span><span>Minister.    It  is  Government’s  view  that  the  Ministers  still  has  a  role  to  play.      This 

</span><span>amendment  provides  that  the  draft  statement  of  corporate  intent  must  be  sent  to  the 

</span><span>Bank  not  only  to  the  Investment  Corporation  but  to  the  Minister responsible for the 

</span><span>Cook Islands Development Bank as well.  The reason why it must also be delivered to 

the  Minister  is,  that  Minister  has  the  job  of  keeping  an  eye  on  the  Cook  Islands 

Development  Bank  to  make  sure  that  he  is  giving  effect  to  the  social  policies  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 42</a></div><div><span>2068 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Government  where  those  are  relevant  and  the  laws  allows.    With  the  consent  of 

Cabinet Mr Speaker the Minister may require the Cook Islands Development Bank to 

place a greater emphasis on Government Social Policy.   

</span></div><div><span>However  Mr  Speaker  where  this  occurs  the  cost  of  doing  so  is  to  be  identified  and 

either  deducted  from  the  dividend  government  receives  from  the  Investment 

Corporation  or  appropriated  by  Parliament.  In  this  way  Mr  Speaker,  the  cost  of 

Government policies will be clearly identified in a transparent way.  With those few 

words  explaining  the  principles  and  merits  of  the  Bill  on  those  couple  of  clauses,  I 

expect both sides of the House to give their strong support to the Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  Can I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. T. Hewett 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr T. Maoate.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  First of all, I would like to express 

my  appreciation  to  the Board of the Cook Islands Development  Bank as well as the 

Manager and staff of the Bank.   

</span></div><div><span>Over the years I have seen some of the weaknesses in regards to the performances of 

the Board as well as the Bank itself.  I expressed my satisfaction with the performance 

</span><span>of  the  Board  and  the  staff  today  because  there’s  been  a  big  improvement  but  I  still 

</span><span>think  there  is  plenty  of  room  for  more  improvement.  I  believe  that  what  the 

Government is doing by aligning the Cook Islands Development Bank Strategies and 

Management  to  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  is  totally  to  improve  the 

services  of  the  Bank  as  the  Statutory  Subsidiary  of  the  CIIC  for  the  services  to  our 

people.    With  regards  to  this  particular  clause  that  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has 

mentioned in terms of the shares of the Bank, an ordinary person in my view will have 

some difficulty of understanding it.  You have to sit beside an accountant or Banker to 

be able to follow what these different types of shares are.  Some of the clauses have 

been removed and they affect the public servants.  In my view, originally the idea was 

to assist these public servants when they work for the banks.  If I recall correctly Mr 

Speaker, the intention there was for the public servants to continue their contributions 

to the Superannuation Scheme.  I notice that this clause will be repealed.  What are the 

alternatives?  But my belief right from the start is that this was to assist these public 

servants so that they will not lose their superannuation contributions.  We have these 

consequential amendments in the clause 2, which I find will not be easily understood 

by  any  ordinary  person.    There  is  always  this  tone  of  conspiracy  between  these 

statutory corporate, which includes now the Cook Islands Development Bank, dealing 

with Government social policy.   

</span></div><div><span>I do realise Mr Speaker that the Cook Islands Development Bank is trying to extend 

its services to the Outer Islands and this idea is a good one.  I totally support it but I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 43</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2069 

</span></div><div><span>am not too sure whether the people in the Outer Islands are actually benefiting from 

this operation.  The Cook Islands Development Bank is supposed to be assisting our 

people in development projects.  But in reality Mr Speaker, it is a commercial bank.  

When  you  go  through  the  process  of  getting  a  loan  from  the  bank  for  whatever 

purpose, you will find that there is hardly any difference between the operations of a 

purely commercial bank and the CIDB.  But if anything is different Mr Speaker, it is 

the  difference  between  the  short  time  you  can  spend  with  the  Manager  or  a  Senior 

Officer  for  Commercial  Bank  and  the  Cook  Islands  Development  Bank.  In  the 

Commercial Banks I have been dealing with them for many years.  You will not spend 

that much time with them. You inquire and they </span><span>will give you either a straight  “ yes” 

or “no” in a short time and you are satisfied in most cases. Unfortunately, the history 

</span><span>of  the  Cook  Islands  Development  Bank  has  always  been  contrary  to  what  I  would 

expect from banks.   

</span></div><div><span>At times I’ve been told that</span><span> the Board was often known not to meet because one of the 

Board  Members  have  gone  somewhere  and  therefore  it  had  to  wait.    However,  all 

these years Mr Speaker, I noticed a big difference in the performance of the operations 

of the Cook Islands Development Bank.  I noticed when I go to the Bank that the staff 

</span><span>Members serves you well.  They make you welcome. I even noticed that senior staff 

</span><span>members spare their short time with clients and I see this as a big change from what I 

used  to  see  in  the  past.    But  what  is  the  Government  doing  for  the  bank?    Is  the 

government  rewarding  these  people?  In  my  view  when  Government  talks  about  its 

social policies and then siphon funds from statutory corporations, it makes me worry.  

Worried  because  I  expect  Government  to  be  reinvesting  in  the  businesses  first.    

When there is a revenue in excess of what they need for the normal day to day routine 

money  should  be  put  back  into  the  service,  back  into  the  operations  of  the  bank  to 

improve the services and the livelihood of the people working in there.  And not only 

that  Mr  Speaker.    The  huge  interest  should  be  reduced  to  assist  people  who  are 

borrowing the money.   And if the service to the Outer Islands is inadequate because 

of lack of funds, then that should be given out to that area.  Those are my concerns Mr 

Speaker.    I  feel  strongly  that  instead  of  Government  taking  off  the  cream  from  the 

work  of  the  banks  these  statutory  corporation  must  first  pour  it  back  into  their 

operations. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  am  also  aware  of  the  operations  of  the  Monetary  Board  and  the 

Development Investment Board.  These are areas where money is involved, banking is 

</span><span>involved.  Although we are going through 5 statutory bodies that are actually subject 

</span><span>and forms part of the CIIC Amendment Act, there are others not included such as the 

</span><span>Telecommunications.  Now this is a weird one Mr Speaker. I didn’t see any difference 

</span><span>between the Telecommunications company and the Te Aponga and all these other 5 

</span><span>statutory  authorities.    There’s  no  explanation  about  why  the Tel</span><span>ecommunication did 

not form part of the responsibilities of the CIIC.  Maybe because they have sold shares 

to  get  $3  million  to  pay  off  the  debt  for  the  Nauru  Loan.    However,  the  fact  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker is that there is a clause in TELECOM’s agreement that Governm</span><span>ent can buy 

</span><span>back those shares if they want to.  And that’s a shame because TELECOM should be a 

</span><span>part of this consequential amendment.  Then we will have a clear indication as to the 

</span><span>situation of all statutory bodies. That is why I said Mr Speaker its weird.  </span><span>There’s no 

</span><span>explanation  to  it  and  yet  it  is  one  of  the  more  prominent  statutory  authority  in 

Government.  There is nothing to stop this Government from doing the same with all 

</span></div><div><a>Page 44</a></div><div><span>2070 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the  other  authorities.    So  far  we  can  see  that  Telecommunication  is  one  of  those 

</span><span>excluded  and  the  question  is  what’s  next?    Those  are  my  comments  Mr  Speaker.  I 

</span><span>hope  that  the  achievements  by  the  Cook  Islands  Development  Bank  that  I  have 

observed will continue to progress. However, I strongly oppose this amendment that 

the revenue of the Cook Islands Development Bank will become a milking cow for the 

Government for its social services. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Dr R. Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker.  I would like to make a comment on the 

amendment  before  the  House  regarding  the  Cook  Islands  Development  Bank  being 

controlled  by  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation.  I  cannot  help  feeling  that 

there is some motive behind this move by Government to bring this independent body, 

</span><span>the CIDB under the control of the Government’s tax collectors.  Because, I feel this is 

what  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  is.  It  is  Government’s  means  of 

squeezing more money out of assets of this country.  I couldn’t help thinkin</span><span>g that the 

Cook  Islands  Investment  Coporation  has  become  the  coconut  extractor,  the  money 

extractor for Government.  Because if we look Mr Speaker at the idea of bringing the 

Cook Islands Development Bank in this country, it was really to help our people.  To 

help  our  people  to  make  loans  from  this  Bank  at  very  low  interest  rates  so  we  can 

develop this country. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact, if I’m correct Mr Speaker, Papa Arapati introduced the Development Bank in 

</span><span>our  country  for  the  sole  purpose  of  assisting  our  poor  people  to  get  onto  their  feet.  

And subsequent Governments have assisted this Bank to assist our people.  Perhaps if 

I explain to our people listening, the ADB lends the Cook Islands Government money 

at very low interest and it is then on lend to the Cook Islands Development Bank to 

lend  to  our  commercial  sectors.    The  difference  in  the  amount  of  interest  charge  is 

what  the  Cook  Islands  Government  will  derive  as income from  the use of the Cook 

Islands Development Bank.  If I am correct, the money is lent by the ADB to the Cook 

Islands Government at 2% and then the Government on lends to CIDB for about 7%.  

Therefore the Government is taking 5% out of this ADB money.  At the current rate of 

lending  the  CIDB  is  lending  out  at  an  interest  rate  of 14%.  Therefore, not  only the 

Cook Islands Government stands to gain some interest from this ADB money, but the 

</span><span>CIDB as well.  May I ask, where’s the assistance given by this Bank to the people?  

</span><span>The rate charged by the CIDB is no different from those charged by the commercial 

banks.  If there is any amendment to this Bill Mr Speaker, we should change the CIDB 

</span><span>to the Cook Islands Government Profit Making Bank.  Because that’s exactly what is 

</span><span>happening today.  There is no development here.  Development Mr Speaker is when 

we give our people low interest loans from such banks as the CIDB so they can get on 

with planting more vegetables, fishing, so that they can develop our country.  Like the 

</span><span>airport.   I don’t see where our people stand to gain one iota of benefit from this.  If 

</span><span>anything they would continue paying the high interest rates the CIDB currently charge.  

What  guarantees  do  our  people  have  that  there  would  be  any  further  increase  in  the 

rates the CIDB would charge our people?  Now that we have added yet another level 

of  administration  in  administering  the  ADB  Funded  CID  Bank?    Again  I  would 

question, do we not trust our people managing this Bank?  I know the people working 

in the Cook Islands Development Bank. They are very dedicated, they are concerned 

</span></div><div><a>Page 45</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2071 

</span></div><div><span>with the well being o</span><span>f our people, but they can’t help charging the high rates because 

</span><span>of  the  emphasis  on  the  CIDB  by  Government  to  charge  the  rate  they  are  charging.  

Everyone wants a bank for the development for our country that can keep the interest 

rates down, keep the cost of administering the bank down so that our people can enjoy 

lower rate of interest when they go and see the Cook Islands Development Bank.   

</span></div><div><span>The  way  I  see  it  Mr  Speaker,  Government  is  only  concerned  in  moving  the  money 

from the Development Bank to other areas instead of lending lower loan rates to our 

people.    What  is  more  confusing  Mr  Speaker  is  that  if  the  CIDB  was  appropriated 

</span><span>funds  each  year,  and  if  the  Government  doesn’t  deliver,  then  it  will  be  taken  as  a 

negative balance from CIDB. They don’t have</span><span> to pay Government.   

</span></div><div><span>Well, Mr Speaker I don’t see the benefit of bringing these changes at all, if anything, it 

</span><span>would  be  a  bigger  burden  onto  our  people,  because  of  the  cost  of  administration.  

Today  we  are  increasing  the  cost  of  administration  of  the  CIDB  Bank.    It  can  only 

mean one thing. high interest rates to the Cook Island people.  As such, the intent of 

the CIDB to help our people in industry, agriculture and fisheries have been lost.  For 

many many years, our people submitted their grievances to Government to assist them 

</span><span>receive development loan rather than a commercial loan, which demands extravagant 

</span><span>interest loans. 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  difficult  for  me  Mr  Speaker  to  support  the  amendment  required  in  this  Bill 

because I see this  as  further burden onto  the people of this country to  carry.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Before I call on a next speaker, I 

wish to inform the House that at 3.15 p.m. today I will cease the debate on this Bill.  

Our next speaker is the Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman,  Kia  Orana  to  you.  I  think  Mr  Speaker, 

that the staff is capable of running this Bank today without bringing in another group 

of people to administer this Bank.  

</span></div><div><span>My  leader  earlier  questioned  why  the  Telecommunication  is  not  included  in  any  of 

these amendments. I think this is the area that we should be looking into.  There is no 

telecommunication  service  to  the  island  of  Rakahanga  and  I  think  there  should be a 

committee  set  up  to  look  into  this  area.    We  are  quite  lucky  today  because  of  Mr 

</span><span>Stewart  Kingan’s  peacesat  assisting  my  people  in  Rakahanga.    I  have  seen  the 

</span><span>manager of Telecom and quite often, they told me that services would be installed the 

year after.  To date, nothing has been done to alleviate our problems.  I know the Cook 

Islands Development Bank has assisted a lot of people in the Northern Group.  I think 

</span><span>they have provided a lot of assistance’s to them.  I also believe our people are able to 

</span><span>manage the bank.  Why do we need some other people to come and manage this bank? 

By employing more people to oversee he work of the Bank, will that reduce our costs? 

If  it  will  decrease  the  interest  rates  then  I  will  give  my  support  this  Bill  but  if  the 

revenue of the Bank will be used to pay them, then I oppose this Bill. As the Member 

for  the  Island  of  Manihiki  pointed  out  to  us  earlier,  the  purpose  behind  this 

Development  bank  was  to  enable  our  people  to  have  access  to  low  interest  loan  for 

businesses and for housings. To enable them to have loans for housing.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 46</a></div><div><span>2072 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I know we are aware that there were significant problems in this bank in the past but 

today I believe and I think a lot of people feel that what the staff of the Cook Islands 

Development Bank are doing at the moment is good.  We can remember Mr Speaker 

the reports that have been presented to this House by the Cook Islands Development 

Bank.  Everything was done in accordance with the rules and regulations and we can 

see that there has not been any misappropriation of funds.   It is a different story with 

other  places  such  as  Government  departments,  Ministries  where  there  have  been 

instances of misappropriation of funds. However, with the Cook Islands Development 

Bank we can see that everything done by the staff of the bank are perfectly in harmony 

with their terms of operations.  So why would we need some other people to come and 

dictate to them?  As you can see, the staff that they have now is managing the Cook 

Islands Development Bank quite well.   

</span></div><div><span>As I also mentioned earlier maybe by getting this group of people, the Cook Islands 

Investment  Corporation  involved,  this  will  cause  an  increase  in  the  interest  rate.  

Those are my views on this Mr Speaker.  These people are managing the bank quite 

well.  I  think  the  people  that  need  to  be  investigated  or  assisted  is  the  Telecom.  

</span><span>Alternatively, the Housing Corporation where we lost tens of thousands of dollars or 

</span><span>maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars. I think the people managing the Cook 

Islands Development Bank should actually come along and take over the Cook Islands 

Investment  Corporation.    We  know  of  how  good  and  how  well  these  people  are 

</span><span>working. However, we don’t know how the CIIC will fair in this new arena.</span></div><div><span>We  can  see  that  one  of  their  mistakes  was  the  sale  of  the  Marine  Resources  Pearl 

Farm on the Island of Manihiki which was sold very very cheaply.  I know the people 

of  Rakahanga  submitted  a  tender  for  $70-80,000  but  this  was not  accepted.  What  I 

was  told  was  that  it  was  sold  to  the  President  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party  for 

$25,000.00.  The  Minister  of  Marine  Resources  has  told  us  the  other  day  that  it  was 

sold  to  the  President  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party.    These  things  were  not  conducted 

properly.  I  think  these  were  done  wrongly,  including  the  tendering  of  some  of  the 

</span><span>Ministry of Marine Resources’ </span><span>boats.  I would also like to question these people as to 

why they listened to  the advise of the Minister of Marine Resources when they sold 

the pearl farm. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Please come back to the Clause before us Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:  </span><span>I  was  talking  about  the  things  that  this  Cook  Islands  Investment 

</span><span>Corporation has been doing.  I don’t like what they have been doing.  This is why I am 

</span><span>complaining.    Because  there  are  also  other  things  that  are  being  sold  or  maybe  they 

were just being given away because its nearly that time again for election.   

</span></div><div><span>The Minister of Marine Resources said that he was also party to selling this farm - to 

</span><span>the President of the Cook Islands Party.  This is why I can’t support this Bill which we 

</span><span>are trying to enact because they will be over and above the staff of the Cook Islands 

Development Bank.  Those are my views and I oppose this Amendment Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

The Honourable Member Paora Teiti.

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you, Kia Orana to everyone this 

afternoon.  Kia Orana also to our people listening in this afternoon, Kia Orana in the 

name of our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  Mr  Speaker  to  give  my  support  to  this  Bill.  First,  I  would  like  to  thank  and 

congratulate all the staff of this Bank from the Managing Director to his staff.  This as 

far as I know, is  one of the most important bank that is trying to help our people in 

this country.  What they have been doing have been to help our people to come out of 

their shells so to speak.  Because our people have found it difficult in the past to deal 

with  banks  but  today  we  find  that  there  are  people  looking  after  different  areas.  

</span><span>There’s a person for Nikao, there’s a person looking after the interest of the pe</span><span>ople of 

</span><span>Arorangi and if you’re from Tupapa, there’s a person looking after the interest of the 

</span><span>people from Tupapa.  In the past, I have always felt quite scared to approach the Cook 

Islands Development Bank because I have not fully understood what they were doing.  

Now that I understand what is required. For example, although one might have already 

have a loan with them and you want to go for another loan, then just by approaching 

them they will help you.  They will always help you out.  So I would like to thank the 

person responsible for Nikao and Tereora because now whenever I go in I go to meet 

this person.  After talking to this person quite often I am now more comfortable with 

</span><span>what’s going on at the bank.</span></div><div><span>The question here that we have heard is  why are these people brought in to manage 

the bank and the criticisms that there will be more fees or more money required to pay 

them.  I think our biggest problem is the fact that there will be a papaa involved. We 

have  a  papaa  managing  or  being  involve  in  the  management  of  the  Airport,  Port 

</span><span>Authority and the Cook Islands Development and so on.  So I think really don’t think 

</span><span>we  should  be  worrying  about  it.  When  we  legislated  some  arrears  before,  the 

opposition complained about the Maori who will be employed.  Now, these Bills will 

affect the papaa. Yet the Democratic Party policy is people first.  Mr Speaker, this is 

what  the Cook Islands Party has been doing for a long time.  And we will maintain 

that policy. 

</span></div><div><span>The  important  thing  is  that  a  number  of  concerns  have  been  identified  in  the 

</span><span>operations  and  the  general  management  of  these  activities.  Government’s  policy  is 

</span><span>such that there are some areas that need to be ironed out including the Ports, Airport 

</span><span>and the Bank.  And this is why we are bringing this amendment in today.  What we 

</span><span>are saying here is that this corporation is not coming in to manage, they’re coming in 

</span><span>to  keep  an  eye  on  things.    We  know  from  the  amendment  Bill  that  we  passed  this 

morning, they are being given the chance to  suggest  things to  the authorities.  If we 

</span><span>look  at  this Bill  there’s very little difference.  The issue is for the authority of these 

</span><span>corporations  to  look  at  suggestions  given  to  them  by  the  Cook  Islands  Investment 

Corporation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Come back to the Bill Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  The  same  thing  will  happen  to  the  Development  Bank.  The 

Development Bank can look at the suggestions made by the Cook Islands Investment 

Corporation and it is up to the Development Bank to act on it or not.  The bank knows 

</span></div><div><a>Page 48</a></div><div><span>2074 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>how  the  bank  is  run  and  therefore  they  would  know  better  whether  the  suggestion 

made would work or not.   

</span></div><div><span>I  therefore  would  like  to  support  this  amendment  by  Government.    The  opposition 

however  is  indicating  that  we  do  not  really  understand  what  is  happening.    I  can 

remember  there  was a statement made once that government  has no money and this 

then Mr Speaker is why these amendments are being made. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  isn’t  Government  doing  this  for  us?    In  some  departments,  I  am 

</span><span>suggesting that there are people who are soliciting public properties but what we do 

not realise is that we the people are the ones who are damaging Government.    The 

bank  has  a  Board  with  their  own  staff  Members.  Then  we have the Bank with  their 

own staff members.  We also have the bank. In this Bills that w</span><span>e’re going through we 

</span><span>do not get rid of the Government, we do not get rid of the Minister.  It is telling us that 

in  some  cases  this  corporation  is  replacing  the  Minister.    As  we  have  heard  and 

discussed  earlier  the  Minister  is  not  being  removed  completely.    There  are  certain 

areas where the Minister is not required and that is what is being amended.  It is not 

because the Minister has too much to do or not enough to do.  The reason is because 

</span><span>we  are  delegating  responsibilities  to  different  people.      I  thin</span><span>k  I’ll  finish  here  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker so we can get enough time to go into the clauses.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    The  Honourable  Deputy  Prime 

Minister Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I got up to say a few words before we move into 

the  Committee  of  the  Whole  and  to  express  my  concern  on  views  expressed  by  the 

Honourable  Member  Pupuke  Robati.    His  view  sometimes  Mr  Speaker  has  a  strong 

flavour of racial discrimination. As a matter of fact he has been like that throughout 

the day. He appears to be very much against non Cook Islanders and I am afraid that is 

not the kind of view that we should entertain in this House.  He alleged that the Cook 

Islands Investment Board sold the assets in Manihiki; sold by the Minister of Marine 

Resources to the President of the Cook Islands Party.  Again, another twisted opinion 

to twist the facts after all the explanations given by the Minister of Marine Resources 

</span><span>in  this  House.    He’s  got  the  cheek  to  get  up  and  twist  all  those  facts</span><span>.    The  Chief 

Administration Officer of the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Mr Speaker spoke 

to  Dr Robati and explained to  him in  full why the Rakahanga Island Council tender 

was not accepted.  He explained it to Dr Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Point of Order.  I never spoke to him. Come on, correct yourself. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>    The  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  and  the  Cabinet 

have  very  good  reason  in  not  granting  the  pearl  farm  that  was  run  by  the  Marine 

Resources  in  Manihiki  to  the  Rakahanga  Island  Council.    The  Rakahanga  Island 

</span><span>Council  is  another  public  body.    We  can’t  sell  this  asset  from  a  public  body  that  is 

</span><span>managed by the Marine Resources to another public body.  It defeats the purpose of 

</span><span>Government  policy  that  public  bodies  or  organisations  should  not  be  involved  in 

</span><span>businesses. It should be the private that we want to promote the business sector, not 

the public bodies.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 49</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2075 

</span></div><div><span>In  fact,  Mr  Speaker,  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  never  received  any 

instructions from the Minister of Marine Resources, the Honourable Tepure Tapaitau 

as to whom they should sell the pearl farm to.  We all know, because the Minister of 

Marine Resources told this House and the public that he has no part in the selling of 

the  farm.    That  is  the  decision  of  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  and 

recommend  to  Cabinet.    The  private  company  owned  by  the  CIP  President,  Henry 

Puna, who is also the President of the Cook Islands Party, has made a very good offer.  

His  offer  was  next  to  that  of  the Island Council of Rakahanga.  However, the Cook 

Islands  Investment  Corporation  supported  his  offer  Mr  Speaker  because  it  complies 

with the policies of Government and the Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  That 

is we are supposed to promote private companies, not public companies.  In addition, 

on the strength of those policies Mr Speaker, the Cook Islands Investment Corporation 

strongly advised Cabinet along those lines.  We have decided to support that, to make 

sure  that  we  continue  and  work  along  those  policies  that  we  have  made  publicly.  

Instead  of  Government  bodies  holding  onto  any  crown  assets,  we  should  give  those 

assets to promote private companies to improve their operation of businesses.   And 

according to my information Mr Speaker, all these were explained to the Honourable 

</span><span>Member Dr Pupuke Robati.  But as usual, because he wasn’t successful he will always 

</span><span>run down and complain about the facts.  And of course, on top of that we know that 

</span><span>they don’t have the money that they were talking about.  They just want to try and foo</span><span>l 

</span><span>us and make us believe that they have the money.  And that’s my view.  I only want to 

</span><span>explain  the  unfair  allegations  that  was  said,  submitted  to  this  House  by  the 

Honourable  Pupuke  Robati,  in  that  the  Honourable  Minister  Tepure  Tapaitau  was 

involved in the deciding as to who should get the pearl farm. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I will interrupt you Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>A  Bill  intituled:  An  Act  to  amend  the  Cook  Islands 

Development  Bank  Act  1978  and  ensure  consistency  between  its  provisions and the 

provisions of the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act 1998. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I will now resolve Parliament into the Committee of the Whole.
