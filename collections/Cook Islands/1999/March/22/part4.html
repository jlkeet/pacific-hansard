<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Cook Islands Investment Corporation (Amendment) Bill: Motion on Second Reading: 

Interrupted Debate on adjournment of Second Reading.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Nobody has explained this Bill that we are amending. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to you Mr Speaker.  I rise to explain the amendment in this Bill. That is the 

</span><span>Minister’s responsibility but the Minister is saying that he has done that last Friday.  </span></div><div><span>We  know  Mr  Speaker  that  the  principal  Act  was  completed  in  1998.   However, the 

question is  why is  it necessary to create this body to carry out these responsibilities.  

Obviously experts have looked into this matter and feel that Government is not able to 

carry out their responsibilities, hence the Amendment before the House.   Government 

also knows that the landowners of the Airport are angry. Government is very uneasy.  

Therefore, they created this authority. This body will then be responsible for making 

decisions, even to the extent of selling this property. 

</span></div><div><span>In  terms  of  the  Airport,  I  know  that  Tinomana  is  angry.    The  landowners  are  angry 

because the Airport was proposed for sale to  foreigners.  The Ui Ariki of Te-Au-O-

Tonga  was  also  angry.    The  Ngati  Makea  did  not  like  what  was  happening.    Now 

Government  is  dodging  its  responsibility  and  requiring  instead  the  Corporation  to 

make  those  decisions.    The  Government  is  aware  that  it  needs  to  form  a  body  of 

business  minded  people  because  such  a  class  of  people  will  not  be  bothered  with 

trivial matters.  Their objective is to ensure the success of the business.  In most cases 

they  will  not  concern  themselves  with  moral  issues.    I  believe  that  this  is 

</span><span>Government’s  aim  for  creating  this  body.    This  is  no  longer  their  concern.    A  body 

</span><span>such  as  this  Corporation  can  handle  these  public  businesses.    I  am  glad  to  say  that 

while  this  Corporation  may  be  heavy-handed  the  landowners  were  not  scared  at  all.  

They want to oppose the move to sell this property to foreigners.  Likewise the Port 

Authority.  The respective landowners of the Port are also concerned.  This includes 

the landowners of the Aitutaki Airport. 

</span></div><div><span>The  landowners  of  Aitutaki  got  together  and  formed  an  organisation  for  them  to 

counter  any  move  by  the  Corporation  against  them.    The  formation  of  this  body 

derived from a report by the ADAB. It was also concerned about the undertakings of 

Government.  We seem to be geared for astronomical projects and high costs of living 

rather  than  controlling  the mass debts  of our country.  These are the symptoms  of a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2031 

</span></div><div><span>damaged economy.  Because of the impact of a dwindling economy, it affected even 

the  lives  of  our  people.    If  the  Leaders  of  this  country  could  only  administer  our 

country  properly,  then  nothing  of  this  kind  will  happen.    Instead,  Government 

indulged  in  huge  borrowing  and  submerged  our  country  into  the  worst  financial 

quagmire ever experienced by our people. That is why we have appointed the CIIC, to 

resolve this debt.   

</span></div><div><span>Now, we have this Bill to make our people happy.  Our people are not dumb, don’t try 

to fool our people.   Don’t think that we can do anything.  No way, our people know 

</span><span>what  is  happening.  I  feel  sorry  for  our  people.  Time  is  rough.    I  rise  to  express  my 

disappointments.    Now  Government  is  attempting  to  dodge  its  responsibility  by 

passing  it  over  to  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation.  Inadvertently,  I  think 

some  rights  should  be  vested  in  the  Outer  Islands  Local  Government.      I  recall  an 

incident  on  the  island  of  Aitutaki,  with  regards  to  the  Packing  Shed  on  the  wharf.  

This  building  has  been  renovated  and  the  Island  Council  believes  that  they  are 

responsible for this property now.  Mr Chairman, in the workshop held for the Mayors 

of the Outer Islands, they were told that they will be given the right and the powers to 

do as they think fit for the islands.  Sadly Mr Speaker the Island Councils tried to take 

</span><span>over the Packing Shed but the whole issue is taken to Court and the Court threw out 

</span><span>the  case  that  was  presented  by  the  Island  Council.      The  Deputy  Prime  Minister  is 

saying  that  those  Councillors  are  stupid.  This  is  sad  because  it  was  his  Government 

that  told  the  Island  Councillors  that  you  could  do  what  you  want  in  order  to  better 

your  islands.  Unfortunately,  they  were  taken  to  Court  and  embarrassed  in  Court 

because the CIIC did not give them any rights.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is what the Island Councils wanted, but the Government did  not do 

their part.  As we can see they have been sitting on their behinds all this time, while 

the Island Councils on the Outer Islands have been toiling away for quite a while but 

this  Government  has  not  been  doing  anything.    This  is  why  now  that  we  are 

encountered with this problem.   They know that the Mayors are holding a forum in 

Atiu soon. They want this Bill to be passed before that.   I think the timing is bad Mr 

Speaker, because the Island Councils are very upset.  We need to help our Mayor in 

the Outer Islands because they want to be able to develop their islands to benefit our 

people.  I want us to be able to make laws that our people can live with.  Not just for 

us to make laws just for the sake of making them.   I think the Government has heard 

what our people want.   They know our people are angry, and I am glad that they are 

</span><span>awakening to the kind of administration adopted by this Government.  While this Bill 

</span><span>is  telling  us  that  Cabinet  can  also  keep  an  eye  on  the  operations  of  the  CIIC,  I  also 

think that Cabinet can  keep things under lid. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  Mr  Speaker,  to  inform  the  landowners  of  the  Airport  on  Rarotonga, 

landowners  on  the  Airport  on  Aitutaki,  and  the  landowners  of  the  Ports,  that  what 

must  take  place  must  receive  their  endorsements.    It  must  not  be  dictated  by  CIIC.   

There  are  some  cases  Mr  Speaker,  where  the  lands  should  be  given  back  to  the 

landowners  and  there  are  some  cases  where  the  lands  stay  with  Government.  

</span><span>However, Government should look into rewarding the landowners a lot better.  

</span></div><div><span>Let  us  look  at  the Sheraton  Hotel.   This  was a public asset but  Government  has not 

been able to do anything right about it up to this today. The only thing they have been 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>2032 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>able to do is to increase the amount owing to this Project. And what we see happening 

is that the land has been taken back. It was taken back by the landowner by virtue of a 

Court decision.  It did not take the landowners more than 10 years to find a developer 

</span><span>for this Project. Therefore, I don’t want this Government to claim credit for that. Thi</span><span>s 

is  a  prime  example  of  how  ignorant  this  Government  can  be.  They  just  cannot  get 

things right. The only expertise they have is to put this country into debt.  

</span></div><div><span>This  is  why  I  am  sad  that  if  there  are  lands  that  Government  is  not  using  or  not 

improving, then I think these lands should be given back to the landowners.  Maybe 

the landowners can improve these lands or develop them.  For example Mr Speaker, I 

would  like  to  look  at  the  Research  Station  in  Totokoitu.  This  Government  or  the 

Minister has not been able to negotiate with the landowners to extend the lease on this 

land for the Research Station. They have no regard as to whether the Agriculture is an 

important component in the development of this country.   Today a lot of the plants or 

trees  that  have  been  seeded,  transferred  and  planted  on  this  land  in  order  for  the 

Researchers to carry out their research, have died for lack of maintenance. 

</span></div><div><span>How can we say we want to revive agriculture in our country and yet our leaders in 

</span><span>Government are showing us they do not want to do this. This is what I can see. This 

</span><span>Government propagated this situation and we now see the symptoms.  We believe that 

they  prefer  to  criticise  the  travels  we  took  twenty  years  ago.  Yet,  today  we  can  see 

they are taking these same trips but the difference is that there is no money.  These are 

the things that sadden me.   

</span></div><div><span>I  saw  a  report  in  December  regarding  taxes  that  have  been  collected  and  it  is  way 

down. This is a sad situation. This confirms our country has not been turned around as 

they  boasted.  This  is  why  I  rose  to  show  my  dissatisfaction  with  what  has  been 

happening but I can also see there are sections in this Bill that will be of benefit to our 

people in the outer islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Speaker last year the Minister of Outer Island Development said 

there  would  be  one  more  amendment  to  this  Act.  It  would  give  power  to  the  outer 

island local governments to take over the assets of Government, such as Crown lands.  

The Mayors of the outer islands were also told they would be given the authority over 

any  Crown  lands.  This  amendment  before  us  does  not  go  along  with  what  was 

explained by the Honourable Minister and is not in line with what he told the Mayors 

of  the  outer  islands.    What  this  amendment  is  doing  is  giving  all  the  power  to  the 

Cook Islands Investment Corporation. We see that their power is nearly the same as 

that of Cabinet. I see in some areas the Minister is removed and his powers transferred 

to the Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  This is an area I am not very happy with 

and I would like to ask why the Minister is deprived of these responsibilities and why 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2033 

</span></div><div><span>these are transferred to the Cook Islands Investment Corporation? Why do they have 

</span><span>almost the same powers as Cabinet?  Shouldn’t these decisions be made by Caucus, a 

</span><span>committee or even  by us the elected representatives of our people?  

</span></div><div><span>The  Island  Councils  are  elected  representatives  of  the  people.    The  Cook  Islands 

Investment Corporation is not the representatives of our people. Cabinet has put them 

in place. Who are they?  Who elected them? Our people did not elect them. How is it 

that the local governments of the outer islands the Mayors and the Island Councillors 

have to  bow down before the Cook Islands Investment  Corporation and beg to have 

the power to do something? If the Cook Islands Investment Corporation allows them it 

is  O.K.  but  if  not,  then  the  Island  Council  loses  out.    I  would  be  happier  if  the 

responsibility stayed with Cabinet. Or the responsibility be given to a committee that 

comprises of Members of Parliament.  I would be a lot happier if the chairman of that 

committee is a Member of the Government side because at least we will have people 

who have been elected by the people of the country and not  a committee elected by 

Cabinet.  I do not know exactly who these people are on this board but they are people 

who do not know our Maori way of life.  This is why I would be a lot happier if the 

responsibility  is  with  Cabinet.  I  am  certain  that  with  Cabinet  their  intentions  and 

</span><span>principles, the spirit behind the decision making would be for our people because they 

</span><span>are  elected  by  the  people.    Or  if  it  would  be  a  committee  and  the  chairman  is  a 

Government Member I would be a lot happier, rather than having a committee elected 

by  Cabinet  which has nearly the same powers as that of Cabinet.  I can see that the 

Cook Islands Investment Corporation is replacing the powers of the Minister.  This is 

why  I  am  afraid  because  the  power  is  being given to  people other than Members of 

Cabinet. 

</span></div><div><span>Also  we  have  heard  in  this  House  mention  of  the  large  amounts  of  money spent  on 

these people.  I would be a lot happier if a Member of Government was put in charge 

and not somebody else.  I am very worried about this power given to a separate group 

</span><span>of  people  and  we  do  not  even  know whether our people’s need will be a priority to 

</span><span>them.  I would rather that the money spent on these people be diverted to our people 

and the Investment Corporation Board be disbanded, and a committee of Members of 

Parliament  set  up  to  do  the  work  that  is  set  out  to  be  done  by  the  Cook  Islands 

Investment  Corporation.  Otherwise give it back to Cabinet.  I believe this is  one of 

those areas that should be taken care of by Cabinet but what has happened is Cabinet 

is getting somebody else to do their work.   

</span></div><div><span>So what is Cabinet going to be doing?  Cabinet will sit around with nothing to do and 

pay other people to  do what  was  expected of them to  do.  I think this responsibility 

should stay with the Cabinet.  Or if Cabinet thinks that they have too much to do they 

should  give  the  responsibility  to  a  Member  of  Government  and  the  Member  of 

Government  will  form  a  committee  from  Members  of  Parliament.    At  least  the 

responsibility  will  be  with  Members  of  Government.    Those  are  my  views  and  I 

strongly oppose this amendment Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Mama Mau Munokoa.  But  before I call upon the Honourable 

Member, I wish to inform this House that I will cease the debate on the Bill at 10 past 

10 this morning.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>2034 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Member, Ngamau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Mr  Speaker,  to  your  staff,  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to 

Cabinet Ministers and to all Members in this House this morning  - Kia Orana to you 

all.  Kia Orana also to our people listening in to the radio this morning. 

</span></div><div><span>I rose, Mr Speaker, because I don’t like what we are discussing.  As highlighte</span><span>d by my 

Leader  and  colleague  earlier  on,  I  will  not  go  too  far  into  this  subject  as  they  have 

covered  most  of  it.    These  members  of  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation,  I 

believe    has  given  them  a  lot  of  powers  and  I  also  believe  that  these  people on this 

Board are business people.   

</span></div><div><span>I am also a landowner of the Airport.  As pointed out to us, the landowners are Ngati 

Makea,  Ngati  Karika  and  Tinomana  in  Arorangi.  The  two  Ariki  on  this  Airport  are 

</span><span>Makea and Karika. There are other landowners that don’t </span><span>own very much but they are 

still landowners.  In total there are 43 landowners on our Airport today. We talked to a 

staff Member of CIIC, Mr Speaker and I know what he told us and we know that the 

</span><span>Airport was warranted.  Aitutaki’s Airport was leased.  So </span><span>I can see that these people 

have  a  lot  of  powers  if  we  pass  what  we  are  discussing  today.  Most  Members  of 

Parliament  in  this  House  are  not  landowners,  but  the  landowners  can  see  that  these 

people can take this Airport and do what they want with it. 

</span></div><div><span>If only Members in Government did what the people elected them to do and that is to 

run  this  country.    In  the  past  any  Government  that  came  in  ran  the  country.  Large 

amount  of  money  is  now  paid  to  these  people  on  this  Board.    So  I  cannot  support  

giving  the  rights,  the  powers,  to  these  people.  I  will  end  here,  Mr  Speaker,  because 

most  of  what  I  would  like  to  say  has  been  covered  by  my  two  colleagues  and  I  see 

there is only five minutes left so I will give that speaking time to somebody else. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I would just like to make use of this 

last few minutes before we end the debate on this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to  give my support to  the Amendment Bill before the House and I would also 

like  to  remind  the  Honourable  Dr  Pupuke  Robati  that  what  the  Minister  of  Outer 

Islands Development said last year is being carried out in Clause 7 of this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like the Honourable Member and his Leader to know that no Government in 

the  past  bothered  to  look  after  any  Government  assets.    Even  when  they  were  in 

Government  for  ten  years,  nobody  bothered  to  look  after  these  assets.  The 

Government of the day was worried that there were so many assets of Government to 

look after. What Government planned to do then was to set up a group of people and 

</span><span>their sole purpose would be to look after those assets of the Crown.  There have been 

</span><span>a lot of instances in the past where Crown assets have been abused and misused and 

used for political  gain.   There have been a lot of things over the years, Mr Speaker, 

such  as  Government  houses,  the  ports  in  the  country,  the  airports,  the  assets  in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2035 

</span></div><div><span>departments that have not been taken care of.  These are now the responsibility of this 

Board and now we see that they are being taken care of. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, our people and Government can see that we can actually make some money 

from  the  assets  that  we  have  because  these  assets  are  being  administered  properly.  

Today  we  have  business  people  with  business  minds  to  look  after  these  assets.  

Government  has  removed  politicians  away  from  managing  the  assets  of  the  country 

and  given  it  to  people  with  business  minds  and  therefore  we  see  there  is  an 

improvement. 

</span></div><div><span>I would li</span><span>ke to give Government’s thanks to the Cook Islands Investment Corporation 

</span><span>Board who for the first time in this country are doing a good job. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> May I interrupt the Deputy Prime Minister.  Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-ASSISTANT:</span><span> A Bill Intituled an Act to amend the Cook Islands Investment 

Corporation Act 1998
