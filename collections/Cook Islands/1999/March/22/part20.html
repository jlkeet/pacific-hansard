</span></div><div><a>Page 53</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2079 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. JACK:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Second and Third Readings of Te Aponga Uira o Tumu-te-Varovaro 

Amendment Bill be completed by no later than 7.30p.m. tonight.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Leader of the House.  May I call for Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Member U. Matata 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. When I go to Palmerston Island I’m gonna 

</span><span>tell  the  Palmerston  people  to  vote  the  Leader  of  the  House  out  for  bringing  in  this 

stupid  motion  into  the  House.    So,  you  better  watch out  my friend.  You have been 

doing this kind </span><span>of thing too much today and during the last fews days.  I’m going to 

</span><span>tell the Palmerston people to throw you out.  I thought I was going campaign against 

</span><span>the party, but I’m going to campaign only against you.  I’m going to campaign against 

</span><span>you, only one - you.  So we hear again Mr Speaker about these terrible motions that 

the Leader of the House is moving.   

</span></div><div><span>Anyway,  Mr  Speaker,  we  can’t  do  much  about  it.  I  am  only  standing  to  show  my 

</span><span>concern, my disappointments, my anger with this Leader of the House.  Actually, there 

are quite a few amendments  in  this Amendment Bill.   Even though there are only 2 

clauses  but  the  schedules  -  look  at  this  Mr  Speaker.    One  of  the  pages  on  my 

amendment bill is turned upside down.  It does show you how they rush these things 

into the House.  The page is turned upside down.  This is only one of those things Mr 

Speaker  which  reflect  the  type  of  work  from  this  Government.  I  can  predict  Mr 

Speaker that when we become Government next July, we will be going through some 

anomalies in these Bills because of this business of rushing work through Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>I can hear them objecting to my comments.  Too bad.  So I just want to indicate my 

</span><span>concern  and  I’m  not  happy.  I’m  still  not  happy  and  I  will  not  be  happy  until  this 

</span><span>Parliament  is  finished.    I  call  this  un-parliamentary.    This  is  really  deceiving  our 

</span><span>people  their  right  to  know  exactly  what  all  these  amendments  are.   Today we heard 

that  there  would  be  two  more  Bills  to  come  before  this  House.  Government  is  only 

concerned  in  receiving  t</span><span>he  Assents  from  the  Queen’s  Representative  on  these  Bills. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 54</a></div><div><span>2080 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Nothing else, no formal debate, no caucus debate, its going to be passed in this House, 

</span><span>rubber  stamped  and  of  course  the  Queen’s  Representative  will  have  no  difficulty  in 

</span><span>assenting these bad Bills.  So I will sit down so that I can have some of that time from 

now until 7.30 to debate on the Bill.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Te Aponga Uira o Tumu-te-Varovaro Amendment Bill 

be now Read a Second Time 

</span></div><div><span>Speaking briefly to the principles and merits of the Bill Mr Speaker, this Clause is the 

last of 4 Bills dealing with Statutory Corporations.  The proposed amendment to the 

Te Aponga Uira o Tumu-te-Varovaro Act is designed to align this Act with the Cook 

Islands Investment Corporation Act.  Under the Cook Islands Investment Corporation 

Act Mr Speaker the Board of the Investment Corporation appoints the Directors of the 

Te  Aponga  Uira  and  this  authority,  a  subsidiary  of  the  Investment  Corporation.    A 

number  of  provisions  in  the  Aponga  Uira  o  Tumu-te-Varovaro  Act  are  added  or 

moved to accommodate this change, in particular: 

</span></div><div><span>a) 

</span></div><div><span>b) 

</span></div><div><span>c) 

</span></div><div><span>d) 

</span></div><div><span>e) 

</span></div><div><span>f) 

</span></div><div><span>g) 

</span></div><div><span>h) 

</span></div><div><span>the  amendment  provides  for  the  appointment  of  the  Directors  and  the 

determination of their remuneration by the Investment Corporation 

the  amendment  removes  the  right  of  Minister  of  Energy  to  attend  Board 

Meetings 

the  employment  of  consultant  by  the Aponga Uira will no longer require the 

approval of the Minister of Energy 

tariffs and Schedules are no longer restricted by the guidelines issued by  

Minister of Energy 

the requirements  of gaining Cabinet approval for the Aponga Uira to acquire 

or to dispose any interest in lands is removed 

the Investment Corporation may give to the Te Aponga Uira general direction 

as  to  the  management  strategies  to  be  followed  by  the  authority  in  the 

</span><span>performances of the authority’s functions</span><span>

Te Aponga Uira will have the power to declare a dividend, which is paid to the 

</span><span>Investment  Corporation  in  accordance  with  the  authority’s  statement  of 

</span><span>corporate intent 

Te  Aponga  Uira  will  be  required  to  issue  to  the  Investment  Corporation 

annually  a  statement  of  corporate  intent  for  approval  by  the  Board  of  the 

Investment Corporation Annual Report to be filed and Fiscal Update must be 

provided to the Investment Corporation. 

</span></div><div><span>the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 55</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2081 

</span></div><div><span>Once  again  Mr  Speaker,  the  amending  legislation  does  not  completely  remove  the 

</span><span>authority of the Minister of Energy.  It is government’s view that the Minister still has 

</span><span>a role to play.  This amendment Mr Speaker provides that Te Aponga Uira must send 

the draft statement of corporate intent, not only to the Investment Corporation but to 

the Minister of Energy as well.  The reason Mr Speaker why it must also be delivered 

to  the  Minister  of  Energy  is  that  the  Minister  has  the  job  of  keeping  an  eye  on  Te 

Aponga Uira to make sure that it is giving effect to the social policies of Government 

where  those  are  relevant  and  the  laws  allow.    With  the  concurrence  of  Cabinet,  the 

Minister may require Te Aponga Uira to  place greater emphasis  on the Government 

Social Policies.  However Mr Speaker where this occurs the cost of doing so is to be 

identified  and  deducted  from  the  dividend  that  government  either  receives  from  the 

Investment Corporation or appropriated by this Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>In this way Mr Speaker the cost of Government Policies will be clearly identified in a 

transparent  way.      With  that  brief  explanation  Mr  Speaker,  I  hope  the  Members  on 

both sides of the House will have some idea as to the principles and merits of the Bill 

</span><span>and the Bill before the House only have 3 clauses.  I’m of the view that we can tackle 

</span><span>this Bill before 7.30 p.m. tonight.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  May  I  call  for  a  Seconder 

please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Member U. Matata 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Mama Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. MUNOKOA: </span><span>Mr Speaker and to all of us here this evening, Kia Orana.  I rise 

to present my views.  We have heard the brief summary from the Minister responsible 

and maybe what he was trying to explain is fair enough to the people.  But my mind is 

still drawn to the Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  I understand the Aponga Uira 

</span><span>has its own Board like that of the Airport Authority, Port Authority and so on.  It’s not 

</span><span>because the Papaa on this Board is creating us any concern; but what I can see is that 

there are so many chiefs but no Indians.   Before, everything was running well.  The 

people from the Aponga Uira carried out their responsibilities but nowadays we have 

created  positions  and  made  appointments  to  put  in  people  on  various  positions  on 

Boards.    But  nevertheless  whatever  we  say  or  however  we  scream  and  object,  the 

matter will still go through this House as the Minister has recommended.   

</span></div><div><span>My other concern is the indiscriminate chopping by Te Aponga Uira of over-hanging 

</span><span>branches on cables.  I don’t want anything </span><span>to happen as experienced when the Airport 

</span><span>Authority trimmed the trees affecting the airstrip.  They went onto people’s properties 

</span><span>without even consulting the owners.  If Te Aponga is going to do some tree trimming, 

let the landowners know. Let them be aware that you are there to do the job.  In my 

own constituency in Nikao, when I work to help my people I always make sure that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 56</a></div><div><span>2082 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the  hanging  branches  over  the  cables  are  cleared.    So  I  would  like  to  encourage 

Members  in  Parliament  to  consider  my  opinion.  There  are  quite  a  few of us here in 

Opposition  but  we  can  always  contribute  to  this  Bill.    That  is  all  I  have  to  say  Mr 

Speaker, Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mama  Mau.    Our  next  speaker  is  the  Honourable 

Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Good  evening  to  you  and  also  to  your 

staff.    Good  evening  to  our  people  listening  in  this  evening.    Kia  Orana  to  those 

Mayors who have arrived in Rarotonga and travelled on to Atiu, Kia Orana to you all.  

I  believe  your  Forum  will  go  on  ahead  with  the  opening  tomorrow  and  I  wish  you 

people  good  luck.    I  have  no  doubt  there  will  be  2  or  3  Ministers  coming  over  to 

explain to you people the activities Government is going to implement regarding the 

devolution.  I encourage and give you my support in your forum.  Now, I come back to 

the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the amendment Bill has been briefed by the Deputy Prime Minister as to 

what  changes  there  have  been  in  this  Bill  and  I  would  just  like  to  make  a  short 

comment  on  some  of  the  clauses  mentioned.  The  amendment  talks  about  the 

appointment of Directors and a Manager. I have no idea Mr Speaker who the Directors 

</span><span>are  today  with  regard  to  the  Aponga  Uira,  I  don’t even know who their manager is.  

</span><span>Whoever they are, I believe they are doing a good job and I hope that they are taking 

care of the interests of the working people and that is the little people that are working 

for  this  Aponga  Uira</span><span>.        </span><span>Because  I  don’t  want  to  hear  any  criticism  like  our  people 

</span><span>have  been  expressing  on  the  very  high  salaries  of  the  manager  for  the  Cook  Islands 

Investment Corporation.  People are expressing their concerns not only in this House 

but also in the media about the very high remuneration packages that the manager of 

the Cook Islands Investment Corporation is been given.   

</span></div><div><span>Before, it is Cabinet that approves the salaries and wages of directors and managers.  

Today, this amendment indicates that it is the Board that appoints a Manager. It is the 

Board that approves the salaries and wages for these people. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I am hoping that they will not - because of the independence of these positions.   

I am hoping that they will not be in a position to pay out or to set up salaries in such 

an  extravagant  manner.  Unlike  what  has  been  given  to  the  manager  of  the  Cook 

Islands Investment Corporation. Instead to provide a salary relative to other employees 

</span><span>either in  the private sector or in  Government  departments.  I just don’t want to hear 

</span><span>any  more  of  these  stories  about  a  person  employed  by  the  CIIC  having  a  very  large 

salary  and  on  top  of  that,  have  certain  perks  or  allowances.    And  I  do  hope  that 

members  of  the  Board  to  be  elected  are  people  who  are  capable  in  making  good 

decisions for the benefit of the service to the public. And if they should have a surplus 

at the end of the year, I will strongly urge them, strongly ask them to put that back into 

the service.  Actually, before the set up was made, the Act passed for the Cook Islands 

</span><span>Investment  Corporation  to  take  over  all  these  other  statutory  bodies  corporation and 

</span><span>the Aponga Amendment Bill brought into the House provided for Government to take 

any surplus from the revenue of the Aponga for social services.  But now, of course, 

we have the Amendments that has come to the House to bring all these other statutory 

</span></div><div><a>Page 57</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2083 

</span></div><div><span>bodies including the Aponga Uira to be one of those statutory corporations under the 

Cook Islands Investment Corporations.  What I am really saying Mr Speaker here is 

that I would like the manager, I would like the Board of Directors to make sure that 

their first priority is to serve the people through the services of the Aponga Uira.   

</span></div><div><span>There are people in this country Mr Speaker who are having difficulty in paying their 

power bills because of the high rate that is being charged to consumers in this country. 

And we know that there is an Act that has been passed to assist the pensioners for the 

payment of their power bill.  The reason for that is because they cannot afford the high 

rates that they are paying, even though sometimes it only require one or two lights in 

the houses.  The point here is  that the consumption rate, the rate per unit is  so high 

that even if they use so small consumption they still find it difficult to pay the bills.    

However,  there  is  an  assistance  to  our  old  pensioners  as  far  as  the  consumption  of 

electricity  on  Rarotonga  is  concerned.      I  know  the  Outer  Islands  are  not  benefiting 

from this assistance to pensioners.   

</span></div><div><span>There  are  certain  things  Mr  Speaker  that  our  people  are  grieving,  and  one  of  the 

common complaints by our people is the charge of $5 for reading their meters.  There 

</span><span>are people who are saying that sometimes it is almost more to pay the $5 than to pay 

</span><span>the  consumption  rate  that  has  been  charged  for  the  use  of  the  electricity.    And  in 

certain  circumstances  like  accommodation  where  people  have  6  reading  meters,  $5 

will be charge for each one of those meters. 

</span></div><div><span>This is something you know Mr Speaker that you can’t imagine. Because one man is 

just reading the meters just next to each other six times or maybe 8 times.  That’s 8x 5 

</span><span>= $40.00 Surely Mr Speaker some common sense can be put into that.  These are the 

things  that  our  people  are  complaining.    They  said,  hey!  we  pay  these  ridiculous 

</span><span>charges.  There’s got to be something better than that.  Thank you Mr Speaker.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The  Honourable  Minister  of  Education  Ngereteina 

</span><span>Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I rise Mr Speaker to give my support to 

the  Second  R</span><span>eading  of  the  Bill.    I  don’t  really  believe  that  we  will  have  much  to 

</span><span>debate about in this Bill because this could probably be the fifth or the fourth Bill of 

the same nature.   

</span></div><div><span>I  have  heard  the  Honourable  Member  Mama  Ngamau  Munokoa  saying  that  the 

corporation consists of Papaa.   

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:  </span><span>Point  of  Explanation  Mr  Speaker.    I’m  only  referring  to 

Papaa. That’s why I said it.  Because Papa said we thought it was a papaa. I know who 

</span></div><div><a>Page 58</a></div><div><span>2084 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>are on the Board.  Johnny, another John with Trevor.  I understand, I’</span><span>m only trying to 

refer to what Papa Paora has said before. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> You may carry on Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:    </span><span>I  will  accept  the  point  of  explanation  raised  by  the  Honourable 

Member.   

</span></div><div><span>John  Tierney  is  Chairman,  John  Wichman  is  a  Member  and  Trevor  Clarke  is  a 

Member.  Mr Speaker, Government sees to the needs of the people. Therefore there is 

a need to adopt a system to carry out and to make use of the assets of Government that 

are worth millions of dollars.  Government feels these are the best people to run these 

affairs  in  a  businesslike  manner.    They  have  been  administering  the  affairs  of  the 

Authority for over a year now and Government  can see the benefit in the work they 

are carrying out.   

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Leader of the Opposition was raising the point about the high cost of 

electricity  consumption.    This  is  also  another  responsibility  of  the  Board,  to  ensure 

</span><span>that  Government’s  policy  of  social  affairs  is  being  taken  into  consideration  as  they 

</span><span>carry out their responsibilities.  This is an important aspect, the money consumers pay 

for electricity.  Government knows that the high cost of electricity nowadays is fairly 

high.  We  have  put  this  matter  into  the  hands  of  the  Board  of  the  Cook  Islands 

Investment  Corporation  to  work  out  how  they  can  drop  the  cost  of  electricity.    If  a 

foreign  company  wishes  to  invest  in  the  Cook  Islands,  we  will  look  to  see  if  their 

charges are reasonable and lower than Aponga Uira.  Then we might consider using 

</span><span>their energy.  This is Government’s social policy </span><span>- to ensure that the cost of electricity 

is looked into much deeper for the future.   

</span></div><div><span>We  have  heard  there  is  a  problem  arising  in  Aitutaki  in  which  the  chairman  of  the 

board is also the Mayor of Aitutaki.  This is another thing we have requested the Cook 

Islands  Investment  Corporation  to  look  into.    This  is  another  thing  that  we  are 

enacting, the appointment of the electricity board in Aitutaki to be made by the Cook 

</span><span>Islands Investment Corporation.  I don’t think any Member in the House doubts that 

</span><span>the cost of electricity is high in the outer islands, it could be up to $2 per unit to run 

electricity  in  the  outer  islands  and  Government  has  ordered  the  Cook  Islands 

</span><span>Investment Corporation to make sure Government’s social policy is first and foremost, 

</span><span>to  be  sure  our  people  are  comfortable  with  their  electricity  consumption.    They  are 

looking  into  the  matter  to  see  how  they  can  charge  cheaper  electricity  in  the  outer 

</span><span>islands.  I am issuing a warning to Aponga Uira, don’t think you will continue in the 

</span><span>service  forever.    If  there  is  anybody  here  who  can  offer  a  cheaper  way  of  providing 

energy we might consider these people.  This is what I wish to encourage.  We have a 

duty to perform.  We must work together.  Mr Speaker this is all I have to say. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I call for the next speaker, I wish to inform the House that pursuant to the order 

</span><span>of the House I will cease debate on the Bill at 7.20pm tonight.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 59</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2085 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my appreciation and acknowledgment to 

the workers working for Te Aponga Uira.  I understand at one time there was a surplus 

in Te Aponga Uira and Government brought legislation in order for them to use this 

surplus.  I appreciate the service they are providing and the hard work they have done.  

The  only  problem  I  am  not  happy with  is  the $5 surcharge. There were two times a 

couple  of  months  back  where  a  lot  of  people  were  saying  that  without  any  warning 

their electricity was turned off.  I have not heard any more complaints in that regard.  

</span><span>Maybe  it  is  because  election  time  is  here  and  they  do  not  want  to  turn  the  people’s 

</span><span>electricity off.  Maybe after the election they will turn it off again.  The only point I 

wish to stress is to let the people have some warning that their power will be turned 

off and if they are unable to pay for electricity there is no alternative but to turn it off.  

This is one Authority I think should remain as they are because they are doing a great 

job, they are doing very well and my recommendation is they should remain as they 

are and let no other authority come on top of them. 

</span></div><div><span>So this is why I would like to stand up to show my appreciation for the service that 

these  people  are  providing  not  only  here  in  Rarotonga  but  also  those  in  the  Outer 

Islands. I would like to show my appreciation for their services.  And on the island of 

Rakahanga  I  would  like  to  thank  the  landowners  for  giving  up  land  to  build  an 

electrical plant.  Be</span><span>cause in the area where they are relocated I don’t think it will be 

</span><span>much  of  a  concern  any  more  because  they  have  a  good  spot.    My  appreciation  also 

goes to the person who was responsible for the electrical supply in Rakahanga.  He is 

doing a good job  in  looking after the plant.  He is receiving favourable consultation 

and  advice  from  Rarotonga  and  the  Minister  responsible.    They  are  not  having  any 

problem any more.  There is continuity of the electrical supply in Rakahanga and so 

we are not having any problems.  Unlike the Telecommunications.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  people  of  Manihiki  during  the  time  when  we  ran  out  of 

power supply.  Through their generosity, the power supply was in service again. This 

is all I wish to say.    Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Our next speaker is the Minister 

of Justice and Lands, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you, greetings to all staff 

Members and to all Honourable Members on both side of the House and to our people 

listening in to our debate tonight - Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise, Mr Speaker, to speak on the subject of the Bill that we have before the House, 

the Te Aponga Uira O Tumutevarovaro Amendment Bill.  I would also like to thank 

</span><span>the Minister responsible for making this adjustment to this particular Bill and to bring 

</span><span>it in line with the Cook Islands Investment Corporation and also my acknowledgment 

and appreciation  to  the staff Members of the Aponga Uira for the excellent  services 

they are providing.

</span></div><div><span>Mr C</span><span>hairman, I give my support to the Government’s idea of corporatisation.  I would 

</span><span>like to acknowledge the various sectors in Government that has been privatised. 

</span></div><div><span>The Bill that we have before the House reminds me of a graduation a month or so ago. 

Some  students  passed  their  Diploma  in  Public  Sector  Management.    I  believe,  Mr 

Speaker,  this  is  one  of  the  good  things,  which  happened  during  the  course  of  the 

reform.  Because these young people have passed these diplomas.  The position where 

we have foreigners looking after our welfare, our businesses is now such that we can 

manage  these  positions.    Not  only  in  Government  agencies  but  also  in  the  private 

sector.  These young Cook Islanders have achieved high education and this also gives 

them  an  opportunity  to  expose  themselves  to  higher  challenges  and  secure  senior 

positions in the public and the private sector.  They are now able to make use of their 

knowledge.    This  is  a  major  weaknesses  identified  amongst  our  people  in  the  past. 

Especially  in  their  management  skills.    By  achieving  these  qualifications  they  will 

definitely be able to head these authorities in the future. Opportunities will be open to 

our young people to move onto these Boards.  Then they will be able to carry out or to 

take up these responsibilities.  The time has gone where volunteers or expatriates took 

</span><span>over  these  positions  of  authority  because  we  didn’t  have  the  appropriate  skills.  Our 

</span><span>people  unable  to  do  the  work.  The  problem  was  that  we  didn’t  have  the  ticket,  the 

</span><span>certificates and these expat</span><span>riates who have the ticket but don’t have the experience for 

</span><span>the  job  easily  won  the  appointments.    But  one  day  our  people  will  be  taking  up  all 

those  responsibilities.    We  can  see  there  is  a  great  improvement  in  the  manner  in 

which  Te  Aponga  Uira  was  managed.    I  am  sure  those  qualified  will  eventually  be 

able to carry out these tasks in these authorities. Our young people have gone overseas 

for further education.  When they come back I am sure and I am confident they will be 

able  to  take  up  these  responsibilities  in  the  hands  of  expatriates.      So  these  are  the 

areas that I am looking at that. 

</span></div><div><span>This is all I have to say.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Thank you.  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and greetings to you all and 

greetings  to  our  people  who  are  listening  in  to  our  debate  tonight  and  to  our  tired 

Members of Parliament for our long day today. 

</span></div><div><span>I  shall  be  very  brief  Mr  Speaker  on  the  eve  of  this  Parliament  being  dissolved.    I 

would have thought the Te Aponga Uira Amendment would bring some goodies for 

our people.  After all it is only a few weeks before the Election. 

</span></div><div><span>You know in 1990 Mr Speaker, the Gulf War started and our price on our electricity 

went  up.    There  was  a  10  per  cent  surcharge  on  our  electricity.    People  accepted  it 

because  of  the  war.    The  war  in  Iraq  started  again  later  and  now  there  is  a  war  in 

Bosnia.  The price of that surcharge is still there.  Therefore, our people are waiting 

out.    They  are  patiently  waiting  for  some  reduction  in  the  cost  of  electricity.    I  am 

</span><span>afraid my people, don’t expect miracles!  Nothing will happen.  Election Day is near 

</span><span>but - nothing will happen. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 61</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2087 

</span></div><div><span>Tonight  we  see  Te  Aponga  Uira  who  quite  recently  showed  a  huge  surplus  in  its 

operations  and  kindly  donated  over  $200,000  to  the  pocket  of  this  country.    Then 

some of these people, these hard working people of Te Aponga were demoted.  Inspite 

of the heavy charges they have to pay for the cost of the French Loans and other cost 

to  the  Aponga.    I  feel  sorry  for  the  existing  Board  of  the  Aponga.    My  friend  Mr 

Kairau  of  Matavera  whom  I  quite  often  have  an  argument  with  because  of  the  high 

charges  in  electricity.    Now  all  your  hard  work  will  probably  be,  not  appreciated  as 

</span><span>much.  Don’t tell me I haven’t told you my friend.  </span></div><div><span>This Bill is creating the amendment to the Aponga like the other Port Authority, the 

Airport.  It has in many ways sadden my heart because our people have devoted a lot 

of their time to make those areas they are responsible to function properly and they all 

have been working hard and profitably.  I have seen the Aponga workers sustain some 

</span><span>horrific injuries  from  tree cuttings or from working in hurricane winds.  It’s of little 

</span><span>consolation to know that the Aponga would be liable for these injuries.  Because many 

of  them  have  sort  compensation  from  our  National  Compensation  Scheme  without 

success.    There  are  some  injured  people,  electrocuted  workers,  workers  who  have 

</span><span>nearly cut off their legs when using chainsaws, they sustained severe injuries.  Sadly 

</span><span>today some of those injured workers have never been compensated.  It is sad that their 

responsibility first  and foremost should be to their workers and to the people of this 

country.   

</span></div><div><span>I mentioned this earlier.  Will this amendment bring some relief to our people who are 

paying very expensive unit costs for electricity?  I doubt very much though that this 

will  be  the  case.    The  Honourable  Minister  of  Education  talked  about  the  Aitutaki 

power  supply.    He  has  caused  some  confusion  in  this  House.    When  the  devolution 

process  was  started  2  years  ago  the  power  was  transferred  to  the  supervision  of  the 

Island  Council.    They  have  been  managing  it  quite  successfully  to  our  amazement. 

They  can  maintain  their  power  and  the  fuel  supply  sufficiently  to  operate  a  more 

efficient power system than they ever enjoyed.  I too am confused Mr Speaker because 

we understand that running our own power in the outer islands will be our own affair 

and now we hear that the CIIC will be in charge of it.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>I’ll  interrupt  you  Honourable  Member  because  our  time  is  up.  

</span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>A Bill intituled an Act to amend the Te Aponga Uira o 

Tumu-Te-Varovaro  Act  1991  to  ensure  consistency  between  its  provisions  and  the 

provisions of the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act 1998. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> We will now resolve Parliament into the Committee of the Whole.
