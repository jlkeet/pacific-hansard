</span><span>moved so far.  I will call him Leader of the House for guillotine motion.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Cook  Island  Government  Property  Corporation  Amendment  Bill, 

Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA: </span><span>I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Cook Island Government Property Corporation Amendment Bill be 

now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>The  Cook  Island  Government  Property  Corporation  Amendment  Bill  is  making  a 

number of minor changes to the Cook Islands Government Property Act and this itself 

is  the last  of six Bills  which we have gone through these last days or so concerning 

Crown  assets  and  their  administration.    Important  changes  have  been  made  to  the 

Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act and the Bills bring the Act in line with the 

Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act.  This Bill - 

</span></div><div><span>a) 

</span></div><div><span>b) 

</span></div><div><span>clarifies those Crown assets which are vested in the Corporation; 

</span></div><div><span>to provide that Property Corporation is now primarily a holding company with 

the management and negotiation of disposal of assets now being the job of the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 65</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2091 

</span></div><div><span>Investment  Corporation  and  of  course  Mr  Speaker,  the  requirement  for  the 

approval of such disposition being vested in Cabinet; 

</span></div><div><span>to  provide  that  property  belonging  to  the  Property  Corporation  shall  be  dealt 

with in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Corporation Act; 

</span></div><div><span>it vests in the Property Corporation the assets and liabilities of the Cook Island 

Savings Bank thereby removing some ambiguity in the status of the assets due 

to  the  fact  that  the  Bank  is  a  department  of  State  and  not  a  statutory 

corporation and of course, the Savings Bank is still bound by the provisions of 

the  Post  Office  Act  of  1959  which  contains  certain  protection  for  depositors 

and retains certain powers to the Minister of Finance; 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  this  vests  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  former  Housing 

Corporation in the Property Corporation; 

</span></div><div><span>provides that the Queen’s Representative may by Ord</span><span>er in Executive Council 

transfer assets and liabilities to the Property Corporation and finally 

</span></div><div><span>This  requires  the  Property  Corporation  to  produce  a  statement  of  financial 

position  annually  and  a  fiscal  updates  which  is  enshrined  in  the  law  and  is 

what is happening already. 

</span></div><div><span>c) 

</span></div><div><span>d) 

</span></div><div><span>e) 

</span></div><div><span>f) 

</span></div><div><span>g) 

</span></div><div><span>As  I  said  at  the  beginning,  this is  the last of six Bills  designed to  further refine and 

improve  the  efficient  and  effective  management  and  disposal  of  Government  assets.  

With those few explanatory words on the Bill on behalf of the Prime Minister, whom I 

</span><span>believe has just landed at the airport at 7.00 o’clock tonight, I move:</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Thomas Hewett.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time?   

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Actually  I  found  that  there  are 

quite a few amendments in this Bill.  It is not as simple as it sounds.  There has been 

mention right at the start of Clause 2 about interest in land.  There is special mention 

of  not  getting  involved  with  customary  land.    These  terms  have  been  something  of 

special interest to me, Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly on Rarotonga, the customary land in Takitumu is still in shares but it is there.   

I know who the people are and who own the customary land on Rarotonga and I am 

glad this specifically says it does not involve customary land.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 66</a></div><div><span>2092 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  transfer  this  terminology  to  customary  land  in  the  outer  islands, 

especially  in  the  lagoons.    There  are  lagoons  in  the  outer  islands,  for  instance  in 

Penrhyn  and  Manihiki  where  I  lived  for  six  years.    I  know  there  are  small  islands 

within  the  lagoon  itself  that  belong  to  families.    Some  of  these  small  islands  are 

almost  the  same  size  as  some  of  the  islands  on  the  rim  of the reef.  The point I am 

trying to  get  at  is  does this terminology on customary land go to the extent to cover 

islands  within  the  lagoon  such  as  in  Manihiki.  According  to  this  definition  Mr 

Speaker, it does not only talk about customary land on Rarotonga, it is general.  I am 

sure the people of those islands, especially Manihiki, owns small islands in the lagoon 

and to me this is no different than customary land up the hill somewhere else. 

</span></div><div><span>I  raise  this  point  because  I  see  this  as  something  that  will  interest  people  who  have 

lagoons  and  islands  in  the  lagoon.    Families  own  those  small  islands  within  the 

lagoon.  I brought these matters up for their concern because these islands belong to 

families.  They will be interested to know what terminology is applicable.  I think they 

should be placed under customary land. 

</span></div><div><span>I know a lot of people in Manihiki, old people, who still believe that they own those 

</span><span>small  islands  and by right  they should continue to own those small islands inherited 

from our ancestors.  I strongly believe that that is their wish.  To make sure that those 

islands still belong to them and must not be taken away from them by Government. I 

will submit that the ownership of these islands in the lagoons should be given back to 

the rightful owners of each island. 

</span></div><div><span>And  therefore  I  see,  Mr  Speaker,  that  this  customary  land  as  it  says,  as  mentioned 

here, must have a real definition, a wider definition.  A definite definition to indicate 

what is customary lands in the Cook Islands, not just on Rarotonga.  I hope that this 

can be rectified in the near future and that the rightful owners of these small islands 

within the lagoons of each island retain those rights. 

</span></div><div><span>I didn’t  really have much time going through the clauses of this Amendment Bill or 

</span><span>the  Cook  Islands  Government  Property  Corporation  Amendment  Bill,  Mr  Speaker. 

But I overheard the Minister mentioning about the Bill dealing with the Cook Islands 

Savings Bank as well.  I recall once that Government has borrowed money from this 

Bank  for  Government  purposes.    Now  I  hope  that  has  been  repaid  if  that  was  what 

</span><span>happened.    And  I  have  some  concern  with  this  Cook  Islands  Savings  Bank  coming 

</span><span>u</span><span>nder the Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  I can hear the Minister saying it’s not 

</span><span>and I am pleased with that Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>But I heard the Minister comment on the Housing Corporation’s activities and debts 

</span><span>Mr  Speaker.      I  would  have  liked  to  have  heard  more  about  this  particular  one  Mr 

Speaker  because  we  took  the  affairs  of  the  Housing  Corporation  to  the  Police 

Commissioner to look into.  As far as I can remember there is over a million dollars 

</span><span>owing.  There’s been money lost through the operations of t</span><span>his Housing Corporation 

</span><span>Mr Speaker.  What is happening here, Mr Speaker?  I would like to ask the Minister to 

</span><span>explain.  Is there a cover up action here to this Housing Corporation performance or 

are we getting the full story about what happened? Where did the money disappear?  

Who  took  what  and  so  forth?    We  will  recall  that  $3  million  was  allocated  to  this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 67</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2093 

</span></div><div><span>Housing Corporation to provide loans to our people, especially young families.  This 

Government boasted about this when this project was first introduced.  We know what 

the result of the Report of the PERCA was. It was tabled in this House. We know how 

bad the debts were and there are still a lot of houses unfinished.  There is still a lot of 

things  happening  that  we  are  not  clear  about  and  up  to  now  we  h</span><span>aven’t  heard  any 

explanations.    We  haven’t  heard  what  the  story  is  with  the  findings  of  the  PERCA.  

</span><span>Nothing  whatsoever  and  I  am  hoping  that  the  mention  of  this  Housing  Corporation 

now will bring some light to what has happened.  The only feedback we had from the 

Police  Commission  was  that  they  are  still  looking  into  the  matter.    Surely,  Mr 

Speaker, there are information available to be looked into as the PERCA was able to 

</span><span>do so. But we haven’t received any full explanation why and what has happened with 

</span><span>the Housing Corporation? 

</span></div><div><span>So those are my thoughts, Mr Speaker.  As I said there are still a few more clauses that 

</span><span>I haven’t gone through but perhaps there might be a time for that.  I will give speaking 

</span><span>time to my colleagues.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Before  I  call  upon  the  next 

speaker, I wish to inform the House that at 8.20 p.m. tonight I will cease the debate on 

the Bill.  The Honourable Minister, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>    Just  trying  to  answer  queries  raised  by  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition.  Especially in reference first to the former Housing Corporation.  Yes, he 

is quite right.  I think the question is quite valid.  It is important for the question to be 

raised now.  Hence this was included as part of the Government Property Corporation, 

so that it can be properly audited to find out the actual liability of the former Housing 

Corporation.    As  Honourable  Members  know,  Mr  Speaker,  there  were  two.    Part  of 

the Housing Corporation was devolved to the ANZ Bank.  Because of that, the Cook 

Islands Investment Corporation Board has negotiated with the ANZ Bank for a mutual 

agreement between the two for a new loan.  Completely between the customers and 

the Bank. 

</span></div><div><span>And  of  course  a  reference  to  the  Cook  Islands  Savings  Bank.    He  was  quite  right 

again.   That is because it has been taken away as a Government Statutory Corporation 

and left with the Ministry of Finance under the MFEM Act. 

</span></div><div><span>As far as the lagoon in Manihiki is concerned, when we placed the Ministry of Marine 

Resources Act into effect, the lagoons were covered. But I stand to be corrected. I am 

positive that the lagoon was handed back to the people of Manihiki under the Ministry 

of Marine Resources Act.  Now I have been informed by the Honourable Member, Dr 

Woonton that we are talking about the little islands in the lagoon and not the lagoon 

itself.    For  me,  this  is  my  own  opinion,  any  island  in  any  water  in  this  country  is 

owned by the people of this country, not owned by anybody else.  And if there is any 

move fo</span><span>r anybody to come and claim that it is somebody else’s land, I will support the 

</span><span>people who own the islands.  Leave their islets in their own hands.  Because rightfully, 

as  we  all  know,  any  piece  of  rock  out  there  or  any  piece  of  soil  left  in  the  ocean  is 

owned  by  our  people.    We  have  some  in  the  motu  in  Ngatangiia.    The  people  of 

Ngatangiia own it.  Naturally I think those lands on the motu or in the Northern Group 

belong to the people in those islands.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 68</a></div><div><span>2094 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Speaker, because there has been mention of the islands within 

the lagoon on the island of Manihiki I thought this would be an appropriate time for 

me to tell you what I know.   

</span></div><div><span>In the times of my ancestors the lagoon belong to the people. There have always been 

boundaries where families have been able to claim their part of the lagoon.  When the 

Crown decided to  take over the lagoons then things changed.  The people were told 

that whatever islets you have in the lagoon are not yours anymore These then, became 

part  of  the  jurisdiction  of  the  CAO  -  Resident  Agent  at  the  time  and  of  the  Crown.  

When  people  started  farming  pearls  in  the  lagoons  the  authority  was  given  to  the 

Island Council and it was up to the Island Council to give out the permits.  And they 

also  used  the  lagoons  and  motu  or  the  islets  which  were  designated  for  the  Crown.  

What should have happened was to restrict their jurisdictions to the sea or the lagoons 

and  any  motu  or  islet  that  has  risen  above  the  seawater  belongs  to  the  families 

concerned.  There were a lot of families who owned some of these motu but they were 

disqualified and the motu were given to the Crown.   

</span></div><div><span>When we were discussing the Appropriation for the Ministry of Marine Resources, I 

raised the question whether the Ministry of Marine Resources was paying rental on the 

motu they were using for pearl farming.   I know that there are families who own that 

particular  motu.    And  today,  there  are  some  people  farming  on  some  of  these  motu 

who have no right to these motu.  There are other people who actually own this motu.  

I think it is time that these people who are using the motu should be paying rent to the 

landowners.  There are some motu in this lagoon that myself and the Member for the 

island  of  Manihiki  are  landowners  but  there  are  different  people  who  are  actually 

utilising these motu.     

</span></div><div><span>It is not the fault of the Island Council today or the Island Council of the past because 

in the past the people were told that the lagoon and everything in the lagoon are then 

the property of the Crown.  So I see this as a problem area ever since the Crown took 

over.  But I believe and I hope that this mistake can be corrected.  Because I feel sorry 

for the people who actually own this motu.  They are not benefiting from this, other 

people  are  benefiting.      When  we  were  in  Government,  the  Democratic  Party 

Government, we gave the rights of the lagoon and everything in the lagoons back to 

the  Island  Council.    But  when the new Government  came in,  in  1989, they changed 

that and gave that power and authority to the Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>So today, what our families want to do is to go back to the days of old where in the 

times  of  our  ancestors  the  landowners  of  these  motu  or  of  the  lagoon  were  the 

landowners  of  the  islands.  The  power  was  vested  in  the  Cabinet  or  in  the  Minister.  

Today we see this authority transferred to the Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  I 

think if our people found out that the authority is not with Cabinet any longer but with 

a group of people who have the authority or power similar to that of the Cabinet, then 

</span></div><div><a>Page 69</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2095 

</span></div><div><span>our people will have problems with this.  And I also would like the authority over the 

lagoon and whatever is in the lagoon to be given back to the original landowners.   

</span></div><div><span>So again I would like to voice my dissatisfaction in the fact that this is being given to 

the CIIC. The authority should still be retained by Cabinet or the Minister or even in 

</span><span>the  Executive  Council.    Maybe  I  wouldn’</span><span>t  have  that  many  problems  with  it  then.    I 

think this is an appropriate time for me to raise the issues of my people in so far as we 

would like to get the control of our lagoons and everything in our lagoons back to the 

families that owns these lagoons and motu. When the Crown took over the lagoons it 

was to help to grow the pearl shell.  But today, we see that there are a lot of people 

making good money out of the lagoons and therefore I think it is time to give it back 

to  the landowners because all the people with  a lot of money are now making more 

money and the only people who are not making are the actual landowners.  Those are 

my views on this section, thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

will now put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I see the Clerk coming into the House now.  Thank 

you Sir.  

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:</span><span>    A  Bill  Intituled:  An  Act  to  amend  the  Cook  Islands 

Government  Property  Corporation  Act  1969  and  to  make  provisions  for  the 

administration, management and disposal of property vested in the Corporation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I will now resolve Parliament into the Committee of the Whole.
