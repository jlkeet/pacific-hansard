</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Member U. Matata  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is:

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:  </span><span>A  Bill  intituled:  An  Act  to  amend  the  Cook  Islands

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> That concludes the Second and Third Readings of the Cook Islands 

</span><span>Investment Corporation Amendment Bill.    The Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. JACK: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2039 

</span></div><div><span>That the Orders of the Day be amended by moving Order of the day No. 2  

to No. 5 and Bills Nos. 3,4,5 be renumbered as 2,3, &amp; 4. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Leader of the House.  Can I have a Seconder?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Utia Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is:   

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I stand to give my opposition to this stupid amendment.    I 

have looked into the Airport Authority Amendment Bill, and my mind is concentrated 

on  that  particular  Bill  now,  because  I  know  we  have  just  gone  through  the  CIIC 

Amendment Bill.    Now without warning, I have to switch completely to concentrate 

o</span><span>n  the  new  amendment  to  the  Orders  of  the  Day.  What’s  wrong  with  these  people?  

What’s  wrong  with  the  Minister  in  Charge?    What’s  wrong  with  Leader  of  House?  

Why couldn’t they tell us before we started that this is going to be the case?   If we 

</span><span>start  on  this  Bill  we  will  not  have  enough  time  to  consider  the  content  of  the  Bill.  

</span><span>That  is why I say Mr Speaker, this is a stupid amendment. Now I’ve got to go back 

</span><span>and look at my other Bill, which is supposed to come up for considerations later on. I 

need  to  rearrange  my  thoughts  in  order  to  speak  logically  on  the  Amendment  Bill.   

Now that the Order Paper is being changed, we cannot object to it effectively if need 

be.   I just have to make the best of this situation. This is very unfair Mr Speaker, and I 

think you should intervene.  This is not providing the minority in this House sufficient 

time  to  review  and  debate  the  Bills  properly.  And  Government  is  bulldozing  the 

business through this House. At the same time, bullying us just because they have the 

majority.  Our people can see that we are not working as a team for their sake, not for 

our sake as Members of this House.  However, all I can say now, Mr Speaker is that 

this  sots  of  practices  prove  to  our  people  the  type  of  leaders  who  are  running  this 

country.   

</span></div><div><span>I believe they are enjoying what they are doing but I am telling you Mr Speaker, I am 

not  happy  and  it  is  unfair.  So  I  ask  for  your  intervention  Mr  Speaker.    When  these 

sorts of things are practiced in this Honourable House, the Chair must intervene.   

</span></div><div><span> Thank you Mr Speaker 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  The  Honourable  Minister  of 

Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>   It is quite simple Mr Speaker.  If the Honourable Leader of the 

</span><span>Democratic Alliance Party would take note of his Order Paper, immediately after the 

completion  of  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Amendment  Bill,  is  the  International 

Partnership Bill.  That is why we are moving that International Partnership Bill to the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>2040 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>end so that we can proceed onto Bill No. 3 on the Order Paper. Those will then be the 

Orders for today.   

</span></div><div><span>It  is  unfortunate  Mr  Speaker  because  last  Friday  this  House  did  move  a  Motion  for 

this  very  Amendment.      Unfortunately,  I  came  in  to  the  House  this  morning  and  I 

found that it was back on, where it was when this House adjourned last Friday. If the 

Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party would like an apology from me, I would do 

so,  and  apologise  accordingly,  because  the  Order  Paper  this  morning  somehow  is 

mixed up.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.     

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Port Authority Amendment Bill - Second Reading.   The Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. JACK: </span><span>I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Second and Third Reading of the Port Authority Amendment  

Bill be completed by no later than 12.00noon today. 

</span></div><div><span>  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Leader of the House. Can I have a seconder?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Member T. Hewitt 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.    MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  You  will  no  doubt  notice  that, 

after the brief debate on the previous Amendment Bill on CIIC we just went through 

the  clauses  without  any  debate  at  all.      And  our  speech  to  the  Amendment Bill  was 

generalised.  We  never  even  touched  upon  any  of  the  clauses  of  that  particular  Bill.  

Now  I  have  just  heard a silly amendment  by the Leader of the House giving us one 

and a half hours to go through the amendment Bill on the Ports Authority.  I know for 

sure I will not be able to speak on any of the clauses if I do not do so now.  Really, 

</span><span>you  can  say  that  my  colleagues  and  I  don’t  have  much  opportunity  to  speak  on  the 

</span><span>principle and merits of the Bill.  You can almost say that it is lost.  I think I better not 

</span><span>go any further so that we will have at least some time to speak on the Ports Authority 

Amendment Bill. At least I appreciate Members of Government having sympathy with 

us  to  speak  on  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Bill  which  only  gave  three 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2041 

</span></div><div><span>Members of the Opposition time to speak and that is the only time we have.  I can see 

the same opportunity will be given to us provided Government Members are willing 

to do that. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I heard the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party 

is  insinuating  the  possibility  pending  the  Government  side  agreeing  for  us  to  move 

straight into the Committee of the Whole.  Because after all, there is only two clauses 

in the Bill, Sir.   I suggest that we go directly into the Committee of the Whole.  That 

will allow more time for them to look at the two clauses of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Ports Authority Amendment Bill be now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>I want to give a very brief explanation on the principle and merits of the Bill for the 

benefit of all.  This is the first of four Bills dealing with statutory corporations.  The 

proposed  amendments  to  the  Ports  Authority  Act  are  designed  to  align  it  with  the 

Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Act.  Under  the  Cook  Islands  Investment 

Corporation  Act  the  Board  of  the  Investment  Corporation  appoint  directors  of  the 

Ports Authority.  The Ports Authority is a subsidiary of the Investment Corporation.  A 

number  of  provisions  in  the  Ports  Authority  Act  are  added  or  removed  to 

accommodate this change and in particular - 

</span></div><div><span>a) 

</span></div><div><span>b) 

</span></div><div><span>c) 

</span></div><div><span>d) 

</span></div><div><span>the  amendment  provides  for  the  appointment  of  directors  of  the  Ports 

Authority by the Investment Corporation; 

</span></div><div><span>the Investment  Corporation may give to  the Authority general direction as to 

management  strategy  to  be  followed  by  the  Authority  in  the  performance  of 

</span><span>the Authority’s functions;</span></div><div><span>the  Authority  will  have  the  power  to  declare  a dividend which is  paid  to  the 

</span><span>Investment  Corporation  in  accordance  with  the  Corporation’s  statement  of 

</span><span>intent; 

</span></div><div><span>Cabinet approval will no longer be required for the Ports Authority to borrow 

money or issue debentures or mortgaged land; 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>2042 

</span></div><div><span>e) 

</span></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the  Ports  Authority  will  be  required  to  issue  to  the  Investment  Corporation 

annually  a  statement  of  corporate  intent  for  approval  by  the  Board  of  the 

Corporation  and  an  annual  report  has  to  be  filed  and  fiscal  updates  are  

required to be filed with the Investment Corporation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker the amending legislation does not completely remove the authority of the 

</span><span>Minister.  It is this Government’s view that the Ministe</span><span>r still has a role to play.  This 

amendment  provides  that  the  draft  statement  of  corporate  intent  must  be  sent  to  not 

only the Investment Corporation but to the Minister of Shipping as well.  The reason 

why it is being delivered to the Minister of Shipping is that the Minister has the job of 

keeping  an  eye  on  the  Ports  Authority  to  make  sure  it  is  giving  effect  to  the  social 

policies  of  Government  where  those  are  relevant  and  the  laws  allow.  With  the 

concurrence of Cabinet, the Minister may require the Ports Authority to place greater 

</span><span>emphasis  on  Government’s  social  policy.    However  where  this  occurs  the  cost  of 

</span><span>doing  so  is  to  be  identified  and  either  deducted  from  the  dividend  Government 

receives from the Investment Corporation or appropriated by Parliament.  In this way 

the cost to Government policies will be clearly identified in a transparent way.  With 

</span><span>those  few  explanations,  I  hope  it  will  help  us  to  understand  the  reason  behind  the 

</span><span>amendment before the House.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  May  I  call  for  a 

Seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Utia Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>I  stand  to  oppose  the  Motion.  I  want  to  stick  to  the 

Standing Orders of Parliament to go through the Bill, as has been the practice, to go 

</span><span>through the principle and merits first.  It isn’t my fault for not being able to get onto 

</span><span>the  clauses.    If  Government  wants  to  make  any  changes,  change  the  timing  of  this 

debate.  I strongly oppose to this Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like us to go on to the principle and merits of the Bill and if I want to touch 

</span><span>upon any clauses in the amendment Bill I will do so.  I don’t see anything wrong with 

</span><span>that.  I am opposing going straight to the clauses Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2043 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-AT-THE-TABLE:</span><span>  A  Bill  Intituled,  an  Act  to  amend  the  Ports  Authority 

Act  1994-95  to  ensure  consistency  between  its  provisions  and  the  provisions  of  the 

Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act 1998
