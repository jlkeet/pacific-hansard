<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Appropriation Amendment Bill, Committee of Supply. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister for Legislative Services, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I wish to seek leave of the House to allow me to 

move an adjournment Motion of Parliament.  Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Parliament do Adjourn now until Tuesday the 16th of  

</span><span>March at 1.00 p.m</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>I do not think it is necessary for me to explain. However in view of the storm warning 

surrounding  us  at  this  time,  the  special  requirement  of  the  staff  of  Parliament  is  to 

move everything movable in  this House to  the containers which you will see on the 

side of the road in the event of high seas coming through, then we will be ready for it.  

Of  course  the  extra  day  on  Monday  is  to  allow  them  to  put  every  facility  back  into 

place to be ready for Tuesday.  Honourable Members will have a weather bulletin on 

</span><span>your desks.  That is an earlier report.  Now it has been upgraded to a fullscale cyclone.  

</span><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Mr Minister. May I call for a Seconder please?

</span></div><div><span>1831 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Mii Parima.</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kia Orana to you, to the staff and 

to  all  Honourable  Members  of  the  House  and  our  people  listening  in  on  this  windy 

afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Special  greetings  to  the islands of the southern group who are being battered by the 

storm  as  we heard over the radio.  The  only thing we need to do is be prepared, get 

ready as we go through this time.  I rise to give my support to the Motion, as we are 

already conscious of the fact that this hurricane is right amongst us.   

</span></div><div><span>I just wanted to raise the question, whether today we will form part of the days for the 

debate on the Appropriation Bill.  The Minister explained that this would not be part 

of  the  total  number  of  days  for  the  debate  in  Committee  on  the  Appropriation  Bill.  

We the Opposition Members would like to go through each item of the Appropriation 

Bill and to speak on those items. This is the first time the Minister has done something 

good therefore, I support what he has done.  We will not be debating any further. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>   Thank you, Honourable Members.  Please clean your desks to 

allow the staff to move.  Yes Honourable Member the Appropriation Bill supersedes 

any other business in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> This Parliament is adjourned until Tuesday the 16th of March 1999 

at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting Adjourned at 1.13 p.m.
