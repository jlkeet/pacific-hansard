<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Health. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,291,493 for Health stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The  last  Member  speaking  yesterday  was  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you  and  greetings  to  you,  to  your  staff,  to  all 

Honourable  Members  and  our  people  listening  in.  To  the  Honourable  Dr  Williams, 

who have just joined us today, welcome to the House and I hope you and your family 

are well and good. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  do  not  have  much  more  time  left  to  speak  about  the  Vote  Item  on 

Health, which has been appropriated, but I would like to again thank the Minister for 

answering our queries.  He has been very helpful.  I am pleased to note that he has at 

least  arranged  for  an  increase  in  the  Health  appropriation  in  the  Supplementary 

Budget.  Yes,  Mr  Chairman,  the  increase  he  has  made  helps  with  the  purchasing  of 

medical supplies.  I hope the concern raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 

the  Honourable  Dr  Woonton,  will  be  covered  as  far  as  preventative  medicine  is 

concerned in this country.  He mentioned mosquito-carrying diseases, such as Dengue 

</span><span>Fever and Filariasis. Filariasis is one illness that appears to be on the increase in the 

</span><span>country. The Minister has already indicated his concern with that and he is seriously 

considering  the  introduction  of  preventative  measures  in  the  Health  service.  He will 

ensure it is implemented so that these diseases do not become a major problem in our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>1726 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>country.  Mr Chairman, I am happy to stand and support this Appropriation however, 

Mr Chairman, I regret to report that the mother of one of our doctors, Mama Annie, 

has  passed  away.  May  I  extend  words  of  condolences  to  Dr  Tikaka  Henry  for  the 

passing away of your mother in Aitutaki. I have no doubt that all of us will pass on our 

sincerest  condolences  to  the  family  and  words  of  comfort  for  this  sad  bereavement. 

</span><span>We  know  that  Dr  Tikaka’s  parents  have  served  their  country  for  a  long  time, 

</span><span>especially in education. When they settled in Aitutaki, they were active in the Island 

Council  and  the  Church.  They  were  also  deacons  in  the  Arutanga  ekalesia.  When  I 

was the doctor on the island of Manihiki, he was the head teacher of the school and I 

delivered  one  of  his  children.  I  hope  the  family  will  be  comforted  at  this  time.    I 

believe I am supported by all Honourable Members of the House in giving them our 

words of condolences.  I have no doubt the Prime Minister also sends his condolences 

at this time of grief.  We extend to all of them, our words of comfort. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>DR J. WILLIAMS: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman, greetings to you and I hope that you 

are well.  To your staff, greetings to all of them; to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime 

Minister, Members of Cabinet, and Members  on the Government side of the House. 

Greetings  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  thank  you  for  your  words  of  welcome, 

likewise to you too, Mr Chairman, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Members of the Opposition, and all Members of the House I extend to you greetings 

from the Overseas Constituency.  Like the Leader of the Opposition, I would also like 

to convey my condolences to Papa Tikaka and the family for the passing away of my 

sister,  Annie.  My  thoughts  and  the  thoughts  of  the  family  are  with  you  today.  That 

includes  the  family  both  here  and  overseas.  I  want  to  tell  you  that  there  are  lots  of 

them in the Overseas Constituency that is thinking of you and the whole family today.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I want to apologise to the House for my late arrival. When the House 

sat on the 5th, I was in Geneva attending a Conference on Filariasis. It is appropriate 

that I speak on this subject as we are talking about the Health Vote Item today. I have 

been  very  honoured  and  privileged,  Mr  Chairman,  to  have  been  appointed  by  the 

Director General of Health to be a member of a seven-panel group to sit and consider 

the  global  programme  for  the  elimination  of  Lymphatic  Filariasis.  I  am  particularly 

honoured  because  I  represent  one  of  the  smallest  countries  on  planet  Earth,  on  this 

Programme  Review  Committee  for  the  Elimination  of  Filariasis.  There  are  seven 

members  of  the  group  -  one  representing  the  Americas,  one  from  the  Philippines, 

another from Tanzania, one from Japan, one from Europe, one from the Pacific, and 

that is representing the Cook Islands.   There is another from Egypt and another from 

the rest of Asia.  

</span></div><div><span>As the Minister of Health can well remember, in the World Health Assembly of 1997, 

a  resolution  was  passed  to  launch  a  programme  for  the  global  elimination  of 

Lymphatic Filariasis (</span><span>maki ekeeke</span><span>). The reason is that this disease is one which causes 

a lot of disability, a lot of agony and suffering for 120 million people in the world and 

all of them have Elephantiasis or disfigurements of one kind or another. In addition, it 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1727 

</span></div><div><span>is estimated that there are an additional 400 to 500 million people who are infected by 

the  parasite  that  causes  Lymphatic  Filariasis.  Because  of  the  concern  aired  by  the 

Ministers of Health at the World Health Assembly including the Cook Islands, it was 

moved that a programme for the elimination of this disease and completed by the year 

2020.  

</span></div><div><span>Our being chosen to be on this Programme Review Group is because of the pioneering 

work that the Cook Islands did in eliminating or controlling Filariasis through a mass 

treatment programme in 1967, 1968, and 1969. For those of you who recall, including 

Dr Pupuke Robati, who was then the Medical Officer of Health for the Cook Islands, 

we began the programme in Aitutaki. We screened the whole population, from school- 

age  and  upwards  and  gave  mass  treatment  programmes  with  Diethylcarbamazine  or 

Hetrazan.  At  that  time,  the  number  of  people  who  had  positive  tests  was  estimated 

roughly  at  35%  and  there  were  a  lot  of  people  in  Aitutaki  with  Elephantiasis.  The 

programme was launched and twelve months later, the infection rate fell from 35% to 

2%. The people who were found positive were visitors from Rarotonga. The Aitutaki 

population  was  found  to  be  100%  negative.  Therefore  of  that,  we  launched  a 

programme  throughout  the  Cook  Islands  and  if  you  will  recall  people  were  given 

</span><span>monthly treatments of Hetrazan. At that time, we did not know, and I do not think the 

</span><span>Minister  of  Health  at  the  time,  the  Honourable  Inatio  Akaruru,  knew  that  we  were 

doing pioneering work. I am happy to report, a bit late, Minister of Health, that that 

was the first programme launched on planet Earth, the one we did in Aitutaki. That is 

why we were chosen to be on that Group and that was why I was in Geneva, and why I 

was late coming back here.  

</span></div><div><span>While  I  was  in  Geneva,  we  considered  11  applications  -  from  Egypt,  Tanzania, 

Vanuatu, Niue, Tokelau, the two Samoas, Philippines, Nigeria and the Cook Islands. 

Some  were  approved  to  go  ahead,  others  have  been  deferred  for  want  of  more 

information. The Elimination Programme involves the introduction of a single dose of 

two  drugs  -  one  dose  of  two  drugs  a  year.  Each  individual  will  be  given  a  tablet  of 

Albendazole,  an  anti-worm  drug.  The  other  is,  the  drug  we  are  all  familiar  with, 

</span><span>Hetrozan or DEC as it’s commonly known in the WHO scene. These medicines will 

</span><span>be given each year for 5 years and hopefully, by then, each country will be free of this 

debilitating  disease.  Sadly,  as  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  mentioned,  Filariasis  is 

beginning  to  rise  again  in  the  Cook  Islands.  When  we  launched  the  programme  in 

1968, following that throughout, we did not see one more new case of Elephantiasis, 

</span><span>not one. A month ago, I saw a woman in Auckland, who came all the way from the 

</span><span>Cook Islands, to seek medical treatment for Elephantiasis which had begun only three 

months previously. This is the first case I have seen since 1968. When people from the 

Cook Islands come to the clinic, I take it as a routine to screen them for Microfilaria. I 

am sad to say we have picked up positive cases from the Cooks. We have also picked 

up an asthma-like condition called Tropical-pulmonaryesymofilia, that medical people 

will  be  familiar  with.  We  have  not  seen  this  for  a  long  time  -  ever  since  the 

Sanatorium  was  closed.  We  have  not  seen  a  new  case  until  last  year.  We  did  some 

tests  and  there  were  no  positive  results for intestinal  worms.  The only positive ones 

</span><span>are  for  Microfilaria,  plus  some  positive  reflection  in  the  blood  for  Esymofilia.  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker,  I  am  sorry  I  have  dwelled  a  long  time  on  this,  the  reason  is  I  want  to 

emphasise  in  this  Parliament,  and  hope  people  will  listen,  that  we  have  a  problem 

emerging,  one  we  thought  we  had  got  rid  of  but  is  increasing.  As  I  said,  I  have  not 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>1728 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>seen a case of Elephantiasis until recently. I know that the Minister of Health will be 

launching a programme soon. He was one of the proponents of this programme in the 

World Health Assembly in 1997. I am pleading with the general public to cooperate in 

the programme which the Minister will be launching so that we will be one of the first 

on planet Earth to meet the target for the elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis. 

</span></div><div><span>People  are  still  suffering  from  Elephantiasis  or  Lymphonaema.  There  are  people 

suffering from that ever since we contracted this prior to 1968. They certainly do not 

want  to  expand  this  problem  on  those  who  do  not  have  it  today.    With  that,  Mr 

Speaker, I want to give my support to the Health Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MP SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,291,493 for Health stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is, 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,700,041 for Internal Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  Mr  Chairman,  it  states  here, 

under  Section  6  that  there  is  a  $269,127.00  decrease  for  the  Local  Government  of 

Rarotonga.  This  means  what  is  left  for  the  year  1998-99  is  $45,091.00.  So,  Mr 

Chairman,  I  cannot  see  where  the  money  is,  that  Government  is  telling  Local 

Government  on Rarotonga that they have because the original appropriation  was  for 

$314,218. I heard a couple of days ago that when we get the Chinese aid money, this 

will  be  given  to  Local  Government  to  get  it  up  and  running.  Is  this  true,  Mr 

Chairman? The reason I ask the question is because Chinese aid has been specifically 

set aside for MOWEPP. Although this money has not arrived, it has been earmarked 

according to the document that the sum of $650,000 is for MOWEPP. So a question 

that  could  be  asked  is  why  was  the  sum  of  $314,218  reduced  to  the  sum  of 

$45,091.00?   

</span></div><div><span>Here, we have an elected Local Government - the Mayors and Councillors. I hear they 

have a seminar this  evening. What  is  the reason for this seminar? Are they going to 

teach these grown-ups how to administer their individual Councils or is this seminar 

to tell them exactly where the money is going to come from to run these councils? If 

there  is  no  adequate  explanation  from  the  Minister,  Mr  Chairman,  then,  I  think  this 

seminar  is  a  lure  to  get  these  people  out  of  their  homes  to  listen  to  a  campaign 

meeting.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please  come  back  to  the  Vote  Item.  We  are  not  talking  about  the 

seminar later tonight.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1729 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> So be it, Mr Chairman. This is why I am asking why this 

meeting  is  called  for  the Rarotonga Local  Government  Councils. I feel  sorry for the 

person who will announce the meeting tonight that the $314,218 allocated for you, is 

not  there anymore.  If there is  anything left  there, it is only $45,000. Did we not, in 

this House, ask this Government to delay the Local Government elections until after 

the General Elections and then we can see if we can afford to hold those elections?  

</span></div><div><span>You  will  recall,  Mr  Chairman,  what  the  Honourable  Members,  the  Minister  of 

Education Ngereteina Puna and the Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru, told us  - 

</span><span>‘</span><span>we want to give the people the right to administer themselves, but you are trying to 

</span><span>prevent  this’.  So,  what  happened?  We  have  seen  our  friend,  Poko  Keu,  on  the  T.V. 

</span><span>and he is not pleased with what is going on. The Local Government councils were told 

there would be $92,000 per Vaka, the Mayors were very happy. They were satisfied 

for the moment. They even got confirmation that this was true so they went ahead and 

started getting goods on credit.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  these  are  the  fruits  of  being  stubborn  and  arrogant.  They  were  not 

thinking about the state of the economy. They did not listen to the voice of the people 

who told them not to hold the Local Government elections. So what are we to do? Do 

we  want  our  people  to  stay  in  a situation like this? The answer is no. This  is  why I 

stood up, Mr Chairman. I have a problem with the way things are being run. As I see 

it,  the  Supplementary  Budget  is  just  a  short-term  fix  it.  The  sad  thing  is  we  have 

warned this Government, in this House, that the previous Budget was reacting itself. 

Government was already aware that it could not meet that Budget but stubbornly they 

still went ahead with the elections. Now, this is the result, the Local Government is in 

</span><span>serious difficulty. I don’t understand this reduction, Mr Chairman  </span><span>and a Coordinator 

has also been appointed. What will he be paid with? Perhaps part of the $45,000 is to 

pay for the Coordinator whose job is to coordinate between the Vaka Councils.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  certain  that  our  people  on  Rarotonga  want  to  know  exactly  what  is  going  on. 

They need to know why there is a reduction in the funds and they also need to know 

when more funds will be allocated to get these Councils running. The elections were 

held, these Councillors have been elected and sworn in. They are ready and waiting to 

work but we have discovered that there are no funds in their budget. I would like to 

ask  the  Honourable  Members  in  Government,  such  as  the  Honourable  Members  for 

Arorangi,  Tepai  Tepai,  who  is  just  leaving  the  room,  and  the  Honourable  Member, 

</span><span>Utia Matata, and all the Honourable Members for the island of Rarotonga to stand up 

</span><span>and tell  us  where we are headed for and what  you are planning. I would like you to 

</span><span>stand up and say to our people, ‘don’t worry, here is the money and this is where it is 

</span><span>coming fr</span><span>om, the Budget is in a good shape’, and so on. So our people will know what 

</span><span>is  going  on.  Explain  to  them  how  we  arrived  at  a  tragedy  that  I  see  in  front  of  us. 

Stand  up  and  tell  us  because  you  are  their  elected  representatives  in  this  House  and 

you were responsible for this. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, during this session I will continue to urge the Members for Rarotonga 

</span><span>to  stand  up  and  help  me  and  these  elected  Councillors, with  an explanation. Tell us 

</span><span>what  you  intend  to  do.  If  there  is  a  problem  with  the  lack  of  funds,  then  the 

Government  should say so. Do not  hide behind  the facade of a seminar, such as the 

one  that  has  been  arranged  for  tonight.  I  would  like  to  say  to  these  Honourable 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>1730 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Members for Rarotonga, if you cannot help me out, I am going to tell the people not to 

vote for you.  I can see the Honourable Member, Rei Jack, writing something. Maybe 

he  will  be  the  first  to  stand  up  and  help  me  out  by  telling  us  more  about  this  Vote 

Item. I know he voted for Poko Keu Mayor of Te Au O Tonga. I think it is appropriate 

for him to support Poko Keu.  I have looked at the operation plan of the three Vaka. I 

can see there will only be a small amount of funds left over for projects. However, this 

has  been  used  as  an  excuse  to  allow  this  to  go  on,  even  by  some  Members  in  this 

House. They have used it as a reason to  justify this. After carefully looking at these 

proposals, the common belief that most of us held, that most of the money would be 

used to pay the Councillors is confirmed. However, not all that matters now because 

these proposals are nothing because there is no money anyhow. There is no money in 

this Budget so talking any further about it is not justified. Those are my views on this 

sad situation, Mr Chairman. Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Are there any further speakers? The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,700,041 for Internal Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman,  Kia  Orana  to  you  this 

afternoon. Kia Orana to everyone in this Honourable House this afternoon and to our 

people listening in to our debate. Kia Orana in the name of Our Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>I heard the Leader of the Opposition speaking to my Members. It is as if it is up to him 

to decide what the Members of the Cook Islands Party do.  If he is not able to carry 

out his own agenda with regard to Local Government then that is his problem, it is not 

ours.  He is saying that the allocation for local Government has been reduced.  This is 

an  incorrect  statement.    In  the  budget  presented  in  July  last  year,  there  was  a  sum 

allocated from the Public Fund that was thought appropriate to be shared amongst the 

Vaka Councils of Rarotonga. It was thought that $300,000 would be the sum and each 

Vaka  would  receive  $100,000  each.  But  what  happened  was  the  Chief  Electoral 

Officer  took  his  expenses  out  of  the  $300,000  so  we  find  there  is  a  balance  of 

$269,000. Cabinet thought  that it was appropriate that each Vaka received $100,000 

but  after  the  budget  was  put  in  place,  it  was  found  that  the  Electoral  Office  wanted 

part of that $300,000. 

</span></div><div><span>Last  September,  and  when  I  returned  from  China  in  October,  words  were  received 

from  the  Chinese  Government  that  they  would  give  the  Cook  Islands  Government 

$1.5  million  in  aid.  Government  was  to  discuss  with  different  organisations  and  the 

Outer  Islands  how  this  aid  was  to  be  spent.  The  proposals  were  drawn  up,  Mr 

Chairman,  and  these  were  given  to  the  Aid  Co-ordinating  Committee  who  then 

submitted  these  proposals  to  the  Chinese  Government.  These  proposals  are  still  in 

their hands. We still have not received any word as to what the results are. Although 

there appears to be a reduction to $269,000 in the Internal Affairs Appropriation, this 

does  not  mean  the  Local  Government  funds  have  been  cut  out  because  we  are  still 

waiting  for  confirmation  for  the  proposed  funds  from  the  Chinese  Government.  I 

know, Mr Chairman that the </span><span>Konitara Tutara</span><span> (mayor), the Councillors and the</span><span> Kumiti 

Oire</span><span> (Village Council) are eagerly awaiting the arrival of these funds so they can get 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1731 

</span></div><div><span>on with the projects they want to carry out. We understand their problem. I don’t want 

</span><span>to  follow  the  political  leading  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.  The  Leader  of  the 

Opposition  is  trying  to  fan  the  flames  of  anger  of  the  </span><span>Kumiti  Oire</span><span>  and  the  public 

against  the  Government.  This  is  part  of  his  political  campaign  against  the 

Government.  We,  the  Cook  Islands  Party  resolved  not  to  interfere  with  the  Local 

Government elections unlike the Leader of the Opposition who is unable to stay on the 

sidelines.  He  keeps  sticking  his  nose  in  the  business  of  the  Councillors.    It  is  as  if 

these Councillors belong to him. He is talking about the money as if it belongs to him. 

This  is  not  his  money,  Mr  Chairman.  This  Government  found  these  funds  and  was 

able to secure it from our Chinese friends. It is not vapour in the air, it is actually still 

in  the  hands  of the Chinese today. It  will not  be coming out  of the air, it will come 

through the Bank. This is my reminder to the Leader of the Opposition - keep out of 

the business  of the Vaka Councils.  Keep your DAP nose out  of the business of the 

Vaka Councils. When we start our political campaigns for the elections, that will be 

the time we will start having fun. It will not be long now.  

</span></div><div><span>There is a function tonight for those who have been elected as Vaka Councillors. This 

is  not  something  that  we  have  thought  of  today.  This  was  planned  last  year.  It  was 

</span><span>already  planned,  Mr  Chairman,  that  a  workshop  would  be  organised,  after  the  local 

</span><span>body elections, to show the Councillors what their responsibilities are. The Mayor of 

Takitumu says that he does not know what his responsibilities are because he has not 

been  told  yet.  Not  to  worry,  he  and  all  Councillors  will  be  taken  through  the 

Rarotonga  Local  Government  Act  and  shown  what  their  responsibilities  are.  This  is 

not electioneering, unlike what the Leader of the Opposition was doing. This is a time 

to train our Council members, to show them all their rights and responsibilities within 

the law so that they will not be uncertain of their rights and they will not be confused 

about their jurisdictions. There are other enactments in this House, which affect their 

responsibilities.  Some  Mayors  seem  to  think  that  they  can  do  whatever  they  want. 

Some seem to think that they can spend the funds as they see fit. They do not know 

that  there  are  conditions  as  to  how  the  funds  will  be  spent.  There  are  a  couple  of 

Mayors like that in the Outer Islands. They are hasty in their actions, they do not take 

the  time  to  consider  what  their  real  responsibilities  should  be.  We  do  not  want  the 

Mayors  of  Rarotonga  to  be  like  that.  They  will  be  taught  financial  and  economic 

management according to the law so that they will learn that the funds they are being 

allocated are public funds, and there are rules and conditions as to how they will spend 

it. They have to understand that they cannot spend it anyway they want, they have to 

</span><span>follow the procedure as set out in the MFEM Act.  

</span></div><div><span>Another example is how workers are to be hired in the future. The law stipulates how 

these people are to be appointed - that is the Public Service Act. It is intended that the 

Island and Vaka Councils will follow the procedures and requirements set out in that 

Act. For example, if you are the Mayor you cannot go and get your brother to come 

and work for you because this is what you want. No, it does not work that way. There 

is a procedure, which has to be followed. If there is job, it has to be advertised. The 

people who apply for it will be interviewed and examined before an appointment of 

</span><span>the  most  suitable  applicant  is  made.  Unlike  some  Mayors,  particularly  in  the  Outer 

</span><span>Islands - some of them, not all of them - they pick whom they want for the job, be it a 

friend,  or  a  member  of  the  family.  Those  ways  of  doing  things  are  no  longer 

applicable. The Local Government Councillors of Rarotonga are required to be fully 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>1732 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>aware of these two Acts in particular - the MFEM Act and the Public Service Act. The 

third Act that they must be made aware of is the PERCA Act so that they will know 

that PERCA is permitted to scrutinise how they spend public funds. This means that 

the Mayors cannot take money from the Bank when they want to. They have to follow 

the set  procedure, which is the Mayor has to meet with the Council and obtain their 

approval first before he can do what he plans. He cannot take a blank cheque to New 

Zealand to make a purchase, which the Council has not approved, as in the case of an 

Outer Island Mayor recently. He did not get the approval of the Council to do this. All 

Council members must be made aware that the PERCA Committee has the power to 

check the records of their offices to ensure that they have followed the law. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe no one from the Opposition was invited to the function tonight. I don’t know.  

</span><span>If the Leader of the Opposition  is  not  invited, I will be very happy for him to come 

over to hear what is going on. He will discover that this is not a campaign meeting, as 

he  has  implied.  What  is  happening  is  all  above  board  -  we  are  helping  the  newly 

elected  servants  of  the  three  Vaka  so  that  they  may  serve  their  country  well.  Thank 

you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister.  Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  The Honourable Leader of the House, Mr Rei Jack. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  R.  JACK:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Greetings  to  you  and  Greetings  to  the 

Honourable Members on both sides of the House. Greetings also to the Prime Minister 

this afternoon and also to the two leaders of the Opposition who are not present in the 

Chamber. I hear that the other leader has gone to New Zealand.  He was not elected to 

go to New Zealand, he is elected to be here. Greetings to him anyway. Greetings also, 

Mr Chairman, to our people listening in to our debate on the radio this afternoon.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, through you, I would like to extend my greetings to my own electorate 

of Ruatonga-Palmerston Island. To the senior citizens in my constituency, and to all 

the people listening in, greetings to you all. May I also extend my condolences to the 

family  in  Aitutaki  whose  loved  one  passed  away  today.  Three  of  the  children,  two 

boys and one girl, reside in my constituency. Their mother passed away today on the 

island of her birth. May God bless and comfort you all.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  rose  to  support  the  appropriation  of  the  $6,700,041  for  Internal 

Affairs. I feel that this is relevant for their needs. I would also like to congratulate the 

Minister  and  staff  of  this  Department  for  their  work.  I  would  like  to  send  special 

greetings  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Ministry  who  is  away  in  New  Zealand  receiving 

medical treatment. May God bless her and look after her until she returns to us safely. 

</span></div><div><span>I return, Mr Chairman, to the topic of the Rarotonga Local Government which we are 

discussing now. I strongly support the Local Government for the activities, which they 

are carrying out despite the fact that they have been told that there is no funding. It is 

hard to believe that there is no funding because I have seen a lot of work taking place, 

from Upper Tupapa all the way to Avatiu and Nikao. There is a lot of progress taking 

place in the Vaka of Te Au O Tonga.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1733 

</span></div><div><span>We have heard both the Leader of the Democratic Party and the Prime Minister speak. 

Mr  Chairman,  if  you  weigh  their  views,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is  speaking 

</span><span>nonsense while the Prime Minister’s views have a lot of</span><span> substance. Therefore, to those 

of you listening in, it is obvious whom you should elect as leader. Two Members on 

the Opposition side are calling out that I am campaigning. Mr Chairman, the Leader of 

the Opposition was campaigning earlier. What am I supposed to do? Just watch him? 

He  was  saying  that  the  Rarotonga  Local  Government  has  become  a  major  problem 

</span><span>today.  However,  I  am  saying  that  it  is  not  true.  He  is  talking  about  it,  as  if  it’s  the 

</span><span>Elephantiasis  disease  that  the  doctor  was  talking  about  earlier.  The  Leader  of  the 

Opposition was saying that there was great difficulty to get a tin of meat to feed the 

workers.  That,  Mr  Chairman,  is  an  example  of  selfishness  and  thoughtlessness  in  a 

Leader.  This  Honourable  Member  has  forgotten  that  this  Local  Government  is  also 

his. I was very disappointed to hear these words come from his mouth. It reminds me 

</span><span>of a saying by an old man in my constituency of Avatiu, ‘too much talk coming from 

the mouth and not enough room to put food in’.</span><span>Mr Chairman, the</span><span>Local Government 

should be encouraged, especially in my constituency.  

</span></div><div><span>Over  the  past  few  weekends  I  have  seen  a  lot  of  hospitality  and  generosity  in  the 

</span><span>amount of food which was donated to the workers, such as tinned meat and paua. This 

</span><span>shows  that  the  people  are  eager  for  this  activity  to  carry  on,  they  are  supporting the 

Rarotonga Local Government. Maybe he got his advice from his advisor, who saw this 

happening in Avatiu, which is why he brought it to this House today - </span><span>he thinks it’s 

</span><span>occurring all over. If he was a man who stayed in his own constituency and worked 

with his people, he would know what is happening there and know what the needs of 

his constituency are. So, I rise, Mr Chairman, to give my support to this allocation of 

$6,  700,041  for  the  Department  of  Internal  Affairs.  I  think  it  is  adequate  for  this 

Department. Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Leader  of  the  House.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Chairman, all Honourable Members and to our people listening 

in,  Kia Orana. When I heard the two speakers from the Government side, especially 

the speech by the Prime Minister, I was reminded of an incident that occurred in New 

Zealand. An ill woman was driven to the hospital. As they went along, it was as if the 

woman  was  possessed  by  a  demon.  Her  brother,  who  was  driving  the  car,  saw  a 

billboard advertising Coca-</span><span>Cola. He interpreted the sign as ‘koke koke koke’, which is 

‘lie, lie, lie’. </span></div><div><span>Last  year,  they  said  funding  of  $300,000  would come from  the Budget.  Today, they 

say  it  is  coming  from  the  Chinese,  therefore  it  is  lie,  lie,  lie.  This  is  why  I  am 

reminded  of  this  particular  incident.  Everything  that  was  spoken  in  this  House  last 

year,  is  different  to  what  is  being  spoken  here  now.  This  is  all  I  have  to  say,  Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>1734 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:  </span><span>Greetings to you, Mr Chairman, and to all of us in the grace of 

God. 

</span></div><div><span> I rise, Mr Chairman, to give my support to the allocation of $6,700,041 for Internal 

Affairs.  

</span></div><div><span>A lot of Members have spoken about the appropriation for Internal Affairs.  I would 

like  to  speak  on  the  appropriation  of  $6,700,000.    We  all  know,  Mr  Chairman,  it  is 

from this Appropriation that we get our sick, destitute and old age support from. Mr 

Chairman, you will recall that this CIP Government has never reduced benefits since 

1995. From 1995 to the present, this Government has not reduced this amount because 

this  Government  is  well  aware  that  this  is  of  great  benefit  to  our  senior  citizens 

(people aged 60 or older), invalids and destitute. These people are very dependent on 

this support. During the financial difficult period of 1996, 1997 and last year, we met 

with these people to assure them that Government would not touch this. Although we 

had  hard  times,  this  money  has  not  failed  to  provide  for  our  needy  people.  We  will 

recall that the appropriations for various Departments and Statutory Authorities were 

reduced, as well as other allocations. All of these were reduced except for the welfare 

benefits.  By  doing  this,  Government  has  demonstrated  its  care  and  concern  for  its 

people,  especially  the  beneficiaries.  The  welfare  benefits  were  not  reduced.  Seeing 

this  continuing  through  the  allocation  in  here  pleases  me.  I  would  like  to  say  thank 

you to the Minister of Finance and the Cabinet for this allocation. Through this, they 

are confirming to our needy people, that they will continue to help them. For that, we 

should congratulate the Government for their continuing support. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Members  of  the  Opposition,  particularly  the  Leader,  did  not  acknowledge  the 

importance of this allocation to some of our people. They spent their speaking times 

complaining  about  the  reduction  of  some  allocations,  particularly  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition,  and  he  criticised  Government,  before  obtaining  the  facts.  We,  in 

Government know that there are other sources of funding. We know how to get fund, 

which  will  help  the  Rarotonga  Local  Government  to  carry  out  its  activitie</span><span>s.  I  don’t 

</span><span>doubt that our people listening to the Leader of the Opposition think he does nothing 

but  criticise  about  everything  -  from  the  elections  for  Local  Government,  Council 

funding. Even today, he is still complaining. He will always complain. It makes you 

wonder what kind of person this is. This is a DAP disease. I hope their disease stays 

with them until the day of celebration, which lies ahead of us.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to congratulate the Mayors and Council Members who have been elected. 

You  have  your  work  cut  out  for  you.  It  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  you  have  to 

have  money  in  order  to  start  working.  It  was  customary  practice  for  us  to  come 

together to do community work without the requirement for funds. The leaders of the 

</span><span>Tapere </span><span>or village would call the people to come together to do the work because they 

are aware that it benefits the community as a whole. I am not saying they do not need 

financing, they do for some projects but what I am saying is, the Mayor and council do 

not need to wait around for financing. They can go right ahead and do it.  If a Mayor 

</span><span>or  Council  Member  is  going  to  use  the  lack  of  funds  as  an  excuse  not  to  call  the 

</span><span>people together to do the work required of them, then that Council Member became a 

Councillor  or  Mayor  for  the  wrong  reasons.  Calling  the  village,  the  </span><span>Tapere  </span><span>and  the 

</span><span>Vaka</span><span>  together,  to  do  things,  is  not  a  new  thing  to  us.  However,  some  people,  Mr 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1735 

</span></div><div><span>Chairman,  such  as  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  are  using  this  as  an  excuse  to 

politicise this whole issue. They are not there to encourage people to move ahead.  

</span></div><div><span>Let us look at the good things the Mayors and Councillors have done since they have 

been elected into these positions. Those Councillors and Mayors who have cleaned the 

roads have done a very good job. I would like to congratulate the Minister of Internal 

Affairs, the Secretary of that Department and the staff of the Ministry, for their efforts 

and  their  encouragement to  the people in  the local  Government  councils to  carry on 

the good work that they have done so far. Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> For my last couple of minutes, Mr Chairman, I would like 

to  present  some  views  on  this  subject  before  us.    This  will  be  short,  Mr  Chairman, 

</span><span>about  the  phrase  ‘</span><span>kokekoke’</span><span>,  used  by  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati 

</span><span>earlier,  which  probably  means  to  ‘lie’. He did  not  say that I had lied. He  </span><span>said  ‘koke 

koke koke’</span><span>. I am not worried though, Mr Chairman, because he is getting old, so this is 

just as a point of explanation.  He seems to think that we should not get the Chinese 

Government involved with assisting us. He is suggesting that, just because we said it 

in our Budget last year, we should stay exactly where we were. He is saying that we 

should  not  change  a  thing  although we have found ways to  better it. We should not 

change it because we will be </span><span>‘koke koke koke’</span><span>. This is the way that this gentleman is 

coming  across  but  we  cannot  do  anything  about  this  because  he  is  getting  old.  His 

thoughts are all over the place. He does not like the idea that the Chinese Government 

is going to give the people of this country $1.5 million. This is on top of the $650,000 

that they gave us last year.   

</span></div><div><span>This is a way we have found, Mr Chairman, in order to utilise these funds that will be 

given to us by the Chinese Government. This money will not be given to Government 

but  it will be given to each of the Vaka Councils. Although it was Government that 

was  responsible  for  locating  these  funds,  and  although  it  will  be  dispersed  by 

</span><span>Government,  it  has  always  been  Government’s  intention to  give the money to  assist 

the Vaka Councils and also the Island Councils in the Outer Islands. This is Cabinet’s 

</span><span>intention.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati,  please  do  not  be 

jealous. If we find new methods, do not get mad and do not call us </span><span>‘koke’</span><span> people. In 

addition,  if  he  is  surprised  by  our  improved  methods  for  getting  assistance,  then  he 

should just clap and be happy for us, and I will be satisfied.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Our  next  speaker  is  the  Honourable 

Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I just rose to give my point of 

view on the accusations being levelled at me by the Prime Minister and my colleague, 

the Honourable Member, Rei Jack.  I did not hear who the other one was accusing me. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>1736 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Nevertheless, Mr Chairman, I was not very happy with the explanation given to us by 

the Prime Minister about this allocation in the Schedules which tell us that this is a net 

decrease  of  $269,127.    In  the  explanations  provided  by  the  estimates  to  this 

Appropriation Amendment, it tells us that anything within brackets is a decrease.  As 

we go through this column that I am speaking of, which is in brackets, it tells us it is a 

net  decrease which means that the appropriation has been decreased.  In the column 

on  the  side  of that one, we have the amended figures for the financial year 1998-99 

under  the  three  headings  of  Gross  Expenditure,  Trading  Revenue  and  Net 

Appropriation.  This is what this Supplementary Budget brought into this House as a 

net appropriation, the figure $45,091. This money, which we have been hearing about, 

has been confirmed by the Prime Minister as Chinese aid. I was wrong to say that this 

money is hanging in the air somewhere, it is actually still in China.  The money that 

we are hearing about from China is the same as the money that we were told was to be 

used  for  buying  the  Rarotongan  Hotel.  The  money  that  Government  thought  they 

would receive for the sale of the Rarotongan Hotel has not arrived yet. It is still at the 

Rarotongan Hotel.  

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Chairman, what this Appropriation Amendment is telling us is, that there is no 

</span><span>money, there is no $300,000 for the Councils to utilise. What the Budget is telling us 

is,  that  it  is  definite  that  there  is  $45,000  for  the  Rarotonga  Local  Government.  I 

would like to ask the Honourable Prime Minister not to campaign in this House. The 

Prime Minister and the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister as well as my friend, the 

Honourable Rei Jack, are all saying that I am campaigning in this House. I am not, I 

am  merely  stating  the  facts.  The  days  ahead  will  confirm  for  us  if  there  is  money 

available for the operation of the Vaka Councils of Rarotonga. We will wait and see 

although these people are getting sick of waiting.  

</span></div><div><span>My  colleague,  the  Honourable  Member,  Tepai  Tepai  is  yelling  out  that  this 

Appropriation should be allowed to be passed. I feel sorry for him. He is not standing 

up to support me for a larger sum of $300,000 to be allocated, he says we should leave 

it at $45,000. It does not matter though because we all know that the people who have 

been  elected  into  these offices knew there was  no money but  they insisted on going 

ahead. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding  a  point  raised,  that  is  the responsibilities of the councils, the Mayors and 

</span><span>Councillors.  It  is  appropriate  that  they  are  shown  clearly  what  their  financial 

</span><span>responsibilities are under the MFEM Act and Local Government Act. It is important 

that  they  are  made  aware  of  all  their  responsibilities  about  all  the  Acts.  These  were 

clarified to the Councillors of the Vaka of Takitumu at a meeting last night. However, 

I  think,  Mr  Chairman,  it  should  have  happened  as  soon  as  the  Local  Government 

elections  were  completed.  There  should  have  been  a  swearing-in,  and  training 

seminars  straight  after  the  elections  -    not  as  it  is  being  conducted  today,  during 

General Election campaigning time, where it could be used as a bribe. We do not want 

that sort of thing. What I really want to see happen, is that after we have passed this 

</span><span>appropriation that they be given the money so that they can go ahead with the project 

</span><span>that  they  have in  mind. Then we will find out  whether it is  true that there is  money 

available. However, as we can all see, Mr Chairman, according to this budget there is 

$45,000 available and there is no more.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1737 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Honourable Member, Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Kia Orana to you, Mr Chairman, Kia Orana also to Honourable 

Members of this House and to our people listening in this afternoon. Through you, Mr 

Chairman, I would like to send words of condolences to Papa Tikaka Henry and the 

family for the passing away of our mama, Ani. May God bless you and comfort you 

all.  When I was going to school, Papa Tikaka Henry was the principal of the school in 

Tongareva.  In addition, he had a long association with the island of Penrhyn together 

with  his  children.  I grew up with  Dr Henry Tikaka and his sister Winnie.  May the 

Lord help us all in our time of grief. 

</span></div><div><span>I  come  back  to  the  appropriation  for  Internal  Affairs,  Mr  Chairman.  I  was  rather 

confused,  Mr  Chairman,  at  the  exact  amount  allocated  for  the  Rarotonga  Local 

Government.    Earlier, the Prime Minister stated that the sum of over $300,000 was 

</span><span>allocated  to  this  local  body  but  now  with  the  Amendment,  I  don’t  see  the  same 

</span><span>number  appearing  in  the  appropriation  for  the  rest  of  the  year.  As the Leader of the 

Opposition said, the nett appropriation for the Rarotonga local bodies is $45,000, not 

$269,000.  Later,  the  Prime  Minister  also  explained  that  there  have  been  some 

allocations  for the local  body from  the  Chinese aid  funds.  He continued to  say that 

$1.6  million  was  coming  from  the  Chinese  as  an  aid  package.  If  you  refer  to  the 

Schedule  9  of  the  Amendment  before  the  House,  it  was  noted  that  the  Chinese  was 

only  donating  $650,000  to  the country, last budget.  This  budget,  only $400,000 was 

allocated as Chinese aid.  Maybe the Prime Minister can elaborate on this, or are we 

still waiting for the $1.6 million aid money from the Chinese?  I am very concerned 

about this because quite often we rely on money that we may earn for Government. It 

was  only  six  months  ago  that  we  promised  the  local  Government  of  Rarotonga  the 

sum of just over $300,000. The question Mr Chairman is, what happens if the Chinese 

is not forth coming with their aid?  If the Chinese decide that t</span><span>hey can’t afford to give 

</span><span>us the money, who will suffer? My concern is the local body of Rarotonga will suffer 

because there is no allocation for Local Government. This is what actually happened 

to our budget - there was a short fall because there were no sales of the Government 

assets by the Cook Islands Investment Incorporated body, which is why we are short 

of funds for the earlier estimate of the budget. That is why there are so many deletions 

in the allocations for different departments.  

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Rei  Jack  said  that  the  Vaka  Council  is  doing  a  wonderful  job  in 

Rarotonga.  I totally agree with him.  At the same time, I also feel that we have let our 

Local Government down. While the people have contributed what they can afford in 

food,  where  is  the  contribution  from  the  Government?  In  fact,  we  have  treated  our 

local  bodies  with  some  contempt.    Just  go  back  to  the  time  when  they  were  elected 

and  they  were  confused  about  when  they  would  be  sworn-in  as  council members of 

Rarotonga.    It  took  quite  a  while  before  these  people  were  sworn  in  as  council 

members of Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>The  people  elected  on  the  three  Vaka  Councils  are  outstanding  people  from  the 

community. They are out there willingly to help the community, especially our Mayor 

from the district of Puaikura and his Councillors, who have gone ahead and done the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>1738 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>best  they  can  for  the  local  people  there.  I  did  not  see  any  contribution  from  the 

Government  in  the form  of machinery or some equipment to clean up the district of 

Puaikura.  Therefore,  if  it  cannot  support  our  Local  Government  by  monetary 

contributions,  surely  it  can  contribute  in  other  ways,  such  as  making  Government 

machinery available to  help  our people in  the districts.  There is concern in the local 

body councils that only a few of the elected ones are recognised as being eligible for 

the  Vaka  Council.  This  has  created  some  problems  for  some  </span><span>Kumiti  Oire</span><span>  who  was 

elected. In spite of the lack of funds allocated to our three Vaka Councils, let us help 

these people by assisting them and by giving them either tractor or whatever is needed 

to  help  the  work  in  the  villages.  I  was  also  approached  by  two  of  the  Mayors  of 

Rarotonga,  asking  our  help  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  Government  the  lack  of 

assistance  from  that  part  of  the  community.  It  is  very  difficult  for  them  to  achieve 

some of the work they are planning to do in the villages without these machinery or 

heavy equipment to do the work.  

</span></div><div><span>My concern here Mr Chairman is, </span><span>if there’s no allocation in this budget for the Local 

Government,  it  won’t  b</span><span>e  until  next  July  before  they  see  some  kind  of  financial 

assistance.  If  we  do  not  provide  for  our  Vaka  councils,  the  words  of  Papa  Pupuke 

</span><span>earlier  might  come  true.  I  am  sure  Members  of  this  House  do  not  want  us  to  be 

</span><span>referred  to  by  that  name.  It  is  sad  also  that  a  very  senior  member  of  Parliament  is 

referred to as being senile. If we look at the Scriptures, Abraham was twice the age of 

Papa Pupuke Robati.</span><span>Even as a very old man he was blessed with two sons, so before 

we throw stones let us be careful about what we say. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Mama Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:  </span><span>Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Chairman,  and  to  all  your  staff 

Members. Greetings to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Members, 

Government Members and the Opposition Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  the  budget  for  Internal  Affairs.  Like  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister  who  spoke  before  me  said,  this  is  one  of  the  places  where  our  elderly  and 

children get their support. I am thankful for the services provided by this Department 

but  I  am  sad  to  hear  that  the  mother  of  this  Department  has not  recovered from  her 

illness. I know this dear woman is a very hard working woman. 

</span></div><div><span>If  you  will  recall  last  Monday  Mr  Speaker,  I  spoke  regarding  the  Rarotonga  Local 

Government, that is, the lack of funds to support its work. I will not retract anything I 

</span><span>said.  I  rise  this  time  to  respond  to  the  Prime  Minister’s  comments  regarding  the 

</span><span>Rarotonga Local Government, who he says will be trained to administer their affairs.  

I  am  disappointed  because  these  Councillors  who  will  receive  training  are  already 

capable people. They already know how to run the country. What they really need is a 

little Government support in the form of funding. Like the Prime Minister said to me 

in  1997,  when  I  asked  him,  and  as  most  of  you  in  here  are  aware,  there  are  funds 

allocated  for  our  constituencies.  In  my  opinion,  it  is  we,  here  in  Parliament,  who 

should  receive  training  on  how  to  administer  our  constituency  funds  rather  than  the 

Local Government who only have to administer $1,000.00 per month. That is why we 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1739 

</span></div><div><span>have  come  to  this  -  we  had  to  elect  a  Local  Government  to  help  run  the  country.  If 

only the Members of Parliament had organised themselves earlier to administer their 

funds  carefully,  this  would  not  have  happened.  Therefore,  we  have  to  help  these 

Councillors  within  our  constituencies  because  we  have  no  other  choice.  This  is  the 

way for us to go forward. We must support and encourage each other.   

</span></div><div><span>Last  week I was  so sure, we were going to  get  some funding for our Vaka Council. 

However, we did not so the front-end loader we hired to fix the road at the eastern end 

of  the  airport  had  to  be  paid  for  out  of  my  own  pocket  again.  We  could  not  secure 

heavy machinery from the Ministry of Works to assist us because they were busy. We 

may  be  prepared  to  lend  a  hand  but  it  is  things  like  this  which  are  a  hindrance  to 

progress.  This  is  all  I  have  to  say  on  the  allocation,  Mr  Chairman.  I  support  the 

allocation for Internal Affairs.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Minister of Agriculture, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, Greetings to you to Honourable Members in the 

House, to the Prime Minister and my Cabinet colleagues, and to our people listening 

in, Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I rise to give my support to the budget allocation for Internal Affairs.  

My  only  disappointment  is,  when  this  allocation  arose,  we  were  heading  into  the 

electoral campaign period. All of us in this House are aware of the main Acts which 

govern the business of Government, which are the MFEM Act, PERCA Act, and the 

PSC Act. These Acts are our control. When I came back on Monday on the first day of 

this month when Parliament started, this is what the Leader of the NAP said to me in 

</span><span>that hut outside, “Have you heard of the new party’? I said, “Yes, they are called the 

People’s Party. I’ve heard they are going to put forward a candidate for Ngatangiia”. 

He  said,  “No,  it’s  a  Cook  Islands  Tumu  Party”.    I  laughed  and  said,  “That’s  an  old 

</span><span>story. This is what you and the Honourable Member Terepai Maoate are saying to try 

</span><span>and ruin our support”. </span></div><div><span>In fact, this morning I heard the Leader of the Opposition saying to Members on the 

Government side to support him as if he is in charge of them. I heard today that I am 

the one spreading the story that the CIP is breaking up. Mr Chairman, we are told by 

the  MFEM  Act  that  when we make an allocation in  Parliament, it is  not  to  be  done 

secretly.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR.T. MAOATE:  </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor.    What  is  your  Point  of 

Order?  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  with  due  respect  to  the  Minister,  he  is 

talking off the Vote Item. I have nothing to do with the New Alliance Party Member 

for  Ngatangiia  and  I  have  no  influence  over  the  selection  of  a  Cook  Islands  Tumu 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>1740 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Party candidate. I am saying, Mr Chairman, the Minister is irrelevant and he should be 

asked to come back to the Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>That is a point of explanation, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  I  was  trying  to  explain  the 

appropriation  for  the  Rarotonga  Local  Government  Act  as  required  under  the 

appropriation.  In July last year, this Parliament appropriated $300,000 for the Local 

Government. It was outlined by the Prime Minister and what it means is $269,000. If 

the rest of the Chinese money, or if the appropriation negotiations between ACC and 

the Chinese officials is not here in time, the Minister of Finance is required under the 

MFEM  Act  to  find  the  money  from  within  the  appropriation  already  amongst 

departments to meet that commitment. Parliament has already made that appropriation 

in July.  Similarly, if they have a deficit by 30th of June, it wo</span><span>n’t go and run away, it 

will stay there, in other words, if they bid for next year’s budget they will allow that 

</span><span>money to come back so they can pay their debts. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  know.  I  was  one  of  the  Ministries  that  was  hit  because  we  didn’t 

</span><span>understand the process. You know, for the Members of the Opposition, especially the 

Leader  of  the  Opposition  to  come  back  in  here  and  ignore  the  requirement  of  the 

legislation that is wrong.  There are three Acts in there, the MFEM Act, the PERCA 

Act  and  the  Public  Service  Act.    If  they  need  machines  -  sure,  they  go  and  ask  the 

HOMs because those people have to account to MFEM their expenditure of fuel and 

the  time  they  run  those  machines.    Nobody  in  this  House  can  deny  that  they  do not 

know the Act. The MFEM Act sets out how the appropriations are to be spent by the 

Departments. As a followup on their expenditure, PERCA has been granted the right 

to go and audit them. It is established by the Act on how the appropriations are to be 

spent. So why are we doing this? Because it is politics. It is politics. This is why when 

I  started  speaking,  I  said  I  was  saddened  that  this  good  deed  was  done  at  electoral 

campaign  time.  The  nature  has  been  changed  by  politics  because  this  is  a campaign 

period. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>It’s you</span><span>r job. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  The Leader of the Opposition is saying it is our job, fine, but it 

</span><span>is  not  our responsibility, Mr Chairman.  It is the HOM’s responsibility because they 

</span><span>have been given the responsibility by Parliament to spend their budget. So go and see 

them. Yes, the legislation is quite clear, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> You have no right. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  I am not saying I have no right.  I am saying that I have every 

right to bring back the legislation that was established by this House in here.  

</span></div><div><span>For the Leader of the Opposition to say to me I have no right - I have every right in 

</span><span>here  because  that’s  our  job  in  here.  We  are  here  to  formulate  relevant  legislation  to 

</span><span>allow  our  people  to  develop  this  country.  That  is  what  we  should  be  doing  and  we 

should all be supporting the legislation that we all agreed in  here. Support  our local 

Cook Islanders who are running it. Sure, because it is something new to us, we will go 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1741 

</span></div><div><span>wrong.  Who can do the right things all the time?  Even if the Lord Jesus was to come 

down right now, we would still criticise Him. 

</span></div><div><span>I thought that we would come into this House and encourage the Local Government 

on the island of Rarotonga. They are lucky they got $92,000 at the outset, meanwhile, 

we in the Outer Islands got only $2,000, $3,000 and $4,000. He is complaining about 

</span><span>$269,000,  that’s  what  I’m  talking  about.  That’s  what  I’m  saying.  They  are  saying 

there’s nothing in here.  I am saying there is. We are the people who created the law. It 

</span><span>is  there  in  the  Appropriations,  it  </span><span>wasn’t  hidden.  If  we  put  $300,000.00  in  there  last 

July, it should be there, and it hasn’t disappeared. This is why I mentioned the HOMs 

</span><span>because they have to account for their spending. When they request any amount from 

MFEM  for  expenditure  in  their  departments  each  month,  they  have  to  give  a  good 

</span><span>reason.  They  will  be  asked  ‘why  do  you  need  a  four</span><span>-</span><span>wheel  drive?’  They  are  still 

saying  there’s  nothing  there.  If  they  still  think  there  is  nothing  there  then  let  them 

</span><span>believe that but let Government get on with wh</span><span>at they are supposed to do. You don’t 

</span><span>give  public  money  to  somebody  who  will  spend  it  on  something  else  for  his  own 

pleasure.  They  are  the  very  people  who  complained  to  the  Government  that  money 

was  being  wasted,  so  Government  created  some  laws  to  make  its  spending  open  to 

</span><span>scrutiny, to make it more transparent to the public. Still, they say we are trying to hide 

</span><span>our spending.   

</span></div><div><span>The  law  controls  the  Minister.  When  the  Vaka  Councils  of  Rarotonga  learn  how  to 

administer their budgets carefully, the Minister will be able to come back in the next 

financial  year  to  explain  how  they  spent  their  budgets.  The  Scripture  verse  this 

morning, Psalm 115, tells us that they have eyes but they cannot see, they have ears, 

</span><span>but they will not listen, they have fingers with which to touch but they won’t, and they 

have legs to walk but they don’t want to walk. I am trying to explain what I believe 

</span><span>the law is telling us.  This is the way I understand it. We did this last year and in 1997 

we created the PERCA. The MFEM was created the year before that.  Therefore, Mr 

Chairman, I support this Appropriation for the Local Government of Rarotonga, and I 

would urge the Local Government Councillors to come to the Seminar this evening so 

they will learn how to prioritise their projects. Therefore, whoever is in Government 

</span><span>after 1st July, they will be required by law to justify their expenditure. It’s as simple as 

</span><span>that, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>Again, Mr Chairman, I give my support to this Vote Item and I would like to ask the 

</span><span>Local  Government  Councillors  on  Rarotonga  to  come  to  this  Seminar.  After  this 

</span><span>Seminar,  they  will  fully  understand  exactly  what  is  required,  and  I  am  sure  some 

money will be available for them to start their projects. Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Thomas Hewett from Tautu-Vaipae. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you this afternoon, Kia 

Orana also to your staff.  Kia Orana also to the Prime Minister, to the Deputy Prime 

Minister, to all Cabinet Ministers and to all Government Members - Kia Orana in the 

name of Our Lord.  Kia Orana also to the Leader of the DAP and your Members, to 

the Leader of NAP and your Members.  Kia Orana also in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>1742 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this point, Mr Chairman, through you, to send my Greetings to the land 

of my birth.  In addition, through you, Mr Chairman, on behalf of my wife and family, 

as  well  as  my  constituency,  I  would  like  to  send  condolences  to  the  family  of  our 

Papa, Papa Tikaka Henry, in their time of grief. This man, Mr Chairman, was one of 

the  strongest  supporters  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party  on the island and was very much 

involved in religious and other groups on the island.  May God help them and comfort 

them in their bereavement.  

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to everyone in the religious sector on the island of Araura and to all 

the members of your churches. Kia Orana also to the Ui Ariki, the Ui Mataiapo, and 

the Mayor and the Island Councillors on the island, Kia Orana to you all.  Kia Orana 

also  to  all the people in  my electorate, to  the people of Tautu-Vaipae-Vaipeka.  Kia 

Orana to you all.  Your Member is still going strong and it will not be long before we 

all meet again.  

</span></div><div><span>I will come back to the Appropriation before us today, Mr Chairman, but I will not be 

too long on it. I would like to ask leave of you again, please, Mr Chairman. I have just 

</span><span>received  some  news  that  a  mama  from  my  constituency,  Mama  Tavake  Kapena  has 

</span><span>just passed away and I would like to send my condolences to the family. May I also 

send the condolences of my wife and family, and that of my electorate, Tautu-Vaipae-

Vaipeka. Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>I will come now to the Appropriation before us.  I am now talking about the allocation 

for the Ministry of Internal  Affairs. For a long while I have listened  carefully to the 

</span><span>views  of  other  Members  who  spoke  earlier  on  this  Vote  Item,  now  it’s  my  turn  to 

</span><span>present  my  views.  I  would  like  to  give  my  support  and  I  thank  the  staff  of  this 

Ministry and its  Minister for the allocation to this Ministry. I have a proverb, which 

</span><span>says, “the blind leads the blind into the hole”.  Mr Chairman, the Leader of the DAP 

</span><span>rose  and  tried  to  lead  others  astray  through  misinformation.  He  was  not  aware  that 

there is money available somewhere. Then the Leader of the CIP rose and explained 

why there were delays with the Local Government funds. He also explained the reason 

for  the  amount  allocated.  Then  another  Member  of  the  DAP,  the  Honourable  Dr 

Pupuke  Robati,  rose  to  speak  in  the  same  </span><span>‘kokekoke’</span><span>  fashion  (on  this  occasion,  Mr 

Chairman,  I  believe  </span><span>‘kokekoke’</span><span>  means  to  be  misinformed).  Then  the  Honourable 

Member Dr Robert Woonton also stood to give his point of view.  

</span></div><div><span>It was already explained, Mr Chairman, that the request for funding was already put to 

the Chinese Government and we are now waiting for it to arrive. I believe, because I 

am  a  member  of  this  Government  that  this  money  for  the  Rarotonga  Local 

Government will arrive any day now. You see, Mr Chairman, I am not a person who 

has  doubts.  I  do  not  have  a  </span><span>‘kokekoke’</span><span>  attitude.  I  have  a  firm  belief  that  things  will 

happen.  Then  Honourable  Member,  Ngamau  Munokoa  rose  to  speak.  She  suggests 

that  some  of  us  members  of  Government  have  misused  funds.  She  says  we  have 

wasted it. I would like them to go to Vaipeka, Vaipae and Tautu and see what good I 

</span><span>have done with this money in my constituency. They do not want to see the benefits. 

</span><span>They  would  rather  remain  blind  and  be  led  by  the  blind into  a hole. I would like to 

assure them that Thomas Hewett would not lose his seat in this next General Election, 

because Mr Chairman, Thomas Hewett has done some good work in his constituency. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1743 

</span></div><div><span>Thomas Hewett has not wasted the money, he has done all this work so the big eyes 

and the small eyes can see where all the money has gone. Today, my people are very 

happy because of the things that I have done for them and they have assured me that I 

will stay in my seat until the day I die.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Chairman, regarding the Seminar this evening, for the Mayors, for the 

Konitara Tutara, to try to explain to them what is expected of them - the Opposition 

does  not  want  it  to  happen.    Mr  Chairman,  like  any  other  profession,  you  require 

training. Be it a doctor, a mechanic, or any other job, you need training. Sure, they are 

capable  people  but  they  need  training  so  that  they  become  more  proficient  in  their 

work.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>I am sorry to have to interrupt you, Honourable Member, but it’s 

</span><span>time  to  adjourn.    I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  to  move  for  us  to  report  back  to 

Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I move:  

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
