<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Clause 1, Short Title.  Interrupted debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you,</span><span>Mr Chairman, I raised the matter regarding the 

commencement date of this Amendment Bill after it is passed. I looked in the Bill but 

I  cannot  find  where  it  says  when  it  will  be  applied  in  May.  Perhaps  the  Minister  in 

charge would be able to give some indication because once this is passed, what is in 

</span><span>the Bill will make a lot of difference to what we are doing and what we will be doing 

</span><span>in the next few months. I know the application of the Bill as a whole is recommended 

by the Political Review Commission but the details of the drafting of the Bill has been 

left for further consideration. But now that we see the Amendment to the Electoral Act 

has been brought to the House, it appears it is being rushed, Mr Chairman.  It should 

have  been  left  for  further  discussion  and  research  so  we  could  be  sure  if  this  is  the 

right  answer.  We  need  to  be  sure  if  the  contents  of  the  Amendment  are  satisfactory 

and suitable to the aim that the Amendment is trying to get to. There is no doubt in my 

mind,  Mr  Chairman,  what  the  Committee  recommended  in  general  terms  have  been 

</span><span>reflected in this draft Bill but the details are the Government’s.    </span></div><div><span>I  have  already  expressed  my  concern  about  the  individual’s  </span><span>rights  in  view  of  the 

Constitution,  especially  in  terms  of  the  Fundamental  Human  Rights  and  Freedoms. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 47</a></div><div><span>1964 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  uppermost  in  every  law  we  pass  in  this  House.  I  am  expressing  my  concern 

about the application of the Act once the House passes it. Maybe it is going to be more 

difficult if I request for an amendment to this Bill. Whereas if we look at the dates of 

application of this that will probably satisfy everybody for the time being.  Thank you, 

Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, I am seeking the Leave of the House.  Would it 

be  possible  for  the  House  to  agree  to  leave  Clause  1  and  move  on  to  the  next  one 

because we are expecting an amendment to come through.  When it is ready then we 

will go back to Clause 1.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I would like to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 be Postponed </span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 of the Bill be Postponed? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>Clause 1 is postponed. 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 2.  Tenure of office.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Clause 2 talks about the tenure of office. In this Clause the electors 

are given the right to recall their Members and as such, it may lead to a dismissal of 

the Member from his seat. I am not sure what the legal opinion on this will be but I 

suspect  this  Clause  is  encroaching  on  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  which 

provides for the authority of the Members. If that is the case, I am suggesting that this 

Bill be required to comply with the terms for amending the Constitution.  That is, it be 

left  to  lie  for  a  90  day  period,  very  much  similar  to  the  other  Constitution 

Amendments which we pas</span><span>sed. I haven’t researched this fully but I think it may affect 

</span><span>our Constitutional rights if we pass it. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span> MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 48</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1965 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Mr Chairman, I am having difficulty with the way we are 

going through the clauses.  We have postponed Clause 1 Short Title.  Now we are on 

Clause 2, Tenure of Office which indicates that there is a requirement for two thirds of 

</span><span>a Member’s electors in his or</span><span> her Constituency under section 2(a) of this Act. 

</span></div><div><span>We can compare that with Clause 3, the new part, which is Part IIA.  I suppose this is 

as drafted. Then we go on to Clause 4 - the nomination of candidates, and then it goes 

on to  Clause 7 where it indicates Part VIA which is  Campaign Period and Electoral 

Expenditure.  So I suppose the clauses are still in order but these big headings of Part 

IIA  are  just  parts  of  those  clauses  such  as  Clause  3  and  Clause  7.    Am  I  right  Mr 

Chairman?    So  now,  the  Minister  has  advised  me  that  this  is  the  case.  I  am  just 

concerned why this Part IIA - Petition of Electors in big letters, capital letters is under 

Clause 3. 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  will  come  back  then  to  Clause  2,  Mr  Chairman,  regarding  the tenure of office. 

The  new  paragraph  says  t</span><span>hat  “not  less  than  two</span><span>-</span><span>thirds  of  electors  of  the  Member’s 

constituency  support  a  petition  conducted  in  accordance  with  Part  IIA  of  this  Act” 

</span><span>which, in my view, Mr Chairman, will extend the debate inadvertently into Clause 3.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  looking,  Mr  Chairman,  at  the  life  span  or  the  term  of  office  of  a  Member  of 

Parliament,  whether  it  is  five,  four  or  three  years.    I  support  the  idea  of  two-thirds 

electors because if it is  more than half of the electors. I have no doubt that Part IIA 

clarifies the grounds upon which petitions can be made. The question here is why are 

we creating this  Act? Which of you Government Members performed badly and did 

not do your work while you were in Government? Which of you were sacked for not 

doing the job? And who of you in Government are trying to introduce it through this 

Bill?  

</span></div><div><span>We, in the Opposition, cannot do anything because you will not give us any money or 

machinery with which to do our work. We have had no Constituency Funds since you 

came to power. This Bill applies to you. If only you had introduced this Bill in 1994-

95, or before, it would have been the appropriate time because it was then that your 

weaknesses  which  wrecked  the  country,  were  discovered.  The  appropriate  time  for 

you to have brought this Bill was the time when you sent our public servants home. 

</span><span>That  was  the  best  time  for  this  Bill  to  be  implemented.  It  wasn’t  until  the  ADB 

</span><span>brought in its Reform programme that you paid any attention to what we were saying.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> I will ask you Honourable Member to come back to the point. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am trying to work out who is 

</span><span>responsible  for  causing  this  Bill  to  be  brought  into  the  House.  I  am  sure  it’s  not  us 

</span><span>because we are not currently running the country. As I came through the corridor, Mr 

Chairman,  I  heard  my  brother-in-law  at  the  back  there,  the  Minister  of  Education, 

</span><span>calling  us  ‘buffoons’  and  other  insults.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  newspaper 

</span><span>accused us of not fighting Government enough, which is why all these problems have 

</span><span>occurred.  We  have  been  fighting  this  Government,  Mr  Chairman,  since  1992.  We 

</span><span>noticed the economy was declining since 1992 and we said so, but they told us that we 

were politicking. This Political Reform Commission has been of help. They listened 

to them. But the problems are not new, we have talked about them for a long time - 

</span></div><div><a>Page 49</a></div><div><span>1966 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>we  are  in  trouble,  we  are  in  trouble,  we  said  -  but  they  told  us  we  were  just  being 

nervous and all sorts of other negative things. That is why I was surprised to hear my 

brother-in-law saying that this is news to him. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>He worries me some times. You’re a source of concern. You have 

</span><span>a nasty streak in you.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  An  opinion  was  raised  by  the  Honourable  Dr  Pupuke 

Robati  on  this  Clause  </span><span>–</span><span>  that  is  if  this  is  what  is  happening  we  should  consider  this 

</span><span>Clause carefully. I don’t want us to make mistakes in front of our people. I don’t want 

</span><span>us  to  make  the  wrong  choices.  While  we  are  postponing  Clause  1,  we  also  need  to 

look into Clause 2 to make sure it is right. Maybe we need to postpone it too.  

</span></div><div><span>The  most  important  question  here  is,  why  is  this  Bill  being  brought  in  now?  The 

Deputy Prime Minister said earlier that the reason for this, as shown in the Report, is 

that our people are fed up because Election times in the past were a great burden for 

our people. The Reform Committee looked into this matter and recommended that the 

campaign period be shortened. When you enter into politics you must be aware that 

you will spend a lot of money. It is a fool who does not know  that. You are not the 

only one who will be spending a lot of money but your Committee also will suffer, as 

will your constituency. We all know that the Cook Islands Party is one of the biggest 

spenders  during  campaign  time.  There  was  one  election  campaign  where  they  had 

these  huge  portraits  of  the  Prime  Minister  all  over  the  roads,  which  must  have  cost 

$200 to  $300 each. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> I would like you to come back to Clause 2, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I just want to ascertain why this 

Bill was brought into this House.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  criticising  this  Government,  Mr  Chairman,  because  it  was  through  their 

mismanagement that we ended up with this Bill.  I support Clause 2, Mr Chairman. I 

want  to  see  that  any  Member  of  Parliament,  or  even  the  Government,  can  be 

petitioned. What  I really want  to  see is  a change to  this Clause, that is, if the Prime 

Minister is at fault, petition the whole Government, not just him. That is the problem. 

If  only  he  had  stepped  down  and  somebody  better  had  taken  over  then  our  country 

</span><span>wouldn’t  have  been  ruined.  You  see,  Mr  Chairman,  these  people  cannot  keep  the 

</span><span>Prime  Minister  under control. If I was in  the Party in  charge, he would surrender to 

me. I have no doubt about that. That is why I broke away. Half the party came with me 

</span><span>and  the  other  half  went  with  him.  These  Members  sitting  at  the  back  here  are  ‘yes</span><span>-

</span><span>men’. They say ‘Yes Minister, Yes Prime Minister’ all the time. </span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I thought you have reminded the Leader of the 

Opposition often enough that he is out of order. Irrelevancy. We are debating Clause 2 

- Tenure of Office. He is talking about the Government. It has nothing to do with the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 50</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1967 

</span></div><div><span>Tenure  of  Office  of  Members  of  Parliament.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  Prime 

Minister.  We  all  know  he  is  stubborn  and  he  is  envious  of  the  Prime  Minister.  He 

wants to be the Prime Minister which is why he tries to tear him down constantly. But 

the Prime Minster is too smart and too good for him. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister. Please come back to Clause 

2, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.</span><span>The  Deputy  Prime  Minister 

seems to have forgotten</span><span>that it was he and the Prime Minister who ran me down just 

recently  -  calling  me  stupid  for  reminding  them  of  the  things  they  did.  I  have  done 

nothing wrong and they call me names. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please come back to Clause 2. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  But  I  am  not  happy  about  the 

way  they  are  behaving.  When  I  say  something  they  jump  up  to  complain.  I  am  just 

wondering why this Clause is brought in and what the justification for it are? I have no 

faults  that  will  cause  my  people  in  Ngatangiia  to  stand  up  and  petition  me.  Why  is 

that? Because I am working for my constituency. I am not running the Government.  I 

am not the one who signed the Letters of Guarantee, I am not the one who sent 2,000 

</span><span>public servants home. It’s not me, and don’t blame me. I am not the one who  </span><span>drove 

5,000 people out of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, you know the Leader of Opposition is still being stubborn. He is still 

</span><span>being irrelevant. The Standing Order is applicable but he doesn’t want to abide by it. 

He doesn’t</span><span> want to talk on Clause 2, instead he talks a lot of rubbish. We don't want to 

waste our time listening to  his  rubbish. He should take it home. He should suppress 

his  anger  and  jealousy.  He  has  no  choice.  We  are  not  talking  about  that.  We  are 

talking  about  Clause  2  -  </span><span>Tenure  of  Office.  If  he  doesn’t  have  anything  to  say  on  

</span><span>Clause 2, he should sit down and shut up. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>   Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister. Honourable Member I think 

this is the fourth time I have tried to ask you to come back to Clause 2. This may be 

</span><span>the last. So may I humbly ask you to please come back to Clause 2?   

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR.  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  fully  aware  of  the 

</span><span>consequences of avoiding your ruling. And I don’t need anybody from the back row to 

</span><span>tell me what the consequences are. They are not the Speaker, you are Mr Chairman.   

They are acting as  if they are the Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:  </span><span>Point  of  Order.  He  is  not  talking  on  the  Clause  2,  Mr 

Chairman.  He  is  trying    to  argue  with  you  on  the  ruling.  See  how  arrogant  and 

stubborn he is. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  The main thing I wanted to talk about, Mr Chairman, is in 

Clause 3, as mentioned earlier. The amendment of Clause 2 is referring to Clause 3, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 51</a></div><div><span>1968 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>which is  the establishment of the new part, which is  Part  </span><span>IIA. But I can’t help... Mr 

</span><span>Chairman,  can you advise  me whether I can speak on the content of Clause 3 as well, 

because the Clause 3 establishes the meaning of Part IIA. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>No you can’t. </span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Do you see, Mr Speaker, I am asking the question and he is 

answering it from the back there?  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  As  a  rule  Honourable  Member,  I  cannot  allow  you  to  speak  on 

Clause 3. Please concentrate on  Clause 2. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> See, a simple answer. You know, it is comments like this 

</span><span>from  the  back  row  there  that  annoys  me.  However,  there  isn’t  really  much  in  the 

</span><span>clause 2 here so I will defer the detailing of my opinions on Part IIA when we come to 

Clause 6. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I AKARURU: </span><span>Hooray.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> When it comes to the application of this Part II, I want the 

constituency for Pukapuka to be the first one to petition their Member. Mr Chairman, 

when  the  Island  Council  election  was  conducted  on  the  island  there  were  a  lot  of 

problems there. They had to charter a flight to Pukapuka  just to  check whether these 

things  were real. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, thank you, Honourable Member.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> The result, Mr Chairman, was negative.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Point of Order. Mr Chairman, the only way to fix this stubborn 

Member  for  not  respecting  the  Chair,  is  to  throw  the  book  at  him.  Give  him  a 

Marching Order to get him out.  Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span> (Commotion in the House) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  us  all  this  evening.  Mr 

Chairman,  I  rise  to  ask  for  an  explanation  from  the  better  English-speakers  in  this 

House to explain these Clauses. Mr Chairman, when we look at the Clauses 2 and 3 

we can see that  they are almost identical.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Please stay on Clause 2. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> I am talking about Clause 2. As I said, Clauses 2 and 3 are alike. If 

you look at Clause 2, the best interpretation for it is in Clause 3. In Clause 2 it says no  

less  than  two-thirds  of  electors  of    the  Member  of    the  constituency  is  required  to 

support the  petition and explanation for that is in Clause 3. I think, Mr Chairman, it is 

only fair  that we should deal  with Clauses 2 and 3 together. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 52</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1969 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I do not understand what the objection in Clause 2 is about. Clause 3 

states  the  reasons  for  petitions.    I  have  nothing  to  say  about  Clause  2  but  I  do have 

something  to  say  about  Clause  3.  You  are  right,  Mr  Chairman.  We  should  move  to 

Clause 3 where much more can be said about it.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Chairman,</span><span>I would like to return to this Clause. We know that 

we, Members in  this House, are more or less permanent once we are elected, that is  

until the next Election, or you resign, or you are mentally ill, or you failed to attend 

Parliament for more than 14 days, or you are convicted of an offence. What we have 

here is a new disqualification which I believe encroaches on the Constitution. Which 

is why I asked a  question on this earlier. If this is the case, this Bill will be invalid 

until certain procedures are followed for all Constitutional amendments, that is a two-

thirds majority is achieved and a period of 90 days has lapsed before the third reading. 

I waited for the Honourable Member Paul Temm to explain this but he did not. I still 

await an explanation from this Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:    </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  to  make  a  brief  comment  on  Clause  2. 

The question raised earlier was why we are doing this in Clause 2? The simple answer 

is  that  this  is  one  of  the  recommendations  from  the  Political  Review  Commi</span><span>ssion’s 

</span><span>Report.  Government  is  making  use  of  the  recommendation  by  the  Political  Reform 

Commission  hence the Bill before the House.  We can find that recommendation on 

Page 10 of the Report of the Political Reform Commission. This is what Government 

is  doing  today.    This  is  not  something  that  Government  thought  up  by  itself, 

Government  is  making  use  of  the  recommendation  by  the  Political  Review 

Commission. I am happy that Government has done this.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:    </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  this  Bill  has  brought  a  lot  of  trauma  into  this 

</span><span>House and the manner in which it was dropped on the House’s lap one hour before it 

</span><span>was  introduced  with  its  deep  implications,  is  quite  unsettling.    I  appreciate  that  the 

</span><span>Clause  here  is  adding  another  ground  about  the  Tenure  of  Office  of  a  Member  of 

</span><span>Parliament.  Quite clearly the tenure of office of Members of Parliament are defined in 

the Constitution.  It gives the grounds upon which a Member of Parliament can lose 

his seat.  Now this new section in Part IIA of this Act is a new ground.  I think they 

</span></div><div><a>Page 53</a></div><div><span>1970 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>call  it  the  Right  to  Recall.    Mr  Chairman,  I  agree  with  the Honourable Member, Dr 

Pupuke  Robati  when  he  said  this  does  touch  on  the  Constitution.  We  have  a 

Constitution  that  defines  the  tenure  of  office  for  Members  of  Parliament.  This  new 

Clause has to be added to the Constitution.  If we are going to pass this it still would 

have no effect in law unless the Constitution is amended to include this. Quite clearly 

this  Clause  touches  on  the  removal  from  office  of  a  Member  of  Parliament,  so  I 

wonder if the Minister of Justice has checked with his advisers in Crown Law because 

you do not want to put something like this in only to find later it is invalid because the 

Constitution has not been amended.   

</span></div><div><span>I  appreciate  the  protective  measures  that  are  built  into  this  so  that  when  a  Member 

</span><span>from your Constituency takes a sudden dislike to you, because you didn’t buy him a 

beer or you didn’t take him to dinner, then he coul</span><span>d go around collecting a petition to 

get  you  recalled.    I  see  this  is  a  costly  exercise.  Part  IIA  covers  the  grounds  as 

covering the actions to be taken to put this tenure of office clause into effect Part IIA, 

Mr  Chairman,  defines  the  grounds  and  also  states  the  details  of  the  application  to 

conduct a petition.  

</span></div><div><span>That is one of the strangest petitions I have ever seen.  First, it says you cannot do it in 

</span><span>the first year, then it says you cannot do it in the last year, then it says you can only do 

it in the second and third year.  I am actually amazed at the grounds stated in Part IIA.   

</span><span>The first ground for a petition is, “has without good cause habitually failed to attend 

sitting days of Parliament”.  Immediately, I can see two Government Members losing 

</span><span>their  seats  or  being  subjected  to  recall  for  this.  Our  dear  friend,  the  Honourable  Dr 

Joseph  Williams  would  be  the  first  and  the  second,  the  Prime  Minister,  because 

between the two of them, I think they hold the record of non-attendance in the House.   

</span></div><div><span>Anoth</span><span>er  one  says,  “has  neglected  to  consult  with  and  report  to  the  Member’s 

</span><span>constituents  on  matters  that  significantly  affect  them  and  which  come  within  the 

</span><span>responsibility of the Member as a Member of Parliament”.  According to Cook Islands 

</span><span>Party  Members  of  Tak</span><span>uvaine,  the  Prime  Minister  is  guilty  of  this  and  then  (c)  “has 

neglected to convey to Government the requirements of the Member’s constituents..”.  

My  goodness,  how  many  times  have  we  gone  to  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office  to 

</span><span>complain about things that are needed in our constituency and how many times have 

</span><span>we been kicked out of the Prime Minister’s Office without getting anything at all?</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  don’t  know  whether  you  remember  a  fund  called  the  Constituency 

</span><span>Fund.  Well,  ever  since  this  Government  came into  power ten years ago they abused 

this provision and kept all the Constituency Funds for themselves. Our Constituency 

</span><span>in Atiu has never received any of the Constituency Funds for ten years.  It’s a record 

</span><span>and I find the Prime Minister particularly cruel as far as this is concerned. 

</span></div><div><span>The last ground for a petition, Mr Chairman that a Member has become unfit to hold 

office  as  a  Member  of  Parliament  for  reasons  of  serious  misconduct,  such  that  the 

Member is held in disrepute.  Hello, hello, hello, I wonder whom this is referring to. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Bring your mind back on to Clause 2, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 54</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1971 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> This Clause does touch on to Clause 2, Mr Chairman. I was just 

having  a  nibble  around  the  edges  before  I  return.  So,  Mr  Chairman,  this  is  an 

interesting  provision.  I  wonder  if  this  provision  was  available  before,  whether  some 

</span><span>Members would be recalled because of it?  I don’t know.</span></div><div><span>I just want to assure this House, Mr Chairman that I have a very, very strict code with 

all the Members and candidate</span><span>s of the New Alliance Party.  I don’t need legislation to 

</span><span>say so. They know it. Any misbehaviour - </span><span>they are down the road! We don’t need a 

petition.  We  don’t  need  specific  laws  for  it  because  if  a  political  party  has  strict 

</span><span>discipline, if their leader is strict about discipline, everybody knows where they stand. 

It should be left to the leader to do his own thing and a weak leader will not be able to 

do anything.  A weak leader will allow things to happen and you can be assured, Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, I’m an ex</span><span>-cop and a tough one at that. Any misconduct in my Party will be 

dealt with  very, very sternly. I was  not  a bad cop  - </span><span>don’t say that or the people will 

</span><span>think badly of me. I was a gentle but firm cop.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I’m about to conclude my comments about this. It’s a sort of dubious 

provision. I like some parts of it but I don’t like the other because it is prohibitive. The  

</span><span>petitioners will pay for the petition, it will cost them a lot. I am also disappointed, Mr 

Chairman, that no provision is made to punish those who make false petitions against 

a Member. You see, Mr Chairman, somebody might take a dislike of me. Say a top- 

</span><span>heavy  businessman  with  heaps  of  money.  He will go away saying ‘I will fix you, I 

will pay for a petition to have you recalled’. So, he’s go</span><span>t the money, he will throw it 

in.  He will pay for everything.  He will give me considerable trouble. He will arrange 

for his stooges to go into my electorate and collect the signatures. You see, they could 

have  gatherings  where  food  is  given,  BBQs,  beer,  then  somebody  rallying  to  get 

people to sign a petition. It can be done.  What I am saying is, Mr Chairman, that is 

</span><span>the  tragedy  of  this  provision.  There’s  nothing  to  punish  a  false  petitioner.  There 

</span><span>should be a serious penalty for somebody who lodges a false petition. They should be 

thrown into prison if it is found out that they are lying, their actions are malicious and 

</span><span>they are just trying to destroy the Member of Parliament because they didn’t like him.  

</span><span>You see, this reflects, this reflects - a lot of </span><span>Members of this House don’t realise it </span><span>- 

this  reflects  the  bias  that  the  Political  Review  Commission  had  against  Members  of 

</span><span>Parliament.  They  didn’t  recommend  any  protection  for  the  Members  of  Parliament. 

</span><span>All they recommended was  getting rid of Members. 

</span></div><div><span>A</span><span>nd  the  other  provision,  I’ll  just  mention  it  before  I  sit  down,  Mr  Chairman.    The 

</span><span>other provision that I have an intense dislike for is the right of somebody overseas to 

</span><span>send a postal declaration. How do they know about your misbehaviour if they’ve gone 

</span><span>ov</span><span>erseas?    Mr  Chairman,  how  can  they  tell  that  I  haven’t  been  to  Parliament  when 

</span><span>they  are  living  in  Sydney  for  the  last  two  years?    How  can  he  tell?  Does  he  treat 

himself as somebody to be consulted?  Does the consultation provision apply to him 

in Sydney that I have to go to Sydney to tell him what is happening in Atiu? So could 

</span><span>he petition, if I don’t go to Sydney to report the activities in the House and in Atiu?  

Of course, Mr Chairman, this is a wild card. I’m just throwing the hypothetical extent 

</span><span>of how far this absurdity can be spread.  

</span></div><div><span>I really object to people who have left the electorate exercising a postal declaration in 

support of a petition to recall you when they are not living in the electorate. It should 

</span></div><div><a>Page 55</a></div><div><span>1972 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>be confined to people living in the electorate. I think this is taking the right of recall 

too far to allow for postal declarations. 

</span></div><div><span>As I say, Mr Chairman, that concludes my comments about this Clause.  I do have a 

lot more to say about later Clauses.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Tepai Tepai. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TEPAI:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman. Kia Orana to you this evening, Kia Orana 

also to your staff.  Kia Orana also to all Honourable Members in this House, those in 

Government  and  to  the  two  leaders  in  the  Opposition  and  to  your  Members  -  Kia 

Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I rose, Mr Chairman, to give my views on this Clause 2.  I have read it over and over 

</span><span>and still I can’t come to grasp the meaning in here. I don’t want to go over the ground 

</span><span>that has been covered by the Leader of NAP because he has given his explanation on 

Clause 2.  I just have a problem with this Clause where it says that there should be no 

less than two-thirds majority.  Mr Chairman, we know there are three  Parties today. 

You know, Mr Chairman, what if a New Alliance Party Candidate wins but the other 

two parties  get together causing the New Alliance Party  Member to get out. As we 

know, Mr Chairman after the election it </span><span>won’t  be that  everybody will stay  enemies.  

</span><span>There will come  a time that everybody will come together and  be friends again. This 

</span><span>part  worries  because  today  we  don’t  really  trust  people  in  parties.  Those  are  my 

</span><span>problems that I just like to show these to everybody, Mr Chairman. Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member      Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable, Dr Robert Woonton 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman, on this  rather cool evening , 

because  it  was  warm  earlier  on.  Kia  Orana  also  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  this  

House. A special  welcome and Kia Orana to all our people listening in. I rose,  Mr  

Chairman,  to    get  my  views  on  this  Amendment  to  our  Electoral  Act.  While  the 

intention  of  the  Clause,  in  principle,    is  a  good  one,  it  gives  our  people  a  means  of 

recalling    their    Members  of  Parliament.  Earlier    this  afternoon    I  expressed  my 

support   to this particular Clause. However, Mr Chairman, since I have been advised 

by constitutional experts, I have discovered a deficiency. 

</span></div><div><span>The part that is deficient, Mr Chairman, is the protection of Members of  Parliament.   

Members  of    Parliament  in  this  Amendment  have  no  recourse  for  any  unjustified 

petition  against  them.  In  fact,  Mr  Chairman,  I    firmly  believe  that  the  law    should 

protect not only the candidate or the Member of Parliament but also the Members in 

</span><span>their  constituencies.  I  was  also  advised  that  these  amendments    cannot  be  effected 

</span><span>until  we  change  the  Constitution,  especially  the    part  where  we  can  disqualify 

Members  of  Parliament  from  their  seats.  Even  if  we  pass  this  law  tonight  it  will  be 

unconstitutional.    

</span></div><div><a>Page 56</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1973 

</span></div><div><span>I am very touchy with this Clause because I went through and experienced the effect a 

false accusation of a forced petition against a Member. I was one of  those Members 

affected. I will, if you  permit me, Mr Chairman, to describe my experience   where a 

petition  was  drawn against me.    I shall be very brief.  I was called to attend  to a 

young man who fell off a coconut tree in Manihiki. In fact he was unconscious after 

</span><span>falling from a tall tree and severely hurt. I didn’t  go voluntarily  to see this person.  In 

</span><span>fact, the family to attend to their son who fell off a coconut tree dragged me.   As the 

only doctor on the island, I attended this young man. The nurse came  and  gave me a 

hand, we put this young  man in the hospital and treated him.   At no time  did I attend 

</span><span>to this boy without  the nurses or any other of the family being present.  I don’t want 

</span><span>to    go  too  much  into  details.    However, the following day I arranged for this young 

man  to  travel  with  me  back  to  the  main  hospital  in  Rarotonga.  I  arranged  his 

admission  to  the    Rarotonga  hospital,  and  the  ambulance  was  there  to  pick  him  up.   

The next day somebody went up to the hospital and got this young man to sign that I 

tried  to  persuade  him  to  vote  for  me.  To  my  surprise,  Mr  Chairman,  he  signed  it 

together  with  10  other  witnesses.  When  I  heard  what  has  transpired,    it    hurt  me 

</span><span>because as a doctor,  my priority is to look after his health and it’s not his vo</span><span>te I was 

</span><span>after. At  no stage did I  ask him or insinuate to this boy to cast his vote for me. This is  

</span><span>the    kind  of    cheap  shot  to  get    a  Member  of  Parliament  to  be  disqualified.    The 

petition went  on and on and listed everything else that I have done, as a doctor, not as 

</span><span>a  person,  but  as  a  doctor.  The  saddest  thing  is,  Mr  Chairman,  I  couldn’t  even  do 

</span><span>anything to  protect  my reputation and myself. Yet, here tonight I am supporting this 

recommendation by the Political Review Commission. However, I also want to see a 

provision where I can defend myself if I am wrongly accused. To me we are rushing 

this legislation.  This matter  should, this particular Bill should be referred to a Select 

Committee   to go through it with a fine-toothed comb before bringing it back to the 

</span><span>House. As  proof of what I am saying, this Bill was introduced at 1.00 o’clock today 

and  by 7 o’clock this evening we already have  amendments to it.  What kind of  Bill 

</span><span>are  we  trying  to  push    through  so  our  people  can  be  faced    with  situations  where 

</span><span>people  can’t  defend  themselves.    To  me  this  is  most  unfair    to  both    Members  of 

</span><span>Parliament  of this country and the electors of our nation.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  see,  as  I  said,  some  protection  for  those  who  stand    accused  of  any 

political    manoeuvring    or  any  political  misbehaviour  or  misdeed.  All  too  often  we 

jump up with a knee-jerk reaction and accuse people when we are not sure. It is time 

</span><span>we  should  check  our  facts  and    if  there  is  cause    by  all  means,  proceed    with  the 

</span><span>petition  but if there is  no just cause then the perpetrators of these of these petitions 

should suffer the same consequences that the Member does. It is common knowledge 

Mr Chairman, our laws protect those who are falsely accused, and you have means of 

redress, of protecting yourse</span><span>lf. In here, in this Amendment, I don’t see any opportunity 

</span><span>being given to the Member of Parliament or the accused to stand and defend himself.  

In fact, if somebody falsely prosecutes you,  you can sue him for any damages, that he 

may  have done to you. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  let’s  see  some  amendment  to  this  Clause  to  introduce  a  Clause  so  that  we  can 

</span><span>defend ourselves and the Courts will decide who is telling the truth.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 57</a></div><div><span>1974 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  recall  a  petition  against  a  former  Member  of  Parliament.    The  reason  for  the 

petition was that he gave a breadfruit to  another family. How ridiculous can we be?  

These  are  the  kind  of  things  we  must  protect  not  just  the  electors  but  Members  of 

Parliament as well.  The Honourable Member from Ruauu is saying one cigarette was 

also used for the basis of a petition against a Member of Parliament. Mr Chairman, we 

make laws that will be acceptable to our people and it will not cause any disharmony, 

it will fly through like magic. But if we start picking on one and not the other, we are 

being unfair in this House.  

</span></div><div><span>I would urge the Minister of Justice, who introduced the Bill, to take it back and if he 

is sure he can win the next election then he can reactivate it. Let us put it aside and get 

on with things that are more important to save the country from drowning. In fact, I 

was  approached  by  a  Travel  Agent  and  his  concern  was  he  has  sent  thousands  of 

tourists  from  the  United  States  to  our  country  and  we  are  stealing  from  tourists 

walking on the street during daylight hours. This has not only happened to a tourist, it 

also happened to one of our women-folk on the road. There are more important things 

we  can  discuss  or  pass  tonight  than  making  laws  just  to  victimise  Members  of 

Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>I know I will be out of order, Mr Chairman,  but I will bring the attention of the House 

to an incident that happened in November and not one of the perpetrators have been 

apprehended to this day. I have verified my facts with the man in charge of the CIB 

and he assured me there has not been any arrests. We should be concerned with this 

</span><span>because  it  will  affect  our  tourist  industry.    If  we  don’t  do  anything  about  it,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman,  I  am  afraid  we  will  lose  half  our  tourist  population  who  comes  from  the 

United  States.    These  are  incidents  new  to  our  country.  The  question  we  should  be 

asking is,  why is  this  happening. We pride ourselves on how friendly and courteous  

we are. If  Members of the Government are concerned, I know I am out of order, Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, but I can’t help bringing this to the attention of the House. My concern is 

tourism,  which  is  the  backbone  of  our  country.  If  we  don’t  do  anything,  then  I  am 

</span><span>afraid we are doomed. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the</span><span>Honourable Minister, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  What  we  are  amending  is  a 

subsection of this  section in this Amendment to the principal Act. The protection or 

recourse everyone is worried about is in the principal Act. It is not in the Constitution, 

it  cannot  be  a  Constitutional  amendment  because  we  are  dealing  with  the  principal 

Electoral  Act  of  1998.    If  anything,  Mr  Chairman,  I  should  have  joined  the  two 

Clauses together, when I made the Motion, because in Clause 3 from (a) to (v) this is 

the essence of the amendment Bill. The Clause is different from the Part IIA that we 

are  looking  at.    The  essence  or  this  Part  8(a)  to  8(v),    is  that  this  is  where  the  real 

amendment to the principal Act is. The reason for this is because these areas are not in 

the principal Act of 1998.  

</span></div><div><span>We all know, Mr chairman, if somebody is out of order I will move a Point of Order. 

The  reason  I  have  not  done  so  is  because  it  was  my  fault.  I  did  not  join  the  two 

</span></div><div><a>Page 58</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1975 

</span></div><div><span>together and because of it the Members of Parliament were not able to understand that 

what  we  really  want  to  do  is  in  the  subsections  (a)  to  (v).    I  would  like  to  ask 

Honourable  Members  if  we  could  pass  Clause  2  and  move  on  to  Clause  3  and 

concentrate our attention on Clause 3.  Thank you, Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Utia Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>MR U. MATATA:  </span><span>With regard to Clause 2 of this Amendment Bill.  I was listening 

to the explanation by the Minister with regard to the Clause. I still have doubts about 

Clause 2 because of the two-</span><span>thirds of electors of a Member’s Const</span><span>ituency. During an 

election there will be three candidates and one will win.  This Clause tells us if two- 

</span><span>thirds of the electors of a Member’s Constituency have a problem with him, they have 

</span><span>the  right  to  remove  him.    The  area  which  is  of  concern  to  me  is,  what  if  the  Cook 

Islands Party, which is my party, gets me elected and the other two parties do not like 

</span><span>it. What if the supporters of those other two Parties don’t like me there as a Member 

</span><span>of Parliament, if they unite, then they will have a two-thirds majority because I will 

only have a third. This is one of the things that may occur that I have problems with. If 

this amendment had said that two-thirds of the Party that put me in there are the two-

thirds that are allowed to remove me, then I would feel a lot easier.  

</span></div><div><span>I think what this Clause is going to do, Mr Chairman, is to treat us like puppets and 

this Clause is  pulling the strings. The other reason,  I thought  this might  happen, Mr 

Chairman,  is  because  of  the  attitudes  of  the  people  today.  People  today  are  very 

clever. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  is  asking  us,  Mr  Chairman,  if  we  are 

supporting  this  Amendment  Bill.  I  think  we  are  all  in  the  same  boat.  I  mean  I  still 

</span><span>don’t understand this. Next thing we knew it was here.</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  my  honest  opinion  tonight,  Mr  Chairman.    I  was  one  of  the 

people,  Mr  Chairman,  when  we  were  discussing  the  Report  of  the  Political  review 

Commission, who was against some of the recommendations in that Report. I was one 

of the Government Members who joined with NAP who showed no confidence in two 

Members of that Commission.  There are reasons why I supported that Motion.  But 

</span><span>this is an area, Mr Chairman, that I really cannot agree with and I don’t know how we 

</span><span>are going to rectify this so that people will not treat us as if we were play-things. 

</span></div><div><span>If we look at the reasons or the grounds by which people can bring a petition against 

you, there are four different grounds that people can do this and they can do it at any 

time.  Those  are  my  views  on  Clause  </span><span>2,  Mr  Chairman,  and  I  don’t  want  to  say  too 

</span><span>much about it.  I will sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?       

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 59</a></div><div><span>1976 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Right  before  me  Honourable  Members,  is  the  new  Clause  1:  Short  Title  and 

Commencement.  I think we should go back to this now because a person cannot walk 

</span><span>around without a head.  So let’s go back to Clause 1.</span></div><div><span>The new Clause 1 : Short Title and Commencement : First Reading 

</span></div><div><span>That’s the new Clause 1 : Short Title and Commencement : Second Reading</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 of the Bill be deleted and the following  

New Clause be substituted: 

</span></div><div><span>1.  Short Title and Commencement 

</span></div><div><span>(1)    This  Act  may  be  cited  as  the  Electoral  Amendment  Act  1999  and  shall  be 

read together with and deemed part of the Electoral Act 1998 herein referred to 

as the Principal Act 

</span></div><div><span>(2)  This Act shall be deemed to have come into force on a date to be appointed 

</span><span>by the Queen’s Representative by Order in Executive Council</span></div><div><span>2.    The  Analysis  to  the  Bill  be  amended  consequentially  by  inserting  in  the 

</span><span>heading of Clause 1 after the word “Title” the words “and commencement”</span></div><div><span>MR  N. GEORGE:</span><span>   Tell me why? Come on, give us  an undertaking. Come on you 

guys. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:</span><span>  Just  a  brief  explanation,  Mr  Chairman,  on  the  Amendment 

before the House.  I think all Honourable Members of the House understand that there 

was no commencement provision and it is the reason we have this Amendment before 

</span><span>us now. Of course you’ve heard the Opposition Members speak vigorously earlier this 

</span><span>afternoon . . . 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>Oh, they’re happy now.</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:</span><span>    .  .  .  emphasising  the  fact,  Mr  Chairman,  that  if  this  Bill  is 

passed then all they have been doing up to this point in time is illegal and they have 

breached the Act.  Therefore, Mr Chairman, the purpose here, of course, is that a date 

will be taken before the Executive Council to make sure that it is five weeks before 

the election date is announced. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>  And it will be announced? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 60</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1977 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Yes, it will be announced.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I do hope 

that everybody understands the amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Welcome democracy. 

</span></div><div><span>(Much noise) 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Members.  Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Amendment be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>A little debate first. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    I  would  like  to  say  a  few  words  of  appreciation,  Mr 

Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>I didn’t see you Honourable Mem</span><span>ber because you are the same 

colour as the white walls. The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  don’t  consider  that  as  unparliamentary.  

(Much  laughter)  I’m  just  full  of  joy  for  the  amendment  that  the  Minister  has  put  i</span><span>n 

place.    As  he  has  rightly  said,  the  Opposition  Members  have  spoken  vigorously  of 

their views of what is in the Bill. So I am very pleased with this because it now shows 

that the date of the application of this Bill will be announced and the consequences of 

what is in Clause 7 - which concerns us the most,  will be indicated quite clearly. That 

is all. Now, I can prepare my trip to the Northern Group without any worry. 

</span></div><div><span>I am glad that the Minister has made the changes to satisfy all the needs and I am very 

grateful, on behalf of us in the Opposition here, I am very pleased with that. Also, Mr 

Chairman,  I  will    withdraw  my  threat  to  take  this  Bill  to  Court.  So,  I  would  like  to 

support this amendment to the Short title. Thank you, Mr Chairman.     

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>      Thank  you,  Honourable  Member    The  Honourable  Member, 

Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>I too, join the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Chairman, to thank 

the Minister of  Justice for hearing  the voice  of  reason.  I am quite happy  that  the 

roaring and shaking that I made in this House this afternoon was properly heard. So 

the  people  can  see  that  we,  in  the  Opposition,  can  achieve  things  if  we  shout  loud 

enough.  I thank the Minister for his fortitude and the courage to solve this problem 

because we did have a real fear that the sudden introduction of this amendment would 

make  all  the activities that we are used to, to suddenly become illegal. 

</span></div><div><span>I  was  wondering  from  minute  to  minute,  Mr  Chairman,  whether  we    are    in 

Communist China, or North  Korea? Because  if this became law tomorrow, it would 

</span><span>be the most outrageous thing, this Government  has ever done. So, what it means by 

</span><span>this new amendment, the Short Title and Commencement - what it means now is that, 

happily, for all of our supporters we can continue to do what we have been doing, and 

then  when this becomes law, the Minister assures us it will come into law 5 weeks 

</span></div><div><a>Page 61</a></div><div><span>1978 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>before the General Election, whenever  that is. So, if the General Election is in June, 

then this amendment will come into law sometime in May, 5 weeks before the date in 

June.  

</span></div><div><span>So this is a major relief that we can continue to enjoy our freedom, that democracy is 

preserved,  common  sense  is  maintained and we continue to  enjoy our freedom  until 

such  time as  we get  into this House as  a new Government to throw this stupid law 

</span><span>out.  I  don’t  want  to  start  another  fight,  I  just  want  to  indicate,    I  am  happy,  on  a 

</span><span>temporary basis, but I will not rest, I will not rest, until this repulsive and oppressive  

provision - not in the first half but in the later part - which restricts our freedom, that 

</span><span>is so oppressive, it will be my life’s ambition to make sure it is removed forever from 

</span><span>this House.  

</span></div><div><span>The  important  thing  to  remember,  Mr  Chairman  is,  that  when  the  Political    Review 

Commission recommended Reform and change, they did not recommend punishment. 

The  did  not  recommend  the    criminalisation  of  Elections.  Mr  Chairman,  the 

</span><span>implication  of  this  is,    it  won’t  apply  to  us  during  this  Election,  but    if  this  is    to 

</span><span>remain in force at the next General Election, what it means is, if you campaign before 

</span><span>the election period, you are liable to five years imprisonment and a $10,000.00 fine. 

</span><span>Mr Chairman, it easier to steal something, you won’t be punished too severely. Yet, if 

</span><span>you  commit    an  offence    under  the  Electoral  Act,  you  face  severe  punishment,  for 

doing  what  you  should  do  to  go  and  get  elected  to  serve  the  country.  That  is  why  I 

said,  it    is  criminalising  campaigning  to  run  for  public  office,  there  is  something  

</span><span>seriously  wrong  with  this.  I  just  can’t  restrain</span><span>  myself,  I  just  have  to  express  my  

intense  dislike  for  the  second  part  -    for  the    Clause  3  Amendment.  To  this 

Amendment before us, I just  want to indicate that    I support this Amendment  now, 

this  resurrection  of  sensibility  into  our  Electoral  process,  I  welcome  it,  I  support  it, 

and I sincerely thank the Minister of Justice. Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  In  listening  to  the  statements 

made  by  the two Leaders,  the rest  of the Clauses of the Bill will go to the House 

without debate. Thank you, Honourable Members.    

</span></div><div><span>Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>(Much noise) 

</span></div><div><span>That the  Amendment be Agreed to?   

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to   

</span></div><div><span>New Clause 1: Short Title and commencement, First Reading.   

</span></div><div><span>New Clause 1: Second Reading.  

</span></div><div><span>New Clause 1: Short Title and Commencement, Second Reading.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 62</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1979 

</span></div><div><span>That the New Clause 1 be Added  to the Bill?  

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>That is what I thought.  

</span></div><div><span>Clause  3, New  Part  - Part IIA   Petition of   Electors.  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr. Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman,  you  will  remember  that  I 

reserved the right to speak on the Clause 3 at this time.   So  I am saying to my friend 

the Honourable Paora Teiti, we now </span><span>have the Floor to speak on Clause 3.  I don’t have 

</span><span>very much to say about Clause 8A - </span><span>Members’ seat maybe declared vacant by petition  

</span><span>of  electors.    However,  we  have  some  very  good  views  from  the  two  Members  of 

Puaikura,  the  Honourable  Member,  Tepai  Tepai  and  the  Honourable  Member  Utia 

</span><span>Matata.  I feel sorry that you weren’t  involved, you weren’t called into the Caucus so  

</span><span>it could be explained to you, and why this Bill is being brought into  the House. So, 

when the Election comes along, watch out! Clause 8B is Grounds  for Petition, which 

is the different  grounds that could be used to apply for a petition to remove a Member 

from his seat.  There are so many different grounds here that could affect the tenure of 

a Member of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Today we do not have a Code of Conduct in any of our laws. This is one way we can 

find out  whether a Member of Parliament has done something wrong. This  is why I 

think  we  should  have  an  Act  to  provide  a  Code  of  Conduct  for  the  Prime  Minister, 

Ministers and Heads of Departments, so we can judge whether one of these people has 

</span><span>done something wrong. It is sad that it hasn’t occurred before today. In Clause 8(b) it 

</span><span>tells of the type of conduct of a Member which is not appropriate; the grounds upon 

which the people can bring a petition against you. I would like to say to Honourable 

Members,  during  the  next  Election  put  your clothing on properly, button your shirts 

properly,  wear  shoes  -  if  you  do  not  have  any,  borrow  some.  This  is  why  we  as 

Members of Parliament should ensure that our conduct is the best. These are the sorts 

</span><span>of  things  that  our  people  hate  about  us  which  could  provoke  our  people  to  bring  a 

</span><span>petition  against  us.  There  are  other  grounds, such as you did  not  consult  with  them. 

We, Members of Parliament, Heads of ministries or Ministers, we should ensure we 

have the best  behaviour so that our people will not  bring a petition against us to try 

and  get  rid  of  us.  Clause  8  B  are  not  the  only  grounds  people  can  use  to  bring  a 

petition against you because debates are going through the radio, we are telling them 

through this Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>I  have  talked  about  this  earlier  on  and  I  was  very  angry  when  I  said  it.  This  time  I 

</span><span>don’t want  to  say it in  anger. This  regards Code of Conduct. Clause 8C sets out the 

</span><span>Application  to  conduct  a  petition.  It  says  that  you  must  have  more  than  30%  in  the 

electorate before a petition will be accepted. It tells us the Chief Electoral Officer will 

not  accept  a  petition  in  the  first  year.  I  can  understand  that,  Mr  Chairman,   because 

</span></div><div><a>Page 63</a></div><div><span>1980 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>that first year includes all petitions relating to the Election. It is also not fair because a 

</span><span>Member  of  Parliament  has  just  started  and  it  won’t  be  fair  to  say  a  Member  of 

</span><span>Parliament has not done anything because he or she has just started.  It also tells us in 

the last year of a term the Chief Electoral Officer will not accept a petition because the 

Election is on the doorstep. If the term of Parliament was three years, Mr Chairman, 

we could say there would be no need for petitions. We know Members of Parliament 

will be on their best behaviour, Government will be on its best behaviour because they 

</span><span>know it won’t be long before the ticket arrives telling them whether to leave or to stay 

</span><span>in Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>As we can see in this case there is a first and last year and two in between.  I go along 

with  the  view  expressed  earlier  on  to  put  in  place  a  penalty  for  people  who  falsely 

present a petition. In some cases, the mere fact the Member is a member of the DAP 

that  could  be  enough  for  some  people  to  present  a  petition.  I  agree  with  the  idea 

mentioned  in  this  House  that  if  a  person  is  found  to  be  falsely  presenting  a  petition 

that person should be punished. Under Clause 8C, subsection 4 says that people will 

be entitled to a refund of a bond because they have to come up with a bond to pay for 

two-thirds of the Court costs. This Clause says if a petition is not presented properly 

</span><span>they will lose their bond and if it is properly presented they are entitled to a refund of 

</span><span>the bond.  

</span></div><div><span>I  can  see  there  are  provisions  where  you  have  to  pay  a  bond  in  order  to  present  a 

petition, if the court case costs $100,000 you will have to pay two thirds of that cost.  

Clause 8C says there are a lot of things to be considered including an application for a 

petition.  Subclause (e) says the application may be withdrawn by the applicant.  There 

are a lot of subsections under the present Clause. If we really want to understand it we 

should take the time to read it carefully.  

</span></div><div><span>If  we  want  to  do  something  under  this  Clause  8C, there are complicated procedures 

that have to be followed. This maybe similar to the conduct of a General Election. I 

</span><span>am sure if there’s a petition to be done there will be a lot of money involved.  I have 

</span><span>no doubt about that. This would also include postal declarations. The procedure is like 

the election of the Prime Minister of New Zealand. The instructions for the collection, 

and  scrutineering  of  conduct,  of  a  petition  is  very  like  the  conduct  of  a    General 

Election. Also in this Clause 3 is mention of Mayors and Island Councillors.   This is 

the  Clause  that  I  said,  Mr  Chairman,  I  was  so  surprised  to  see  that  it  was  included. 

</span><span>What was that? I am wrong. Nevertheless, Mr Chairman, I still don’t like it because 

</span><span>the  change  means  the  Mayor  for  Aitutaki  has  to  resign  before  he can stand. I might 

call it the Tai Herman Clause. Let me return.... It looks as if my time is up. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman. I will try and be as brief as I can.  I 

have already declared my pet hates in some of these Clauses but I do have one or two 

comments  left  in  this  Part  III.  I  still  feel  sorry  for  the  Member  of  Parliament  being 

petitioned against because he is not protected enough. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 64</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1981 

</span></div><div><span>So under sub-clause 8D(3</span><span>)  “Where the Member complained of is of the opinion that 

</span><span>either - (a) the allegations contained in the application have no basis in fact; or (b) that 

paragraphs  (a),  (b),  (c)  or  (d)  of  section  8C(2)  of  this  Act  have  not  been  complied 

with-  that  member  may  apply  to  the  High  Court  for  a  determination  that  the 

</span><span>application...” etc. be withdrawn. He can make an application to the Court to have a 

look  at  this. Now what  concerns me is  the costs. Whoever drafted this Bill couldn’t 

</span><span>care less about the Member.  Okay</span><span>, there’s a bond there to cover the Electoral Office.  

</span><span>When  the  petition  fails  to  get  two-thirds,  the  bond  money  is  forfeited,  the  Electoral 

Office gets all that money, but when it comes to the Member of Parliament taking the 

matter to Court for a declaration, he is not covered.  There are no costs guaranteed for 

him.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, just to give you an idea of how expensive Court matters are.  You can 

start off, to hire a lawyer to do this - your starting point is $5,000. If somebody decides 

to take a petition against you and you know you are innocent, immediately you have to 

spend a lot of money to protect your innocence. I can tell you the thing a lawyer will 

tell you is you pay a deposit of $2,500 straight away when you see him. Then, if no 

judge is avail</span><span>able, there’s two options for you to take, either you fly to Auckland for a 

</span><span>hearing in Auckland or you pay for the costs of the judge to fly to Rarotonga.  If you 

</span><span>are taking your case to Auckland, you have to go with your lawyer, you’ve got to pay 

</span><span>your law</span><span>yer’s air fare and hotel accommodation. Now you are looking at $3,000 for 

</span><span>that travel and by the time you finish with that, if your application for declaration is 

successful  there  is  no  place  here  where  the  Court  can  award  costs  against  the 

petitioners.  Nowhere. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the sad part.  If you go back to a General Election, if there’s a petition against a 

</span><span>successful  candidate,  he  has  protection.  That  protection  came  about  because  a  wise 

guy,  a  Member  of  Parliament  called  Norman  George  had  the  foresight  to  make  an 

amendment to the Electoral Act back in 1987.  That amendment, dating back to 1987 

requires that if you are going to lodge a petition then you must deposit security for that 

petition for $5,000.  If you want to take the matter to Court you pay for that security 

</span><span>by paying $5,000 for that petition. And that’s just a security of costs.  On top of that 

you’ve  got  to  pay  $1,000  to  lodge  that  petition.  That  came  about,  Mr  Chairman, 

because when I started my political career it was rocky, it was bumpy.  It’s</span><span> time I went 

</span><span>.... my friends in the Cook Islands Party just wouldn’t accept that I was very popular 

</span><span>on  my  home  island.  And  I  still  am.  Still  am.  Mr  Chairman,  it  cost  me.  The  Court 

</span><span>cleared  me.    It  cost  me  over  $5,000  to  defend  myself  against  a  $20  petition  at  that 

</span><span>time. 

</span></div><div><span>In  those  earlier  days,  Mr  Chairman,  you  got  ridiculous  petitions  for  something  like  

offering  a  Zap  to  drink,  or  a  chewing  gum,  or  a  packet  of  twisties.    Some  of  the 

</span><span>petitions were ridiculous. For $20 you could upset a successful candidate’s</span><span> victory on 

Election  Day,  you  can  upset  him  for  weeks  after  that.  But  when  we  introduced  the 

$5,000  security  of  costs,  I  think  we  started  with  $500,  I  think  the  CIP  Government 

lifted  it  to  $5,000  but  when  those  costs  were  applied  all  the  nonsense  stopped.  You 

</span><span>see, Mr Chairman, if an electoral petition fails, the successful candidate will get that 

</span><span>$5,000.  I remember the Honourable Minister, Tepure Tapaitau, was able to take our 

$5,000 when our unsuccessful petition was lodged against him in Penrhyn.  Oh, I was 

sour about that because we needed that money but the Honourable Minister ended up 

</span></div><div><a>Page 65</a></div><div><span>1982 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>getting it.  It might be worth  mentioning he scared all the witnesses when we went to 

see them.  They all took off through the coconut plantations. If I had a horse I would 

have hopped on a horse and chased them through the bushes. But anyhow, at least in a 

petition against a newly elected Member of Parliament - he has got protection, he has 

got security for costs. Here, a Member of Parliament of at least two years standing is 

</span><span>not protected.  He’s got no protection.  All the drafters of this Bill have gone to a lot 

</span><span>of trouble to protect the Electoral Office. Maybe I should blame Stephen Wearing for 

his  influence.  He covers his  Office but he forgets about the Member of Parliament. 

</span><span>But  that’s  not  his  responsibility.  It  is  regretted.  When  you  make  legislation  like  this 

</span><span>Members on the Government side should be aware.  It could be them.  One of them 

could be facing a petition for recall later. 

</span></div><div><span>I can tell you, Mr Chairman, that if you take the matter to Court at the end of the day 

you  are  going  to  face  a  Bill  of  $12-15,000.00.  So  after  the  innocent  Member  of 

Parliament spends all his money to get the Court to declare in his favour, he is out of 

pocket for $12,000 and the petitio</span><span>ners go off laughing ‘ha, ha, ha, it cost him a packet 

and we’re not paying him a cent’. So, I am very critical of this, Mr Chairman, not that 

</span><span>I  fear  that  this  will  affect  me  because  I  am  a  conscientious  Member  for  Areora-

</span><span>Tengatangi-Ngatiarua. I would never have a problem with this but I know that there 

</span><span>are some nasty people in our community and one day, somebody will be abused. So, I 

just  feel  sorry  that  there  is  no  protection  for  the  Member.  Mr  Chairman,  even  the 

provision  relating  to  offences  -  in  8V  it  lists  the  offences  that  can  be  applied  to  the 

conduct of a petition but there is no provision in there for a malicious petition made 

against the Member. When you look  at  the offences provision  in  8V, on Page 10, it 

lists  Sections  78  which  touches  on  infringement  of  secrecy.  Then  it  lists  79,  which 

covers  interfering  and  influencing  electors,  and  goes right  up to  86. All  of these are 

voting offences only. There is nothing  to make it an offence for petitioners to make a 

false petition. So, Minister of Justice, let me tell you, your Amendment fails to make it 

</span><span>an  offence  to  make  a  false  petition.  Minister  of  Justice  are  you  listening  to  me.  I’ll 

</span><span>keep asking you until you respond. There is no offence in malicious petitions against 

Members of Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  saddened  that  this  Amendment  carries  the  malice  held  by  the  Political  Review 

Commission against Members. This Amendment is reflecting their hatred of Members 

of Parliament. All they could recommend is the faults of Members of Parliament, they 

never look at the faults that other people can commit against Members of Parliament. 

</span><span>So, I say to my Honourable friends, maybe when you think about it, it wasn’t such a 

</span><span>bad  idea  to  crucify  them  for  their  Report.  (laughs)  Every  now  and  then  I  feel  like 

lashing a whip. 

</span></div><div><span>This is it. There is no protection in this Bill for Members of Parliament. It is sad that 

those drafting this Bill did not see it right to do so. Like the Leader of the Opposition, 

I  did  think  I  would  have  a  lot  to  say  about  the  Tai  Herman  and  Mama  Ngai 

Ame</span><span>ndments,  but  I’ll  wait  until  we  come  to  Clause  4.  Is  that  part  of  Clause  8,  can 

</span><span>somebody correct me? I think so. How can it be 8 then you go back to 4? Perhaps, I 

</span><span>can just mention that... are we allowed to talk about Clause 4, Mr Chairman? Maybe 

</span><span>when every</span><span>body is fast asleep then I can talk about it. All right, we’ll talk about that 

</span><span>tomorrow. It certainly strange to have that provision there especially after the Mayor 

</span><span>of  Aitutaki,  Tai  Herman’s  expression  of  interest  to  stand  for  Parliament,  was  made. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 66</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1983 

</span></div><div><span>Not that he has a chance to get elected - not against our candidate over there. In fact, 

the  Amuri  seat  already  belongs  to  Mrs  Kairoro  George,  otherwise  known  as  Jenny 

</span><span>Shipley. I don’t want to send my friend Paora Teiti into a horrible nightmare tonight 

</span><span>by talking about it.          

</span></div><div><span>I think I’ll finish off the next couple of minutes to wind up the night. Mr Chairman, 

</span><span>these  are  sound  foundations.  It  is  almost  like  running  a  by-election.  But  when  you 

look  at  the  grounds  for  a  petition,  how  many  times  would  Members  of  the 

Government  side  be  recalled  for  non-appearances  in  Parliament,  for  neglecting  to 

consult  with  their  constituents,  and  other  offences.  I  reckon  that  shifting  the 

disciplining  of  Members  of    Caucus  to  the  electorate  is  passing  the  buck  by  the 

Leader.  Mr  Chairman,  instead  of getting an electorate to  lodge a petition, to  deposit 

bonds, to hold a by-</span><span>election eventually, why doesn’t the Leader of each Party be given 

</span><span>the  responsibility  of  doing  it  himself?  There  are  matters  of  discipline  in  which  an 

organisation  is  answerable  to,  particularly  with  matters  of  conduct,  behaviour.  If  a 

Leader is competent in controlling his troops there is no need to take him back to the 

electorate. Absolutely no need to.  When you are in a battle situation, when you are at 

the  front  of  a  war-</span><span>zone,  you  don’t  go  back  home  to  hold  court  to  discipline  your 

</span><span>Members, you do it there and then.   

</span></div><div><span>On that note, Mr Chairman, Honourable Members, I conclude my deliberations for the 

night. May you all go home and may the good Lord guide each and everyone of you, 

until you rise again in the morning. Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Members. Our time is up. I would like to 

ask the Minister to return us to Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported to Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Question is; 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to?
