<div><span>BILL READ A FIRST TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Can the Honourable  Minister please name the date and the time of 

the second reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span> At 1.00 p.m. this afternoon Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>The Bill is now ordered for the second reading at 1.00 o’clock this 

</span><span>afternoon. Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  I  have  a  request,  Mr  Speaker.  The  Bill  in  front  of  us  was  just 

presented a moment ago which means we will have only an hour to look at it before 

</span><span>we debate it at 1.00 o’clock. I thought we would have gone on to the other Bill that 

</span><span>has already been presented. That is, the Amendment on the Cook Islands Investment 

Corporation Bill.   It seems to me this is unreasonable and this is why we tend to get 

up and express our grievances with the procedures of this Honourable House. Because 

we already have something presented in the House which we can deal with first before 

we can go on to the Electoral Amendment Bill.   Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Leader of the House.

</span></div><div><span>That this Sitting be Extended to 10.00 pm tonight and that it be Suspended now 

and Resume at 1.00pm and a break from 4.00 pm to 7.00pm. 

</span></div><div><span>And the second suspension... Mr Speaker, may I ask the Leader of the Opposition to 

keep quiet, I am the Leader of the House. The second suspension, Mr Speaker, is from 

4.00pm to 7.00pm.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Can I have a seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member, Utia Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
