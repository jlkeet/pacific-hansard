</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Please be seated Honourable Members of the House. Kia Orana to 

all Honourable Members in the name of Our Lord this beautiful morning.  Before we 

go  into  business  today  we  should  thank  the  Pastor  for  bringing  his  message  of 

encouragement.  

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  we  all  know  what  I  did  to  the  Honourable  Member  for  Rakahanga  last 

night.  I went home last night with this dark cloud following me.  My conscience told 

me  that,  in  order  to  get  this  dark  cloud  away  from  me  and the Honourable Member 

Pupuke  Robati  this  morning,  I  should  apologise  to  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr 

Pupuke Robati for what I did to him yesterday.  I pray the Honourable Member will 

accept my apology.
