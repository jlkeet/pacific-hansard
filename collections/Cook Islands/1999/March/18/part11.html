<div><span>BILL READ A SECOND TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I now resolve Parliament into the Committee of the Whole.  Clause 

1, Short Title.  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill?  

</span></div><div><span> The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Now, I would like to know when 

this Bill will come into effect. By my reckoning, there are Clauses in this Amendment 

Bill  which  will  cause  a  lot  of  problems.  I  believe  when  the  Bill  is  passed  by  this 

House, it will come into effect immediately. In other words, after it has been given to 

</span><span>the Queenâ€™s Representative for his assent, it is in effect. </span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>May  I</span><span>interrupt  you,  Honourable  Member?    I  now  ask  the 

Minister to move for progress to be reported to Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported to Parliament</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><a>Page 46</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1963
