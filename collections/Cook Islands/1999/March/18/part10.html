<div><span>SITTING IS RESUMED 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please  be  seated  Honourable  Members,  this  Parliament  is  now 

resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>Electoral Amendment Bill, Second Reading.  The Honourable Minister of Justice and 

Lands. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Electoral Amendment Bill be now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>In so moving, Mr Speaker, I would like to make some introductory comments just to 

assist Honourable Members of the House and to give some additional explanation to 

what is already there in the Explanatory Notes of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>At  this  point,  I  greet  you  Mr  Speaker  and  your  staff  members  and  all  Honourable 

Members  of  the  House.  To  our  people  listening  in  to  the  debate  this  afternoon,  Kia 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1941 

</span></div><div><span>Orana.  I believe that the Bill before the House will be of great benefit to our people, 

our country and this Honourable House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Bill in front of the House is a continuation of Government’s aim to 

</span><span>update  and  modernise  our  legislation  pertaining  to  the  electoral  process.  It  is  also 

being  presented  in  recognition,  Mr  Speaker,  of  certain  expectations  of  our  people. 

These expectations, Mr Speaker, have been identified by the Commission of Political 

Review  in  their  Report  on  reforming  the  political  system  of  the  Cook  Islands.  This 

Bill  adopts  certain  recommendations  made  by  the  Commission  in  their  Report.  The 

</span><span>main part of the Bill focuses on one of the Commission’s findings, that is, that voters 

</span><span>want  to  be  able  to  recall  their  Member  of  Parliament  if  he  or  she  performs 

unsatisfactorily. Some of us here, Mr Speaker, in this House today, need to be honest 

with ourselves and admit that just before the elections are held we are out there among 

our constituents, being seen to be hearing the concerns of our electorate and making 

promise  after  promise  to  them.    Mr  Speaker,  after  we  have  succeeded  in  obtaining 

office, I wonder how many of us here in this House today live up to the expectations 

we  have  generated  amongst  our  people?    How  many  of  us  regularly  go  back  and 

consult  our  people  on  matters  that  affect  them  and  then  try  to  the  best  to  get 

</span><span>Government to address their concerns?   

</span></div><div><span>In  Government  today,  Mr  Speaker,  Heads  of  Ministries  are  required  to  enter  into  a 

performance  agreement  with  their  respective  Ministers  to  ensure  that  they  carry  out 

their respective responsibilities effectively.  It can be said, Mr Speaker, that this Bill 

sets out the performance agreement of Members of Parliament with their constituents.  

Through the passage of this Bill, we will be stressing the point that we and all persons 

who succeed to an office in the future are fully accountable to our people for their full 

term  in  office.  The  importance  of  accountability  is  continued throughout  the Bill  by 

the  introduction  of  provisions  that  impose  on  political  parties  and  independent 

candidates,  the  responsibility  of  providing  records  or  returns  of  all  electoral 

expenditure  to  the  Chief  Electoral  Officer.    The  Chief  Electoral  Officer  has  the 

authority to audit a return if he believes the return is erroneous in any particular way.  

It  is  further  provided  in  this  Bill  that  these  returns  shall  be  made  available  to  the 

</span><span>public for inspection.  As referred to, in the Commission’s Report, Mr Speaker, we in 

</span><span>Parliament  and  other  political  candidates  need  to  be  mindful  of  the  pressures  and 

demands  on  our  supporters  during  the  campaign  period.    It  can  be  a  burden  on  our 

people  to  supply  food,  transport  and  other  resources  during  this  period  before  the 

</span><span>election and we need to be aware of the tensions campaigning brings to our families 

</span><span>and  the  community  as  a  whole.    For  this  reason,  Mr  Speaker,  there  are  further 

provisions  in  this  Bill  which  provide  for  the  control  of  all  forms  of  electoral 

advertising or election activity. Provision, Mr Speaker, is also made for the limitation 

of the campaign period to a term of five weeks prior to the date of the election. 

</span></div><div><span>Other miscellaneous provisions in the Bill, which also follow the recommendations of 

the  Commission  for  Political  Review,  include  the requirement that all voting papers 

include a photograph of the candidate.  The Bill also provides for the opportunity for 

</span><span>any candidate, if he or she wishes, to provide a statement about the candidate, to be set 

</span><span>out  in  the  form  provided  by  the  Schedule  in  this  Bill.  For  the  sake  of  our  people 

listening  in  to  this  broadcast,  this  statement  includes  background  information  on  a 

</span><span>candidate’s education, employment, community service, political experience, sporting 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>1942 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>experience  and  family.  This  statement  is  to  be  made  available  at  the  request  of  any 

elector on polling day. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, Mr Speaker, the Bill  includes  a provision  which requires any person who is 

elected to the Island or Vaka Council or as Mayor, to resign from that position before 

accepting a nomination as candidate for any election to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>In  explaining  the  purpose  of  this  provision,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is  my  view  that  it  is 

important to ensure that all candidates to be elected as Members of Parliament, begin 

campaigning  on  an  equal  footing.  That  is,  persons  who  have  been  elected  as 

Councillors shall not be able to use positions of authority to influence voters. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it is my hope that all the Honourable colleagues here in Parliament today 

will support this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>No way.  It’s cut throat... (interjection inaudible).</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:</span><span>  And  welcome  in  particular  is  what  I  refer  to  as  the 

accountability  provisions  of  this  Bill.  Mr  Speaker,  I  have  much  pleasure  in 

commending this Bill to you and to my fellow Members of Parliament in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> You should be ashamed. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Can I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Hon. Vaine Tairea 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Norman George, Leader of the New Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>  To  you, Mr speaker, Greetings. To all Honourable Members  on 

</span><span>both  sides  of  the  House,  the  Government  side  and  to  the  two  Leaders  of  the 

</span><span>Opposition, Greetings.  Greetings also to our people who are listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  this  is  one  of  the  saddest  days  of  my  life.  To  see  this  outrageous  Bill 

before us.  I have no problem with the first part, which is the right to recall.  I have no 

problem with that.  But my problems begin from the requirement that those who are 

currently  Mayors  are  required  to  resign  from  their  positions  before  they  stand  for 

elections.  And, Mr Speaker, I am also totally disgusted with the new Part 6 (a) of this.  

I thought quite frankly that the Prime Minister was joking when he said that he would 

</span><span>restrict campaigning to five weeks.  I thought it was a good joke.  I thought the most 

</span><span>realistic  and  practical  way  to  restrict  the  campaign  to  five  weeks  is  to  call  for  a 

General  Election  five  weeks  from  dissolution  date.    But  to  legislate,  to  turn  the 

activities  that  we  are  doing  now  into  a  corrupt  practice  is  most  disappointing.  I  am 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1943 

</span></div><div><span>shocked with this legislation! They have now legislated that if you start campaigning 

</span><span>now, this is called an “election activity”.  An “election activity” is doing what the New 

</span><span>Alliance Party has been doing in the last three weeks.  This Bill before us now says it 

is a criminal offence to do that.  You will be found guilty of corrupt practice and liable 

to a fine of $10,000 for doing what we used to do for the last 31 years. Mr Speaker, 

there is disbelief reading this.  It is brutal and shocking! This is cruelty to our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Let’s look at it. You can commit a corrupt practice under this Act, a criminal offence, 

</span><span>if you advertise or do a promotion at any time before the election period is declared.  

So, what our candidates - what Peto has been putting in the paper - has now become a 

criminal act - for putting his name to promote himself in the newspaper in the last few 

days.  This  Amendment  before  us  now  makes  it  a  criminal  act.  Mr  Speaker,  the 

pamphlets  we  have  been  distributing,  now  becomes  a  criminal  act  under  this 

Amendment.    Please  God  tell  us  what  sort  of  a  country  we  are  living in  right  now?  

Please tell us what kind of democracy we have? 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>It’s not a democracy. It’s oppression.</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> I would like to ask the Honourable Members on both sides to use 

your  conscience.    Look  at  these  provisions.  Look  at  the  implications.  Under  this 

provision  you  cannot  advertise  or  promote  anything  about  your  political  party  until 

Government  declares  the  election  period.  Right  now  if  this  is  passed,  and  I  am 

appealing to the conscience of all Members, if this is passed today, anything you do on 

television is liable to a fine of $10,000.  If you publish anything, if you send out cards, 

</span><span>you’re  lia</span><span>ble.  Now  this  could  be  cards  -  now  what  sort  of  cards?  Christmas  cards, 

Greetings cards, anything.  If you send out pamphlets, if you write out any signboards, 

you  commit  an  offence  under  this  provision.    But  look  at  the  cruel  way  they  define 

</span><span>“advertising”</span><span>or  “promotion”.    This  is  in  106A  under  Interpretation.    The  (a) clause 

</span><span>right up the top there. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  the  Clause  says  ...  let  me  read  the  whole  Clause  because  it  makes  sense  when 

you read it: 

</span></div><div><span>“Election  activity”,  which  is  the  banned  activity,  “election  Act</span><span>ivity  in  relation  to  a 

candidate  or  a  political  party  at  an  election  in  any  constituency,  means  any  activity 

open to, or directed at the general public and which relates principally to the campaign 

for  the  return  of  a  candidate  or  the  promotion  of  a  political  party  and  which 

comprises-  </span><span>[particularly] (a) advertising or promotion of any kind; or...”.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it is so general it is designed to catch whatever activity.  You can’t say 

anything about your candidate.  You can’t say anything about your Party</span><span> from today 

otherwise you will be fined $10,000.  For 31 years we are able to do whatever we like 

because this is a free country.  We have a Constitution guaranteeing our freedom.  For 

33 years since self-government we have been able to do it.  Today, it is telling us we 

can no longer do it.  It becomes an act of corruption if you do it.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  quite  certain,  Mr  Speaker,  that  if  somebody  takes  this  to  the  High  Court  for  a 

declaration, this provision is a breach of our human rights.  A Government that knows 

what it is doing could have controlled all of these things.  All of these things can be 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>1944 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>controlled  without  legislation.    But  today  under  this  Bill  we  are  told  you  can’t  do 

</span><span>anything  any  more  until  the  campaign  period  is  declared  and  we  will  not  know that 

until the Prime Minister tells us when the General Election is going to be held and you 

have to count five weeks from election date. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  want  the  people  of  this  country  to  know  that  the  pamphlets,  the 

brochures  we  have  been  giving  to  the  people  of  this  country  to  show  them  our 

policies,  to  show them what  we plan to  do from  today, that that brochure cannot  be 

</span><span>printed any more.  From today, under this Government’s Amendment, it is illegal.</span></div><div><span>You can no longer have public meetings, a meeting like the ones we had in Mangaia 

and the ones we had in Vaipae, Aitutaki, is now illegal under this new Amendment.  

What kind of country is this, what kind of law is this? From today onwards, if we hold 

another  public  meeting,  we  will  be  subject  to  a  fine  of  $10,000.</span><span>00.  For  goodness’ 

sake, people, what are we doing here?   This Bill is telling us you can’t do anything in 

</span><span>the  meantime  until  the  Election  Day  is  decided.    Of  course,  it  can  be  avoided,  of 

course you can do it, if you tell us today that the election will be in five weeks time 

then nothing illegal will be done.  Therefore, if the Minister is to get up and say to us 

</span><span>in  this  House,  the  election  will  be  in  five  weeks  time,  I  am  happy.  Then  we  can 

</span><span>continue with our public meetings, we can continue with our pamphlets.  This is the 

only way that we can cope with this outrageous Bill. The only way to cope with the 

damages of this provision is if the Government is to tell us that the General Election 

will  be  in  five  weeks  time,  finish,  no  more  complaints,  so  that  we  </span><span>don’t  start 

</span><span>committing these offences. Our  brochures are being printed, the second volume is due 

to come out.   If the five weeks period does not start today then we are in trouble. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, what I am outraged with is the principles and the implications. We have 

enjoyed freedom in our beautiful country for so long, and to have this curve thrown at 

us at this late hour is just heart breaking.   So the only way that I will be happy with it, 

is, if we are told that the General Election will be in five weeks time.  So that, there 

will  be  no  lapse,  there  is  no  gap  so  that  the  current  activities  that  -  particularly  my 

party is in, - because we are well on the road, we have been campaigning vigorously 

for three weeks. If this Bill makes all our activities illegal from this point on then we 

are  very,  very  downhearted,  Mr  Speaker.  I  was  expressing  my  reaction  on  the 

principles of curbing the right to distribute pamphlets, the right to get on the TV and 

radio to promote our parties, the right to hold public meetings, those are the principles 

</span><span>that I am defending, Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>I think everybody realises that the Cook Islands Party is just sitting around. I do not 

know  what  their  strategy  is,  but  they  are  not  doing  much  publicly.  It  could  well  be 

they  have  been  counting  on  this  legislation  to  control  everybody  else,  so  that 

everybody can be slowed down to their pace.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  requirement  for  Mayors  to  resign  their  positions  in  order  to  allow 

them to stand as candidate is totally repulsive, totally ugly and unnecessary. Why not 

</span><span>let  the  Mayors  have  a  run,  if  they  succeed  they  resign  as  Mayors?  If  they  do  not 

</span><span>succeed, they go back as Mayors. And the Minister of Justice talks about them having 

</span><span>an  advantage.    What  advantage?    Why  doesn’t  the  Prime Minister resign d</span><span>uring the 

</span><span>campaign period?  Why don’t the Ministers resign during the campaign period?  Why 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1945 

</span></div><div><span>impose  this  punishment  on  the  Mayors  while  they  Cabinet  Ministers  and  the  Prime 

Minister remain in office to take advantage of their offices during this period? Is that 

why the Cook Islands Party Government is opposed to a Transition Committee taking 

over the Caretaker role of the Government during the campaign? 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I feel so strongly about these provisions that I will be meeting with the 

New Alliance Party Executive to consider the consequences. And if their decision is 

to defy this law we will do it. However, it is better for me to predict the outcome. All I 

can say is I have never seen anything like it.  It is brutal and it is anti-democratic, it is 

a complete restriction on our freedom to campaign during election time. The biggest 

danger is if the General Election is delayed until June, especially towards the end of 

June. That means between now and April all activities will come to a halt, because of 

this provision.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  run  out  of  time,  I  will  have  some  more  to  say  about  it  later.  I 

cannot find myself supporting this Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Education, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  give  my  full  support  to  this 

Electoral Amendment Bill.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Just because you are finished! 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA: </span><span>I know that I can be accused of speaking on a system that I will  not 

be a part of, you can think what you want. But I want to tell you, Mr Speaker and our 

people listening to the Honourable Norman George, that this Bill is the embodiment 

of some recommendations of the Report of the Commission of Political Review. I also 

want  to  tell  you  that  this  Government  is  committed  to  implementing  those 

recommendations  from  the  Commission,  which  in  our  view,  are  of  benefit  to  this 

country. 

</span></div><div><span> (Interjections) 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Norman  George,  last  night  told  the  people  of  Rarotonga  that  he 

supports  the  recommendation  from  the  Commission  for  an  interim-appointed 

Government  to  look  after  the  affairs  of  this  country  from  the  date  of  dissolution  of 

Parliament, to the date of the installation of the new Members of Parliament and the 

new Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  was  so  surprised  that  today  he  thinks  it  is  a  good  idea  for  appointed 

people  to  govern  this  country.  Whereas,  when  he  was  in  Government  for  two 

consecutive  terms,  he  had  no  problem  with  the  Government  of  the  day  being 

appointed  the  Caretaker  Government  on  the  dissolution  of  Parliament.  But  today 

</span><span>because he’s not in Government he thinks it’s a good idea. In 1983, a year that I will 

</span><span>never forgot, this country was governed for two weeks by an appointed person and I 

</span><span>made up my mind there and then that this was never ever going to happen again. Now 

the  Commission  in  their  wisdom  saw  fit  to  recommend  that  an  appointed  group  of 

people govern the country for this interim period.  Mr Speaker, I want to tell you and I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>1946 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>want  to  tell  every  Honourable  Member  and  our  people  listening  in,  that  this  action 

would be contrary to the spirit of democracy. 

</span></div><div><span>This  country  will  always  and  should  always  be  governed  by  elected  representatives, 

even during the interim period between the dissolution of Parliament and the swearing 

in  of  the  new  Parliament.    I  stand  firmly  on  that  principle,  Mr  Speaker,  and  for  34 

years there was no question about the transition period when the Government for the 

term  was  reappointed  by  the  representative  of  the  Head  of  State  as  the  caretaker 

Government  until  the  new  Government  was  sworn  in.  There  is  nothing  wrong  with 

</span><span>that system because it is in accordance with the spirit of democracy.  Let’s not have 

</span><span>any more talk about an appointed group of people governing this country because it is 

against the principles of democracy. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Norman George, made a great display of being very angry 

over  the  implications  of  these  new  provisions.  If  we  look  at  the  Bill  there  is  no 

retrospective  provision  saying  that  the  provisions  of  the  Bill  will  become  effective 

from a retrospective date, say January 1st, 1999. There is no such provision. In other 

words, he does not have to worry about what he and his party have been doing over 

</span><span>the last few weeks, or even since last year, so there is no cause to worry. Embodied in 

</span><span>this amendment Bill are the principles of a level playing field for those who want to 

go into the national political field. If there is anyone in this Honourable House who is 

against the principle of fairness of each Member having a fair go then let them show 

their true colours to our people listening. You will note that the same starting date for 

campaigning  for  each  individual  candidate  who  will  be  nominated  for  the  race  into 

this  Parliament  will  begin  at  the  same  time.  And  also  the  same  provisions  for 

expenditure for each candidate for each party. These are the issues being legislated in 

this Bill, the principle of fairness.   

</span></div><div><span>My  friend,  the  Honourable  Norman  George,  said  he  supports  the  new  part  2(a),  the 

petition of electors. I am glad to hear that.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>No, no, no. It’s 106(a).</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>  No,  you  support  the  petition  of  electors,  yes.  Well,  this  is  one  of 

those recommendations from the Political Review Commission where, in their view, 

and  Government  supports  it, the electors should have a say in  their elected Member 

after a period of 12 months in Parliament and not after 12 months from the end of the 

</span><span>term.  In  other  words,  we’re  looking  at  a  period  of  two  years  in  between.  If  the 

</span><span>Member  is  not  doing  his  work  and  the  grounds  are  laid  out  here,  for  example, 

habitually  failing  to  attend  sitting  days  of  Parliament.    Members  must  confess  it  is 

good common sense reason for recalling a Member of Parliament who does not attend 

sittings of Parliament as he is supposed to be doing. 

</span></div><div><span>The second ground for petitioning the Member of Parliament is neglecting to consult 

</span><span>with  and  report  to  that  Member’s  Constituency  on  matters  that  significantly  affect 

</span><span>them.  The  third  ground  is  the  neglect  by  the  Member  of  Parliament  to  convey  to 

Governm</span><span>ent  the  requirements  of  the  Member’s  constituents.  The  fourth  ground  for 

</span><span>petitioning  is  that  the  Member  has  become  unfit  to  hold  office  as  a  Member  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1947 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament  for  reasons  of  serious  misconduct  such  that  the  Member  is  held  in 

disrepute.  These are the grounds.  

</span></div><div><span>Members  of  a  Constituency  that  are  affected,  by  having  such  a  Member  represent 

them,  do  not  have  to  wait  until  the  end  of  the  term,  they  can  have  that  Member  of 

Parliament  removed  in  the  middle  of  the  term.  Listening  to  the  reaction  from  the 

members  of  the  public  concerning  the  Members  of  Parliament,  that  seems  to  be  a 

common call.  Which is probably the reason why they want to cut the term from five 

to four years, most are saying to three years, because they cannot wait to remove that 

Member of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, while I am  talking about  the term  of Parliament, if I can just express a 

thought  here,  I  want  to  tell  you  and  the  people  of  our  country  that  it  will  be  near 

impossible  to  change  the  term  from  five  years  to  whatever  we  want  because  the 

Government of Sir Thomas Davis in 1980-81 cemented that provision - the five-year 

term  -  and  it  will  be  nigh  impossible  to  change  it  because  it  requires  a  two-thirds 

support of the electors and two-thirds majority of the Members of Parliament. Before 

that,  it  only  required  a  two-thirds  majority  of  the  House  to  change  the  term  as  the 

</span><span>Cook Islands Party Government did, from three years to four years. But then, when Sir 

</span><span>Thomas  Davis  came in  with  his  Government,  consisting of the Honourable Member 

Dr  Pupuke  Robati  -  he  is  the  only  survivor  of  that  Government  -  they  cemented  it 

</span><span>solid.  The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati was just boasting, ‘ha, ha, ha, that 

was a good job we did’, oh yes, that’s right. To our people listening, if your wish is 

</span><span>not realised, </span><span>don’t blame this Government. You blame those people who cemented it 

</span><span>in such a way that it requires two-thirds of the electors of this country and two-thirds 

of the majority of the Members of the House. Your Government of today, the Cook 

Islands Party Government realises the difficulty, hence it is bringing into the electoral 

system what we now have before this House, the ability of the Constituencies to recall 

their Member of Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Point of Order. Is a retired Member allowed to speak?  

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA: </span><span>I am still in this House, thank you. I am speaking for the people of 

Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara,  preparing  the  way  for  the  Honourable  Teina  Bishop.  

The  Honourable  Member,  Norman  George,  showed  his  displeasure  in  having  the 

Mayor and Island Council Members and Members of the Vaka Council being put on 

the  same  ground  as  everyone  else  in  the  public  sector,  those  people  being  paid  by 

Crown  funds,  from  having  the  same  status,  that  is  having  to  resign.  What  is  the 

difference  between  a  Mayor,  a  Member  of  the  Island  Council  and  a  public  servant?  

There is no difference. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> They are elected by you.  They are not Crown Servants. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Yes, I accept that the people elected the Local Government. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>That’s right.  They ar</span><span>e not Crown Servants. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  But let them make up their own minds, if they want to be a Local 

Government  person  or  a  National  Government  person,  you  cannot  have  the  best  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>1948 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>two worlds.  So, Mr Speaker, I want to end by saying that those of us who are scared 

of reform, who are scared of giving every person who wants to run for Parliament a 

fair go, an equal opportunity, oppose this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>It’s not equal.</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  And I think the Honourable Member, Norman George has already 

shown the country his true colours on this Bill. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> The warrior spirit! Courage. That is our warrior tradition.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, to all Honourable Members and to our people who are 

listening in to our debate this afternoon - Greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to thank you for your apology this morning and I want to say 

to you that I have accepted your apology with pleasure. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when I look at the Explanatory Note in this Bill, it says it is based on the 

recommendations  made  by  the  Political  Review  Commission  in  its  Report  on 

Reforming the Political System of the Cook Islands.  Mr Speaker, these were the same 

people who were crucified, ridiculed and called childish in this very House. The Prime 

</span><span>Minister called them ‘childish’.  The Minister of Education says I am lying. Allow me 

to read to you what the Prime Minister said.  “There are also some recommendations, 

</span><span>Mr  Speaker,  that  are  so  shallow  as  to  be  childish  and  there  are  also  some 

recommendations  which  point  in  the  right  direction.    What  I  have  found  are  arrows 

</span><span>being shot at us Members in this House and you too, Mr Speaker.”</span></div><div><span>These are the same people who were crucified in this House and yet we take up their 

recommendations. Maybe it is because we are getting closer to the commemoration of 

the crucifixion  of Our Lord, which is  why this happened. What surprises me is this, 

Mr Speaker. They rejected and condemned thei</span><span>r Report and call it ‘childish’ yet they 

</span><span>accept  some  of  its  other  recommendations  in  here.  My  hope  was  for  the  Prime 

Minister to stand and apologise to these people whom they crucified and whose work 

</span><span>they ridiculed. If only it ended there. Instead, they made this Bill and told the public 

</span><span>that the provisions in here are based on the recommendations in the Report prepared 

by these people. If I may be allowed, Mr Speaker, permit me to apologise on behalf of 

this  House  to  the  Commission  of  Inquiry.    Their  Report  and  their  recommendations 

are perfectly in order which is why we accepted them in this House.   

</span></div><div><span>What are those people who condemned and crucified these people thinking now?  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Hypocrites, hypocrites.  

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  There  are  those  Members  of  Cabinet  who  have  supported  their 

Report,  such  as  the  Minister  of  Marine  Resources,  Education  and  the  Minister  of 

Justice.  However,  the  majority  of  the  Government  Members,  including  the  Member 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1949 

</span></div><div><span>for Amuri-Ureia, condemned and ridiculed these people. The Honourable Member is 

</span><span>saying, “Sorry”. I accept your apology.</span></div><div><span> (Much laughter) 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  the  surprising  thing.  It  is  claimed  that  this  Bill  is  based  on  the 

recommendations of the Commission but if one is to go through the other Clauses in 

this Bill it is </span><span>obvious that they have a different reason for creating it. It’s for their own 

</span><span>purposes. They are trying to prevent electoral activities because they are not yet ready 

to campaign. Here we are, we are all prepared for campaigning - as already mentioned 

by </span><span>the New Alliance Party Leader. We are ready already. The Prime Minister’s idea is 

</span><span>that  by  the  time  he  gets  back  from  the  Northern  Group,  this  Amendment  would  be 

passed  so  nobody  can  campaign.  Our  mistake  was  to  wait  till  after  Parliament  was 

dissolved before we start campaigning. We have no choice now - we are not permitted 

to campaign - if we do we will be fined. We will have to campaign later. This is a sad 

</span><span>state of affairs. Our Government is copying Hitler’s way of running things.</span></div><div><span>So  what  was  wrong  with  the  way  things  have  been  done  up  until  now?  Campaign 

</span><span>periods in the past were enjoyable. These are new ideas which have been introduced 

</span><span>by  Government  to  stop  us  from  campaigning.    Maybe  it  is  because  they  have  heard 

that the Mayor of Aitutaki may be a candidate in the next election. This could be why 

</span><span>they are doing this. I don’t think he is the only one </span><span>- there are a lot of other Mayors 

who want to stand for election because they are popular with the people. Why should 

we  prevent  them  from  standing?  If  the  people  want  to  vote  for  them and not  us, let 

them. We should accept that.  

</span></div><div><span>Those are my views now, Mr Speaker, but when we deal with the Clauses then I will 

register some more views. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  sit  down,  may  I  read  this  item  from  the  newspaper?  The  names  of  certain 

Ministers  have  been  mentioned  in  the  paper.  The  Minister  of  Marine  Resources  has 

stood  up  for  one  of  our  boys,  from  the  North,  alleged  to  have  done  wrong  but  the 

Minister helped him to clear his name. I felt sorry for this boy. Now he is in the clear. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>    Point  of  Order,  Mr  Speaker.    The  Point  of  Order  is  very 

obvious. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  I  was  only  giving  my  support  to  those  people  whose  names  are 

mentioned in the paper. I am now in doubt as to whether the speeches made yesterday 

were truthful because they differ from what is in the paper. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>    Point  of  Order,  Mr  Speaker.  If  the  Member  persists,  I  will 

raise Point of Order after Point of Order until he sits down. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate, and the Leader of the Democratic-Alliance 

Party. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>1950 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T. MAOATE:</span><span>Mr Speaker, I don’t know whether you heard the Deputy 

</span><span>Prime Minister saying there is another fool getting up. Did you hear that? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Do you accept what I said? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> If you heard him - it is not the sort of thing that is suitable 

</span><span>to  be  mentioned  in  this  House.  I  don’t  know  what  he  is  laughi</span><span>ng  about.    Maybe  he 

thinks it is a joke. I am not a fool like him. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise, Mr Speaker, to let him and his colleagues know what this Bill is all about. 

</span></div><div><span>I am very sorry for the Minister who has presented this Bill before the House.  He was 

a former policeman who knows the law and he ought to know the Constitution of this 

country.  The  Constitution  of  this  country,  Mr  Speaker,  has  been  breached  by  this 

Amendment  Bill.  I  am  telling  this  Minister  who  brought  this  Amendment  into  this 

House and all the Honourable Members of this House, together with our people who 

are listening in,  let me assure you that I will take this Amendment Bill to Court.  If 

this House passes this Bill, I will take this Bill to Court for breach of our human rights 

as stated in our Constitution. Yes, because this Amendment is taking away the rights 

of people to do what they want within the law. This Amendment Bill has been brought 

into  this  respectable  and  Honourable  House  by  these  terrible  people  to  abolish  the 

precious rights of our people provided for by Constitution. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the result of hasty decisions - hasty Bills. It is typical of last minute work - it is 

</span><span>rushed through and as a result it has not been analysed properly. Why didn’t they do it 

</span><span>properly  shortly  after  the  report  was  produced?  They  could  have  presented  it  to  the 

House  so  we  could  go  over  it  carefully,  but  now  it  is  being  rushed  through  without 

giving us time to examine it carefully. And now, what do we see? This untidy thing 

full of mistakes is being thrusted upon us. And if no changes are made to put this Bill 

right, I will refer this matter to Court.  

</span></div><div><span>Before  this  Bill  was  introduced  into  this  House,  we  were  already  advised  that  two 

youngsters from Aitutaki will be coming to this House. They are the ones behind the 

move to bar Mayors from standing in the Central Government General elections. Mr 

Speaker,  these  two  used  to  be  friends  with  the  Mayor.  They  shared  dialogue, 

socialised and ran businesses side by side. Now they have come to Rarotonga and this 

is  what  they did  when they got  here. They pushed the Minister of Education to step 

down and further, they got this Bill introduced into this House to prevent the Mayor 

from standing for election. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWITT:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>There is a Point of Order on the Floor 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWITT:</span><span> Irrelevancy. 193.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I am talking on the Bill. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1951 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Let me explain.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> Rubbish. Typical of stupid people.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span>You listen. I’ll explain. 193, Mr Speaker. I can’t see any mention 

</span><span>of the names of these two young folk from Aitutaki in this Bill. In this Bill there is no 

mention that they were responsible for stopping the Mayor from being nominated. Mr 

Speaker,  I  would  like  you  to  ask  the  Honourable  Member  to  leave  these  two  young 

men out as they are not in this Bill. Bring him back to the Bill.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>You don’t know what’s being said. </span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate.   

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.  Thank  you  for  that  rude 

interruption. Why stand up to say something against me when I was speaking on the 

Bill?   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Oh, if you accuse other people that is okay? ... (rest inaudible). 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>If the Honourable Member does not know to what is going 

on, sit down.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Order  please.  The  Floor  is  now  for  the  Honourable  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate.    

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. It’s no use, he doesn’t understand 

the meaning of the word. I know they don’t like my comments, but too bad they asked 

</span><span>for it. Even the </span><span>Deputy Prime Minister is complaining at the back here. I don’t want to 

</span><span>waste time with them they are useless to me. They are useless to me.  

</span></div><div><span>Now, this Amendment, Mr Speaker, has some good parts. The reason being they have 

been guided by the Report of this reputable Commission. Some of these Clauses are 

based on recommendations in that Report. Firstly, the right of the electors to petition 

idle-sitting Members, especially those from  the Government  bench. Not all of them, 

</span><span>only some, but I don’t want to ment</span><span>ion names.     

</span></div><div><span>So the first part of the Bill is in order. If only we listened to the people for a three-year 

</span><span>Parliamentary term, then we wouldn’t need this Bill. If a Member is not working, the 

</span><span>electors have the option to throw him or her out without waiting for another election. 

Secondly, the Political Reform told them what to do and I totally agree with them. If 

we  look  further  back,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is  obvious  why  this  Government  is  panicking. 

The Cook Islands Party does not know what to do. They are unable to call meetings of 

their own, and the only thing they could do is to bring this Amendment in to restrict 

the campaign period.  They are trying, through this amendment, to threaten the people 

</span><span>by restricting them from doing things of their own. They have given up already. The 

</span><span>proof  of  that  is  the Minister at  the back here, he does not  want  to  step down.   The 

Honourable  Minister  Ngereteina  Puna,  he  did  not  want  to  step  down.  He  came  into 

this House and said that he is giving the chance to the young people, that is not true.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>1952 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>These  young  people  pushed  him  out.    Maybe  my  ‘bro’  here  has  retired  at  the  right 

</span><span>time, and I doubt if I can compare him to the Honourable Member at the back here. 

</span><span>My only reservation is his replacement.  I don’t like him because he fix</span><span>ed the roads in 

Matavera only and not the ones in Ngatangiia. 

</span></div><div><span>Clause  7  here,  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  certain  that  this  breaches  the  Constitution  of  the 

Cook Islands. I am certain what I am required to do when this Amendment is passed 

in  this  House.  If  only  we  could  debate  it  and  leave  it  for  the  next  Parliament  to 

</span><span>implement  ...but  the  unfortunate  thing  is,  it  does  not  look  like  it’s  going  to  go  that 

</span><span>way. What is becoming apparent is this - this Bill will be put into effect by the time 

the Prime Minister returns from his campaign trip to the Northern Group. Despite this, 

I want to reassure this House that it will not prevent me from visiting my friends in the 

Northern Group because it will be an excellent opportunity for me to meet with them.  

</span></div><div><span>700 people in Pukapuka are awaiting my arrival and Tiaki Wuatai has invited me to 

visit, this Bill says I have no right to go to Pukapuka to campaign. This is not right. 

Mr Speaker, what will I do about this invitation from this gentleman and the people of 

Pukapuka to visit them? I want to go there to ask them what they want. I want to find 

</span><span>out  if they prefer Wuatai or the Deputy Prime Minister. I am  not  allowed to  do this 

</span><span>sort of thing when I get there. This shows me that this Bill was created to prevent me 

from going to Pukapuka next week to campaign. I know the Deputy Prime Minister is 

behind the passage of this Bill to prevent me from travelling to Pukapuka and Nassau 

to campaign. They created a Bill to stop the Mayor of Aitutaki from getting involved 

in  the  General  Election.  This  is  the  promise  made  to  the  two  young  men  by  the 

Minister of Education. He told them not to worry about it.  

</span></div><div><span>I asked a question of the Honourable Member, Dr Joseph Williams, when he was still 

here.  I  like  asking  questions  of  Dr  Williams  and  the  Honourable  Member,  Tom 

Marsters  because  they  answer  honestly.  I  asked  Dr  Joe  Williams  whether  he  was 

aware  that  if  any  amendment,  such  as  the  one  we  have  now,  will  be  introduced.  It 

</span><span>would  mean  a  Member  would  have  to  step  down.  He  replied,  ‘I  looked  at  it  and  </span><span>it 

</span><span>doesn’t look  like it will happen’. See what happened, Mr Speaker? The moment the 

</span><span>Honourable  Member  Dr  Joseph  Williams  left  for  New  Zealand  they  inserted  this 

Clause into the Bill. The Members of Government are doing this dirty act against their 

own Memb</span><span>ers.  I don’t worry about the people on this side, but the people in the back 

</span><span>row have a terrible attitude.  There is a verse, which says, what you sow is what you 

</span><span>will reap. You created this Bill and I tell you, it will come back and bite you.  

</span></div><div><span>I want to assure you, Honourable Members, that the people of Aitutaki who have been 

supporting Tai Herman will dramatically increase now that you have introduced this 

Bill  into  this  House.  This  is  the  most  terrible  Bill  ever  introduced  in  this  House 

because it clearly contravenes the Constitution of the country. 

</span></div><div><span>I don’t feel like supporting this Bill. Why do we have to bring this kind of Bill into the 

</span><span>House? We are targeting certain individuals in order to prevent them from standing. I 

</span><span>don’t like this sort of Bill  </span><span>because it is shortsighted. There is no long-term vision in 

</span><span>this Bill. Let me tell you that today the Mayor of Auckland, New Zealand, is a woman 

who is also a Member of Parliament. Maybe these Ministers do not know that.  She 

was  interviewed  on  television.  She  said  she  is  able  to  carry  her  responsibilities  as 

</span></div><div><a>Page 36</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1953 

</span></div><div><span>Mayor and as  a Member of Parliament as well.  I don’t know  </span><span>- we are a very small 

island, why do we have to bring this type of legislation into our country. I want you to 

know,  Mr  Speaker,  that  I  was  already  aware  of  this  Clause  because  the  message 

arrived to let me know that the Minister had accepted the request of these two young 

men. The Minister told them not to worry, he would step down. Goodbye! Goodbye! 

</span></div><div><span>Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, it was the Ministers in the back row that introduced this 

Bill.  The  Leader  of  the  Alliance  Party  is  shouting  out...  Mama  Ngai  was formerly a 

staunch CIP supporter but maybe because they heard that she no longer supports them 

they brought this Bill in, to discourage her. Maybe they prepared this Bill because they 

were angry with their own former supporters for taking away their support. I want our 

people  to  know  that  this  is  one  of  those  rushed,  dirty  and  corrupt  activities  being 

carried out  by this  Government against its people. They are treating our people as if 

they  are  stupid.  That  is  what  they  are  giving  to  our  people.  This  Government  is 

committing  a  terrible  and  sad  thing  against  its  people  in  the  last  days  before  the 

Election. I feel sorry for the people of this country because this Amendment will not 

benefit our people. 

</span></div><div><span>What  should  be  amended  is  the  way  they  govern.  When  we  compare  this  Clause  7 

</span><span>with  what  they inflicted upon us in  the past  in  the Letters of Guarantee, Clause 7 is 

nothing when compared to the damage that that could have caused in this country. If 

you  compare  this  Clause  with  the  way  Government  diverted  funds  from  the 

Superannuation Scheme, this is nothing. When you compare this with what happened 

to  the  money  lost  by  Vincent  Ingram  and  ECIL,  this  is  nothing compared with  that. 

Serves them right for their poor management. 

</span></div><div><span>If  I  am  to  recount  all  of  the  different  diseases  which  have  afflicted  our  country,  Mr 

Speaker, it is very sad. The negative results of this Clause 7 are nothing compared to 

the Sheraton Hotel where millions of dollars was lost. Consider the enormous debt we 

owe  to  other  countries  in  loans.  Luckily,  those  countries  agreed  to  reduce  and 

restructure our debt so we can manage to pay it back - that is, if our economy does not 

decline further. I ask, will this Clause 7 be able to entice the 5,000 people who left our 

</span><span>shores in the past few years, to return home?  I don’t think so.  What about the 2,000 

</span><span>people  who  lost  their  jobs,  how  will  this  Clause  bring  them  back?  How  pitiful,  Mr 

Speaker.  This  Government  is  bringing  all  the  stupid  things  in  here  instead  of 

concentrating  on  the  important  things  such  as  addressing  the  needs  of  our  people. 

</span><span>What  happened to  the workers of this country who were laid off? They were driven 

</span><span>elsewhere  to  seek  work.  We  all  know  why  this  happened,  the  country  is  bankrupt. 

There is no doubt about it - this country is bankrupt.   

</span></div><div><span>There  are  some  Cook  Islands  Party  supporters  who,  despite  the  fact  that  there  is 

something wrong, pretend not to be aware of it. They are the </span><span>same people who don’t 

</span><span>know  the  difference  between  what  is  good  and  what  is  bad.  They  are  just  like  their 

bosses  in  this  House.  They  are  exactly  the  same  as  their  bosses  in  this  House.  

</span><span>Wherever the boss goes, they follow. Sorry, my time is up. Why don’t on</span><span>e of you get 

</span><span>up and extend my time? Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 37</a></div><div><span>1954 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:  </span><span>Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  Greetings  also  to  all  our  people 

listening in this afternoon. I rise, Mr Speaker, to make a brief comment in support of 

the Bill.  I do not know who is the more ignorant amongst us, whether it is him or us. 

But  I will tell  you what  I know about this Bill. The Leader of the Opposition said a 

Mayor  cannot  stand  in  a  General  Election.  His  remarks  regarding  ignorance and the 

haphazardness  of  this  Bill  prompted  me  to  speak  out.  Mr  Speaker,  the  Mayor  has  a 

right to be nominated at the next election. The Leader of the Opposition is calling us 

ignorant when he is the </span><span>one who doesn’t know what he is talking about. The Mayor 

</span><span>can  stand  but  he  needs  to  resign  first.  Maybe  he  was  very  angry  and  that  is  why  he 

</span><span>couldn’t think straight. </span></div><div><span>A young man once said, if you want to become a leader you need to lead by example.  

Simple and easy to understand. Mr Speaker, if you weigh it up, who is ignorant - him 

or  us?  The  Member  for  Rakahanga  is  saying  that  he  will  decide.  I  am  sure  that  his 

answer will be that it is the two of them. The reason is, they have not fully explained 

to the listening public all of the details contained in this Bill. Councillors and Mayors 

have to resign first. He is misleading the Mayors and the Councillors so that they will 

</span><span>believe that they have no right to stand in the next election. I don’t know why he’s</span><span> left 

</span><span>the  Chamber.  He’s  just  finished  talking  and  left.  I  never  walked  out  when  he  was 

</span><span>speaking.  Now it is my turn, he does not want to listen to me. 

</span></div><div><span>He mentioned these two young men who came to Parliament. They were not here to 

see  the  Minister  but  because  they happened to  be in  Rarotonga at  the time they just 

wanted to come in here and observe.  He was saying that the Cook Islands Party is not 

ready and that is why we created this Amendment. The Cook Islands Party is ready.  

His  Party  is  the  one  who is  </span><span>not  ready because they haven’t organised a Member for 

</span><span>them to stand in my constituency of Amuri-Ureia yet. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I had no intention of talking like that but when he insulted us by calling 

</span><span>us ‘ignorant’, I had to respond in kind. The people of the Co</span><span>ok Islands know that we 

are not brilliant. Mr Speaker, please correct me if I am wrong - </span><span>there’s a song which 

says,  ‘when  you  look  at  them  they  are  childish,  when  you  look  at  them  they  are 

drunkards, but when you crash into them, you will be ‘had it’’.</span></div><div><span>(much laughter) 

</span></div><div><span>I was waiting for the Member of Rakahanga to assist me by completing the song but 

</span><span>he didn’t. He only gave me a big smile.  Honourable Members, my colleague and I are 

</span><span>in this form. When you run into us, your heads will hurt. This is the story of a rugby 

team who will drink all week and then they play rugby on Saturday. They are good.  In 

this  House  there  are  no  ignorant  or  clever  Members.  We  are  all  the  same,  we  are 

</span><span>Members of Parliament. Don’t show me your credentials.  I don’t have any. But </span><span>if you 

lash out at me, watch out. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  that  is  why  I  rose  -  to  confirm  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  that  I 

</span><span>intend  to  stand  again  and  to  tell  him  that  Mayors  also  have  a  right  to  stand.  This  is 

what I was taught at school - when you speak, be clear so people can understand what 

</span></div><div><a>Page 38</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1955 

</span></div><div><span>you are talking about. Not like this - that the Mayors cannot stand for election. This is 

all I have to say now, Mr Speaker. That is why I stood up. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Marine Resources, Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.  Mr  Speaker,  I  rose  to  give  my 

support  to  the  Bill  before  the  House.  Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Speaker  and  to  all  staff 

members  in  this  Honourable  House  this  afternoon.  Greetings  also  to  the  Prime 

Minister, who is in the Northern Group. Tomorrow, you will arrive in Penrhyn where 

there  will  be  a  great  welcoming  reception  for  you.  Everything  has  been  organised. 

Thank  you  to  the  Mayor  of  Tongareva  for  I  have  received  your  programme  for  the 

</span><span>Prime  Minister’s  arrival  tomorrow.  Greetings  to  all  the  people  of  Penrhyn,  to  the 

</span><span>Councillors, to the Pastors and the Assistant Pastors and your parishioners, Kia Orana 

to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Deputy Prime Minister in the House and all Honourable Members - Kia Orana.  

Greetings  also  to  our  listening  public  all  over  the Cook Islands who are listening to 

our debate this afternoon. Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  we  have  an  Amendment  to  the  Electoral  Act  presently  in  front  of  the 

House. We have heard the Minister of Justice summarise the principles and merits of 

this Bill. As I listened to him it became clear to me what the spirit and purpose of this 

Bill is. I also listened, Mr Speaker, to the previous speakers. It became apparent that 

some of them support most of the Bill but there are some Clauses which they disagree 

with. We heard the Honourable Member Dr Woonton say that it is Clause 7 in the Bill 

which they do not support. The problem appears to be the campaign period.  

</span></div><div><span>Clause 7 - 106B says that anybody who does anything outside the parameters of the 

Bill will be committing an offence.  I believe Mr Speaker that our people who listened 

to the previous speakers will also be listening to this point being discussed. Mr 

</span><span>Speaker.  106A Interpretation clarifies “campaign period” </span><span>- which is the period of 5 

weeks immediately preceding 6pm on the day before polling day.  

</span></div><div><span>We have heard the views expressed earlier of some of those who opposed and those 

who  supported  the  Bill.  We  heard  the  views  expressed  by  the  Leader  of  the  New 

Alliance Party together with the views of the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party.    

Both  of  them  touched  on  106A  and  106B.  They  argued  that  these  provisions 

contravene the Constitution of the Cook Islands. That is their interpretation. My view 

is quite different from theirs. I do not agree with their interpretation of the law.  The 

reason  for  this  is,  if  we  look  at  the  fundamental  human  rights  in  article  64  of  the 

Constitution, which I will read aloud:  

 </span><span>“64(2) It is hereby recognised and declared that every person has duties to others 

</span><span>and  accordingly  is  subject  in  the  exercise  of  his  rights  and  freedoms  to  such 

limitations as are imposed, by any enactment or rule of law for the time being in force, 

for protecting the rights and freedoms of others or in the interests of public safety, or 

</span><span>order, or morals, the general welfare, or the security of the Cook Islands”</span></div><div><a>Page 39</a></div><div><span>1956 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:  </span><span>That’s a hollow argument. This  Amendment is  taking away our 

</span><span>right - it is not protecting it.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  You  know,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  the  freedom  of  speech  and 

expression as enacted in article 64(2) is subject to such limitations as are imposed by 

any enactment or rule of law for the time being in force, in the interests of the general 

welfare of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>Why don’t you read 65(b)? Why do not you go down further and 

</span><span>read the whole thing... 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Deputy  Speaker,  to  ask  these 

Honourable Members not to interfere with my speaking time. Mr Deputy Speaker, do 

they want to take the Floor? I will sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  the  test  is  whether  that  restriction  as  set  out  in  Clause  7,  is  a 

matter of public interest, or is it a matter of public policy. If it is, it is not ultra virus to 

the Constitution. If it does... 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>It is.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  ...then,  the  argument  maybe  looked  at  favourably.  Then  as 

stated  by  the  Leader  of  Democratic  Alliance  Party  he  will  take  this  matter  to  the 

Court.  That is his freedom to do that.  No one is going to stop him.  He can go right 

ahead.   

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  Deputy  Speaker  to  the  public  interest.  This  public  interest  in  the 

Constitution  in  Article  64(2)  of  the  Constitution  is  echoed  through  the  voice  of  the 

people.  The voice of the people for particular islands and villages which were visited 

at the time by the Political Reform Commission.  

</span></div><div><span>                                              (Interjections inaudible) 

</span></div><div><span>This  public interest  matter raised by the people, Mr Deputy Speaker, is contained in 

one  of  the  recommendations  in  the  Report  of  the  Political  Reform  Commission.  In 

</span><span>fact, the Commission’s recommendation is for the campaign period, from the people, 

</span><span>to  be  restricted  between  4  and  6  weeks.  There  were  reasons,  from  the  people,  and 

</span><span>again echoed in the report of the Political Review Commission. The public identified 

a division in families, in the community, as one of those reasons.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> That was in the seventies.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Our  people  saw  the  tension  within  families  and  the 

community  during campaign periods. Mr Deputy Speaker, there was a lot of burden 

on the families, on the relatives, on the supporters supporting a particular candidate, or 

supporting a political party either in the transportation of their members or supporters, 

or  in  the  preparation  of  food  and  other  things.  You  see,  Deputy  Speaker,  all  those 

things put together brought about the need to make this Amendment. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 40</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1957 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> These are repressive measures. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span> Mr Deputy Speaker, this amendment is directed at the welfare 

of the people... 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>They didn’t ask for it. You are choking them. </span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  ...whose  concern  are  the  demands  on  them  during  the  long 

period of campaign.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> They are not complaining to us. They come and buy the goat meat 

- no problems.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span> The tension, Mr Deputy Speaker, the division amongst family 

members  in  the  community  -  all  of  these  things  have  been  identified  by  the 

Commission,  upon  which  the  recommendation  to  reduce  the  campaign  period  is 

based. That is the reason, Mr Deputy Speaker that this Amendment was brought to the 

House. It is on this basis. The Government listening to the voice of the people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>  ...  (interjection  inaudible)...  it  is  not  the people...  this  is  one of 

their final acts. This is their farewell.  

</span></div><div><span>HON  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  That  is  why,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  the  majority  of  the  House 

will support the Bill before the House.  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Minister.  Any further speakers please? 

The Honourable Member for Manihiki, Dr Robert Woonton . 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>  Greetings  to  you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Greetings  to  you this 

afternoon.  Greetings  to  all  Honourable  Members  of  both  sides  of  the  House,  to  the 

Honourable Members on the Opposition, and those on the Government side. A special 

Kia Orana to our people listening in.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Deputy Speaker, I was hoping that because we had only a few days of Parliament 

left,  that  we  would  end  on  a  peaceful  note,  instead  we  are  faced  with  a  threatening 

piece  of  legislation.  The  bulk  of  the legislation is  ok, there is  no problem  with  that.  

But  when you come to  Clause 7 of this Bill, this is where the worry is.  Mr Deputy 

Speaker, I liken this piece of legislation to a blow below the belt. I know it will hurt 

our people because we are now taking away their freedoms which were secured and 

guaranteed  under  our  Constitution  especially  Article  64  (1)  which  guarantees  our 

freedom  of  thought,  conscience,  and  religion;  freedom  of  speech  and  expression. 

Article 64 also guarantees our freedom of peaceful assembly and association. To me, 

this Bill is unsettling foundations. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>We can’t even have public meetings. </span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> We are taking away the freedom of our people to choose which 

political party they want, how they would like to assemble and put their ideas together 

for a better future for our country. The Bill before the House makes it a crime if we 

</span></div><div><a>Page 41</a></div><div><span>1958 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>assemble  anywhere  for  any  political  activity.  If  we  write  articles,  or  carry  out  any 

actions or make any expressions, we will be convicted of an offence against this Act. 

If you perform these functions before the designated period of campaigning, they will 

be classed as a criminal offence against this Act. The Crimes Act can put you in gaol 

for no more than 14 years. This one legislation should be put to a Referendum in the 

</span><span>coming  election.  Don’t  come  into  this  House  and  claim  it  is  what  the  people  want.  

</span><span>The people will say what they want if this question is put to them in a Referendum.  

</span></div><div><span>This  action  is  a  bid  by  a  desperate  Government  to  stay  in  power  by  introducing 

legislation like this to obstruct Opposition from winning Government by legal means.  

Is the incumbent Government too scared to run in a level playing field? If they are not 

scared then they should remove Clause 7 from the Bill and put it to the people through 

a Referendum. Ask them if they want it or not. We make legislation to make life more 

comfortable for our people. Over the last few days, we have been passing legislation 

after legislation to oppress our people, to penalise our people and to restrict them.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Deputy Speaker, this kind of legislation will bring riots to this country. You are a 

former policeman, you should understand that this kind of legislation will bring unrest 

</span><span>to  the  country.    I  am  not  trying  to  be  a  hero,  there  is  no  hero  here.  Our  country  is 

</span><span>known as Christian, recorded in our Constitution are our Christian beliefs, why bring 

legislation to oppress the very people we are trying to support? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Hear, hear. 

</span></div><div><span>DR. R. WOONTON:</span><span> The Honourable Minister of Education is saying we are saving 

expenses to our people. Our people are voluntarily giving time and resources to help 

our cause, there is nobody who is pushed to do this, unless the Cook Islands Party is 

oppressing their supporters. I can tell you, if I have to name one person who funded 

the  Cook  Islands  Party  campaign  before  the  last  one,  that  person  who  funded  that 

party declared it to me himself. He is on the island. I do not have any problem if you 

have to scrutinise our books. You are welcome if you want to come and scrutinise the 

books. I do not have a problem if you ask the Mayor to step down before he stands for 

election as a Member of Parliament. That is his right to choose. This is the very basic 

principle  we  are  talking  about  -  the  freedom  to  express  oneself.  If  you  want  to  be a 

Member of Parliament, you can run but you have to give up the Mayoralty. 

</span></div><div><span>The only part of this legislation I am very much in favour of is the part that gives our 

</span><span>people the power to recall a Member of Parliament who is not performing. It’s a pity, 

</span><span>Mr Deputy Speaker that this legislation was not brought in 1994 because some of us 

would  not  be  in  the  House  if  the  power  of  recall  was  activated  then.  Probably 

including myself.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a conscience issue. We have to look at it seriously, are we 

being fair to our people? There are only four more days when we will not be Members 

of  Parliament  again.  When  Parliament  is  dissolved  we  might  be  Members  of 

Parliament until the next election, but we only have four days of this Parliament, why 

bring in oppressive legislation like this so our people will be in turmoil?   

</span></div><div><a>Page 42</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1959 

</span></div><div><span>I would urge Members of this House to vote with your conscience. Put aside political 

hats and vote from your heart.  Just for once in five years, let us honestly answer the 

request our people have asked of us. I have been informed by the Leader of the New 

Alliance  Party  that  this  legislation  will  not  be  in  effect  until  May,  this  will  give  us  

time to prepare ourselves because right now our people are waiting to know when the 

election will be.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, Greetings to you. Now, I will come back to the part of the Bill which was 

recommended by the Commission of Political Revi</span><span>ew’s Report. I am in full support of 

</span><span>those provisions. It is a pity that Clause 7 has tainted this good intention of bringing 

</span><span>those  recommendations  by  the  Political  Review  Commission.  It  doesn’t  matter,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker. The people will decide at election time. </span><span>It won’t be long now. Thank you.  </span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Minister, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. Through you, Sir, I would like to thank 

both  sides  of  the  House  this  afternoon,  as  well  as  the  people  who  are  hopefully 

listening in to the debate.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, with your permission I would like to begin my support of the Bill in the 

House by quoting an editorial report in the newspaper this morning. It is on page 4 and 

it  reads:    </span><span>“In  its  summary  and  main  recommendation  the  Political  Review 

Commission’s Report says, the clear wish of the people now is for prompt achievable, 

</span><span>and manageable adjustments and improvements to alleviate some of the problems and 

prepare us better for the c</span><span>hallenges of the future.”</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, that is not my quotation.  It’s the Editorial of the local newspaper of this 

country,  it’s  the  voice  of  the  people  of  this  country  and  it’s  substantiated,  if 

</span><span>Honourable Members care to look into the Political Review C</span><span>ommission’s Report, by 

the  very  issues  that  we  are  dealing  with  today.  It’s  in  page 77 twice and in  page 37 

once. Everything that this Bill is dealing with in this House is there. It’s the wish of 

</span><span>the people of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Exactly.  The Opposition does not want to listen to the people. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Now Sir, allow me to come back to the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I give my full support to the Bill introduced by the Minister of Justice for 

us  the  Honourable  Members  of  this  H</span><span>ouse  to  consider.  I  don’t  know  where  the 

</span><span>information  came  from  with  regards  to  the  allegations  by  some  Members  that  our 

people will be fined - $1,000, or $10,000.  No, Mr Speaker. It does not say our people 

will be subject to prosecution, it says you and I, and the Members are! Nowhere in this 

Bill does it say that the people will be prosecuted. This Bill is there to pre-warn us and 

</span><span>any  future  Parliamentarians  of  this  country.  This  is  not  the  people’s  Bill,  it  is  ours. 

</span><span>This  is  what  this  Bill  is  all  about.  This  is  the  desire  of  the  people  of  this  country. 

People  have  aired  their  views  on  the  Radio  Talkback  in  the  last  few  days.  They  are 

asking when we are going to respond. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 43</a></div><div><span>1960 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>When this Report came into Cabinet in October of last year every Member was very 

alarmed just as we all were in this House later, when the Report was tabled. We were 

ridiculed  which caused each and everyone of us to question our functions and roles as 

Members of Parliament. We thought that we had lost our mandate to lead our people, 

all  of  us  developed  some  doubt  about  our  roles.  I  was  one  of  those  people  who 

followed  those  views.  I  am  proud  of  the  Honourable  Member  who  introduced  this 

recommendation  into  this  House  because  it  was  this  Government  which  set  up  this 

Commission of Political Review.  

</span></div><div><span>There are a couple of things in this Bill that I am not happy about.  The Cabinet will 

be meeting after this debate tonight to look at what needs to be removed from the Bill 

so  that  we  not  only  satisfy  every  Member  in  Parliament  at  present  but  those  in  the 

future. Mr Speaker, we feel that there are a couple of things that need to be looked at 

again.  Mr  Speaker,  I  want  to  tell  you  that  a  proposal  was  made  tonight  that  some 

matters raised yesterday and probably this morning will be guillotined. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>... (interjections inaudible)...What is it all for?  

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span> Government decided this morning that we wanted the House to 

air their views on this Bill today, tonight and maybe tomorrow. I invite the Members 

to  be  patient.    We  need  to  meet  tomorrow  morning  and  in  the  afternoon  as  well  in 

order to fully analyse the various aspects of the Bill. Mr Speaker, I would like to ask 

all  Honourable  Members  that  after  I  finish  speaking,  we  adjourn  and  give  Members 

time to go home and prepare themselves to come back for our next sitting at 7.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I sit down, I would like to acknowledge the time that the Deputy Speaker took 

in  the  Chair  this  afternoon.    I  wish  he  was  sitting  on  that  seat  when  the  two 

Honourable Members from the Opposition raised their points.  With those comments 

on  the  Bill  before the House, Sir, I say thank you very much indeed for listening to 

me.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  give  my 

support to the Bill before the House.  I support the Bill from Clause 1 to Clause 7.  No 

matter what the criticisms of the Opposition are against the Bill. They are entitled to 

thei</span><span>r views. Their main objection, Mr Speaker, is to Clause 7. I don’t know why they 

</span><span>have a problem. This Clause is there to try and protect the interests of our people. It is 

based  on  a  request  by  the  people  which  they  put  forward  to  the  Commission  of 

Political Review through their Report. The Members of the Opposition should not say 

that this came from the Government alone, no. This came from the people to us. One 

of  the  benefits  of  this  Amendment  before  us  is  the  shifting  of  the  burden  off  the 

shoulders  of  the  electors,  especially  the  supporters  of  the  DAP  and  the  NAP.  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker,  I  feel  sorry  for  the  supporters  of  these  two  parties.  They  have  been 

</span><span>fundraising  and  campaigning  since  last  year.  Their  supporters  have  been  supplying 

chicken and other goodies and yet, their children have been suffering for lack of those 

</span></div><div><a>Page 44</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1961 

</span></div><div><span>same  foodstuffs  in  their  homes.  I  feel  sorry  for  the  supporters  who  sent  their  goats 

</span><span>from Atiu, and yet they don’t have that many goats. This is a great burden on them. </span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Order.  Order please. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>  Mr  Speaker,  this  Bill  is  removing  the  chain  that  binds  the 

necks  of  our  people  in  the  form  of  the  campaigns  and  fundraising  expenses  of  our 

political parties.  

</span></div><div><span>Don’t say that this is not the desire of our people. This is the voice</span><span> of the people in the 

Report of the Commission. It is being reflected in this Bill. If the Government sets it 

in  motion,  it  is  not  good  because  it  was  us  who  set  it  up.  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  not 

surprised  with  the  views  of  the  Leaders  of  the  New  Alliance  and  the  DAP  parties.  

They  want  the  fund  raising  to  continue  because  they  are  the  ones  benefiting.  They 

want  to  spend  it  by  travelling  to  all  the  outer  islands.  Therefore,  I  am  not  surprised 

when  they  got  up  and  opposed  the  time  limit  on  the  campaign  period.  The</span><span>y  don’t 

</span><span>realise  how  much  pressure  and  pain  they  are  inflicting  upon  our  people.  They  have 

been campaigning since last year and if the people sit down and calculate the amount 

of money they have spent on this campaign, it is huge.  

</span></div><div><span>This Bill is the saviour of the people. It is removing the chains which have bound us 

since 1965 through Clause 7 by reducing the campaign period. Our people are sick of 

politics.  Politics,  politics,  politics.  When  the  Churches  campaign,  the  response  from 

the  people  is  weak.  They  </span><span>can’t  be  bothered  anymore.  These  political  campaigns  sap 

our  people’s  strength  and  finances.  People  are  sick  of  listening  to  and  seeing  these 

</span><span>political  campaigns  on  the  TV.  Clause  7  is  not  removing  our  fundamental  human 

rights - it is taking the burden of the political campaign period from them, by reducing 

it to 5 weeks. 

</span></div><div><span>As  the  Minister  of  the  Police  said  earlier,  the  Bill  is  based  upon  the  views  of  the 

people, formulated through the recommendations of the Political Review Commission 

and translated into this Bill.  The Minister of Justice did not come up with this idea by 

himself.  It  was  not  devised  to  help  his  colleagues  in  Cabinet.  No,  you  may  see  the 

recommendation on Page 77 of the Report by the Political Review Commission.  

</span></div><div><span>We heard the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party saying that as soon as this Bill 

is passed, he will take it to Court.  I am saying, go ahead and take us to Court and I 

</span><span>hope  you  are  paying  for  the  costs  yourself.  Don’t  get  the  people  in  the  Democratic 

</span><span>Alliance Party to fund it. Prove to us how good you are. Show us how strong you are.  

I know those fighting words are just to show his Party supporters that he is strong and 

able. 

</span></div><div><span>From  Clause  1  to  7,  Mr  Speaker,  we  will  see  the  good  intentions  of  the  Bill.  It  is 

attempting  to  tidy  up  the  Electoral  Act  as  well  as  our  activities  during  the  General 

Election.  It  is  trying  to  reduce  problems  during  Election  time.  I  congratulate  the 

Minister of Justice for bringing this Bill before the House to strengthen the electoral 

laws of our country in order to lessen the strain on our people during Election time. I 

will  end  here.  I  stood  to  voice  my  thoughts  on  Clause  7  which  was  the  Clause  the 

Opposition  objected  to  strongly.  I  am  not  worried  by  the  comment  that  this  is  an

</span></div><div><span>attempt by the Cook Islands Party Government to obstruct the Opposition because it is 

not  ready  for  campaigning.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  they  are  the  ones  who  are  not 

ready.  They  should  be  telling  themselves  that  they  are  the  ones  who  are  not  ready 

which  is  why  they  have  been  campaigning  since  last  year.  It  shows  they  are  in  a 

desperate position. Yes, it is not the Government who is unprepared. The Government 

is already prepared for the upcoming Election. We are just waiting for the date to be 

announced. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.   The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to</span></div><div><span>CLERK OF THE PARLIAMENT: </span><span>A Bill intituled: An Act to amend the Electoral 

Act 1998.
