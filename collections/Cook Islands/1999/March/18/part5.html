<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Ministry of Outer Island Development. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $7,729,385 for Ministry of Outer Island Development 

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman. Kia Orana to you on this beautiful new day, 

Kia  Orana  to  the  staff  of  this  House,  Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister  who  is  on  a 

working trip. The Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Honourable Members on 

the Opposition side of the House and Government Members, Kia Orana to you all this 

morning. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to  send special Greetings to the Prime Minister and his delegation who 

are on a trip to the Northern Group.  I would like to extend our Greetings to him and 

his delegation. Maybe he was listening to Members of the Opposition criticising him 

last night.  All I would like to say is if the people of Rakahanga have turned up with 

their sacks, put a few coconuts in and send them back. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  also  to  all  our  people  listening  in  this  morning,  some  of  whom  may  be 

</span><span>angry with us and some of whom may be happy as they listen to this debate.

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I rise again, Mr Chairman, to give my support to this Appropriation for the Ministry of 

the  Outer  Islands  Development    for  the  sum  of  $7,729,000.  The  Ministry  of  Outer 

Islands  Development,  Mr  Chairman,  has  been  put  in  charge  of  all  the  Government 

Departments on the island of Aitutaki. The Health Department, the Education and all 

other  Departments  have  been  responsible  to  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Islands 

Development. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Oh rubbish! 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Mr Chairman, the Honourable Member for Rakahanga is saying this is 

rubbish.  We  all  know  and  I  know,  Mr  Chairman  that  the  Ministry  of  Marine 

Resources  on  the  island  of  Aitutaki  is  still  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of 

Marine Resources.  We all know this.  We discussed it over the last few days and what 

I  am  talking  about  are  the  Departments  that  are  in  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Islands 

Development  on the island of Aitutaki.  I have told him before that when  I speak he 

should keep quite because I know what I am talking about. I am the one talking. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You are irrelevant, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  About  the  Public  Health  Department  on  the  island  of  Aitutaki,  they 

are the people that are responsible for carrying out health inspections throughout the 

villages.  People on some islands, in fact, in most of the country, are very concerned 

about the increase of mosquitoes and the lack of assistance given to them to eradicate 

this problem. Mr Chairman, if we have  the money, there may be less mosquitoes.  But 

if it rains there will be mosquitoes. If it is shining there will still be mosquitoes.  There 

</span><span>will be mosquitoes all the time. I don’t want the Honourable Member to say ‘rubbish’ 

</span><span>because when it rains we all know that there are going to be mosquitoes.  

</span></div><div><span>We all heard from the Mayor of Atiu on the radio yesterday, highlighting the problems 

that the island of Atiu is having because there is no chemical spray sent there. It is a 

problem  because  there  are  no  chemicals  on  Rarotonga.  So,  what  does  he  mean  by 

</span><span>‘rubbish’?  The  problem  is  with  the  landowners  that  own  the  land  where  the 

</span><span>mosquitoes  are  breeding.  I  believe  that  those  people  who  have  cleaned  their  homes 

and surrounding areas will not have much problems with mosquitoes. We have heard 

it  is  a  problem  in  Atiu.  In  Aitutaki  there  have  been  a  lot  of  instances  where  some 

people  cleaned  their  own  yards  but  adjacent  to  them  are  homes  which  are  empty. 

These areas have become overgrown with weeds and I believe these places encourage 

mosquitoes to breed.  I would like to say to the Honourable Member from Rakahanga 

that  I  am  not  saying  for  an  excuse.  No,  I  am  telling  you  what  I  have  experienced.  I 

</span><span>know  what  caused  the  increase  in  mosquitoes.  I  don’t  know  why  he  ha</span><span>s  a  problem 

</span><span>with me when his problem is with the Speaker. Now he’s turning  to me.</span></div><div><span>At  our  church,  there  are  properties  surrounding  it  in  the  village  of  Amuri  which we 

</span><span>don’t  have  any  access.  These  properties  around  our  church  make  our  church  look 

</span><span>untidy and when the rains come, the mosquitoes which breed increase and infest our 

</span><span>church  as  well.    Today,  Mr Chairman, the church has paid  somebody to  clean these 

</span><span>properties  even  though  we  have  no  right  to  be  on  these  properties.    We  have  paid 

somebody to keep theses places clean so these properties surrounding the church will 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1921 

</span></div><div><span>not  be  a  problem  for  our  church.  The  Public  Health  Inspector  went  to  see  the 

landowners of these properties near our church and they gave us all sorts of excuses. 

</span></div><div><span>I think the Member should k</span><span>eep his mouth shut. Maybe you haven’t had breakfast this 

morning. Why don’t you go home and have breakfast?  There’s plenty of time. </span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  this  problem  has  been  highlighted  for  us  by  the  Public  Health 

Inspectors. You should clean your home as well as surrounding areas. Collect empty 

tins  and other containers that mosquitoes can breed in.  Some people have no regard 

</span><span>for this problem, Mr Chairman. They don’t care whether there are many mosquitoes or 

not. They don’t care.</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  The Honourable Member, 

Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Irrelevancy, Mr Chairman.  He is talking about Public Health. We 

have already discussed the Health Vote Item so I think he should not be speaking on 

Public Health. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>Please  come  back  to  the  Appropriation.    Please  don’t  stay  too 

</span><span>long where you are. Come back to the Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> As far as I understand, Mr Chairman, the Health Department on the 

island of Aitutaki is the responsibility of the Ministry of Outer Islands Development.  

This is why I did not say anything when we were on the Health Vote Item because I 

know that the Health Department on the island of Aitutaki is the responsibility of the 

Ministry of Outer Islands Development. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, even though there interruptions it does not matter because I have said 

what I wanted to say. If you can all remember I was talking about the problems that 

the two doctors were having with  the Ministry of Outer Islands Development. Now, 

why  should  I  have  problems  speaking  about  Health  when  I  know  that  the  Health 

Department  on  the  island  of  Aitutaki  is  the  direct  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of 

Outer Islands Development?  So what about the schools on the island of Aitutaki, Mr 

</span><span>Chairman?    Are  they  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  or  are  they  the 

</span><span>responsibility of the Ministry of Outer Islands Development on the island of Aitutaki?  

</span></div><div><span>I don’t know why these two Members in the Opposition are trying to make me out to 

</span><span>be  a  fool  because  we  are  talking  about  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Islands  Development. 

That is what I am talking about. I think they should let me speak and then everybody 

else  should  sit  there  and  listen  and  when  your  time  comes  to  speak  you  can  say 

whatever you want to say. The Education Department on the island of Aitutaki is the 

direct responsibility of the Ministry of Outer Islands Development. 

</span></div><div><span>First of all, I would like to thank the Minister of Education and also the Secretary of 

the Ministry of Education because they have sent a lot of things to help improve the 

schools on my island. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>1922 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Minister  of  Energy  because  it  was  through  this 

Ministry that the private sector on the island of Aitutaki was given the licence to wire 

houses and schools on the island of Aitutaki. This has made life easier in Aitutaki. It is 

also in keeping with what was planned in the past, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  past,  Mr  Chairman,  if  you  wanted  your  house  wired  you  had  to  pay  for  the 

airfare to bring an electrician from the island of Rarotonga. You were also responsible 

for  providing  accommodation  and  food  for  that  electrician.  Today,  it  is  possible  for 

electricians on the island of Aitutaki to apply to be registered to do wiring on houses, 

schools  and  other  buildings.  Today,  these  electricians  can  do  electrical  wiring  on 

house and schools and others. Just recently, I was asked to find ways to try to improve 

the conditions of the Amuri School. I thought to myself, now why am I being asked to 

do this? I am an Honourable Member of Parliament, so why am I being asked to do 

this work?  The reason, Mr Chairman, is because the people on the island of Aitutaki 

know  I  am  a  carpenter.    There  are  more  than  200  buildings,  houses,  halls,  and 

churches which I have built on the island of Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. The Honourable Member, 

Dr Terepai Maoate.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Good morning to you and thank 

you for your earlier message to the House.  

</span></div><div><span>I  was  listening  carefully  to  the  Honourable  Member  as  he  was  speaking.  He  was 

</span><span>boasting about himself. He’s campaigning for himself, and I would like to ask you to 

</span><span>bring him back to the Vote Item, Mr Chairman.  The Vote Item is not about him.  I do 

</span><span>not want to know whether he has a qualification in carpentry. He shouldn’t be talking 

</span><span>about  that  sort  of  thing.  We  want  him  to  come  back  to  the Vote Item because he is 

trying  to  lead  us  off  the  topic.  If  we  stand  to  speak  we  might  be  tempted  to  do  the 

same. Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> That is not a Point of Order, Honourable Member, it is a point of 

explanation. Nevertheless, I would like you to come back to the Appropriation of the 

Ministry of Outer Island Development. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  The  reason  I  said  this,  Mr  Chairman  is  because  I  am  now  an 

Honourable Member of Parliament, and people come to me for help. What I am trying 

</span><span>to do is to explain the reasons the people are doing this. I don’t think I am going off 

</span><span>the topic - I am right on the nail here. Those are my views, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Our  next  speaker  is  the  Honourable  Member  from  Nukuroa, 

Tangata Vavia.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  you  and  your  staff  this 

morning.  Greetings  also  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the  Cabinet  and  to  all 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1923 

</span></div><div><span>Government Members. Greetings also to the Leaders of the Opposition. Greetings to 

you all. Greetings also to all our people listening in to our discussions this morning.  

</span></div><div><span>I rise, Mr Chairman, to give my strong support to this allocation  for the Ministry of 

Outer  Islands  Development.    Mr  Chairman,  in  1996  we  started  the  Reform  process 

that  we  are  going  through  at  the  moment.  In  July  1997,  we  started  to  devolve 

responsibilities  to  Local  Governments  in  the  Outer  Islands.    It  is  nearly  18  months 

since we started to devolve those responsibilities. We can see in the Estimates that the 

responsibility  for  Economic,  Community,  Infrastructure,  Education,  Health,  Police 

</span><span>and  Governance  have  all  been  granted  to  each  of  the  Outer  Islands’  Lo</span><span>cal 

Governments.  Also  included  in  this  Amendment is  Energy, which will be put  under 

the  control  of  MOID.  This  is  quite  a  large  sum  of  money  -  just  under  $1.5  million. 

Therefore, the total amount that has been allocated for the Ministry of Outer Islands 

Development is $7,729,000.00. 

</span></div><div><span>I think I will be correct in saying, Mr Chairman, that in a period of 20 years this is a 

small budget. In past years, before the devolution process began, this is about the same 

amount  of  money  that  was  given  to  each  of  those  Departments  to  govern  their  own 

</span><span>Departments  in  the  Outer  Islands.  This  amount  for  the  Outer  Islands  has  not  been 

</span><span>increased, it is the same amount, but it used to be given to the Ministries to administer 

their offices or Departments in the Outer Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>I  come  back  now,  Mr  Chairman,  to  the  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Island 

Development. I would like to give them my thanks. Mr Chairman, in those 18 months 

they  have  done  a  Herculean  job.    Who  could  have  thought  that  they  could  have 

performed  this  fast  in  getting  these  responsibilities  to  each  of  the  islands  and  their 

Local Governments. Many responsibilities have been given to the Local Governments. 

I  think  there  are  still  a  lot  of  responsibilities  that  remain  to  be  given  to  the  Local 

Governments,  Mr  Chairman.  I  think  we  have  just  scratched  the  surface.  And  we 

cannot do this completely yet, until the laws have been put in place.   

</span></div><div><span>Since the devolution of powers to the Local Governments, Mr Chairman, it has been 

the  intention  of  the  devolution  process  and  of  Government  to  give  the  power  of 

governance  to  the  people.      In  fact,  it  was  given  to  the  people  rather  than  closer  to 

them. The reason for this is that they, in the Local Governments, are the ones working 

closely  with  the  people  and  not  the  Members  of  Parliament.  And  if  we  can  all 

</span><span>remember, the purpose of the devolution process was to give a better quality life for 

</span><span>our people.  

</span></div><div><span>I am happy with this allocation to the Outer Islands, Mr Chairman. The reason being 

before the devolution  began, we were unable to complete some tasks, yet within the 

last 18 months of the devolution, many things have been accomplished together with 

the Local Governments of the Outer Islands. I am happy to say we have been able to 

purchase new machinery which we are paying off in instalments out of our allocation. 

We have been able to upgrade and fix our water tanks out of our small allocations. I 

</span><span>am  pleased  with  what  we  have  been  able  to  accomplish  in  the  last  18  months,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman. It has made life somewhat easier on our island. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>1924 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Also,  I  have  not  heard  many  complaints  about  the  referral  of very ill  patients  in  the 

Outer Islands to the Rarotonga Hospital. The Health Department on each island, under 

the  jurisdiction  of  MOID,  has  been  able  to  pick  up  the  costs  of  bringing  very  ill 

patients to Rarotonga. As I said earlier, this may be one of the smallest budgets in 20 

years, but the work which has been accomplished is greater than anything I have seen 

in the past.  

</span></div><div><span>I  also  know  Mr  Chairman  that  some  people,  including  Outer  Islands  Members  of 

Parliament  and  Local  Governments  in  the  Outer  Islands,  are  still  having  problems 

with  the  fact  that  the  administration  of  finances  has  not  been  given  to  them  yet.    I 

would like to say I am one of those people who are very frustrated about the delay in 

giving administrative power to the Local Governments. I have shown my frustration to 

the Secretary of MOID. At the same time, Mr Chairman, I realise that administrative 

powers  cannot  be  handed  over  to  the  Local  Governments  unless  they  have  a  very 

good, strong and capable administrative team. The Mayors of the Outer Islands would 

like this responsibility to be given to them so they can do the work to improve the lot 

of their island in the way they think is best for them.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like them to understand, Mr Chairman, this is not an easy process because the 

</span><span>Ministry of Finance and Economic Management Act require certain conditions to be 

met. Under the MFEM Act, the Mayors are not accountable. They are not bound to do 

any reporting but  their Chief Executive  Officer is.  The MFEM Act  requires them to 

make monthly, quarterly and annual reports. That budget, when it is prepared, goes by 

the Output and the Outcome.  Any money spent in that budget is tied to the output. If 

the Island Council spends that money anywhere else, the Chief Executive Officer gets 

the blame. There is no provision under the MFEM Act to sack the Mayor or to sack 

the Island Council.  The responsibility is tied to the CEO and his staff. That is why the 

Secretary of the Ministry of Outer Islands Development is making sure that we give 

the authority to this office on each island.  

</span></div><div><span>I am not saying, Mr Chairman, that the money will not be given to the Outer Islands. 

Government has already indicated that it will. But we must build a structure that will 

stand up to the MFEM Act and most importantly, that will stand up to PERCA.  Mr 

Chairman,  there  are  also  Island  Councils  and  their  Mayors  who  would  like  to  take 

over  the  employment  of  public  servants  but  there  are  rules  of  guidance  under  the 

Public Service Act.  All public servants, their employers and employees are controlled 

</span><span>by  that  Act.  Mr  Chairman,  again  the  Mayors  and  the  Local  Governments  are  not 

</span><span>accountable  under  that  Act.    There  are  a  lot  of  things  under  that  Act  that  has  to  be 

followed in order to protect public servants. We cannot just go in and employ or sack 

any Government worker just because we want to, or for some political reason.  Further 

still, Mr Chairman, the Local Government is not accountable under the PERCA Act.  

The Local Government is not required under that Act to produce a report. During an 

investigation,  it  is  the  Executive  Officer  of  that  Local  Government  who  is 

accountable. So, my point here is  that Local  Governments  must realise that they are 

there as leaders of the community, to make policies and to talk with their people. In 

</span><span>doing this, we can say that the principle of democracy is being exercised. That is the 

</span><span>intention of the Ministry of Outer Islands Development - to get a strong base, a strong 

executive in each and every Local Government of the Outer Islands.  It is not an easy 

task.  The  officers  in  this  Ministry  have  worked  long  hours  and  during  weekends  to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1925 

</span></div><div><span>find  an  accounting  package  that  will  make  it  easier  for  each  island  to  make  their 

reports.  That  is  the  aim  of  the  Ministry  -  to  make  sure  that  everybody  in  the  Outer 

Islands gets an accounting package that they will all understand so they will not fail in 

their responsibilities under the MFEM Act. 

</span></div><div><span>Imagine, imagine if we give the responsibility of monies to the Outer Islands. Say we 

</span><span>give them now to the Local Governments and we hadn’t done a good job in devolving 

</span><span>that  responsibility  to  these  people  and  PERCA  visits  these  islands  to  do  an  audit. 

</span><span>PERCA  then  reports  back  that  the  Act  hasn’t  been  followed,  imagine  what  would</span><span>

happen.  I  can  be  sure  there  will  be  some  bad  things  said  in  the  Report  about 

</span><span>devolution. I certainly don’t want to see that because devolution is the best thing that 

</span><span>has ever happened for the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  in  March  1996  I  had  the  privilege  6to  attend  the  CPA  Seminar  in 

England  and  we  were  taken  to  the  city  of  Southampton  to  see  what  devolution  has 

</span><span>done  for  that  city.  They  don’t  refer  to  it  as  devolution  to  City  Councils  and  Local 

Governments  in  England,  rather,  it  is  called  “modernising  Local  Governments”.  

</span><span>When they talk about devolution they talk about devolving political power to Wales, 

</span><span>Scotland  and  Northern  Ireland.  Mr  Chairman,  they  started  modernising  Local 

</span><span>Governments in 1970, long before us. They prepared a White Paper - they refer to it as 

the White Paper - which has their policy for devolution. The principles of that White 

Paper  are  exactly  the  same  as  that  which  we  are  going  through.  In  fact,  this  change 

came  from  there  -  through  England,  through  Europe,  to  New  Zealand  and  Australia 

and  to  some  of  the  islands  in  the  South  Pacific.  Papua  New  Guinea  was  the  first  to 

introduce modernisation to Local Governments. 

</span></div><div><span>The  officials  in  this  city  we  met  were  happy  with  the  modernisation  of  their  Local 

Government.    They  were  used  as  a  model  council  for  the  rest  of  the  regions.  They 

were proud when they privatised their port. It made the port better, and it made better 

returns for the city. Through this they were able to preserve historical sites in this city.  

</span></div><div><span>To digress a little, Mr Chairman, they took us to where the Titanic left on her maiden 

</span><span>voyage, and to the Navy port to look at Lord Nelson’s ship. This city is full of history 

</span><span>but it is being modernised by its Local Government. And they are proud of their city, 

</span><span>but it wasn’t always perfect</span><span>. They had three Councils in this city, two of the Councils 

were doing the same kind of work - rubbish collection and water. They realised that 

</span><span>that  is  not  good  for  the  city  so  in  March-April  of  that  same  year  they  got  rid of the 

</span><span>other two and went with one Local Government Council. They also showed us other 

areas of development under the Local Government.  They were happy that they were 

given  that  chance  to  control  their  own  city.  The  White  Paper  estimated  that  the 

changeover would take ten or more years. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I come back to us. We have only started. Only 18 months have gone by and yet 

we  are  expecting  the  six  officers  in  this  Ministry,  only  six  officers,  to  produce 

miracles.  Mr Chairman, they are trying their best and they will continue to try their 

</span><span>best  and  hopefully  the  responsibility  of  administration  of  money  will  pass  on  to  the 

</span><span>Local Governments soon. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>1926 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  know  we  haven’t  gone  into  the  issue  of  what  happens  if  any  one  of  the  Local 

</span><span>Governments  fails  to  deliver  services  to  the  people  of  their  islands.    W</span><span>e  haven’t 

</span><span>questioned that yet.  

</span></div><div><span>What is Central Government’s responsibility when that happens? Mr Chairman, that’s 

</span><span>just  one  and  there  are  other  areas,  such  as  a  Code  of  Conduct.  I  was  not  going  to 

mention it because we, the Members of this Parliament, have not put in place a Code 

</span><span>of Conduct for ourselves. But shouldn’t we also apply that Code of Conduct to Local 

Governments since they are elected representatives of the people as well?  Shouldn’t 

</span><span>they be made accountable to the people as well?  Mr Chairman, </span><span>I’m not saying that a 

</span><span>Code  of  Conduct  be  made  for  the  Local  Governments  before  the  Members  of 

</span><span>Parliament.  They  could  go  hand  in  hand.  There  are  other  issues  that  we  haven’t 

</span><span>touched  on  as  yet.  We  are  still  going  through  the  process  of  ensuring  that  the 

responsibilities being devolved will be done so; that they last a long time, not just for 

a couple of years. Although Local Governments are not accountable to any of the Acts 

mentioned previously, at least they should be made accountable to the people of their 

communities  by  putting  in  a  Code  of  Conduct  for  them.  Just  as  the  Leader  of  New 

Alliance Party has expressed his full support for devolution, I hope and wish that that 

</span><span>is also the wish of the Members of this Parliament. Mr Chairman, those are my views 

</span><span>on this Amendment for MOID. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable  Member,  Dr  Robert Woonton.    Before you speak, I wish to  inform  the 

Honourable Members in the House that at 11.15 this morning, I will cease the debate 

on  the  Appropriation  Amendment  Bill.  The  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Robert 

Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman, Kia Orana to you this morning, Kia 

Orana  to  Honourable  Members  of  this  House,  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to 

Cabinet  Ministers  and  Members  of  Government.  Kia  Orana  also  to  Members  in  the 

Opposition,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all  this  morning.  A  special  welcome  to  our  people 

listening in.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I stand to support the appropriation for MOID.   Mr Chairman, I would 

like to extend a warm Greeting to all the MOID workers on the island of Manihiki - to 

the Principals of the schools there, the health-practice nurses, the person in charge of 

the  MOID  workers  and  all  MOID  workers  on  the  island  of  Manihiki.  I  know,  Mr 

Chairman,  they  are  working  under  very  difficult  conditions.  Unlike  the  other 

Honourable  Members  from  Aitutaki  and  Mitiaro,  who  are  very  happy  with  what  is 

going on their islands, I have some reservations concerning the island of Manihiki as 

far as MOID is concerned.  Only they can draw their conclusions why they are a lot 

happier than I am. If you recall, Mr Chairman, Manihiki was struck by Cyclone Martin 

in  November  1997.  Since  then,  16  months  later,  MOID  properties  and  standard  of 

performance  in  Manihiki  are  pretty  much  the  same  since  Martin  left  us.  In  fact,  the 

Secretary of MOID is visiting Manihiki in a couple of hours, arriving in Manihiki 16 

months  after  cyclone  Martin  hit  Manihiki.  Therefore,  I  feel  that  Manihiki  was 

neglected.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1927 

</span></div><div><span>I have almost become one of the MOID workers over here. I have been to the office of 

this Department so many times that I have almost become a permanent fixture in that 

Department.  I  was  trying  to  bring  to  their  attention  the  difficulties  we  are  facing  in 

Manihiki especially with our Healthcare Clinics, our schools and the lack of electricity 

in Manihiki. I admit there is reconstruction taking place in Manihiki.  Surely, we can 

do more to help alleviate the difficulties, especially the difficulties the Health workers 

are experiencing on that island. The hospital in the village of Tukao was completely 

demolished by Cyclone Martin. And they are making do with  what  they have in the 

patched-</span><span>up Principal’s house as a clinic. In fact, the nurse there invited me to inspect 

</span><span>the  premises,  the  conditions  she  was  working  in.  I  said  to  the  nurse,  I  am  going  to 

close this clinic because it is not suitable for human habitation. But at the plea of the 

Island Council and the Mayor, who asked me not to close the clinic, I did not.   

</span></div><div><span>In the main village of Tauhunu, the hospital there is partly damaged by the hurricane 

and partly damaged because of weathering. Luckily, the women-folk of Manihiki built 

</span><span>a Child Health clinic. That’s what they are using as a temporary hospital. Hopefully, 

</span><span>when  the  new  community  centres  are  built  then  we can house the clinics there. The 

situation about the school buildings - </span><span>I have mentioned these before, and it’s still the 

</span><span>same.  I also  raised the point that there was ADB funds available to  upgrade and to 

</span><span>repair these damaged school buildings.  

</span></div><div><span>I was dismayed, Mr Chairman, when I received a letter from the Development Bank of 

this country that Cabinet has made a resolution to take the fund back and not to use it. 

But  through  the  efforts  of  the  workers  of  this  Department,  this  fund  was  made 

available again to upgrade the school in Manihiki.   Other Outer Islands are boasting 

about  the  standards  of  their  electricity  and  their  hospitals,  while  we  in  Manihiki  are 

suffering.   In fact, I came late to the House this morning, Mr Chairman because I was 

called  by  concerned  people  from  New  Zealand  whose  workers  are  now  doing  the 

reconstruction on Manihiki.   These are the workers who are contracted by Mainzeal 

(sp.?) to do the reconstruction in Manihiki. There are about 11 adults there working on 

the island. Their concern is that people have been exposed to TB. They demanded to 

know  what  I  am  doing  about  these  workers,  and  I  have  assured  them  that  I  will  be 

visiting  Manihiki  shortly  to  check  on  these  people.    This  should  not  be  my 

responsibility as </span><span>a Member for Manihiki but because it’s my people, I am going out to 

</span><span>help where I can. In fact, their Managing Director threatened to remove these workers 

from  Manihiki  if  nothing  is  done.  It  was  only  through  my  assurance  that  something 

</span><span>will be done and I will personally attend to it which then led to the withdrawal of the 

</span><span>threat.  This  is  what  happens  when  we  have  people  working  in  very  poor,  appalling 

condition.  

</span></div><div><span>What about our own people, they are also exposed to these risks? The deficiencies in 

these areas, especially in the healthcare and education of my people and the supply of 

conveniences  like electricity, are my main concerns. I was shocked, Mr Chairman. I 

made  sure  that  the  clinic  in  Tukao  had  some  kind  of  electricity  from  a  portable 

generator but the minute I left the island, this was removed from that particular clinic. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Deputy  Prime  Minister  will  understand  how  much  Manihiki  has  personally 

contributed to  assist  with  its own power in  the past. In fact, we bought all the spare 

parts to have our generators reconditioned. Not only that, we paid $40,000 to T &amp; M 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>1928 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Heather  to  acquire  their  machinery  to  assist  in  the  reconstruction  of  buildings  in 

Manihiki.  The  Mainzeal  contractors  who  are  now  working  in  Manihiki  understands 

that  there  is  a  Ministry  of  Outer  Islands  Development  contribution  of  $150,000  and 

they are still today asking where this money is. 

</span></div><div><span>I’ll tell you who the ones are who suffer, Mr Chairman. It is the people of Manihiki. 

</span><span>There  was  a  plan  to  build  130  micro-shelters.  Now  there  are  only  95  that  they  can 

afford because of the lack of funds. Part of the cost of the micro-shelters was utilised 

to bring in other machinery to assist with the reconstruction and the cost was taken out 

of  the  number  of  houses  that  were  planned  to  be  built  in  Manihiki.  Our  biggest 

headache, today, Mr Chairman, is to decide who will miss these micro-shelters. It is 

sad.    I  know  there  has  been  a  lot  of  money  poured  in  to  help  Manihiki  but  it is  not 

working. Sixteen months after the hurricane we are still struggling to recover from the 

effects of Cyclone Martin. I will raise a question, Mr Chairman. Why is it that it took 

16 months for the Secretary of MOID to visit Manihiki? I hope that when the Prime 

Minister arrives there this morning, he will see the damage that was done by Cyclone 

Martin and he will see the lack of improvements since that time.  

</span></div><div><span>I am concerned. From this huge $7,700,000, where is the contribution to Manihiki?  I 

</span><span>will  always  raise  this  in  this  House  for  as  long  as  I  am  able  to.  The  community  in 

Manihiki  has  been  accused  of  not  contributing  to  the  project.    We  have,  not  only 

financially, but also through physical attendance and helped in community work. Our 

part of the reconstruction, according to the plans, is to help unload the ships from New 

Zdaland.    I  was  there  personally  to  see  that  the  community  does  this  part  of  the 

project.    On  two  occasions  the  people  came  in  force,  there  were  too  many  workers 

who  were  falling  all  over  themselves,  but  the  ship  was  unloaded  as  planned.    The 

people were tired. They have to resort to other means of supporting themselves. If they 

do not attend to their own pearl farms they will not be able to survive. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming  now  to  the  devolution  process  planned  by  this  Government.    While  I  agree 

that this is a step forward for the Outer Islands, at this stage it is not working as we 

thought it might. A number of complaints have been raised in this House and in the 

newspaper of this country.  It is only right that we recognise the Local Governments of 

the Outer Island because this  is  a new process and it will take time for it to mature.  

Right  now,  there  are  areas  of  concern.  My  concern  is  how  the  Outer  Islands  are 

handling  the  Health  and  Education  systems,  but  if  the  Local  Government  is 

</span><span>comfortable  and  confident  it  can  manage  this,  why  not?  Let  them  control  their  own 

</span><span>affairs. The main difficulty I see in the Local Governments is their ability to run their 

own affairs with a lack of funds which were often promised to us. Although there is 

some  legislation  in  place  to  make  the  Local  Governments  accountable  for  public 

funds, maybe the Minister of Outer Island Affairs should look into this and get this in 

place properly before the next election.  After all, they have CEOs to take care of the 

</span><span>finances, if they can’t manage it then they</span><span> should be replaced.  Replaced with people 

from the MFEM. 

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  concerns  raised  by  the  Outer  Islands  is  the  Government-owned  assets  in 

</span><span>these  islands.  The  Local  Government  has  no  control  at  the  moment  with  regard  to 

hospitals and schools and any Government assets on these islands.  I understand there 

is  an  amendment  to  be  brought  to  the  House  to  amend  the  Local  Government  Act 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1929 

</span></div><div><span>which  will  enable  all  Government  assets  on  the  Outer  Islands  to  be  vested  in  the 

Island Councils. I will ask the Minister of MOID to look into the difficulties we face 

in Manihiki especially with the reconstruction work going on as well as the shortage 

of spare parts. We are having to take parts from one truck to another to get it going. 

</span></div><div><span>They also requested assistance in improving the passage so the unloading of cargo will 

be more efficient. I know the community has come out in force to assist in this area 

but they need dynamites to blow up part of the passage. Not only will it improve the 

efficiency  of  unloading  cargo  in  Manihiki,  it  will  also  help  with  progress  of 

reconstruction that is taking place. There is good progress made in the construction of 

the community centres. It is progressing very well as is the new reticulation system for 

power in Manihiki.  To me they are small p</span><span>roblems, which can be resolved, it won’t 

</span><span>take  too  much  to  get  these  corrected  but  these  little  problems  are  becoming  major 

problems  and  are  slowing  the  progress  of  the  work.    I  would  have  thought  that  the 

work would be completed by November last year, as was projected.  It is only a few 

more  months  to  November  this  year  and  still  they  are  not  completed.  I  will  ask  the 

Minister  to  help  us  in  Manihiki  to  correct  these  weak  areas  so  the  work  of 

reconstruction will progress as planned.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Thomas Hewett. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you, Sir, on this beautiful 

morning.  Kia Orana also to your staff who are working very hard in this House.  Kia 

Orana  also  to  our  people  listening  in  this  morning  in  the  name  of  Our  Lord.    Kia 

Orana to the Prime Minister who has gone off to the island of Manihiki. I believe the 

Lord is guiding him in doing the best that he can for our country.  Kia Orana also to 

the Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Government Members, to the Leader of 

the  New  Alliance  Party  and  to  your  Members.    Kia  Orana  also  to  the  Leader  of  the 

Democratic Alliance Party and your Members.  Kia Orana in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like,  through  you,  Mr  Chairman,  to  send  my  best  wishes  to  my  people.  Mr 

Chairman, this  Appropriation that we are debating now also affects my people.  Kia 

Orana  to  the  Mayor  of  the  island  and  to  your  family.  The  Island  Councillors  and  to 

your families.  Kia Orana in the name of Our Lord.  Kia Orana also to the Ui Ariki, to 

the Ui Mataiapo on the island, to all the servants of the Lord on the island.  Kia Orana 

to all our people on the island as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to all the employees of the Ministry of MOID.  Kia Orana in the name of 

Our  Lord.    Kia  Orana  to  all  the  elders  on  the  island  as  well as the mothers.  Thank 

you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>I will come back now to the Appropriation Vote before the House. I would like to give 

my  support  to  the  allocation  of  $7,729,385  for  the  Ministry  of  Outer  Islands 

</span><span>Development.    I’d  also  like  to  thank  the  Minister  and  his  staff  for  budgeting  this 

</span><span>allocation.    I  believe,  Mr  Chairman,  that  the  Minister  and  all  his  staff  have  worked 

very hard in trying to bring this Appropriation before the House to enable the Ministry 

and the staff to help the development of the country. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>1930 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>So,  I  would  therefore  give  my  support  to  the  Appropriation  allocated  for  this 

Department. They are not only doing the work for Rarotonga but they are also doing 

the administration for people of the Outer Islands. I believe, Mr Chairman, the Mayors 

and the Island Councillors of each of the Outer Islands would like to have total control 

over  the  management  of  their  own  affairs.  Mr  Chairman,  I  was  one  of  those  people 

who opposed the idea of giving total control of administration and finance over to the 

Mayor and Island Councillors. What  Government  wants  to  do is to give them a two 

year period in order to find out whether they are able to administer the affairs of their 

own  island.  I  am  not  saying  that  these  people  are  incapable  of  carrying  out  these 

responsibilities but we want to know if they can manage their own affairs. I know they 

have no difficulty in managing their financial affairs but Government wants to know if 

they can do it first.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge the services provided by the present CEO on the island, 

that is Fred Charlie. I know that he is doing his work with integrity and honesty. I also 

know  that  the  staff  members  working  for  the  Office  of  MOID  on  the  island  are 

working hard also. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  believe  that  the  Mayor  is  carrying  out  his  responsibilities  to  the  best  of  his 

</span><span>ability. The only area where I have some doubts is in regards to the Mayor. He held a 

dialogue with the Honourable Member, Ngamau Munokoa, over the trochus harvests, 

which the Honourable Member mentioned to us yesterday. I believe Mr Chairman that 

the market belongs to Aitutaki alone. If Rarotonga wants a buyer for their trochus then 

they should find their own buyer. Do not put it in with the lot of Aitutaki. I believe, 

Mr Chairman, if Rarotonga is  included the proceeds will be split in half. Our Island 

Council  Members  are  probably  not  aware  of  this.  Maybe  the  Mayor  discussed  this 

with the Member only. But I remain opposed to the idea. If there is trochus harvesting 

on the island of Rarotonga in Nikao I will not be allowed to share in the benefits.  She 

will tell me to go back to Aitutaki and get my share from there and leave the ones here 

to them.  

</span></div><div><span>I believe also, Mr Chairman, that the various departments on the island of Aitutaki are 

carrying  out  their  responsibilities  with  honesty  and  hard  work. Mr Chairman, this is 

the time given to the Council to train them. I believe, Mr Chairman, that this amount 

allocated  for  this  Department  will  not  be  sufficient.  Fortunately,  my  people,  Mr 

Chairman, are resourceful and clever. They are quick to find ways to source revenue 

</span><span>to keep them going.  The other thing, Mr Chairman, is that I observed how the CEO  

</span><span>performs.  I believe that he is the right person for the job. And I believe that the MOID 

is a great help to our people. They help the people when there is a shortage of water by 

transporting water at a nominal fee of $10.00. With regards to the Health Department, 

the  budget  is  being  worked  out  carefully  to  allow  for  the  purchase  of  drugs  for  the 

island. And I believe that there are other departments who are finding other ways and 

means to support themselves.  

</span></div><div><span>On the comments made the Honourable Member of Manihiki in referring to his home 

</span><span>island that is being neglected by this Ministry. Mr Chairman, I understand they were 

</span><span>given $3 million following the devastation to their island. They are better off than the 

rest of us. We have nothing left. We have no money, it is not enough. To me, this is a 

huge  amount  of money which was given to  them and yet  they are still complaining. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1931 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  believe  this  is  one  of  the  wealthier  islands  because  of  their  pearl 

industry.    They  should  be  able  to  sustain  themselves.  What  I  see  is  an  increasing 

dependence  on  Government.  When  their  Education  suffered,  they  blamed  the  

Government.  When  Health  suffers,  they  blame  Government.  They  are  a  wealthy 

</span><span>people,  Mr  Chairman.    Why  can’t  they  find  their  own  ways  and  means  to  improve 

their  lives?  I  don’t  understand  why  t</span><span>hey  are  so  dependent  upon  Government.  The 

Government  has  a  responsibility  to  15  islands  in  the  Cook  Islands,  not  just  them. 

Government has to distribute funding to all of these islands, they are not the only one 

that Government should be concerned about.  And they should appreciate the fact that  

$3 million dollars was given to them to restore their island. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Robert Woonton  is  saying that it is  not  his  responsibility.    

Mr  Chairman,  he  was  elected  by  the  people  to  be  their  representative  in  this 

Parliament,  and  he  is  also  a  qualified  doctor.    He  should  go  back  and  work  on  his 

</span><span>island  to  help  them.  It  is  not  only  Government’s  responsibility,  it  is  also  his 

</span><span>responsibility as the Member for Manihiki. He should go back there, instead of staying 

here in Rarotonga. Go to Manihiki and serve the people in Manihiki.  

</span></div><div><span>Why did the Secretary of this Department wait until 16 months lapsed before he went 

</span><span>there to  help? Mr Chairman, in my understanding when an island is devastated by a 

hurricane, it takes more than two years to restore it. The Secretary is unable to send 

assistance immediately after the cyclone because he has to allocate funding to each of 

the islands. He has to ensure that there is enough for everybody.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  hope  I  have  raised  some  valid  points  here.  I  believe  that  the 

Department  of  MOID  is  fulfilling  its  objectives.  The  Secretary  of  MOID  is  also 

responsible  for  distributing  funds  to  the  old  aged  people,  to  our  children  and  to  the 

sick in our community. The staff of this Department are working hard, day and night, 

to try and find ways to meet the needs of the various branches in their jurisdiction in 

the  Outer  Islands,  while  at  the  same  time  trying  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  people  on 

Welfare  benefits.  The  Minister  is  also  working  together  with  the  staff  to  make their 

</span><span>budget stretch to cover all the Department’s responsibilities. </span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  on  my  island,  a  tractor  has  been  taken  over  by  the  Island  Council.  I 

believe, Mr Chairman these machinery should remain in the Ministry to operate and 

service. Today, these machinery are the responsibility of the Island Councils. As the 

</span><span>Honourable  Robert  Woonton  has  indicated,  a  Bill  may  be  coming  into  the  House 

</span><span>which will put the Island Councils in total control of all the affairs of their island. But 

</span><span>I  don’t  know  when  that  will  be.  We  will  have  to  wait.  As  I  said  last  year,  I  do  not 

</span><span>support  the  idea  of  handing  over  all  of  these  responsibilities  to  the  Island  Councils 

because some corruption will occur.  For example, if one person is given the right to 

hire the personnel, or to select the contractors to do the work. If the decision to make 

</span><span>these appointments is made by all of the Councillors together, then I don’t think it will 

</span><span>be too much of a problem.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would ask the Honourable Member for Manihiki to go to his island and 

</span><span>help his people. Do not become dependent on MOID to watch out for his people. That 

is  why  he  decided  to  become  a  doctor  and  a  Member  of  Parliament  -  to  serve  and 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>1932 

</span></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>work for his people.   It is not good for us if we become a Member of Parliament for 

our island, and then we want to stay here on Rarotonga.    

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA: </span><span>I want to point out to the Honourable Member, Mr Chairman. 

</span><span>He  is  talking  too  much  about  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Robert  Woonton.  He’d 

</span><span>better not have a fit if the doctor decides to criticise him one day. Mr Chairman, we 

are talking about MOID and our respective islands. The doctor was talking about his 

views on his island. This Honourable Member should talk about his own island, not 

</span><span>the  doctor.  He  is  wasting  time  here.  If  he’d  sat  down  earlier  then  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member for Rakahanga could have had a turn to speak. Thank you, Mr Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. Please come back to the Vote 

Item.</span></div><div><span>MP T. HEWETT:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I am glad that the Honourable Member, 

Ngamau Munokoa, stood up to make her comments. They are all valid points. There is 

one  more  minute  to  go,  Mr  Chairman,  then  we  will  come  to  the  end  of  this  debate. 

</span><span>Maybe they are disturbed by the fact they don’t have any speaking time left but this is 

</span><span>my turn, I have 30 minutes which I have a right to use. Maybe she was offended by 

my mentioning her and the Mayor for their idea regarding the trochus harvest.  

</span></div><div><span>I support the allocation for MOID of $7,729,385 as part of the Schedule. Thank you, 

Mr Chairman.

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Can  I  ask  a  point  of  clarification,  Mr  Chairman,  because 

here under Ministerial Support only the Leader of the Opposition is identified clearly 

whereas  all  others  are listed as Agriculture, Education, Energy and Health. I want  it 

clarified that these </span><span>are allocations for Minister’s offices.</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  am  sorry  I  have  ceased  the 

debate on the Vote Items. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Mr Chairman, I am only requesting that you make specific 

mention  of  the  Minister  responsible  to  Agriculture  and  that  is  the  allocation  for  his 

office because it is confusing, as the allocation is put down as Agriculture, our people 

might think there is only $70,000 for Agriculture, or, that it is an additional allocation 

for Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>The Honourable Minister of Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  Mr  Chairman,  I  think  there  is  an 

omission  in  the  Bill  because  in  the  Estimates  itself  it  is  reflected  that  these  are 

Ministerial Support Funding.  Therefore, Mr Chairman, I think it is appropriate that I 

move  an  amendment  incorporating  what  is  reflected  in  the  Estimates  book  into  the 

Bill itself. The amendment being:  

</span></div><div><span>That ‘Ministerial Support’ be incorporated</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>I would like to second that Motion.

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>You  can’t  amend  that  without  going  back  to  the  Committee  of 

</span><span>Supply. </span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:  </span><span>Yes we can. We are still in Committee but the only difference is 

we have finished debating. </span><span>Mr Chairman, I would like to ask Honourable Members to 

just correct their copies. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>I will continue with the Appropriation.
