<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  these  people  are  mocking  me.  That  is  why  I  don’t  like  the  comments 

</span><span>made  earlier.  They  are  misleading  statements,  which  confuse  our  people,  and  are 

twisting their minds.  </span><span>It  is  blinding them from  reality. I think this  is  all wrong.  I’d 

</span><span>like you to know, Mr Speaker, that I have always respected you.    

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  my  views  on  this  Motion,  Mr  Speaker.  I  don’t  like  this  sort  of  Motion. 

</span><span>What I really want to say is for the Referendum question to be clear so our people do 

not get confused. The question should be worded that the term be reduced to 4 or 3. 

However, I know the Prime Minister will get up and twist things around and say it is 

not possible.   I think you know also, Mr Speaker, that there are a lot of people who 

prefer a 3-year term. Why do they want this? Because of the terrible mismanagement 

and the bad state that this country is in today.
