<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Internal Affairs.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,700,041 for Internal Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The  last  Honourable  Member  speaking  on  the  Vote  Item  was  the  Honourable 

Member, Thomas Hewett. I now call on the Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman, Greetings  to  you and to the staff of 

this House. Greetings to all Honourable Members on both sides of the House and to 

our people who are listening in, Greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday, I was speaking on the subject of the Opposition Members objecting to the 

seminar  for  Mayors  that  was  held  last  night.  This  I  believe  is  one  of  the  most 

important  things  they  could  do  because  it  will  show  them  how  to  do  their  jobs  to 

benefit  our  country.  Unfortunately,  the  Honourable  Members  from  the  Democratic 

Alliance Party did not think it was a good idea. That is why those three doctors on 

the Opposition side happened to be doctors. They have had training to get where they 

are. That is what our Government is trying to do for our Mayors. They are trying to 

train them, to educate them with the requirements of their jobs and how they are to 

go  about  it.  Government  is  trying  to  show  them  how  best  to  manage  the  funds  in 

their  Councils.  Running  a  business  is  quite  different,  Mr  Chairman.  In  a  business, 

you have to sell something to get money, whereas in a Council the money is given to 

them  to  spend.  It  is  their  responsibility  to  spend  it  on  behalf  of  the  community.  

There are conditions under the law on how you can spend this money because if you 

mismanage it you will be held liable.  

</span></div><div><span>I support the idea of having trained people to look after their own affairs.  I am not 

s</span><span>aying  they  can’t  administer  their  own  finances,  I  am  saying  that  they  have  to  go 

</span><span>through  this  kind  of  training  because  the  money  they  are  handling  belongs  to  the 

public.  I  want  to  remind  the  Honourable  Member,  Mrs  Munokoa,  when  the 

Democratic  Party  Government  was  in  power  in  1978  they  used  the  Constituency 

Fund without offering any to  the Cook Islands Party. That  is  why you do not have 

the money you need today because they spent all that money at the time they were in 

power. Mr Chairman, I feel sorry for the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party for 

</span><span>his ignorance and carelessness in calling on the Members of Parliament of Rarotonga 

</span><span>to  support  his  view.  He  thinks  the  Members  of  Parliament  from  Rarotonga  are 

childish, stupid and ignorant like him. That is why Mr Chairman, I pity him. Maybe 

he knows that he is not getting anywhere in this upcoming election...  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order.  Point of Order.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>There is a Point of Order on the Floor, Honourable Member. </span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  The Point of Order is I am not 

</span><span>the Vote Item.  It seems the Honourable Member is talking about me. He is running 

me  down,  calling  me  uneducated,  stupid,  and  other  bad  things.  I  can  tell  you,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, he thinks he’s the model for u</span><span>s. I would like the Honourable Member to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>1746 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>think  carefully  about  what  he  is  saying  because  I  might  reflect  on  his  background 

too.  So  I  ask  you,  Mr  Chairman,  to  bring  him  back  to  the  Vote  Item,  not  to  make 

himself  look  stupid  in  front  of  the  public.  He  is  irrelevant,  I  am  bringing  the 

Standing Order 193 - Irrelevancy, Mr Chairman, and I think he should be warned.  I 

waited for him to come back to the point but he is carrying on, and on, and it is not 

right.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Honourable Member, come back to the point before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I am on the subject we are dealing with today. I 

am  talking  about  the  Local  Government  which  he  was  referring  to  yesterday. 

Yesterday he concentrated his efforts on Local Government, Mr Chairman.  He was 

going on and on trying to get the Members of Parliament from Rarotonga to support 

him. He was a blind man leading the blind into a hole.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> You are getting sillier.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> It was explained to them many times, Mr Chairman. They were 

told that that money would be coming. Government had placed its request and when 

the  money  arrives,  it  will  be  given  to  the  Rarotonga  Local  Government.  What  are 

they being greedy for? There is no doubt that that money will get here. We have to 

wait, but it will get here. When it arrives it will be given to our Mayors. I cannot see 

any reason why they have to get angry. I am not lying. They are the ones who started 

</span><span>lying. See, Mr Chairman, that’s their way </span><span>- they lie and now they are angry. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Come back to the topic, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Carry on.  Carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT: </span><span>That is why it is a problem for the DAP because they have been 

caught  out  for  lying.  I  give  my  support  to  the  Appropriation  in  the  Budget  of 

$6,700,041 for Internal Affairs and to the staff allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Tepai Tepai.   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TEPAI:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker. Greetings to you and your staff. Greetings 

also  to  the  Leader  of  Government  and  Cabinet  Ministers  and  to  us  Government 

Members.  Greetings  also  to  the  two  Leaders  on  the  Opposition  side  and  your 

Members on this showery afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to respond to the question raised by the Honourable Member from Nikao about 

the  $8,000 issued to  individual Members.  I think she is  the 201st person who has 

asked questions regarding this amount of money. I have explained the problem with 

this money and I will try to explain it to her again. In 1994 when I first heard about 

</span><span>this fund, I applied for it. I fished for it and was successful but the catch was a small-

</span><span>sized  </span><span>“patuki”</span><span>.  This  small  </span><span>“patuki”</span><span>  was  to  be  shared  amongst  us,  the  three 

Members  of  the  district  of Puaikura. It  was used on the Puaikura Palace on Mama 

Tinomana</span><span>’s house </span><span>- on her toilet, shower and hot water. This small patuki, worth $6-

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1747 

</span></div><div><span>7,000, was used on the Palace in Arorangi. This was the only time I was successful 

in  catching  this  patuki  on  my  fishing  rod,  Mr  Chairman.  Later,  there  was  an 

application  from  the  Ruaau  community  to  help  re-roof  their  Meeting  House.  I  had 

planned to do other things with this money, Mr Chairman. I wanted to fix the Clinic 

first, and if there was anything left over then I would use it on the Meeting House. 

This Clinic is in Arorangi j</span><span>ust past Raymond’s shop. You will see this building, it is 

</span><span>not  a  private  house,  and  it  belongs to  the entire community. My intention was, for 

the money to go to repair this dilapidated building.   

</span></div><div><span> HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order.  Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I have been looking through 

the Vote Item of Internal Affairs to find the Constituency Fund, Mr Chairman, and I 

</span><span>don’t see any here. The Honourable </span><span>Member is campaigning about what he has done 

in Ruaau. He is trying to remind people of what he has done for them. He thinks he 

can convince those people now.  It is too late. Too late. The Constituency Fund has 

nothing to do with this Internal Affairs allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I would like to ask you, Mr Chairman, to drag him back 

</span><span>by the ear to come back to the Vote Item and don’t try and campaign.  Thank you, 

</span><span>Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  TEPAI:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    I  am  trying  to  answer  to  the  question 

raised by the Honourable Member from Nikao about the Constituency Fund, which 

is the $8,000 each Member gets. I am trying to explain what happened.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Carry on, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TEPAI:</span><span> And when I went back to fish for this money there was none left. It 

was all gone. Since then, Mr Chairman, I have been unable to accomplish my plans.  

</span></div><div><span>I now come back to the Vote Item of Internal Affairs with regard to Rarotonga Local 

Government.  The  Cook  Islands  Party  Government  well  before  1978  started  the 

Island Council. In 1978 when the Democratic Party came to power, they abolished 

the  Island  Councils.  The  reason  for  this  was  so  they  could  divert  the  funding  into 

their  pockets.  They  did  that,  which  is  why  they  are  so  opposed  to  it  now  because 

there is no money left. What happened was, they diverted the funds to the Members, 

then they stopped it going to the CIP and kept it to themselves. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Point  of  Order.  The  Honourable  Member  is  saying  that 

Members  of  the  Opposition  stopped  it  because  they  wanted  to  pocket  that  money.  

</span><span>That’s  an  allegation  that  the  Honourable  Member  cannot  prove.  So I don’t accept 

</span><span>that because that is personal reflection on Members in the Opposition, Mr Chairman 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>1748 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>and it is not fair.  I think if we talk about who is pocketing money, we should look at 

them today - the way they have mismanaged the country.  I am saying, Mr Chairman, 

that the Honourable Member is very irrelevant and very unfair in accusing us in the 

opposition.  I  would  like  him  to  withdraw  that  remark  that  we  have  pocketed  that 

</span><span>money.  We have not pocketed that money at all. He’s got no proof. Thank you, Mr 

</span><span>Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    May  be  the  Honourable 

Member should explain what he means.   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TEPAI:</span><span>Mr Chairman, if he’s not happy with the word ‘pocket’, then I will 

withdraw that. Instead, I will say ‘it was shared out amongst the Members’. It was 

</span><span>shared out. That is the problem, when the Local Government was abolished, I am not 

sure whether they took the funds and shared it out to all Members in order to help 

their constituencies. I am not sure if both sides received funds. I was only responding 

to  the  question  raised  by  the  Honourable  Member  Ngamau  Munokoa  from  Nikao 

regarding the $8,000. People still believe today that this money is being given out. I 

</span><span>want it made known that it is not. Like the Member of the Opposition has said he’s 

</span><span>been in this House for ten years and he has never used that money. 

</span></div><div><span>So, people out there, don’t think this fund still exists. It doesn’t. It was ceased a long 

</span><span>time ago.  Luckily, we were able to get a few thousand dollars and we were able to 

</span><span>use it on Tinomana’s Palace in Arorangi, on Mama Tinomana’s toilet </span><span>and hot water. 

These days, no matter how much I change the bait on the hook of my rod, I never 

seem to catch any fish.  

</span></div><div><span>I  will  now  come  back  to  the  appropriation  for  the  Internal  Affairs  Department 

debated yesterday. Mr Chairman, when we look at this allocation we see  $314,000, 

</span><span>followed  by  $45,000.  Why  stop  there?  The  next  total  is  $269,000.    I  don’t  know 

</span><span>what  other  Members  are  thinking  with  regards  to  this  Vote  Item  but  I  suspect,  Mr 

Chairman  that  this  money  was  returned  to  the  Departments.  This  is  why  we  are 

passing this Amendment Bill, Mr Chairman, in order that the amount required can be 

topped up and then we can bring the money back. We will end up with the $314,000 

required.  If only the leader of the Democratic Alliance Party yesterday had thought 

to look for this money then he would be able to work out exactly where this money 

is.  The  only  way,  Mr  Chairman,  that  he  can  find  where  this  money  is,  or  find  out 

</span><span>which Departments have used this money, is to go out there with a feather as bait on 

</span><span>his  fishi</span><span>ng  rod  and  start  fishing  around.  If  you  throw  the  line  out  and  there’s 

</span><span>something there then you use the money there. This is how this $269,000 was used.  

</span></div><div><span>That is why Mr Chairman, I called out to the Leader of the DAP yesterday to let it go 

because this wa</span><span>s a trick I was trying to play on him, but he didn’t catch on. If he had 

</span><span>let  it  go  yesterday,  today  he  would  be  standing  tall.  Maybe  it is  because I have no 

title in this House which is why they criticise me, and yet when I leave the Chamber, 

they  criticise  me  again.  If  they  had  listened  to  me  then  they  would  be  standing  on 

</span><span>their own two feet. This reminds me of the parable of the light trying to overcome 

</span><span>the  darkness  but  the  darkness  would  not  give  in.  Finally,  I  would  like  to  tell  the 

Leader of the Opposition that when I go out to have a cigarette, I only have one or 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1749 

</span></div><div><span>two puffs. If you see me going out, you will know why. While I am out there, I still 

</span><span>know what’s going on. </span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Chairman, I support the Vote Item. It does not matter if we complain, 

the figures will not fall off the page. Your criticisms will not change anything. What 

is written is written, Mr Chairman. Therefore, I support it, Mr Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Mama Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Kia Orana again  to  everybody this  afternoon.  Kia Orana to 

you, Mr Chairman, and to the staff of this House. Kia Orana to the Prime Minister, 

Deputy Prime Minister, Ministers, to all the Members in the Government and to all 

my  colleagues  here  in  the  Opposition,  Kia  Orana  to  all  of  us  this  afternoon.    Kia 

Orana also to our people in the Cook Islands listening in to the radio. Kia Orana to 

you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to say to tell the Honourable Member of Tautu-Vaipae that I did not say 

that  they  misused  funds.    It  is  a  question  that  I  asked  the  Prime  Minister  in  this 

House.  We  were  all  in  the  Select  Committee  for the Rarotonga Local  Government 

and everybody there can remember that I asked what happened to the money which 

you  allocated  for  the  Rarotonga  Local  Government  before  I  came  into  Parliament. 

Therefore, I would like our people to know that this is not something that I just made 

</span><span>up  but  this  is  something  I  asked  our  Prime  Minister  for  good  reason.  I  don’t 

</span><span>remember  everything  that  occurred  in  1978  but  I  do  remember  that  the 

administration of our country in 1978 was good. We came to the elections of 1989 

and everything was  still okay in this country. Then the CIP Government came into 

power.    

</span></div><div><span>I do not want anybody to say it was the Democratic Party Government who put the 

country into the situation it is in today. In the 1994 elections, I stood as a candidate. I 

</span><span>was  aware  of  our  financial  situation  then,  so  don’t  say  it  was  the  Democratic 

</span><span>Government which caused our country to fall into this financial crisis. I would like to 

remind  the  Honourable  Member  for  Vaipae-Tautu  that  when  the  Democratic  Party 

Government  left,  this  country  was  in  good  condition.  From  1989  to  1994,  this 

country was in a good state.  After you came in 1994, you ruined this country with 

</span><span>your mismanagement.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Shut up.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor.  What  is  your  point  of 

order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:    </span><span>I  would  like  to  remind  the  Honourable  Member  that  we  are 

</span><span>talking about  a Vote Item. I would like her to  leave the problems between her and 

the Member for Tautu. Remind her we are talking about a Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>1750 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>I will stand again if she goes back in that direction. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  was  only  answering  to  something  an 

Honourable Member said. I think I did stray a bit so I am sorry. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  the  subject  of  the  Rarotonga  Local  Government,  Mr  Chairman.  I 

have no difficulty supporting this concept of Local Government but I am concerned 

about the burden which will be brought to bear upon our people. When we originally 

discussed the allocation for the Rarotonga Local Government, I thought that was the 

end of it.  I went back and thought about the things we discussed which may be put 

in  place  such  as  taxation,  fines  for  littering,  dog  tax,  these  are  things  we  have 

discussed.  When I think of these things, I am a bit worried because we will not be 

able  to  fine  our  own  people.  I  believe  our  people  would  find  this  very  hard  to  do 

because today we all know life is hard for our people. There are also instances when 

you would like to call the village people to work together on a village project, maybe 

once or twice a month. After the first and second time people will come but by the 

third,  very  few  will  show  up.  I  know  that  this  type  of  system  was  a  good  system 

about 20 years ago but today I can see it is very hard on our people.   

</span></div><div><span>With regard to what I said yesterday, I am not against people being taught. I think it 

is us in this House who should be given training. We all know that the people who 

have been elected on to the Vaka Councils are people who have had businesses and 

know how to  manage their finances. I know, as one of the earlier speakers already 

said, these people stood because they want to look ahead, not to the past. For me, I 

want to look ahead also so I can be sure that my people will elect me again. Thank 

you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman, and Greetings to you on this new day and 

Greetings  to  the  staff  of  this  House.    Greetings  to  Honourable  Members  of  the 

House,  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  all 

Government Members. Greetings also to the two leaders of the Opposition, who are 

both not present in the House today and to their Members, Greetings to you all. Kia 

Orana  to  our  people  listening  to  our  debate  today  concerning  the  allocation  for 

Internal Affairs.  

</span></div><div><span>Through you, Mr Chairman, I would like to extend my Greetings to my home island 

Aitutaki.  First, I would like to send condolences to the family of Papa Tikaka, who 

passed away yesterday. They are grieving today and I wish that the good Lord will 

bless and comfort them all.  I would like to send separate Greetings to the Mayor of 

Aitutaki  and to  all his  Councillors. I understand the Mayor will be the Democratic 

</span><span>Alliance Party candidate and that he will be contesting the seat in my Constituency. I 

</span><span>would like to give him this traditional proverb: </span><span>“aere marie e taku potiki kia kite koe 

ia ina potea” </span><span>(slow down my child in order that you will see tomorrow).  

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1751 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe my friend you are confused with the Mayoral Elections, that was then, this is 

the General Election for Members of Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Point of Order. Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  What is your Point of 

Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  the  honourable  Mayor  has  not  been 

nominated as a candidate yet, as the Member is saying. He is making an allegation 

and  running  the  Mayor  down,  Mr  Chairman.  He  is  being  unfair.  He  is  very  much 

irrelevant,  Mr  Chairman,  and  I  would  like  to  ask  him  to  withdraw  his  comments 

because the candidate has not been confirmed yet. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member your Point of Order is correct. 

Honourable Member your comments are out of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman for correcting me. I just came back from 

</span><span>Aitutaki yesterday and I heard this from a Member of the Honourable Dr Maoate’s 

Party, which is why I said it. I don’t say things for the sake of it, I am not a child.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Please come back to the discussion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:  </span><span>He  s</span><span>hould  not  say  that  I  am  scared,  I am  not  scared. He’s the one 

who should be scared, don’t look at the past, but worry about your future. </span></div><div><span>To you, Mr Mayor and your Council Members, Kia Orana in the name of Our Lord.  

To the four Ariki on the island, the Mataiapo and all the people, Greetings to you all 

in the name of Our Lord. Greetings also to these very important people, the servants 

of Our Lord and your assistants, and to your church members, Greetings in the name 

of Our Lord. To the Government Representative and the CEO, Greetings to you.  I 

believe what you are doing is important for the development of our island.  Greetings 

to the people in my Constituency of Amuri-Ureia. I believe that you still support the 

Cook  Islands  Party,  and  myself.  I  also  know  that  you  still  support  our  Leader,  Sir 

Geoffrey Arama Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>I will stop my Greetings here until after I have spoken on the Vote Item.  I was not 

</span><span>here  yesterday  when  the  discussion  commenced  on  Internal  Affairs  but  when I got 

here  today,  it  was  obvious  there  was  s  lot  of  tension.  Many  other  things,  most  of 

which  are  not  even  in  the  Budget,  are  being  talked  about  in  here.  This  is  what  is 

</span><span>wrong with us. There is a Manihikian saying which says ‘you say one thing, and they 

say something else’. Mr Chairman, if</span><span> we debate, we should stick to what is on the 

piece of paper. When I went through the Vote allocation for the Internal Affairs, Mr 

Chairman, I could not see anything regarding lost funds or money wasted. I listened 

carefully, everybody is talking about something different altogether and this is why 

we  are  always  getting  into  trouble.  What  happens  then,  Mr Chairman if somebody 

answers whatever one person says, then that first person gets angry. Of course, if that 

</span><span>was me I wouldn’t get angry, I’ll just laugh </span><span>about it. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>1752 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  best,  Mr  Chairman,  that  when  we  do  talk,  we  confine  our  criticisms  to  the 

allocation  of  Internal  Affairs.  We  should  be  talking  about  the  things  we  like  or 

dislike  in  the  way  this  money  is  being  used  by  this  Department.  This  Ministry  is 

res</span><span>ponsible for the payments of Destitute’s, Old Aged and Children’s benefits. If you 

</span><span>have any criticisms, it should be about the administration of these things. 

</span></div><div><span>I am aware that some of our so-called destitute people, as soon as they collect their 

benefits,  they  go  and  spend  it  on  renting  motorcycles,  or  purchasing  alcohol  and 

getting drunk. All they do is spend it and wait for the next payment. This is true of 

</span><span>some  people,  not  all  of  them.  Government’s  purpose  giving  this  benefit  is  to  help 

</span><span>them out with the</span><span>ir daily expenses.  However, when we get here, we don’t point that 

</span><span>out - we talk instead of how little they are getting, we criticise the way the payments 

are  being  administered.  We  say  these  pointless  things  so  our  people  listening  will 

think  we  are  right  and  they  will  be  convinced  to  vote  for  us  in  future.  What  we 

should be doing this. We should be finding out how and what we can do to ensure 

that  the  money  is  spent  on  the  things  for  which  it  was  intended.  Instead,  the 

beneficiaries go out and waste it. 

</span></div><div><span>Another  thing,  Mr  Chairman,  I  have  discovered  a  problem  with  the  Old  Aged 

Pension.    In  many  cases,  the  children  of  these  old-aged  pensioners  collect  the 

pension  for  them  and  they  spend  it  elsewhere.  We  all  know,  Mr  Chairman,  the 

purpose of this money is to support them, to provide food for them in their homes. 

What  we  should  be  doing  here,  Mr  Chairman,  is  to  see  how  best  we  can  help  our 

people in this regard. Instead, we come here and criticise each other in this House, 

</span><span>calling each other names, we don’t ge</span><span>t anywhere, and our people will remain in the 

dark about the work of Government.  

</span></div><div><span>When you hire people to do some work for you, you have to pay them. In the case of 

Government, you will get very upset if the Government which you elected does not 

help  you.  That  is  your  own  fault,  you  chose  those  people.  When  I  hire  people,  I 

</span><span>always pay them. When I plant crops, I let everyone on Aitutaki eat it, I don’t mind. I 

</span><span>never complain, I want them to eat it. You may laugh at what I am saying but I am 

telling the truth. Often, when I am not in Aitutaki, people come and help themselves. 

If they are listening to this, they will be laughing and thanking me because they are 

</span><span>grateful. I don’t complain or take people to court.  </span></div><div><span>So,  Mr  Chairman,  what  we  should  be  doing  is  discussing  the  problems  in  this 

Department,  or  congratulating  them  for  a  job  well  done,  or  looking  at  ways  to 

increase this allocation for the Internal Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  now  come  back  to  the  people  of  my  island  because  they  know  and  have 

</span><span>experienced  what  I’</span><span>m  saying.  To  the  youth  groups  and  the  church  groups  in  the 

community, I would like to encourage these warriors because I believe they are the 

future.  They  are  the  one  who  will  take  my  place,  not  here  in  Parliament,  but  over 

there on the plantations. The reason I mentioned the youth is because they are going 

</span><span>to be my supporters in the next election. Don’t think you people are going to take my 

</span><span>place  over  here,  no.  You  are  going  to  take  my  place  on  Te  Maunga  Pu  planting 

crops.

</span></div><div><span>My  last  Greeting  goes  to  the  Department  of  Justice  on  Aitutaki  and  for  those who 

have been appointed as J.Ps. 

</span></div><div><span>My time can’t be up yet. Mr Chairman, I met a J.P. once, he was upset that we never 

</span><span>send  our  Greetings  to  them  from  this  House.  He  was  disappointed  that  we  never 

acknowledge them and the important role they play in the community. That is why I 

send them my Greetings now. Unfortunately, this dear gentleman whom I spoke to, 

is  dead  now.  How  sad  this has to  be, but  we must realise how important  words of 

Greeting are to our listening audience. Many people out there are waiting for words 

</span><span>of Greeting from us in here. Sorry, but I don’t have enough time to greet everybody 

</span><span>in  Aitutaki,  but  next  time  when  I  stand  and  get  elected,  I  shall  send  Greetings  to 

</span><span>everybody. Mr Chairman, I’ll sto</span><span>p here. I support this allocation for Internal Affairs.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable  Minister  for  Tauranga  Vananga  and  Education,  the  Honourable 

Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:    </span><span>Thank  you.  Greetings  to  you  all  Honourable  Members  on  both 

sides of the House and to our people who are listening in.  I rise to give my support 

to this budget allocation for Internal Affairs.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time  to  send  my  condolences  and  that  of  my  family  and 

constituency to Papa Tikaka and the family for the passing away of our dear sister, 

your wife. This is a man who has served this country as a teacher, as a Member of 

the Island Council and also  as JP. He has served well in the community, so I send 

him  words  of  comfort  from  my  wife  and  myself  and  from  my  own  electorate  in 

Aitutaki.  I would also like to give a word of comfort to the Prime Minister because 

this is his sister-in-law, Mama Ani. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like,  at  this  time,  to  send  condolences  to  the  village  of  Tautu  in 

Aitutaki,  to  Mama  Tavake  Piraraiti  who  had  passed  away  yesterday.  I  send  my 

condolences to the children and family. Thirdly, I send my condolences to the family 

</span><span>of  Papa  William  George  in  Titikaveka,  who  passed  away  today.  I  don’t  know  this 

</span><span>man, but I heard about it on the news. To his wife and family, may I send you my 

</span><span>deepest sympathy.  

</span></div><div><span>Fourthly, I would like to send Greetings to the Leader of the New Alliance Party and 

his delegation who went to the island of Araura Enua. I believe our people of Araura 

will  show  him  the  same  hospitality  they  showed  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic-

Alliance Party and his delegation when they were there. At this time, I would like to 

remind  our  people  in  the  constituency  of  Arenikau,  that  is  Arutanga,  Reureu  and 

Nikaupara,  of  the  Committee  meeting  today.  I  will  be  coming  to  Aitutaki  this 

evening with the Chairman of the Cook Islands Party and we will be meeting tonight 

</span><span>at the venue arranged by you. I will come back here tomorrow.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>1754 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  my  words  of  comfort  to  those  families  who  are  grieving  today  and  my 

Greetings to those people in the three sectors of our community. I send my Greetings 

to the community leaders in the three sectors.  

</span></div><div><span>I come back to the appropriation for the Internal Affairs. I would like at this time to 

give  my  Greetings  to  the  former  Minister  of  Internal  Affairs,  Pa  Pokino  and  the 

present  Minister  of  Internal  Affairs,  Mr  Tiki  Matapo,  and  to  the  Secretary  of  the 

Internal Affairs, Mama Kopu Brown, Greetings to all of you. We all know that Mrs 

Brown, the Secretary of the Internal  Affairs, has gone to New Zealand for medical 

treatment and I am pleased to hear that she is doing quite well and she will be back 

very soon.  

</span></div><div><span>When I look at the appropriation budgeted for the Department of Internal Affairs, I 

can  see,  Mr  Chairman,  that  the  allocation  is  low  but  the  service  provided  is  very 

high.   This is the kind of spirit we have had in Government Departments since the 

reform. Many Heads of Ministries, the Ministers and their staff are working beyond 

what is expected of them when serving their people.  

</span></div><div><span>When  I  look  at  the  Vote  Item  in  front  of  us,  I  see  that  the  allocation  for  Protocol 

Internal Affairs has been increased. I am happy for this section because this is a very 

busy and active part of the Ministry. These are the people who go to the Airport to 

the VIP Lounge to meet the dignitaries who come to our country. This section takes 

care of and escorts them while they are in our country. We had a recent visit from the 

French  Polynesian  Government  representative,  the  Minister  of  Culture  and  Higher 

Education and her delegation. I was pleased by the assistance provided by Kaka and 

Henry to this woman and her delegation. They took good care of her and escorted her 

everywhere she wanted to go on Rarotonga.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I listened to  the speeches of the Honourable Members regarding the 

Rarotonga Local Government allocation. I would like to say that we must not forget 

that the Local Government is already in gear and carrying out their work. They are 

obtaining whatever services they require on credit because Government has informed 

them that there is money coming to them to assist them in their activities. The work 

is proceeding very well. Maybe there are people saying that we should not be doing 

this kind of thing, or else we will be over-committing ourselves. I want to say that I 

have  faith  in  the  Minister  of  Finance,  Pa  Pokino,  for  his  strict  management  of  our 

finances. His management style is tough like the </span><span>makatea</span><span> (old coral) of Mangaia but 

when he sees that it is possible, he will release the funds as he has promised.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  give  my  Greetings  to  the  three  Mayors  of  Rarotonga  and  the 

three Councils of Rarotonga. I would like to give them my encouragements. I was on 

my way to church on the Sabbath, when I saw a working bee taking place in Avatiu. 

On my way back home, I saw how clean and beautiful it looked. Let us not always 

</span><span>think  that  it  takes  money  to  get  a  project  going,  no  that’s  not  true.  I  heard  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member, aunty Mau, say that the spirit of cooperation has gone from our 

</span><span>people now. She was saying that was the spirit twenty years ago. I believe that that 

</span><span>Maori  attitude  still  exists,  it  is  just  a  matter  of  encouraging  and  motivating  our 

people.  Some of them are waking up to it again. I think it is possible to revive that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1755 

</span></div><div><span>spirit  under  the  Local  Government  administration  and  through  the  devolution 

process. 

</span></div><div><span>We must remember that these are our own roads, our own streams and villages that 

are  being  cleaned.  When  that  is  done  it  looks  </span><span>“</span><span>akaieie”</span><span>  (beautiful),  as  they  say  in 

</span><span>Aitutaki.  I don’t want  to  dwell on the reasons  why our Maori spirit of cooperation 

and sharing has  disappeared, no I won’t.  I prefer to  think about  the positive things 

</span><span>happening today and I am optimistic about our future. I want to encourage us to keep 

up the good work. I have been to other countries in the Pacific, and without belittling 

them, I would say that ours is the most beautiful country within the region. 

</span></div><div><span>I can see an allocation for Social Welfare in the Internal Affairs Vote Item. This is 

for benefits for our destitute people, the old-aged, the disabled and the children. This 

service,  provided  by  Government  to  assist  the  community  is  continuing.  When  I 

compare us to other countries, I think we are the luckiest, yet we complain that we 

are  poor,  suffering  and  that  theft  is  on  the  increase.  Mr  Chairman,  a  true  sign  of 

poverty is the beggars in the streets. That is a sign that the country is in bad shape. 

Mr Chairman, I do not see beggars in the street here.  

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati, is saying you will not find beggars in 

our country but you will find a lot of thieves. I am surprised to hear such a comment 

from one who used to be Prime Minister of this country - for him to speak about his 

own  people  in  this  way!  It  is  not  as  if  thievery  started  just  recently.  Helping  your 

friend is not theft. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  see  there  is  an  allocation  for  Women  and  Youth  Support  Services.    I  would 

like  to  congratulate  the  Government  for  continuing  to  support  this  sector  in  the 

community.  I  would  like  to  encourage  the  women  of  our  country.  There  is  one 

woman Member of Parliament today and after the next general election, I would like 

to  see  a  few  more  and  maybe  even  some  in  Cabinet.  I  believe  this  is  an  area  we 

should look into carefully. Men and women should be able to work together in the 

House, to work together in running the country and to work together in all areas of 

life.  

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  speak  in  English  on  the  allocation  for  Labour  and  Consumer  Affairs 

because I have been approached by people working for some employers who are not 

giving their employees a fair go in accordance with the law of the country.  We have 

some excellent employees in the private sector but we have some bad employers too. 

They are taking advantage of our people because our people are not too sure of their 

rights as employees.  We all know the law, we all know the rights of the workers of 

this country, whether they work for Government or the private sector, the law applies 

to all employees of this country. Those of you who are listening to me and you know 

you are not  giving your employees a fair go in  terms  of overtime, penal payments, 

and entitlement for working hours and so forth, I am appealing to you to follow the 

law, be fair to the workers of our country.  

</span></div><div><span>I am  a firm believer in the principle that every kind of work on earth is important, 

whether  you  are  a  political  leader,  a  church  leader,  a  Member  of  Parliament,  a 

planter, a sweeper on the streets, or whatever, your job is important for this country.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>1756 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I have to thank our men and women who clean the town area every day so that we 

have  a  beautiful  and  clean  town-front.  Thank  you  very  much  for  your  good  work.  

Even you housewives have a very important job to do - caring for the home. If you 

are  not  working,  please  regard  your  work  as  the  mother  of  the  home  as  being  of 

paramount importance. I read a magazine where great leaders of the world, who have 

lived before us, in every case, they have always attributed their status in life to their 

mothers.  Sure mothers who work in the home maybe unpaid but you are doing the 

most  important  work  in  raising  your  children  according  to  the  precepts  of  our 

Christian beliefs. When you do your job well there, then certainly they will become 

good citizens of this country in the future. Therefore, I give my fullest support to the 

allocation  of  $6,700,041  for  Internal  Affairs  to  assist  it  to  continue  with  the  most 

useful work that they are doing in our country. Yes, we can easily say that that is not 

enough, no allocation for any Vote is enough, but it is the way you can use that little 

bit properly. One day, when we become rich, then you will know how to make use of 

the huge amounts you will get. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Utia Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  U.  MATATA:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Greetings  to  you,  to  Honourable 

Members on both sides of the House and to our people who are listening in to our 

debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Honourable  Member,  I  have  to  interrupt  you.  There  is  no 

Quorum. 

</span></div><div><span>BELL RUNG AT 2.45 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Members.    The  Honourable  Member, 

Utia Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>MR U. MATATA:</span><span> I would like to send special greetings, Mr Chairman, to all the 

old-aged pensioners, to our young children on child benefits and also to the people 

who are destitute. My special greetings to the old-aged pensioners. The Ministry of 

Internal  Affairs  is  the  only  Ministry  in  Government  that  actually  just  gives  out 

money. 

</span></div><div><span>If  we  look  at  the  allocation  for  Internal  Affairs,  Mr  Chairman,  we  see  there  is  an 

allocation for $6,700,041.  Of this, over $5 million is allocated by Government for 

this  purpose.    This  is  why  I  said  earlier  Mr  Chairman,  that  this  is  the  only 

Government Ministry that is actually giving away money, especially to our old-aged 

pensioners, child beneficiaries, and also to our destitute beneficiaries.  However, we 

must also understand, Mr Chairman that these beneficiaries will use this money that 

Government  is  giving  away  to  people.    These  beneficiaries  will  actually  give  this 

</span><span>money back to businesses in the country and therefore benefit the country.  I believe 

</span><span>that it is more than $6 or $700,000 per month that Government is giving out to our 

people  which  comes  back  through  the  businesses  as  a  benefit  to  the  country.  

However, in the political campaign period ahead, Mr Chairman, we are not too sure 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1757 

</span></div><div><span>what other political parties will be trying to give to our people as enticements, like 

giving out lollies to our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I think it is  also  quite hard for the  Ministry to  keep track of our people, especially 

those on the old-aged benefits  and the child benefit. In many cases, our people are 

travelling  back  and  forth  and  it  is  quite  hard  for  the  Ministry  to  keep  track  of  our 

people.    However,  I  believe  Mr  Chairman  that  the  Immigration  is  assisting  the 

Internal Affairs in this area where they keep track of our people travelling out of the 

country. I am not too certain on the policy now but I think after six months, if our 

old-aged pensioners are out of the country for more than six months then they lose 

their pension.  So I would like to ask our people to help the Ministry by informing 

them that they are leaving the country and how long they will be absent to make the 

job  of  the  Ministry  a  lot  easier.  I  would  like  at  this  point, to  thank the staff of the 

Ministry of Internal Affairs for the help that they are giving our people in providing 

them with this assistance in the form of these benefits. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  not  speak  on  any  other  areas  in  this  Appropriation  for  Internal  Affairs.    We 

have  heard  the  explanations  by  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  as  he 

explained the breakdown of the Appropriation for the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>I come back, Mr Chairman, to the issue that has been discussed over the last couple 

of days and that is the subject of the Rarotonga Local Government, which I think has 

become  a  political  football  in  this  House.    I  think  the  whole  issue  rose  out  of  the 

concern of two Mayors on the island who went to the television and the newspapers 

to  voice  their  concern  that  there  was  no  money  available  to  help  their  Council.  

Therefore,  when  we  got  on  to  the  allocation  for  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs 

yesterday we then heard all the views of the Members on this particular issue. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Mayor  and  the  Council  Members  of  Puaikura,  Mr 

Chairman.  While  at  their  meeting  I  heard  what  they  wanted  to  do.  I  know  of  their 

plans  and  I  know  exactly  what  they intend to  do. The issue of funds was raised in 

this meeting because anything to do with funds will always be discussed.  However, 

I was happy to note that the issue of the lack of funds did not deter them from their 

plans. They are determined to get the job done. The Mayor did not go and complain 

on  the  TV  that  he  was  worried  about  the  non-availability  of  funds.    Therefore,  I 

would  like  to  congratulate  the  Mayor  and  all  the  Councillors  of  Puaikura.    More 

important to them is that the work be carried out whether there are funds available or 

not they want the work to be done. 

</span></div><div><span>If  we  look  at  the  views  of  the  Opposition,  they  want  to  know  where  the  money  is 

going  to  come  from.    I  want  to  assure  the  people  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga,  if 

Government  has  indicated  that  they  will  provide  something  for  the  Local 

Government  Councils  then  I  cannot  believe  that  they  will  do  otherwise.    If 

</span><span>Government  doesn’t do what  it said it would do then it will be a bad reflection on 

</span><span>them.  I would therefore like to ask our people and all the Councillors on the island 

</span><span>to  be  patient.  I  believe  everything  was  explained  to  you  in  the  workshop  that  was 

</span><span>held  last  night.    I  believe  that  the  Minister  of  Finance  will  rise  and  explain  to  us 

exactly what happened. Maybe if the Minister of Finance is not able to do that then I 

am certain the Minister responsible for the Rarotonga Local Government will be able 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>1758 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>to explain exactly what is happening so we don’t politicise this issue. Those are my 

views,  Mr  Chairman.  I  don’t  have  very  much  else  to  say  except  that  I  support  the 

</span><span>Vote Item for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman,  good  afternoon  to  you  and  good 

afternoon  to  the  staff  of  Parliament.  Good  afternoon  to  Honourable  Members  of 

Government and the Opposition. Good afternoon also to our people listening in.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, like speakers before me, I would also like to give condolences to the 

family of Papa Tikaka Henry. His family developed a very deep friendship with the 

people of the Northern Group.   I came to know Mama Ani when I was attending the 

Primary School of Tauhunu where Papa Tikaka was the Headmaster. At the time, I 

was also a friend of his son, Henry Tikaka. This is how I became one of the members 

of the Henry family.  Therefore, I give my condolences to Papa Tikaka and Dr Henry 

Tikaka and all the family for their great loss. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman  I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  this  appropriation  for  the  sum  of 

$6,741,000  as  part  of  the  supplementary  allocation  for  Internal  Affairs.  I  give  my 

deepest  appreciation  to  this  fund  as  part  of  this  fund  go  to  support  our  old-aged 

people and young children.   Mr Chairman, from the time the reform started in mid- 

1996, until now, this Government assistance that is given to our old folk and to our 

children, has been the cornerstone of their lives. It is my deepest wish that whichever 

Government gets into power after the election, it should continue or even improve on 

this allotment of funding to our beneficiaries.  In fact, it would not be a bad idea for 

my Party to look into increasing the Old Aged Benefit and the Child Benefit. I think 

it would not be a bad idea, Mr Speaker. The reform has taught us to live within our 

own means. If we can afford such an increase, I think it is a good idea. 

</span></div><div><span>I am also very pleased to learn, Mr Chairman, that apart from this small assistance, 

there is also the likelihood that some of our Cook Islanders who have been working 

in New Zealand, will be permitted by new legislation in the near future to return to 

the Cook Islands to live while still collecting their New Zealand benefits. Therefore, 

that  is  another  good  thing  for  our  old  people.  They  have  a  source  of  income. That 

</span><span>will  allow  them  to  return  to  the  Cook  Islands.  But  maybe  just  a  word  of  caution, 

</span><span>maybe it is something for us Parliamentarians to look at, there might be a conflict in 

future if some of them are entitled to two benefits. Some of them maybe eligible to 

collect the New Zealand one, while at the same time they are qualified to collect the 

local one.  

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, Mr Speaker, I am also grateful that part of this grant has been allowed for 

some of our destitute in the country to collect. This is very much appreciated by the 

Department  of  Health.  Mr  Chairman,  we  have  old  people  boarding  at  the  Hospital 

</span><span>because they have no family members to look after them at home. Recently we made 

</span><span>some changes to the legislation to allow the Health Department to access this benefit 

to help these boarders pay for their food and to help with their upkeep. You see Mr 

Speaker this is the Cook Islands spirit. If this was in New Zealand, they would not be 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1759 

</span></div><div><span>accepted in the Hospital.  As Minister, and I am sure any Minister before or after me, 

would not turn these people away. Like I said, I really appreciate this sort of small 

assistance given under this  allocation towards maintaining some of these destitutes 

not only the old people who have no relatives but especially those who are very sick 

</span><span>who  can’t  work  to  earn  their  living.  This  is  one  of  the  allocations  that  has  carved 

</span><span>much of our total budget. My calculation is about 18 percent of the total vote item is 

being  allocated  for  these  services.  It  is  about  the  second  biggest  allocation  of  the 

budget, apart from the allocation to MOID. 

</span></div><div><span>I would repeat, that these people deserve these social services, the social benefits that 

the country is paying now, and rightly so. Internal Affairs also, Mr Chairman, plays 

other vital social roles within the Government. At present, we are all aware, that they 

are  helping  us  by  putting  up  tents/marquees  for  functions  for  both  Government  as 

well  as  private  functions.    In  addition,  I  do  thank  the  workers  of  this  Department 

</span><span>because it’s quite serious responsibilities. The demand is there, although this is one 

area  that  ought  to  be  privatised.  Right  now,  I  can’t  see  anybody  c</span><span>oming  up with  a 

good proposal to take over the responsibility.       

</span></div><div><span>Within the Department of Internal Affairs, we have a Protocol Service offered. This 

</span><span>VIP  Protocol  Service  is  very  important  not  only  to  us,  but  for  visiting  VIP’s  from 

</span><span>overseas. We are talking about representatives of overseas governments - people of 

very high calibre. Mr Speaker, this is an important area because it gives recognition 

to high officials from overseas, including Prime Ministers and Presidents who visit 

our shores. I could not see any other place where they could be accommodated where 

they  could  pay  and  be  treated  like  VIPs.  Government  provides  this  service  free  of 

charge. Government gives recognition to important visitors who come to our shores.  

I personally give thanks to the very few staff who mans this service. I urge them to 

keep on doing the good work they are doing at present.   

</span></div><div><span>The  latest  addition,  Mr  Chairman,  to  the  responsibilities  of  the  Internal  Affairs 

Department  is  the  Vaka  Councils.  I  have  already  congratulated  all  the  Mayors  on 

Rarotonga and all the Councillors. At present, I can see there are some Council who 

are very ambitious and have taken it upon themselves to expend funds of their own 

to  start  cleaning  up  their  villages.  In  my  Constituency  particularly,  I  would  like  to 

thank the Council members, under Lee Harmon, for he has already initiated his own 

cleaning  programme  in  upper  Tupapa.    He  has  already  hired  three  workers  and 

supplied his own materials to start the cleaning-up, with a little bit of support from 

me in terms of gas and oil.  Likewise, other Councils are thinking of the same thing.  

</span></div><div><span>I would just like to announce to the people of Tupapa, our working bee commences 

this Saturday at 7.00 a.m. Although we started cleaning the rugby field last Saturday, 

that is done now and this Saturday we start cleaning up the roadside. Mr Chairman I 

am  very  happy  to  be  associated  with  the  granting  of  this  allocation.    I  hope  this 

money will be spent well until the end of this financial year. Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Minister of Justice and Lands, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>1760 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Greetings  to  you  and  to  staff 

members  of  the  House.  Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister, 

Cabinet Ministers and Honourable Members on the Government side. To the Leader 

of the Democratic-Alliance Party, the Honourable Dr Maoate and your Members, to 

the Leader of the New Alliance Party and his members Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, may I ask your leave to extend my condolences to the family that is 

grieving  for  the  loss  of  a  loved  one?  My  condolences,  my  wife  and  my  family  to 

Papa Henry for the loss of your beloved wife, Mama Ani. May I extend to him and 

his  children,  the family in  Rarotonga and throughout  the Cook Islands, our sincere 

sympathies. May God bless you and comfort  you at  this time. I came to know this 

woman  when  we  travelled  to  Aitutaki  to  see  about  getting  some  land  through  my 

</span><span>grandfather’s  side  of  the  family.    I  knew  I  was  related  to  her  </span><span>but  on  this  trip  to 

Aitutaki  I  came  to  know  how  closely  related  we  were.  This  dear  mama  was  very 

supportive of me when I was getting a section of land to build a house.  

</span></div><div><span>The second condolences I would like to send goes out to your daughter-in-law, Nga 

Mr Chairman, for the passing away of her father. I believe his funeral will be held on 

the Raina family tribal land in Titikaveka this afternoon. He is William George from 

Mangaia who passed away yesterday in the hospital.  May God bring comfort to you 

and your family and give you strength to face the days ahead.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  send  special  greetings,  Mr  Chairman,  to  my  Constituency  in 

Titikaveka. To those of you listening to me on the radio today, greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  regarding  the  allocation  for  Internal  Affairs,  I  would  like  to  send  a 

message to our senior citizens in our country. To the destitute, to the mothers of our 

</span><span>children. Don’t worry your financial support will continue. I would like to make sure 

</span><span>the debate in this House does not confuse you. Do not think that you might not get 

what you are getting now.  

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to send special greetings to the staff of the Internal Affairs and to 

the  Secretary  Kopu  Brown  and  her  husband.  Mrs  Brown  is  in  New  Zealand  for 

medical treatment.  I spoke to her on the telephone today and she sends her regards 

to everybody. Special greetings to Papa Ngata Urirau who is the Financial Controller 

for Internal Affairs. On the 31st of this month, he will be retiring after having served 

</span><span>the Cook Islands Government for 37 years. I know all Honourable Members will join 

</span><span>with me in congratulating Papa, for his honest and loyal service. I speak not only for 

myself  but  also  for  former  Ministers  he  has  worked  for  during  his  time  in 

Government. We all extend our sincerest gratitude to him for his faithful service. I 

have tried to humbly ask him if he could continue until the end of the next financial 

year but he could not carry on. He wanted to retire. I understand Mr Chairman that 

he will be going to one of the countries outside our country where he wants to take a 

complete rest and retire with his family.  Therefore, I would like to seek the support 

of all the Members of this House to extend to this dear Papa, who has worked well 

and hard for over 37 years in the services of the Crown. I would like to ask that we 

join to  show our gratitude to  this man who has served this country well. May God 

truly bless him, his wife and his family, and be with him in whatever he endeavours 

to do during his retirement. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1761 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to send my greetings to Stephen Wearing who has at many times 

been the Acting Secretary for Internal Affairs while the Secretary was away.  He is 

doing  a  very  good  job  and  is  a  very  capable  person.  Not  forgetting  other  staff, Mr 

Chairman, especial</span><span>ly the Women’s Division, in the likes of Mrs Neti Tamarua and 

</span><span>others  assisting  her  to  carry  out  the  responsibility  of  this  division  on  behalf  of  the 

women  of  our  country.  Special  Greetings  from  me  to  all  staff  members  of  this 

Ministry both here and in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, last night the workshop for the Mayors and the Council members was 

held at the CICC Hall in Nikao. The Prime Minister was there to open this seminar. I 

stayed on at the seminar. I would like to congratulate the Co-ordinator of the Vaka 

Council, Vaine Teokotai and to all the Mayors from the three </span><span>Vaka</span><span> on the island and 

Council members from the </span><span>Vaka</span><span> who were there. I would also like to thank the head 

of  the  Crown  Law  Office,  Janet  Maki  who  was  there  to  explain  the  Local 

Government Act to the Council members. I was very happy with the views expressed 

by various members of the Councils for the many questions they have raised with the 

Solicitor General regarding the establishment of local by-laws. The views expressed 

by  the  members  of  the  Council  for  a  proposal  they  want  to  put  forward  to  the 

Minister was very constructive. They wish to establish and implement programmes 

within  the  boundaries  of  their  Vaka.  They  wanted  to  do  these  things  and  to  make 

some  by-laws  to  help  them  strengthen  their  positions  in  the  community  to  enable 

them to carry out certain types of work. 

</span></div><div><span>An example, raised by the Mayor for Takitumu, was that of a </span><span>ra’ui</span><span> (prohibition) to 

be  put  on  the  trochus  within  the  Vaka.  The  question  posed  was,  if  somebody  is 

caught breaking that </span><span>ra’ui</span><span> would the Local Government be able to impose fines or to 

take  those  people  to  Court?  These  were  some  of  the  ideas  floated  last  night,  Mr 

Chairman.  Last  night  was  the  first  night  for  the  seminar  and  tonight  will  be  the 

second.  The  seminar  tonight  will  be  held  in  Arorangi,  and  the  final  night  will  be 

tomorrow,  at  the  Kent  Hall  in  Titikaveka.  The  majority  of  the  Councillors  were 

present last night except for maybe two or three Councillors. However, the gathering 

was  excellent.  It  was  good  to  see  the  points  of  view  from  Councillors  concerning 

their  particular  areas  of  interest.    Although  there  was a lot of debate in  this House 

yesterday concerning the Rarotonga Local Government, it was hardly mentioned in 

this seminar last night. Maybe some people are a bit suspicious of why this seminar 

is  held.  If  there  are  opinions  as  such,  then  they  were not  voiced last night  because 

maybe these people now understand exactly what this seminar intends to do which is 

to inform the Councillors of their particular roles in their respective Councils.  More 

importantly,  Mr  Chairman,  is  the  possibility  of  these  Councils  becoming  self-

sustaining  through  taking  over  some  of  the  services  currently  provided  by 

Government. This will be one way for them to fund their services and to strengthen 

their positions. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  these  men  and  women  who  are  Councillors  are  not  stupid.  The 

</span><span>enthusiasm  and  the  motivation  to  do  the  best  for  their  respective  communities 

</span><span>became very apparent in this seminar last night. This spirit was present last night, Mr 

Chairman,  because  they  are  now  being  given  this  opportunity  to  be  able  to 

administer their own affairs. We all know that this is not something new. We know 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>1762 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>that this occurred in the past and we are reviving it today. There is a strong desire to 

start work                                                                                0as soon as possible. 

However Mr Chairman, I believe it will not be easy at the start. There will be failures 

and there will be successes. These are apparent today, maybe not in this House but 

outside the House in our communities. Our people are not blind or stupid. They can 

see this amongst our Councillors. Some are seen working and some are not. This, I 

believe, Mr Chairman, is okay but the important thing is to improve as we go along 

so everybody will be happy.  

</span></div><div><span>One thing that is important to the Local Government Councils on the island is that 

all the projects in the </span><span>Vaka</span><span> be completed by the 30th of June this year. I am aware of 

the  determination  of  the  Councils  and  the  Mayors  to  achieve  this  goal.  They  are 

enthusiastic  that  this  will  happen.  I  admire  their  determination,  Mr  Chairman. 

However,  I  must  caution  them  not  to  go  too  fast,  we  should  rein  them  in  a  little, 

</span><span>don’t  go  too  fast.  We  must  look  careful</span><span>ly  at  all  the  projects  and  programmes  that 

they would like to carry out, to ensure that they match with the funds available and 

that the distribution of funds is fair to everyone. So, I thank all our Mayors and all 

the  Councillors  for  their  strong  desire  and  eagerness  to  do  things  to  benefit 

themselves and their communities. They are young, energetic people, Mr Chairman, 

who  are  hard  working.  They  are  keen  to  get  on  with  the  job,  to  get  these  projects 

completed. 

</span></div><div><span>There is one issue, which was mentioned by another Member earlier, which I am not 

overly  concerned  about,  but  I  would  like  to  say  something  about  it  nonetheless. 

Maybe this Member did not really understand what role ex-officio members play on 

these  Councils.  What  I  want  to  do  now  is  to  give  an  explanation.  Members  of 

Parliament  are  ex-officio  members  on  these  Local  Government  Councils.    We  are 

not  there  to  run  these  Councils.  It  is  not  up  to  the  Members  of  Parliament  to  run 

these  Councils.  We  are  on  these  Councils  only  to  help  them  and  to  share  in  the 

discussion of issues that are pertinent to our communities.   If you, as a Member of 

Parliament, did something in your community, without prior discussion or agreement 

with the Council then that is your expense and your own efforts. You should not rely 

on  their  funds  for  your  programme.      However,  I  think,  Mr  Chairman,  the  fairest 

thing  to  do  is  that,  we  as  Members  of  Parliament,  work  together  with  our  Local 

Government  Councils.  We  all  work  for  the  one  purpose  and  for  the  benefit  of 

everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>As I said earlier, our goal is the same. We are all working for the benefit of everyone 

in the community. As I also said, we will fail in some places and we will succeed in 

others but the main thing is to work together and encourage each other. The seminar 

which  will  be  held  tonight  in  Arorangi,  is  to  be  hosted  by  the  Vaka  Council  of 

</span><span>Arorangi.  The  major  topic  covered  by  tonight’s  seminar  will  be  administration  of 

</span><span>funds  which  are  to  be  allocated  to  Councils  by  MFEM.  Councils  are  expected  to 

account for these public funds. I was glad for this explanation, because in the minds 

of  some  Councillors,  they  believe  that  they  are  getting  a  bulk  fund  and  be  left  to 

</span><span>carry  on  with  what  they  would  like  to  do.    This  is  not  in  accordance  with  the 

</span><span>provisions of the MFEM Act, Mr Chairman. But the Councils will be able to submit 

their various proposals, which MFEM will then consider. Thank you.

the family who are grieving at the loss of your loved one. My sympathy also goes out 

to Papa Tikaka for the loss of his wife.  The last time I met this lady was last year. 

We  chatted  and  we  were  supposed  to  meet  again  shortly  thereafter  to  discuss  our 

genealogies,  because  this  lady  is  of  Manihikian  descent.  We  are  all  from  Ngati 

Tokamoa.
