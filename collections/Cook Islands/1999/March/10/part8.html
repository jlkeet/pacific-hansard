<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Constitution  Amendment  (No.24)  Bill,  Second  Reading.    The  Honourable  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Greetings, Mr Speaker, and Greetings to all Honourable 

Members  in  the  House  whom  the  people  of  this  country  have  elected  to  be  their 

representatives in this House. Greetings also to the people listening in to our debate 

this evening. Greetings to you all in the name of Our Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>This  Amendment  Bill  in  the  House,  Mr  Speaker,  has  come  about  through  a 

recommendation of the Political Review Commission. The Commission sought the 

views of the community through the meetings they held and the questionnaires they 

gave  them.  It  became  apparent,  Mr  Speaker,  that  only  a  few  people  answered  the 

question  with  regards  to  shortening  the  term  of  Parliament.  It  was  discovered  that 

some  people  thought  a  five  year  term  was  fine  while  some  wanted  four,  and  there 

were also those who wanted to drop it to three. The purpose of this Amendment Bill 

in front of us, Mr Speaker, is to present our people, before the general election, the 

choice of a term of Parliament of four years. If you agree, you will find a box on the 

</span><span>ballot paper, which says ‘yes’. If you do not accept that it be shortened, you can tick 

the ‘no’ box. If you wish the Parliamentary term to remain at a five yea</span><span>r term, you 

can mark in the box that you do not agree. 

</span></div><div><span>There is a rather strange requirement in the Constitution, which states that if there is 

</span><span>to be any change in the term of Parliament it must first be presented to the people. 

This is an amendment made by the Democratic Party Government at the time when 

they  decided  Parliament  should  be  extended  to  five  years  from  the  original  four 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1765 

</span></div><div><span>years.  At  that  time,  they  increased  their  term  of  Parliament  and  made  it  so  that  it 

would  be  difficult  in  future  to  make  any  changes.  What  this  means  is,  the  current 

Government  cannot  change  the  term  of  any  Parliament  without  first  going  to  the 

people  in  a  referendum.  The  people  will  decide  whether  they  want  to  support  a 

change to the term of Parliament or not. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I am happy to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Constitution Amendment (No. 24) Bill be now  

Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>We do not have to decide in this House whether we stand for four or five years, you 

</span><span>don’t have to  do that.  We do not wish as Members of Parliament to in</span><span>fluence the 

decision of our people on the term of Parliament, whether it be reduced to four years 

or keep it at five. The requirement of this Amendment is to give our people the right 

to make a decision either to reduce the term of Parliament to four years or keep it at 

five years.  As I see it, Mr Speaker, our job in Parliament right now is to accept the 

Bill before us, without going into Committee, to give the people the opportunity to 

choose yes or no. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the idea, Mr Speaker. If a Member wishes to talk on the principle and merits, 

</span><span>that is fine, no one will stop you, but we won’t go into the Committee of the Whole 

</span><span>to  scrutinise each Clause of the Bill.  I think, after the debate on the principles and 

merits, we will stop there. We will let the people make the decision. Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister. May I call for a Seconder?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Constitution Amendment (No. 24) Bill be Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>DR J. WILLIAMS: </span><span>Mr Speaker and Members of the House, Kia Orana.  I stand to 

</span><span>support this Bill. It is not just my support that I am giving, Mr Speaker and Members 

of  the  House,  it  is  also  the  support  of  the  Overseas  Constituency.  As  this  Bill  is 

going before our people, you can be guaranteed, Mr Speaker, that this will be one of 

the major subjects on 531PI Radio in Auckland, New Zealand. If we remember, in 

the last general election, a referendum was held on four issues.  I will only mention 

</span><span>two, the first is this: the question was asked to our people, ‘do you want a five year 

term, a four year term or a three year term?’ If we recall, the majority of the people 

</span><span>chose  five  years,  but  if  you  combine  the  three  and  four  year  terms  the  majority  of 

</span><span>people  wanted  a  reduction  in  the  term  of  Parliament  to  less  than  five  years. 

</span><span>Therefore,  it  is  appropriate  that  we  give  our  people  a  second  chance  to  choose 

whether it is a five year term they want or whether in fact it is a four year term that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>1766 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>they want. If it is a four year term then this reiterates their wishes for a reduction of 

the term from five years. 

</span></div><div><span>The second issue concerns the Overseas Constituency.  For those who are agitating 

to get rid of the Overseas Constituency, let me remind you of what the people said 

during  that  referendum.    Mr  Speaker,  83  per  cent  of  the  people  who  voted  in  that 

</span><span>referendum said no, we don’t want to get rid of the Overseas Constituency.  We want 

</span><span>to retain it.  In addition, I am very happy and I am very glad that we have accepted 

the  voice  of  the  people  that  there  will  not  be  another  referendum  concerning  the 

Overseas Constituency.  It is final.  It will not go away. 

</span></div><div><span>As I said, I am not going into the other two issues or I will be called irrelevant.  My 

own  personal  view  is  that  the  term  should  be  reduced  to  four  years.  That  is  my 

personal  view.  I  cannot  give  you  the  Overseas  Constituency  until  we  hold  this 

Talkback  Show on 531PI as we normally do with  all issues concerning Parliament 

and concerning the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>On that note, Mr Speaker, I support this Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, it is very difficult for me to accept this Amendment.  

I will tell you two reasons why. In the last month of last year I went to Rakahanga. I 

showed them and read to them the recommendations made by the Political Review 

Commission  and  the  Constitution  Amendment  No.23  Bill,  which  we  debated  on. 

This is what my people have decided, three years - not four years. I asked them the 

</span><span>reason why they decided on three years, they replied ‘so we don’t have to suffer like 

</span><span>we  are  doing  today  -  it  will  be shorter  - it will be three years of suffering not  five 

</span><span>years!’. If the going is good then it will be easy to bring that Government back after 

</span><span>three  years.  I  thought  about  this  and  I  realised  they  were  wise.  If  a  Government  is 

good  then  they  shall  be  re-elected,  if  not  they  shall  be  easily  removed  after  three 

years.  

</span></div><div><span>When  I  look  at  the Amendment before us, I see four years, it does not  include the 

preference  of  my  people  for  three  years.  If  I  support  this  Amendment,  then  I  am 

</span><span>ignoring the views of my people. This is the first reason </span><span>why I don’t agree with this. 

</span><span>I  got  the  views of my people and their decision is  for three years.  I told them my 

view and that of my Party, the Democratic Alliance Party, which is for four years but 

their decision was three years.   

</span></div><div><span>The second reason I do not support this Amendment is because this Parliament did 

not have confidence in two of the Members of the Commission and one of those who 

did  not  support  them  was  the  Member  of  the  Overseas  seat.  We  rejected  two 

members of this  Commission but now we are accepting a recommendation in their 

</span><span>Report. I am confused by this sort of behaviour. We reject two of these people, two 

</span><span>of whom had a vital part to play in this Report. I am reluctant to support this Bill but 

I am afraid I must or I will be going against the will of my bosses. Mr Speaker, the 

</span><span>General Election is getting closer. If we, Members of Parliament don’t listen to the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1767 

</span></div><div><span>voices  of  our  people,  who  are our bosses, then we will not  be voted back in.  I am 

only following the orders of my bosses.  The Amendment is okay but the number of 

years is not -  it is four and not three.   

</span></div><div><span>I will await and listen to the views of other Members. I will see if they had listened 

to their bosses or not and then, I will decide if I should support this Amendment or 

not. This is all I have to say, Mr Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?   

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister for Health, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I also rise to give my 

support to this Constitution Amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, listening to what the Honourable Member for Rakahanga was saying, I 

am very happy, in a sense, to see that they have now thought about the term issue. I 

will  be  looking  forward  to  their  Manifesto  including  the  three-year  term  as  one  of 

</span><span>their  policies.  Well,  Mr  Speaker,  it’s  a  change  of  heart  from  a  five  year  term  to  a 

</span><span>three  year  term  because  the  Cook  Islands  Party  Government  had  a  four  year  term 

when they were in Government. It was the Government of the Honourable Member 

of Rakahanga that changed the Parliamentary term to a five years.  I was wondering 

whether  the  Honourable  Member  went  and  saw  his  boss  at  the  time  to  ask  them 

whether they wanted a five year term? 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I am a bit sceptical of what he </span><span>is saying and calling his people ‘boss’, on 

</span><span>the issue of the Parliamentary term. I like the explanation given by Dr Williams, the 

Honourable  Member  for  Overseas  -  </span><span>at  that  time  he  was  ‘boss’,  this  time  it  is  his 

people who are the ‘boss’!</span></div><div><span>The second point that I want to raise with regard to the comments of the Honourable 

Member,  is  his  confidence  in  this  Report  produced  by  the  Political  Review 

Commission.    If  he  has  that  much  confidence  then  read  the  review  given  by  that 

Report, it recommends a four year term only. They investigated a three, four and five 

year term but the final decision in the Report was a four-year term. They recommend 

a 4 year term. That is exactly what this Government is doing now. Furthermore, the 

</span><span>Government  is  putting it back to the people. Let them decide by Referendum what 

</span><span>they want, whether it will be a 5 year term or a 4 year term.  My personal preference 

is a 4 year term, but if my people, in Tupapa, wish to go for a 5 year term, then I go 

with them. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I think it is becoming obvious now that Government is trying to put into 

effect  some  of  the  genuine,  acceptable  recommendations  made  by  the  Political 

Review Committee. Given the restraints that we were given at  the time the Report 

was  handed  to  Parliament,  to  the  time  that  Parliament  will  be  dissolved,  we  are 

</span><span>trying  to  implement  as  many  of  the  recommendations  of  the  Political  Review 

</span><span>Committee  as  we  possibly  can.  Later  we  will  be  discussing  a  lot  of  Constitution 

Amendments. These are some of the amendments we feel necessary and essential to 

push  at  this  time.  Some  amendments  are  required  of  the  Electoral  Act  that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>1768 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Government will also be introducing.  I will stop my speech here, Mr Speaker, and I 

hope that support is forthcoming from Members of Parliament. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to you and your 

staff.  To  all  Honourable  Members,  and  especially  to  our  people  throughout  the 

country  greetings.  A  special  Kia  Orana to  you all this evening. I would like to  say 

greetings to you my people and to ask you to please be patient with all the criticism 

of me in this House. During these past days, Mr Speaker, the Honourable Members 

on the Government side - from the Honourable Prime Minister right down to all the 

Honourable  Members  in  this  House  criticised  me.  They  said  that  I  was  unkind, 

cruel...
