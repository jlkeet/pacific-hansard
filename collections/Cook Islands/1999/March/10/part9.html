<div><span>(COMMOTION IN THE HOUSE) 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Point of Order.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> I looked through this Bill we are debating, Mr Speaker, I 

cannot see anything that says anything about a crybaby. Mr Speaker, what I can hear 

is the Honourable Member being a crybaby. I would like to ask you to tell him not to 

be a crybaby. Tell him not to bring the Ngatangiia meeting he will be holding, into 

this House. Tell him to come back to the Bill before the House.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please  come  back  to  the  Bill  before  the  House,  Honourable 

Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>I tell you the truth, Mr Speaker, the people of Ngatangiia 

have  been  turning  their  radios  off  in  the  last  couple  of  days,  especially  when  they 

hear these criticisms against me. However, when they hear on their radios my voice 

returning fire at Government, they keep listening. 

</span></div><div><span>the  people.  Any  party 

</span></div><div><span>I stand, Mr Speaker, to give what the Democratic Party has already decided, in fact 

</span><span>this has leaked out.  I see there are spies in our Policy Committee. So I have to look 

</span><span>into this very seriously, Mr Speaker, to find out whom the spy is who revealed this to 

Government because this is a sudden move. Mr Speaker, this is a sudden move for 

the Government. There is no way for this Government to be moved into realising this 

Bill because this is just a simple bluff.  You see the Demo already have the feedback 

from 

the 

recommendations  of  the  Political  Review  Commission  that  will  be  the  party  the 

people will vote for. Well before the Political Review Commission was established, 

we  already  said  in  this  House  that  the  Cabinet  should  be  reduced.  We  said  many 

other things, such as the Leader of the House be abolished. All these things should 

be  adjusted  but  nobody  listened  to  us.    In  addition,  when  the  Commission  was 

established they did  a very good job.  Then we find there is a Motion in the House 

abusing  two  members  of  the  Commission.    The  majority  of  the  Government 

</span></div><div><span>the  election  supporting 

</span></div><div><span>that  goes 

</span></div><div><span>into 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1769 

</span></div><div><span>Members  voted against the very two people that they put  in  this Commission.  The 

Bill  in  front  of  the  House  today  is  a  result  of  some  recommendations  by  that  very 

Commission that they have no confidence in. So, I am very surprised, Mr Speaker, 

that  two  Constitutional  Amendments  are  the  result  of  this  Political  Review 

</span><span>Commission’s Report </span><span>- at this very last minute. They know it will not be activated 

now, it cannot be implemented now because it will need 90 days.  So who are they 

kidding?    So  who  are  they  trying  to  bluff  into  believing  that  they  are  doing 

something  good?  It  is  too  late.  The people have already made up their minds that 

they are going to vote this Government out. The people have already decided that the 

Party  who  supports  the  recommendations  of  the  Political  Review  Commission, 

which  is  the  DAP  and  the  Party  which  is  going  to  reduce  the  spending  of  this 

country,  is  the  Party  that  they  are  going  to  vote  for.  We  should  not  demean  our 

people by trying to pull wool over their eyes. Government is trying to bluff them into 

believing  that  they  accept  the  recommendations  of  this  Commission.  They  are 

demeaning our people by doing this. They are bluffing by bringing this in at the last 

minute. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the views  presented by the Honourable Member of Parliament for the 

Island of Rakahanga, the Honourable Papa Pupuke Robati, are good ones. They are 

the best views because this is what his people have told him. It is not something that 

he  has  thought  up  himself  and  brought  into  this  House.  It  is  what  his  people  have 

told him.  Personally, I think if our people say that 4 years is not good enough, that 

they  want  3  years,  then  I  will  agree  with  that.  Mr  Speaker,  in  the  case  of  a  3  year 

term,  because  it  is  only  a  short  period,  this  will  ensure  that  we,  as  Members  of 

Parliament, will work very hard. We know that if we do not do very well, we will be 

out  in  a  very  short  period.    I  want  the Democratic Party Government  to  know that 

when they go in as Government, they only have a short period to do their work.  

</span></div><div><span>This  introduction of this  Bill  to  reduce the term  to  four years has been done under 

duress.  Government  brought  this  in  here  because  it  was  a  recommendation  by  the 

Commission.  Mr  Speaker,  this  Report  was  not  written  just  today. This  Report was 

written  the  same  time  as  the  recommendation  that  Cabinet  be  reduced  to  seven 

Members.  These  amendments  for  the  reduction  of  the  number  of  Members  in 

Cabinet  and  the  appointment  of  a  Minister  from  outside  of  Parliament  are  in 

amendment No. 23. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Bring your debate back to the subject, Honourable Member.</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR.  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>We  ask  ourselves  -  are  these  all  the  recommendations 

written  in  the  Report?  We  see  </span><span>in  the  Political  Review  Commission’s  Report  that 

</span><span>there  is  a  recommendation  for  a  reduction  of  Cabinet  but  the  second  part  is  not  in 

that  Report.  We  have  already  agreed  to  most  of  the  recommendations  of  the 

Commission.  The  reduction  of  Cabinet,  we  have  already  accepted  that  long  before 

this Report was written. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:    </span><span>Point  of  Order,  Mr  Speaker.  193,  Mr  Speaker.  We  are  not 

</span><span>dealing with the Commission of Inquiry’s Report...</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>It is part of this. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>1770 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span> ... we are dealing with the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Will the Honourable Member please take your seat, there is a Point 

of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:    </span><span>There  is  an  appropriate  time  to  raise  the  issue  he  is  talking 

about. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  The Point of Order is relevant 

Honourable Member so please come back to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I hear the CIP saying that it was the Demo 

who changed the Parliamentary term from 4 to 5 years. The truth Mr Speaker is, it 

was  prepared  by  the  Cook  Islands  Party  Government  but  it  was  enacted  when  the 

Demo came in.  

</span></div><div><span>If  we  look  back  in  the  records,  Mr  Speaker,  we  will  find  this  process  was  started 

during the administration of the Cook Islands Party Government.  They are trying to 

</span><span>blame  the  Democratic  Party  Government  for  this.  Let’s  not  start  Coca  Cola</span><span>-ing 

</span><span>around.  I  can’t  support  something  like  this,  Mr  Speaker,  because  I  can  see  the 

</span><span>principle  behind  bringing  this  amendment  in  the  House  is  not  a  good  one.    Our 

people  can  see  this  also  because  they  know  this  cannot  be  enacted  in  the  time  we 

have left.  The real desire for a reduction to 4 years is not there. The purpose of this 

is  to  give  our  people  the  impression  that  the  Government  is  making  an  attempt  to 

make  a  reduction  although  our  people  know  that  this  is  not  real  because  it  is  not 

</span><span>possible in the time which we have left. This is why I can’t support something like 

</span><span>this because if the amendment had been brought in at the same time as the No. 23 

Amendment,  which  reduces  the  numbers  of  Cabinet,  then  we  could  believe  it  is 

being  done  for  a  good  purpose.  Nevertheless,  it  is  O.K.  if  we  put  this  through  the 

House now because when we come in as Government it will be easy for us to finish 

it. If our people tell us they want 3 years, we will follow their wishes. This is why we 

have always said in this House - whatever our people tell us at a referendum, we will 

do it. 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to other recommendations made by the Commission, it will be an easy 

task for us to carry out if we were in Government. If we were in Government today, 

we would have carried out all those recommendations. Therefore, on the issue of a 

reduction in  the term  of Parliament from  five years to  four years, this Government 

the  Co</span><span>mmission’s  Report 

</span><span>is  not  a  result  of 

stole  our 

recommendations,  no.  It  is  something  they  have  thought  up  to  today.  Had  they 

thought of it earlier, they would have included it in Amendment No. 23.  

</span></div><div><span>idea.  This  Bill 

</span></div><div><span>When we finish talking, that will be the end. I do not want you people standing up 

and wasting time by talking about things you have made up. Even if you try to con 

</span><span>our people, they will not be conned. Have you not heard the message, “it’s time for a 

</span><span>change”?.  Yes.  If  you  have  not  heard that then that’s your problem.  Therefore, Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, it  is  Democratic Party policy to  reduce the Parliamentary term to 4 years, 

but if the people wants 3 years, we will go with that.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1771 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore my people, I want you to listen carefully to what these people are saying 

about  us.  They  have  no  commitments  on  this  Amendment.  Instead,  they  are 

criticising me. When you hear them start criticising me, turn off your radios. Thank 

you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Minister, Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  to  the  staff  of  the 

Legislative  Services.    Kia  Orana  to  our  Prime  Minister  and  Members  on  the 

Government side, the Leader of the Opposition and your Members on the Opposition 

side. Mr Speaker, I would like at this stage, to give a special Kia Orana to the people 

of Ngatangiia, to the people of Tongareva and to all the people throughout the Cook 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The  reason,  Mr  Speaker,  that  I  am  giving  this  special  Kia  Orana  to  our  people 

throughout  the  Cook  Islands  is  because  of  this  very  Amendment  Bill  before  this 

House  this  evening.    Mr  Speaker,  in  support  of  this  very  important  Bill  before 

Parliament tonight, I would like to point out to the nation that this is one of a series 

of  Amendments  to  the  Constitution.  One  of  a  series  of  Amendments  to  the 

Constitution  Mr  Speaker,  that  is  following  amendment  No.  23  which  is  already 

before the House and later on tonight, we will be touching on Number 25.  You see, 

Mr  Speaker,  if  we  go  back  to  Amendment  No.  23,  we  talk  about  a  reduction  of 

Cabinet  in  that  Amendment.    That  amendment  to  the Constitution arose out  of the 

recommendation  by  the  Political  Review  Commission.  The  Political  Review 

Commission was the vehicle used for the people of this country to speak to us in this 

House.  It  was  the  Political  Review  Commission,  Mr  Speaker,  that  was  devised  by 

this Government to go out to the people and reach out to them to find out what it is 

that they need and what direction they want the country to move.  Mr Speaker, they 

went out and met the people of this country.  They came back, made their Report and 

sent their recommendations to this Government. One of those recommendations, Mr 

Speaker,  was  to  reduce  the  size  of  Cabinet  and  that  was  the  Amendment  No.23, 

which  is  awaiting  its  Third  Reading.  Should  we  get  the  majority  it  will  be  put 

through the House. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Amendment  before  the  House  today,  Mr  Speaker,  is  also  a  result  of  another 

recommendation  which  was  made  by  that  Political  Review  Commission  to  reduce 

the  term  of  this  Parliament.    It  is  obvious  Mr  Speaker,  if  you  look  at  the 

recommendation  itself,  the  people  are  speaking  to  us  to  reduce  the  term  of 

Government and this is exactly what this Government is doing. That is exactly why 

this Bill is before this House tonight. 

</span></div><div><span>I find it rather strange Mr Speaker, that the Leader of the Opposition says that they 

</span><span>support this.  He also said that we have stolen it from their Manifesto and this is all 

</span><span>bluff, for the Bill to be introduced first before the Referendum is made. Mr Speaker, 

the law requires the Bill to be introduced to the House first.  The next step to follow 

that  process,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  it  is  put  to  the  people  through  a  Referendum,  for 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>1772 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>them  to  make  their  choice.  This  is  the  process  of  law  that  this  Government  is 

following. I am not surprised, Mr Speaker, when the Leader of the Opposition says 

that we have stolen this issue from their Manifesto, or they had already made up their 

minds  to  implement  it.    I  would  ask  these  people  in  Ngatangiia  and  the  people 

throughout  the  Cook  Islands.  Why  did  he  not  support  No.23  Amendment,  i.e. 

reduction in  Cabinet when the Bill was put to the House?  He did not support that 

Amendment before the House and it is my submission to the people of this country 

that he will also not support this one, even if it was not too late. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr speaker, I am sure that my people in Tongareva would be very happy indeed with 

the Amendment that was been brought before the House.  I have already said so in 

this  House,  Mr  speaker,  that  they  support  the  recommendations  of  the  Political 

Review Commission which was placed before Government. 

</span></div><div><span>And  before  I  take  my  seat,  Mr  Speaker,  I  was  just  wondering  whether  there  was 

confusion  on  the  part  of  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati  about  the  4 

years  and  the  3  years  reduction  in  the  Parliamentary  term,  just  as  he  was  with  the 

Coca-Cola and </span><span>kokekoke</span><span> billboards? 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:</span><span>  Mr  Speaker,  Greetings  to  you,  Greetings  to  your  staff, 

Greetings  to  Honourable  Members  of  the  House  and  Greetings  to  our  people 

listening this evening. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, Mr Speaker, I find it more pleasant  at  this time rather than having to sit in 

this  oven  during  the  daytime.  It  might  be  prudent,  Mr  Speaker,  that  you  consider 

something better than this for the future because it is indeed very hot during the day 

in this building. 

</span></div><div><span>For now, Mr Speaker, I rise to lend my support to the Bill. But before I comment on 

the Bill,  Mr Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for 

</span><span>acting like a real Opposition, like Her Majesty’s Royal Opposition should be acting.  

</span><span>But I’m not really sure, Mr Speaker, that the manner in which he acts and in which 

</span><span>he  acted tonight  was  becoming of Her Majesty</span><span>’s Royal  Opposition  because I liken 

</span><span>the  way  he  waded  through  his  speech  like  a  </span><span>pikiahara</span><span>  (cat).  Thank  you  (to  the 

interpreter),  so  you  understand  the  Manihikian  language  also?  He  was  scratching 

here and there, not really knowing where he was headed. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker let me make this point very clear. Well before the Review Commission 

came on the scene, this Government had gone to the people seeking their views on 

the Parliamentary term. So, give credit where credit is due. This Government should 

</span><span>be  credited  for  having  gone  out  well  before  the  Review  Commission  came  on  the 

</span><span>scene to seek views of our people what they needed for the Parliamentary term. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Hear, hear. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1773 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span>I’m talking, Mr Speaker, about the Referendum that ran at the 

</span><span>last elections, parallel with the last elections.  So, it is not as if it is a new issue.  No, 

no,  no.    This  Government  has  been  looking  at  it  for  a  long  time.  Unfortunately, 

maybe, due to the manner in which the Referendum was presented, we were not able 

to get a clear picture of what the people really needed. The choices were 3, 4, or 5 

year terms. Maybe that was the confusing part. Maybe if it were only two, like this 

Bill is addressing now, maybe we would have had a clearer answer from our people. 

I think, a point to note, Mr Speaker, is that, with the results that came back from the 

Referendum,  the  three-year,  the  four-year,  the  five-year,  if  we  took  them 

individually, there were more for the five-year term. However, if we put the four and 

the  three  together,  like  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Williams  earlier  said,  then  it 

would appear there was a majority desiring a lesser term. 

</span></div><div><span>With this Bill, Mr Speaker, the picture is very clear now. You have a choice of either 

one or the other, which means you have a choice of a four-year or a five-year term. I 

am sorry, Mr Speaker, I am actually presupposing to them what is going to happen in 

the  Referendum.    The  Bill  is  talking  about  four-years  but  I  understand  the 

Referendum in time, shall address that very issue. 

</span></div><div><span>I am sure that our people will be satisfied that this Government have come again to 

them to give them a second chance to seek their views and their opinions on the term 

of Parliament. If in time the people decide that they would need something less than 

four </span><span>years, then it’s their prerogative and their right to use the proper mechanism to 

</span><span>enhance and achieve that intention. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would remind our people that unlike what the Honourable Member, Dr 

Terepai Maoate said, this was just another political sweetener, it is not the case. I do 

not want to repeat it but the fact is, we have gone before to the people to seek their 

</span><span>views for the term of Parliament. This is not the first time. Of course, it is easy, it’s 

</span><span>easy for the Honourable Leader of the Oppositi</span><span>on to say now, that while he’s in the 

Opposition, that they will change things to suit the people’s wishes. It is so easy for 

him to say that now.  However, I feel if he gets in the driver’s seat, I think it will be a 

</span><span>different story. And the reason I say that, Mr Speaker, like the Honourable Minister, 

Tepure Tapaitau said earlier, it was they, them, he was part of it. They brought in the 

five-year term,  not  this Government,  but  that side of the House when they were in 

</span><span>Government.  I  only  wish,  when  he  was  speaking  that  we  had  not  done  away  with 

</span><span>Standing Order 191, because I would have called him to verify the very statement he 

was  making.  Well,  Mr  Speaker,  once  again  I  support  the  Bill  before  the  House.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member from Nukuroa, Tangata Vavia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VAVIA:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Greetings to you and Greetings to all staff 

</span><span>Members  in  this House. Greetings to the Prime Minister and to all the Honourable 

</span><span>Members on the Government side and to the Leader of the Opposition and Members 

on  the  Opposition  side.    Greetings  to  you  all  this  evening.  Greetings  also  to  our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>1774 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>people  listening  in  this  evening,  in  particular  to  my  people  in  Nukuroa.  You  will 

realise that this is the first time we have sat at night for a long time.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  stand  to  give  my  support  to  the  Amendment  Bill  that  is  before  the 

House.  I consider it a very important Amendment since it is an Amendment to the 

Constitution  and  not  an  ordinary  Amendment  or  enactment.  In  addition,  it  is  right 

that this Amendment be put to our people in a Referendum. Mr Speaker, we heard 

previous  speakers  talking  about  this  particular  Amendment.  Some  even  brought  in 

the  rumbles  that  their  people  preferred  a  three-year  term,  and  yet  Mr  Speaker,  the 

Political  Review  Commission  have  gone  out  to  these  islands  and  obtained  their 

views on this particular issue and other issues as well.  As a result of those findings, 

they  reported  to  Parliament  recommending  a  four-year  term.  This  Government 

brought  in  this  Bill  in  support  of  that  recommendation.  This  is  the  result  of  the 

Political  Review  Commission  -  they  went  out  to  the  people  to  ask  for their views, 

which  they  then  presented  to  Parliament  in  their  Report.  In  addition,  Government, 

through following the proper procedures, produced the Bill to make that possible. Mr 

Speaker,  I  would 

this 

recommendation from the people through the Political Review Commission. Let us 

leave it with the people.  

</span></div><div><span>the  Political  Parties  not  hijack 

</span></div><div><span>recommend 

</span></div><div><span>that 

</span></div><div><span>We may have thought of the same idea, but if each Political Party has agreed to the 4 

year term then that is their thinking. However, this Bill is not introducing politics. It 

is  bringing  in  what  the  Review  Commission  has  recommended.  In  accordance  to 

proper procedures, the Bill has to be introduced into Parliament prior to Referendum. 

Mr  Speaker,  this  Government  has  been  fair,  and  not  only  that,  this  Government 

wants  to  be  seen  to  be  fair,  to  give  this  back  to  the  people.  I  stand  behind  that 

decision by the Go</span><span>vernment. Let’s not go on into the Third Reading of the Bill. Give 

</span><span>it back, once we have finished with the principles, leave it there and give it back to 

the people to make up their own minds. I support what the Prime Minister asked this 

House earlier on, </span><span>let’s not tell the people what to do. Let us be fair. Let us not hijack 

</span><span>this  idea  from  the  Political  Review  Commission,  from  the  people  of  the  Cook 

Islands.  Those are my views, Mr Speaker. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Mama Mau 

Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Greetings to all of you in Parliament tonight, and Greetings 

</span><span>also  to  our people who are listening in to our debate. Mr Speaker, I will not speak 

long.  I  rise  to  support  the  Constitutional  Amendment,  reducing  the  Parliamentary 

term  from  5  to  4  years.      I  would  prefer  3  years,  but  4  years  is  what  has  been 

recommended  so  I  support  that.  At  least  our  people  can  see  we  are  making  some 

effort to make things better for our country. In the interests of progress, I support the 

Ame</span><span>ndment before us so we don’t keep on debating this issue. Kia Orana. </span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

</span><span>Honourable Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Greetings to you, Mr Speaker, on this cool evening. Greetings 

also  to  all  Honourable  Members  of  the  House,  and  to  all  our  people  listening  in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1775 

</span></div><div><span>tonight. Mr Speaker, may I seek your leave to send my greetings to the island of my 

birth, to my people of Manihiki, because they are only able to receive Cook Islands 

radio at night. Greetings to the all the people of Manihiki. To the </span><span>aronga mana</span><span> on 

the island of Manihiki,  to  the various churches on the island, as well as our young 

people,  greetings  to  you  all.  It  will  not  be  long  before  I  get  there.  We  shall  meet 

again next week.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  stand  to  support  the  Bill  before  the  House  to  amend  the  term  of 

Parliament from 5 to 4 years. The Honourable Dr Williams have stated earlier, that 

there  was  a  Referendum  on  the  term  of  Parliament  in  1994.  He  correctly  said  that 

40% of the people voted for 5 years and 58% voted for less than 5 years. To me, the 

term  of  Parliament  should  have  been  reduced  to  four  years  after  that  referendum. 

While we may not  have had the two-thirds majority, when the question was put to 

the people we would have had the two-thirds majority if the right question had been 

put in the Referendum then. 

</span></div><div><span>According  to  the  Report  by  the  Political  Review  Commission,  there  was  a 

misreading of the result of the 1994 Referendum. Those are not my words, they are 

the words of the Political Review Commission. Even if the term of Parliament was 

not  reduced  then,  the  people  are  saying  we  want  a  shorter  term  of  Parliament.  

According to the Report, a current majority of people wants a three-year rather than a 

four-year  term.  That  is  what  the  majority  of  the  people  indicated  to  the  Political 

Commission.  I  have  no  problem  supporting  a  three-year  term  followed  by  a 

Referendum to establish whether the term should really be four or five years.  I want 

some  guarantees  from  Government  that  there  will  be  a  Referendum  at  the  coming 

election to determine the term of Parliament. It is sad, Mr Speaker, as stated earlier 

by the Leader of the Opposition, that this Parliament took a Vote of No Confidence 

in two Members of this Commission. This Parliament showed a lack of faith, now it 

has a change of heart and is accepting their recommendation. 

</span></div><div><span>A reference to the Leader of the Opposition as a </span><span>pikiahara</span><span> (cat in Manihikian) is not 

Parliamentary Mr Speaker. Because this animal can come back and eat its vomit. So, 

do  not  refer  to  my  Leader  as  a  </span><span>pikiahara.</span><span>Why  shouldn’t  my  Leader  be  kicking 

</span><span>around,  especially  as  he  has  been  criticised  so  strongly  these  past  few  days  in  this 

House?  I  compare  him  to  a  horse  bucking  around  because  of  the  criticisms.  The 

Honourable  Member  Tom  Marsters  is  saying  he  is  acting  like  a  proper  Opposition 

Leader.  Let me rephrase that - </span><span>it is Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition. Although there 

</span><span>was a Motion of No Confidence in some Members of the Commission for Political 

Review,  the  Government  has  shown  a  change  of  heart  by  accepting  their 

recommendations  -  I  accept  that.  That  is  a  fact  we  cannot  withdraw,  Mr  Speaker. 

Tonight I feel happy because we have accepted the call of our people to reduce the 

term  of  Parliament  -  in  spite  of  what  happened  to  those  Members  of  the  Political 

Review Commission.  

</span></div><div><span>As to the term of Parliament, our Party did write a four-year term in our Manifesto. I 

</span><span>would say, Mr Speaker, that it is a coincidence that you also have a four-year term.  I 

</span><span>strongly  support  this  Constitution  Amendment  No.  24  Bill  and  I  hope  that  it  will 

happen.  As I said, this is what our people are calling us for. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>1776 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Minister, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker  Kia  Orana  to  you  on  this  beautiful 

evening. To Honourable Members of the House, and to our people listening in to the 

discussions on this amendment Bill before the House tonight Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I shall start with a </span><span>pe’e</span><span> (chant) to start my support for the Bill. This is 

not the same as Coca-Cola-ing or </span><span>kokekoke. </span><span>This is saying</span><span>, ‘pana ki ko, pana ki ko, 

pana ki ko’</span><span>(jump here, jump there, jump everywhere). 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  take  us  back  to  1982  when  there  was  going  to  be  an  election.  In  1981, 

something happened that changed the Constitution of the country. The Government 

of the day was the Democratic Party Government, when the term of Parliament was 

changed  from  four  years  that  the  Cook  Islands  Party  introduced,  to  five  years. 

Therefore, the election was not held in 1982 it was held in 1983, the first year I came 

into  Parliament.    In  1994,  the  Government  of  the  day  was  the  Cook  Islands  Party 

Government  and  it  went  back  to  the  people  to  seek  their  views  on  whether  they 

wanted a term of 3, 4 or 5 years for Parliament.  We heard the explanation made by 

the  Honourable  Member  Dr  Robert  Woonton,  that  they  could  not  get  a  two-thirds 

majority from the people in order that a Constitution Amendment is made.   

</span></div><div><span>However, what the Honourable Member was not able to explain is the present five-

year term. That is what is in the Constitution today  - a five-year term. If there was 

anything that this Government did wrong at the time, it was to put 3, 4, and 5 year 

terms together in the Referendum.  This is probably why a two-thirds majority could 

not  be  achieved.  What  his  Leader  has  been  saying  is,  that  this  issue  is  not  certain, 

</span><span>that there is a lot of doubt about it. This is just an effort to try to muddle the people’s 

</span><span>minds because this is an election year. We have to go back and look at the law we 

</span><span>are  discussing.  We  can’t  make  a  law  then  call  for  a  Referendum.  We  cannot.  We 

can’t do that because if we did we would be forcing the people to follow the law that 

</span><span>we  already  made.    What  the  House  is  expected  to  do  tonight  is  show  we  are 

following  the  procedure  as  stipulated  by  the  law.  That  is  why  we  are  having  a 

referendum. It will be up to our people to decide whether we should stay with a five-

year term or change it to a four-year term of Parliament. If our people want to change 

</span><span>it to be a four-year term then we can come back into the House and change the law.  

</span><span>If  the  people  want  a  three-year  term  then  we  will  have  to  accept  the  wish  of  the 

people.   

</span></div><div><span>I heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say they have put it into their Manifesto.  

This,  I  believe  was  in  support  of  the  views  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  but  I 

think he put it a little bit lightly. What he was really saying was that we stole it. No, 

</span><span>no,  no.  It  wasn’t  only  in  1994  that  the  Cook  Islands  Party  Governmen</span><span>t  wanted  to 

have a look at the term of Parliament.  It was the Cook Islands Party who brought the 

</span><span>term  from  a  three-year  term  to  a  four-year  term  and  then  the  Democratic  Party 

</span><span>Government took it from a four year term to a five year term.  To say that we, the 

Cook Islands Party had stolen this is wrong. That is wrong.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1777 

</span></div><div><span>He was in this Government, Mr Speaker. Right from 1983, he was a Member of this 

Parliament.  I  am  saying  this  so  that  my  people  in  Mauke  can  hear.  This  is  not 

something that we took from them. No. This has always been the policy of the Cook 

Islands Party Government ever since the beginning and he took it to the Democratic 

Alliance Party.  He took it to them and this is why my </span><span>pe’e</span><span>said ‘pana ki ko, pana ki 

ko, pana ki ko’</span><span>.  You don’t know where</span><span>you are. What I am saying now is don’t give 

</span><span>somebody a shovel during the rainy weather because you will be shovelling worms. 

</span><span>We should know, but some of us don’t, that if we go back and start digging up the 

</span><span>past it is us, ourselves, that we are criticising. 

</span></div><div><span>There  is  also  the  issue that this Government  supported a No Confidence Vote in  a 

couple  of  Members  of  that  Commission  but  that  is  wrong.    What  the  Members  of 

Government supported on that day was No Confidence in that Report.  I tell you why 

I supported that move because if you look  at that Political Report, there is nothing 

mentioned that they have sourced the views of my people in Mauke.  Nothing.  So I 

asked in this House that day, whose Report is this? Is this the Report of some people 

in the Cook Islands or all of the people in the Cook Islands? That is why I voted for 

</span><span>that Motion.  It wasn’t a vote of No Confidence in the Members but in the Report.  I 

</span><span>am  still  standing  today  concerned  about  it  because  my  island  was  left  out  of  this 

Report.    Why  did  they  waste  the  money  that  was  allocated  by  this  Parliament  for 

</span><span>them to go to the island? They just went to eat the food on the island and they didn’t 

</span><span>write anything that the people said. This is why I am saying to you now, what I said 

on that day was that I did not support a No Confidence Vote in the Members of the 

Commission  but  in  the  Report  itself  because  my  people  were  not  included  in  that 

Report. 

</span></div><div><span>I  was  quite  surprised,  because  on  the  day  that  we  put  in  the  Amendment  for  the 

reduction of Cabinet from nine to between five and seven, I would like to say, with 

due respect to the Honourable Member, Dr Robert Woonton, that you were not in the 

House at the time.  You were on the island of Manihiki but we know he will support 

it, but for his Leader to come in here today to say that he supported everything, yet 

he  did  not.    For  that  matter,  he  voted  against  it,  I  was  informed  by  the  Advocate-

General. 

</span></div><div><span>So I was just asking in closing who then is trying to pull the wool over our people’s 

</span><span>eyes?  It  is  certainly  not  this  Government  because  it  has  always  been  this 

</span><span>Government’s  philosophy  to  go  back  to  the  people  and  seek  their  views.    Nothing 

</span><span>much  has  changed  in  the  policy  of  this  Government  all  the  way  through  - 

Government  for  the  people  by  the  people.    It  may  have  taken  longer  than  we 

anticipated because of the process of seeking the views and the understanding of our 

</span><span>people.  It  certainly  wasn’t  brought  in  suddenly  into  this  House  simply  because  a 

</span><span>General Election is coming around the corner. There are various other circumstances 

warranting us to go back to get the thoughts and the feelings of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, the purpose for this Bill before the House tonight, Mr Speaker is to give 

</span><span>this Parliament the authority to go back to our people by way of a Referendum and to 

</span><span>find out what our people want. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>1778 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>With those comments, Mr Speaker, I stand to support the Constitution Amendment 

No.24 before the House. That is submitting a referendum to the people to determine 

whether  we  stay  on  five  years  as  the  law  says  or  come  back  to  four  years.    Thank 

you, Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you,  Kia  Orana  also  to  all 

Honourable Members in the House this evening. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise, Mr speaker, to give my support to this Constitution Amendment because this 

Bill,  Mr  Speaker,  as  we  can  see  is  to  repeal  an  Article  in  our  Constitution  to 

substitute it with a new Article. However, because we have pride to dissect this in all 

sorts  of  different  ways,  this  has  now  become  a  big  issue.    This  is  the  reason  the 

Opposition is saying that they are being criticised.  The real reason is that they have 

come in from the side of the House instead of coming in through the front door. My 

colleague, the Leader of the Opposition is telling his people in Ngatangiia that he is 

being  criticised  by  Government  Members.    I  think  if  he  really  thinks  about  it 

carefully  enough  he  will  realise  that  he  is  criticising  himself.    The  parable  tells  us 

that whatever you sow that is  what  you will reap.  If you sow bad things, you will 

reap bad things.  If you sow good things, you will reap good things.  I think if we 

understand this parable, if we understand this verse, then we will understand that we 

are beating ourselves up, we are criticising ourselves. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise,  Mr  Speaker,  because  I  have  a  few  problems  with  what  has  been  said.    The 

Leader of the Opposition said that the people know for sure who they will vote for in 

the next election. He said he had no doubt, he was certain that the people are quite 

sure who they will vote for in the next election.  If he is so sure, look at Amuri and 

Ureia,  there  is  no  candidate.  If  he  is  so  certain,  then  why  has  he  not  been  there  to 

confirm who the candidate will be for the constituency of Amuri/Ureia? That is why 

he is saying that he is being criticised in this House. It was not us criticising him, it 

was himself. Not only him, but also other Members of the Opposition side who said 

that when we get in power this is what we are going to do. The C.I.P. side do not do 

that because this is not campaign time. We are still controlling Parliament.  There is 

</span><span>a saying, “don’t blow the horn before the bread is cooked”.   This is a proverb from 

</span><span>our  elders,  from  a  wise  person.  A  wise  person  does  not  blow  the  horn  before  the 

</span><span>bread is cooked.  

</span></div><div><span>The Bill before the House is plain and clear. There is nothing to doubt about it.  The 

Members  of  the  Opposition  need  to  know  that  it  is  the  usual  procedure  by  this 

Government  that  such  Acts  that  needs  to  be  implemented,  must  be  referred  to  the 

</span><span>people first. This is what this Government is doing, ‘People First’.  In addition, their 

slogan  is  ‘People  First’,  but  they  do  not  understand  why  they  say  that.  The 

</span><span>Government never forgets the people. We always get the people involved when we 

</span><span>are  making  laws  for  this  country.    The  Government  of  today  has  always  chosen 

</span><span>‘people  first’  since  they  started  politics.  Therefore,  when  you  say  something,  be 

certain that you understand what you are saying so that you won’t</span><span> get shot at. I hope 

my  people  who  are  listening  in  from  Aitutaki  are  enjoying  me  as  I  speak  tonight. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 36</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1779 

</span></div><div><span>This is what they usually do. They ring each other to say, ‘he’s on the radio’ so they 

</span><span>can all tune in to listen to me talking.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Honourable Member is saying that he is certain. He is so sure about 

it.  Then  when  different  Members  of  the  Opposition  stand  to  speak,  they  have 

different ideas from each other. Why is that? This means the Leader does not support 

his Members and his Members do not support him. They have different views. 

</span></div><div><span>When  we  talk  about  the  Report  by  this  Commission  that  was  presented  to 

Parliament,  I  was  suspicious  of  this  Report.  I  believe  that  my  suspicions  is  always 

right  which  is  why  I  am  saying  so.  The  Government  is  not  like  other  parties  in 

making  hasty  decisions.  The  Government  may  have  grumbled  a  little  but  it  went 

</span><span>ahead  and  accepted  the  Report  of  this  Political  Commission.  Don  ‘t  say  that  your 

</span><span>idea was stolen by Government. No. Why did you put this in the Manifesto, when is 

that going to be implemented?  What this Government is doing, is to put everything 

to  the  people  for  the  people  to  make  the  decision,  then  Government  follows  their 

wishes.  I  like  the  comments  of  Honourable  Dr  Pupuke  Robati  when  he  said  he 

always  refer  </span><span>to  the  ‘boss’  before  he  does  anything.  This  is  the  first  time  this 

Honourable Member has ever referred to his people as ‘boss’. In the past, they were 

his  servants  but  tonight  he  has  referred  to  them  many  times  as  ‘boss’.  Maybe  he 

</span><span>heard something that is why he is elevating his people.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, that is why I stood up - to ask Members to stand up and prove to us that 

their people will re-elect them. There is a tale about two warriors where one warrior 

</span><span>called  out  to  the  other,  ‘come  to  the deep’ and the  other warrior said  ‘come to  the 

shallow’. What I am saying to them is come to the deep, this is where I am. If he is a 

</span><span>warrior,  come  out  of  the  shadows,  come  into  the  open.  Mr  Speaker,  that  is  all.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Mr Speaker, to round up what we have debated over the 

radio  for  our  people  to  hear.  Before,  we  close  the  debate  on  this  Bill  before  us,  I 

would like to say a few things with regards the comments made by the Honourable 

Leader  of the Opposition.  I am  happy to  speak now in  this House, Mr Speaker, so 

</span><span>that he won’t say that I have criticised him behind his back. He always criticises me 

</span><span>strongly behind my back. He said that we had a lot of time to bring this Amendment 

</span><span>before, yet we decided to bring it at the last minute. He said that the Report of the 

Commission of Political Review was presented a long time ago, why did we have to 

wait till now to present this Bill. He is trying to sway the people into believing this.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  when  Parliament  was  sitting  in-camera,  to  discuss  the  Report  by  the 

Political Review Commission, this was the main view of the Opposition. Let us not 

rush  into  implementing  these  recommendations.    That  was  the  main  thrust  of  his 

view  from  that  meeting.  It  was  agreed  that  a  Referendum  should be organised and 

</span><span>presented  to  our  people.  Mr  Speaker,  this  meeting  was  held  in  November.  Since 

</span><span>November we have had the idea - </span><span>it didn’t happen yesterday or today.  Look how he 

</span><span>is trying to sway the </span><span>thoughts of our people, I can’t do that kind of thing. He can. We 

</span><span>agreed to do this and now he is accusing us of waiting until the last minute. What is 

</span></div><div><a>Page 37</a></div><div><span>1780 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>this  kind  of  behaviour  -  to  sow  the  seeds  of  doubt  in  our  people?  He  knows  that 

when we closed our meeting last year, we went through a holiday period. Not only 

were  we  on  holiday  from  Parliament,  the  Public  Service  was  also  on  holiday.  The 

people  whose  responsibility  it  is  to  prepare  the  Bills  for  presentation  before  the 

House  was  all  on  leave.  When  they  returned,  they  looked  into  the  spirit  of  the 

Constitution  to  see  what  it  was  really  saying.  The  law  had  been  amended  by  the 

Democratic Government in 1982 to make it difficult to amend.  

</span></div><div><span>In  1982  there  was  an  Amendment  to  Article    37  of  the  Constitution  by  the 

Democratic Party. It was Papa Tom and the Honourable Member Pupuke Robati. It 

was they who created that law which made it difficult  to  change the Parliamentary 

term  today.  I  picked  up  the  view  by  The  Honourable  Tom  Marsters,  who  is  the 

General Secretary of the Cook Islands Party. The objection to the view expressed by 

the Leader of the Opposition, that the Cook Islands Party has just decided to create 

this Bill. In 1981, the Democratic Party Government changed the life of Parliament 

from four to five years.  There were three members of the Cook Islands Party who 

were in  the House at the time: the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister Ngereteina 

Puna and myself. We objected that the Democratic Party Government had not put it 

to Referendum for the people.  Outside our objections, there was a petition and 3,500 

citizens of the Cook Islands signed that petition objecting to a change of the term of 

Parliament  from  four  to  five  years.  That  same  year,  at  the  Cook  Islands  Party 

Conference,  Mr  Speaker,  the  Cook  Islands  Party  under  my  leadership,  drew  the 

conclusion, made a resolution that they would put the issue of the term of Parliament 

to  the  country.    There are three Members of that Parliament that day who are here 

today  sitting  on  the  Government  side.  We  opposed  the  change  from  four  to  five 

years. The Cook Islands Party conference of 1981 and the conference of 1982 again 

promulgated the resolution that the term of Parliament is an issue for the people to 

decide,  not  for  Members  of  Parliament.    When  the  Honourable  Member,  Terepai 

Maoate, joined the Cook Islands Party in 1983 he knew that was a clear policy of the 

Cook  Islands  Party.  We  knew  the  problem  we  went  through  in  1983.  There  was 

nothing we could do that year. Even after we became the Government we could not 

b</span><span>ring  the  issue  to  the  General  Election  in  1989,  we  weren’t  in  Government  at  that 

</span><span>time. The next opportunity to bring this issue before the people, at the least cost to 

the country was in the General Election of 1994. And that is exactly what we did. 

</span></div><div><span>If the Democratic Party had been genuine in  their wish for a reduction of the term 

from 5 to 4 years they could have brought a private Members bill to the House, as 

was once done by the Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. It is the Democratic 

Party now who are listening to the voice of the people. We have heard it since 1981.  

They  are  the  ones  who  are  changing  their  tune,  they  are  changing  their  tune  only 

because  they  want  to  take  our  seats.  To  take  over  our  benches.  That  is  the  only 

reason, not because they really believe in it but because it is one trick they can pull 

on the people to become Government.  I say, Mr Speaker, I give fair warning to the 

people,  you  know  what  those  people  are  like,  you  know  what  their  policy  was, 

beware their sudden change of tune. You know them by their fruits. Therefore, Mr 

</span><span>Speaker I am making it quite clear that this Party has stood for a four-year term since 

</span><span>1981, since the Democratic Party chose to unilaterally, without consulting the people 

of the country, to change their own term from four to five years. When I challenged 

Government, as Leader of the Opposition of the time, here is a comment made by the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 38</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1781 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati, who has left the House for this debate. ‘We 

</span><span>accepted  the  Constitution  in  1965,  why  should  we  have  to  go  back  to  the  people 

</span><span>again?’ he said.  Oh, today what did we hear? The ‘boss’. You must go to the ‘boss’. 

</span><span>Have you noticed the quick change in tune.  Oh, there was a very fine young man at 

</span><span>the time, he saw this and called them “Oh ye hypocrites!”. Yes, remember the ‘boss’ 

that is what he is saying. However, in 1981, he said, ‘why should we have to go back 

</span><span>to the people when they have already accepted the Constitution and the right for us 

</span><span>to decide how to govern?’  Lest he has forgotten what he</span><span> said, I encourage him to go 

back and check the Hansard.  He was sitting next to Papa Tom, I was sitting on the 

other side, and almost where Aunty Mau is sitting now, that is where I sat and fought 

that change to the Constitution.   

</span></div><div><span>So, don’t come with th</span><span>is new trick, trying to suggest that we have changed our tune. 

No, Mr Speaker, they are the ones who changed their tune. The people out there are 

listening to the discord, and they are saying you are changing your tune because you 

are frightened of us. And you want to buy our votes because all you want to do is to 

become the Government. They will change their colour, they will appear black, Mr 

Speaker, if that is what is required to get into Government. To the extent that they 

are  saying  now,  if  the  people  want  three  years  we  will  accept  that.  Why?    Only 

because they want to be the Government. That is what the people must judge them 

by.  They  have  no  principles,  they  have  only  one  objective  in  mind,  anything  else 

does not matter, they will do anything just to be the Government. He went so far, Mr 

Speaker,  as  to  tell  this  House  that  the  idea  of  going  from  four  to  five  years  was  a 

Cook Islands Party idea and they were simply implementing it. What an outrageous 

lie. It is unfair to us, the Members of the House and to our people listening in, that 

another  Member  of  the  House  makes  that  sort  of  outrageous  lie.  I  wish  the 

Honourable Member, Pupuke Robati was here, and then he could turn around to his 

</span><span>leader and say ‘okay boss’. </span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Woonton sai</span><span>d, ‘in 1994 you got a result that said that 

58%  wanted  a  shorter  term  of  Parliament’.  He  hooked  onto  the  same  band  wagon 

</span><span>built  by  the  Leader.  Then,  it  is  one  of  those  wobbly  little  band  wagons that barely 

moves,  he  hopped  on  joyfully  and  then  said  to  Gover</span><span>nment,  “That  is  when  you 

should have changed the term of Government because 58% said change it”. Again, 

</span><span>just  like  the  other  day,  the  good  doctor  has  demonstrated  his  ignorance  of 

Constitutional  procedures.  However, I give him fair warning, if he does not  know 

</span><span>the procedure don’t claim knowledge of it. Oh they know the procedure, they know 

</span><span>the procedure. You see the procedure is quite clear.  The group that he is supporting 

was the ones who set the procedure in 1982 and that procedure is exactly what we 

are  following  right  now.  Then  his  Leader  demonstrated  his  ignorance  of 

</span><span>Constitutional procedures as well.  Why don’t you bring 23, 24 and 25 all together, 

</span><span>all three amendments?  Why did you bring them separately?  The fact of the matter is 

24 had to come in the form that it is today because that is what is prescribed by the 

</span><span>Constitution. It cannot come in any other shape.  It can’t come as part of any other 

</span><span>amendment.  For  some  inexplicable  reason,  you  have  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition 

</span><span>who does not know the Constitutional procedure and one prominent Member of his 

</span><span>team,  the  Honourable  Dr  Woonton  himself  demonstrated  an  ignorance  of  the 

Constitutional procedures of this country.

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  The Prime Minister is referring 

to  my  Deputy  Leader  in  Opposition  and  myself  as  ignorant  of  the  Constitutional 

procedures. All the things he is trying to say is to run us down as if he knows better, 

and  we  don</span><span>’t.    In  addition,  my  Point  of  Order  of  course,  Mr  Speaker,  is  personal 

</span><span>reflection.    If  anyone  is  to  be  run  down  in  this  House,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is  him 

mismanaging the affairs of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Here we go.  Here we go. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> He is not my judge to judge me on what I know. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> That is not a Point of Order, Honourable Member.  It is a Point of 

Explanation.  Continue, Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span>Thank you, Mr speaker.  I don’t withdra</span><span>w my comments 

about  their ignorance of the procedures of the Constitution because they have both 

demonstrated that tonight. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the debate on Amendment No.24 be Adjourned to the meeting of  

the next Parliament after the Bill has been presented to the voters  

of this nation by way of a Referendum 

</span></div><div><span>Just speaking very briefly to that Motion, Mr Speaker, I want it known in this House 

that it is the intention of this Government to take the Bill that we have before us to 

the Polls to be run together with the General Elections coming up later this year. The 

procedure of referring the Bill to the nation is a procedure that is fully supported by 

the  Cook  Islands  Party  Government  and  has  been  supported  by  the  Cook  Islands 

Party since 1981.  We have demonstrated our commitment to that policy in 1994 and 

</span><span>we  are  demonstrating  it  again  in  1999.    If  two-thirds  plus  of  the  voters  indicate to 

</span><span>this country, to this Parliament, its wish for a shorter term, this Government gives its 

commitment to give effect to that wish.  The problem that we, in Government, have 

struggled  with,  is  the  fact  that  we  cannot  ourselves  unilaterally  reduce  the  term  of 

Parliament. We cannot do it because the Constitution will not allow us to do it.  The 

relevant Article in the Constitution was entrenched by the Democratic Government 

by  way  of  a  procedure  that  cannot  be  escaped.  Therefore,  as  much  as  we  would 

prefer a four year term, if less than two-thirds of the people of this nation come forth 

for a four year term,  we will not  be able to  change the term  of Parliament to  four. 

</span><span>That is how difficult this particular Article is and how deeply entrenched it is in our 

</span><span>Constitution at the whim and the wish of the Democratic Party Government of 1982. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 40</a></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Prime Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Honourable Inatio Akaruru 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise, Mr Speaker, to present my 

views on this Motion because I hear the Motion by the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker, 

that  this  be  put  to  the  people  by  way  of  a  Referendum.  The  purpose  of  the 

Referendum is that the term of Parliament be reduced from five years to four years 

and he is also saying that an Amendment made by the Democratic Party Government 

to  the  Constitution  that  it  has  been  entrenched  and  cannot  be  amended.    I  am 

surprised with  this, Mr Speaker, because he has a two-thirds majority. Why did he 

not hold a Referendum for the people while he has been in Government because he 

has a two-thirds majority?  Why has he not  given a Referendum to the people and 

then find out the people wish?  He is showing us his ignorance, Mr Speaker, insofar 

as he does</span><span>n’t know what to do.  Therefore, who is ignorant, Mr Speaker?  So where 

</span><span>is  the power that he has because he has had a two-thirds majority in Parliament so 

why  has  he  not  been  able  to  make  an  Amendment  to  the  law  that  has  been 

</span><span>‘entrenched’, his words, ‘by the Democratic Party Government’.  </span></div><div><span>This is why I said earlier, Mr Speaker that this last minute issue brought up is just to 

try to show our people that they are trying to do something.  He has had a two-thirds 

</span><span>majority and I don’t see why he has not  been  </span><span>able to  make this amendment that is 

required. Why is he trying to make our people think otherwise?  No, no, no. He will 

probably  stand  up  and  say  that  there  has  not  been  enough  money  to  carry  out  this 

Referendum. He did not think that it was a bad thing to go into debt and to bring the 

country into the state that it is in today.  Because there was no money then he just sat 

back and was just quiet about it, but today he is trying to say that he knows it all. 

</span></div><div><span>Earlier  on,  Mr  Speaker,  I  rose  to  oppose  him  saying  that  I  am  ignorant  about  the 

procedures of the Constitution. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Please come back to the Motion, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>I  did  not  like  that,  Mr  Speaker,  because  he  did  not 

withdraw that statement. He was calling my Deputy Leader and me ignorant. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  That  was  not  a  Point  of  Order,  Honourable  Member.    It  was  a 

</span><span>Point  of  Explanation,  and  that  is  why  I  did  not  pull  down  the  Prime  Minister.  

Continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 41</a></div><div><span>1784 

</span></div><div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>This  is  why I rose, Mr Speaker, to  explain to  them that 

they have had a two-thirds majority for the last five years, and if they do not know 

that they have had this opportunity for the last five years, then I am quite surprised. 

</span></div><div><span>I have no doubt that he will stand up and say that there has not been enough money, 

but  I  am  saying  that  he  has  all  the  time  to  make  the  changes.  There was already a 

sign  in  the  last  Referendum  but  he  ignored  it  because  he  still  wanted  a  five-year 

term.  

</span></div><div><span>It is true, Mr Speaker. There was a Referendum in 1994, and the result as we know 

was that more people wanted a reduction of the Parliamentary term than the people 

who wanted to stay at 5 years.   It was a clear message Mr Speaker. There was no 

doubt  if you combine the number of people who wanted a 3 or 4 year term. There 

were more people in that category than there were in the category of 5 years.  It was 

</span><span>quite clear, Mr Speaker. They left it at that because they didn’t want a change. They 

didn’t want to hold another referendum later although it was evident that the pe</span><span>ople 

wanted a change. Had they really desired a change they would have been able to do 

it.  If  only  that  had  been  done  then  we  would  not  be  in  the  trouble  that  we  are  in 

today. If that had been done then, the people would have been able to come back and 

the  term  would  have  been  reduced.  Had  it  been  reduced  to  a  three-year  term  that 

would  have  been  perfect.  The  Amendment  that  he  is  bringing  before  the  House  to 

reduce the term of Parliament from 5 years to 4 years, I think it should say from 5 

years to 4, or 3 years. Not to ask whether they want a 5, 4 or a 3 year term but to say 

that it be reduced from 5 years to either 4 or 3 years.  

</span></div><div><span>As  I  listened  to  these  excuses,  I  believe  they  are  trying  to  twist  the  minds  of  our 

people.  I do not want all these excuses, because I think these excuses are a method 

of campaigning to try and say to our people that we do not know what we are doing. 

The people will think that we are unfit to govern the country. If there is a person who 

is  not  suitable  to  be  a  leader  of  this  country,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is  the  Prime  Minister 

</span><span>because he is the one who ruined the country. Don’t try to blame us. It was not us 

</span><span>who ruined this country. For a long time, we tried to teach and help these people, but 

all the time they kept telling us that we know nothing and they are the ones running 

this country.
