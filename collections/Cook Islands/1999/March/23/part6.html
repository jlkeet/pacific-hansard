</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Before I move the Third Reading of the 

Bill, I just want to give my thanks to all the Members for their assistance in allowing 

the  Bill  to  go  through  very  quickly.    Despite  its  shortness,  Mr Speaker, I have been 

assured that it is a very important amendment.  It will assist our Offshore Industry in 

do a better job now. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, Mr Speaker, I would like to  give my Greetings to the Prime Minister, the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  all  my  colleagues  in  Cabinet  and  all  the  Members  of 

Government, the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party and the Leader of the New 

Alliance Party and their respective Members and I would like to wish every Member 

in this House, who is standing again for the election, all the best. I know, Mr Speaker, 

that in the House it may appear that we are at war with each other, that the Opposition 

</span><span>and the Government is at each otherâ€™s throat. However, I think everybody knows that 

</span><span>that is far from the truth because when everything is over in the House, when we go 

outside, we are friends again.  And I am hoping that during the campaign period that 

spirit will continue. I hope, Mr Speaker, that those who do not come back, and I ask 

them not to cry because in any war, Mr Speaker, there is always a winner and a loser.  

And we have to accept that fact. 

</span></div><div><span>Anyway, Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the International Partnership (Amendment) Bill be Read  

a Third time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Utia Matata 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-ASSISTANT:</span><span>    A  Bill  Intituled  an  Act  to  amend  the  International 

Partnership Act 1984
