<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  And  this  concludes  the  Second  and  Third  Reading  of  the 

International Partnership (Amendment) Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker, 

to  all  Honourable  Members  and  a  very  special  Kia  Orana  to  our  people  who  are 

listening to us this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2115 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to seek the leave of the House, through you, to allow me to 

move  a  Motion  without  notice  in  order  to  allow  two  Constitution  Amendment  Bills 

that are currently in front of the House to survive the dissolution of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>As you well know, Mr Speaker, and for the benefit of some of our Members who are 

not  sure  about  it,  all  matters  on  the  Order  Paper  automatically  cease  to  exist  once 

Parliament  is  dissolved.    But  we  in  this  House  have  agreed  to  deal  with  two 

Constitutional  matters  which  this  House  has  agreed  ought  to  be  left  to  the  next 

Parliament to complete.  The Constitution provides that such a procedure is allowed 

provided Parliament is of that view.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I am seeking the leave of the House through you, Mr Speaker, to move this 

Motion, being a Motion without notice: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House allows the  Constitution (Amendment) No. 24 and Amendment 

No.25 to survive the dissolution of Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>I wish to apologise to the Leader of the </span><span>Opposition for the fact that I haven’t had the 

</span><span>opportunity  to  discus  this  matter  over  with  him  but  I  think  it  is  reasonably 

</span><span>straightforward.    All  we  are  doing  is  allowing  these  Bills  to  survive  to  the  next 

Parliament and let that Parliament complete the issue. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Prime Minister.  Can I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister of Legislative Services  

and Agriculture, Vaine Tairea 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Terepai  Maoate,  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance 

Party. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  welcome  the 

Prime Minister back into the House since he has just arrived from overseas.  I would 

like to respond to the Motion, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>I really don’t have any difficulty with what he is asking for, Mr Speaker, with regard 

</span><span>to the Constitution that we have debated and left there. But you see, Mr Speaker, the 

Honourable Dr Robati the other day gave you an amendment in writing, not in proper 

typing,  to  add  a  further  amendment  to  the  Electoral  Amendment  Bill  but  it  was 

refused. He may have been a little bit out of what is normally accepted. In my view, 

this  Motion,  is  also  getting  out  of  the  normal  procedure,  I  would  be  disappointed  if 

</span><span>you ruled differently in  this case, but  it all sounds  familiar to me. So I’m not happy 

</span><span>with  this  Mr  Speaker.  You  see,  the  Prime  Minister  just  arrived  back  last  night,  his 

Deputy Prime Minister, his Ministers should have made preparations. But they </span><span>didn’t 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>2116 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>do anything about it and now the Prime Minister has arrived and realised that nothing 

</span><span>was done so now they’re trying to break the rules and remove the Standing Orders to 

</span><span>try and complete this unfinished job...    (Interrupted by the Speaker) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Please come back to the Motion, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> If the Prime Minister was here he would have made sure that these 

things were done properly but  he flew over to Pukapuka and flew over to Manihiki, 

flew over to Penrhyn. What for? To campaign, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Please come back to the Motion on the Floor, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>He  shouldn’t  have,  he  shouldn’t  have  done  that.  He  knew  very 

well  that  he’s  got  a  job  here  to  do.  He  depended  on  his  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  he</span><span>depended on his  Ministers but they didn’t do the job that they were supposed to do.  

</span><span>You see, I want to find out what he has been doing out there in the Northern Group 

Mr Speaker..... 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  ...... And who paid for that chartered plane? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Order  please,  there  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor,  Honourable 

Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  I would like to ask the Leader of the Opposition to sit down.  

Poi</span><span>nt  of  Order,  Relevancy  in  Debate.  We’re  not  talking  about  the  Prime  Minister’s 

official  trip  to  the  Northern Group to  conduct  Government  business.   That’s not  the 

</span><span>Motion before us.  The Motion before us, is, as proposed by the Prime Minister.   I ask 

you,  Mr  Speaker  to  ask  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to  come  back  to  the  Motion. 

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister.  The Point of Order is quite in 

order  Honourable  Member.    But  before  I  call  you  to  speak,  may  I  refer  you  to  the 

question  by  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati.  I  did  refuse  to  accept  the 

question but straight after that, I changed my mind, and agreed to his request. I put it 

into the Committee and I followed the decision of the Committee.  The Honourable 

Member Dr Terepai Maoate please continue and come back to the Motion.   

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  must  have  been  out  of  the 

Chamber  when  you  made  that  ruling.  However,  Mr  Speaker,  the  Prime  Minister 

depended on his Deputy and his Ministers to do this job properly.  But can you blame 

them,  Mr  Speaker?  Can  you  blame  them  with  all  these  Bills  they  rushed  into  the 

</span><span>House one after the other? In the end they can’t do anything about them but guillotine 

every one of them.  There’s no doubt in my mind, Mr Speake</span><span>r, the Prime Minister left 

</span><span>his order behind him to say ‘these Bills must go through irrespective of what’s going 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2117 

</span></div><div><span>to happen. You have to guillotine it to make sure all of them go through’. They have 

</span><span>done that, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Speaker.  Relevancy of Debate 193.  The 

Motion  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  Bills  that  we  have  passed.    Therefore,  I  ask  you 

again to ask the Leader of the Opposition to come back to the Motion.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  I believe Honourable Member 

that this last meeting today is for us Honourable Members to honour ourselves.  My 

prayer  is  also  that  this  happens  in  this  meeting  today  so  I  would  like  to  ask  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate to please come back to the Motion.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I’d like to extend your prayer to 

</span><span>the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister also and let him realise that this is the last day 

to give me an opportunity to express myself to justify my argument.  Am I hurting him 

</span><span>or  anybody?  I  don’t  think  so,  Mr  Speaker.  I  only  have  a  limited  time  to  say  what  I 

want  to  say  to  justify  my  argument,  but  he’s  holding  me  up  all  the  time.    This  is  a 

habit he’s been doing for the last several days.  This is one of the things that we </span><span>have 

to  put  right,  Mr  Speaker,  when  we  become  Government  -  to  change  the  Standing 

Orders of this Parliament - not to change it, but to make it better.   

</span></div><div><span>So I’m saying Mr Speaker that I have already expressed my appreciation for what the 

</span><span>Prime Minister has requested.  We have debated this Constitution Amendment in the 

</span><span>House  and  it  didn’t  take  us  long  to  do  that.    I  am  only  telling  the  Prime  Minister 

</span><span>through you, Mr Speaker, the failure of these Ministers and especially the boss that he 

has left behind to look after the affairs of this country, the Deputy Prime Minister.  He 

has  failed.    The  buck  always  stops  at  the  door  of  the  Boss  and  that  is  the  Prime 

Minister.    He left  all these things  to  these people, he is  to  blame  - no one else is  to 

</span><span>blame.  So I don’t</span><span> want to get the Deputy Prime Minister to jump up again, so thank 

you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span>Mr Speaker, I’d just like to have some cl</span><span>arification from 

the  front.  Have  I  moved  the  Motion  for  these  Bills  to  survive  or  have  I  moved  the 

Motion  to  allow  me  to  move  a  Motion?  I  was  absolutely  clear  in  my  mind  that  my 

request  was for seeking of the Leave of the House.  And I did  so without moving a 

</span><span>Motion.  But it seems that we have voted on something at this point of time and I’m 

not  quite  clear  what  that  is  which  we  have  voted  on  and  I’d  like  some  clarification 

</span><span>please?   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Mr Prime Minister, to  my understanding the first Motion that  was 

raised  by  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  was  to  seek  for  permission  to  move  a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>2118 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Motion.    And  what  was  the  Motion?  I  don’t  know.    Now  the  House  has  given  you 

</span><span>permission  to  move that Motion.  Therefore, you can move the Motion, Honourable 

Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    In  that  case,  Mr  Speaker,  we 

</span><span>have made a technical error in that my Motion didn’t have a Seconder.  If my seeking 

</span><span>to obtain the leave of the House was converted to a Motion, then that Motion should 

have had a Seconder as I understand the Seconder was not sought.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Mr  Prime  Minister,  the  Motion  has  been  Seconded  by  the 

Honourable  Minister  of  the  Legislative  Services,  who  is  also  the  Minister  for 

Agriculture, Vaine Tairea.  Thank you, Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Mr  Speaker,  I  move  that  in 

accordance  with  the  Legislative  Assembly  Powers  and  Privileges  Amendment  Act 

1986 that this Parliament resolves the following: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Constitution Amendment Bill (No.24) and Constitution Amendment Bill 

(No.25) currently before the House be carried over from this session of 

Parliament to the next succeeding session of Parliament in order for these 

aforesaid Bills to survive the dissolution of this Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Just for the purpose of reminding all of us in the House what this is about, I wish to 

say a few brief words. 

</span></div><div><span>Let  me  begin  by  assuring  this  House  and  the  people  listening  that  I  did  not  go 

campaigning up North. The only person to try to do campaigning at the public meeting 

in Penrhyn was the candidate for the DAP and probably under instructions from the 

Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of DAP.   

</span></div><div><span>Members as well as our people will recall that Constitution Amendment No. 24 was a 

Bill  that  was  seeking  to  set  the  scene  for  a  Referendum  to  be  held  on  the  term  of 

Parliament.    We  took  that  Bill  to  certain  stages  in  this  House,  as  required  under 

Standing Orders. For it to be completed the next Parliament will be required to pick 

this Bill up as a live document.  We need to keep this alive, Mr Speaker, because we 

will  be  conducting  the  Referendum  on  the  same  day  as  the  elections.    I  understand 

there has been some debate whether the term ought to be 5 years, 4 years or 3 years.  

And  there  has  been  some  recommendation  that  the  3  year  term  be  also  part  of  this 

Referendum so it should not only be 5 years, 4 years but 5 years, 4 years or 3 years. 

For those who engaged this debate and did not read out the facts, especially the Talk 

Back  Radio  Show  that  held  this  discussion, I wish to  remind them that the Political 

Review  Commission  recommended  that  the  question  to  be  put  to  our  people  be  left 

only  to  the  two  figures  -  namely,  either  5  or  4  year  term.    That  Commission 

represented  the  view  of  the  people.  This  Parliament  agreed  to  pick  up  that 

recommendation,  conscious  of  the  comments  and  recommendations  of  the  Political 

</span><span>Review  Commission.    It  is  not  this  Parliament  nor  Government  that  restricted  the 

</span><span>choice to 4 or 5.  By that I meant it was not Government or it was not Parliament who 

is  by  its  own  volition,  in  favour  of  that  choice.  That  choice  was  presented  to  us, 

recommended  to  us,  by  the  Political  Review  Commission.    One  of  the  important 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2119 

</span></div><div><span>arguments raised by the Commission is that if the choice was broken down between 5, 

4 or 3, chances of any change happening is much more reduced.  The argument is that 

those who want a reduction in the term of Parliament will choose either 4 or 3.  By so 

doing they will be splitting the numbers who wish for a reduced term and by so doing 

the requirements of the Constitution would not be met.  As I understand it, there was 

only one person who spoke over the Talk Back Show that understood that point but 

none of the others who spoke cared to pick it up.  But in any case, Mr Speaker, that is 

what  Constitution  Amendment  No.  24  is  and  we  are  now  no longer in  a position to 

alter the content of that Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Constitution  Amendment  (No.25)  Bill,  Mr  Speaker,  refers  to  the  ability  of  the  new 

Parliament  to  pass  an  enabling  legislation  in  respect  of  three  matters.    Firstly,  the 

question  of  Crossing  the  Floor.  The  intention  is  for  an  Act  to  be  put  in  place  to 

manage  that  process  so  that  it  is  done  in  a  reasonable  fashion,  a  clear  transparent 

fashion that takes into account the interests and rights of both the elected Member and 

his electors. 

</span></div><div><span>The  second  issue  concerns  the  appointment  of  a  National  Appointments  Council.  

</span><span>Such a council, once the enabling Act is in place, would have the authority to make 

</span><span>recommendations  for  all  of  the  judicial  and  quasi-judicial  positions  in  Government.  

The  third  is  that  the  ability that would be created for the new Parliament to  pass  an 

Act  to  establish a Leadership Code that would affect  all Members of Parliament, all 

senior positions in Government in every sphere of Government activity. 

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  the  three  issues  of  the  Constitution  Amendment  (No.25)  Bill  that  we  are 

seeking  to  have  the  opportunity  to  be  brought  up  as  live  issues  by  the  incoming 

Parliament.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Can I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister of Legislative Services, Vaine Tairea 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The question about Constitution 

No.24 will not be an easy one, Mr Speaker, because what is required is not only a two-

thirds majority in the Referendum to reduce it to four years or three years, whatever 

the Referendum is going to be processed, but it also requires two-thirds majority in the 

House.  So, although we are anticipating to get something done about this, making it 

still  alive  for  the  next  Parliament,  the  fact  is,  we  need  those  two-thirds  on  the 

</span><span>Referendum from the voting population and also the two-thirds majority in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>In a way I am glad the Prime Minister is promoting this because I want our people to 

realise  this:  What  is  being  promoted  here  requires  two-thirds  to  support  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>2120 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Democratic Alliance Party.  That’s right.  That’s the only way we can impl</span><span>ement and 

put that into place and pass it as a Constitutional Act  - that is to put the Democratic 

Alliance  Party  to  have  the  majority  in  the  House  -  at  least  two-thirds  -  or  any  other 

Party for that matter. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I have to interrupt you, Honourable Member.</span><span>I would like to remind 

the Honourable Member we are not talking about the content of these two Bills.  All 

we are doing is speaking on the Motion that these two Bills, No. 24 and 25, be taken 

forward to the next Session of Parliament.  We are not going to debate on the content 

of these two Bills. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  speaker.    I  appreciate  your  remarks,  Mr 

Speaker.    However,  the  Prime  Minister  embarked  on  these  very  points  that  I  am 

talking abo</span><span>ut.  If only he didn’t go into the content I wouldn’t have bothered.  He even 

</span><span>went  back  to  the  Referendum  that  was  passed  in  1994,  Mr  Speaker,  where  in  that 

Referendum  the result showed so much more than five years but the number for the 

four  and  three  put  together  is  more  than  the  five  years.    He  has  already  touched  on 

that. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I think it was appropriate for the Honourable Prime Minister to go 

back  and  to  explain  Constitution  (Amendment) No.24 and 25 because there are still 

some Members who are in doubt as to what 24 and 25 are.  And I am quite certain that 

the people listening in are also asking what these Bills that are being called 24 and 25 

are?  So I think it was appropriate for the Prime Minister to explain 24 and 25 but I 

think if we are going to speak on this Motion, we should just speak on 24 and 25.   

</span></div><div><span>Continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.   I am quite clear on what you are 

ruling, Mr Speaker.  I am sad that if any of the Members of Parliament are not aware 

of what No. 24 and 25 of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill is all about.  Anyhow, I 

will explain what they are all about. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span>No, we don’t need that.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>I’m sorry, Honourable Member.  Please come back to the Motion.</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> What am I supposed to talk about?  Am I just supposed to 

talk  about  Constitution  24,  Constitution  25  without  any  explanation?    What  I  am 

saying,  Mr  Speaker,  is  this  is  too  late  a  time  to  bring  this  Motion  into  the  House.  

</span><span>That’s  why  I  said  earlier  on  </span><span>that  he  was  roaming  around  in  the  North  and  going 

overseas without being here. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> And if I say something somebody is going to pull me down. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2121 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>(Much noise) 

</span></div><div><span>You sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  .... (Inaudible)...you read your Standing Orders. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:  </span><span>You shut up. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> You sit down and shut up. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Honourable Members please take your seats.  Please take your seats 

Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  I raised a Point of Order, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Please take your seat Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span> Thank you, Sir.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> May I remind the Honourable Members of a saying which says an 

angry  man  is  a  hungry  man  and  an  angry  man  will  not  vote.    If  he  votes  he  votes 

wrongly. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> You listen to that. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> So will the Honourable Members please keep quiet. 

</span></div><div><span>I  think  it  is  appropriate  that  we  remind  ourselves  to  be  gracious,  that  we  enter 

ourselves  into  a  frame  of  mind  of  calmness  and  goodwill  toward  our  fellow  man 

especially as we will be sharing our Greetings and making our farewells to our friends 

and supporters later in this session. So, to the Minister who had the Point of Order, I 

</span><span>don’t  agree  with  that  Point  of  Order.  And  to  the  Honourable  Member  that  was 

</span><span>speaking, I would like to very calmly sit him down and hope that he understands.  So I 

will give you some time Honourable Member to think calmly about what you want to 

say. So I would like to call upon the Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In order to keep the peace of this 

country, perhaps I have said enough on what I wanted to say.  But every word I said I 

meant it.  And I agree we only have another hour to go.  Perhaps I should finish here 

</span><span>and I don’t wish to make further comments. Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  May I take it that the Honourable 

Prime Minister is going to reply. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Yes, thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>2122

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Earlier the Leader of the Opposition was saying that the 

only  way  we  will  be  able  to  reduce  the  term  of  Parliament  is  that  the  Democratic 

Alliance Party be given a two-thirds majority in Parliament.  I believe Mr Speaker that 

it will be possible to get a reduction of term from five years to four years but as he was 

saying, it will be quite hard.  But to change the number of Democratic Alliance Party 

Members in this Parliament from 4 to 17 will be like changing a worm into a warrior. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Point  of  Order,  Mr  Speaker.    Mr  Speaker,  I  have 

respectfully  obeyed  your  ruling  and  now  I  can  see  the  Prime  Minister  is  trying  to 

revive again some of the things </span><span>that I was wanting to say but I wasn’t allowed to say.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Mr Prime Minister, can you be more respectful? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> I am being respectful, Mr Speaker, and I was thinking to 

be  in  line  with  the  advice  you  gave  us,  to  bring  the  Honourable  Member  a  plate  of 

food.  Because  your  parable  was  saying,  Mr  Speaker,  that  an  angry  man  is  a  hungry 

man.  So I think I should bring him a plate of food. 

</span></div><div><span>We have the business before us, Mr Speaker, in that need to make a resolution in this 

House that these two Bills be kept alive so that the new Parliament will be able to pick 

them up as alive and finish them. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Prime Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I  understand  that  the  Honourable  Minister,  Tiki  Matapo  has  an  announcement  to 

make. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, yes I wish to make an 

</span><span>announcement.    Today  I  have  received  from  the  Queen’s  Representative,  His 

</span><span>Excellency  Sir  Apenera  Short,  K.B.E.  a  notice  of  Dissolution  of  Parliament.    Mr 

Speaker, I wish to read it.
