<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>International  Partnership  Amendment  Bill,  Second  Reading.    The  Honourable 

Minister of Finance, Pa Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.  Greetings  to  you,  to  all  the  staff 

Members in Parliament and all Honourable Members in the House and to our people 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2107 

</span></div><div><span>who  are  listening  in  to  the  debate  this  afternoon.  Greetings.  Mr  Speaker.  The 

Amendment that we are about to debate is a very short amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Can you move the Motion please, Honourable Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:  </span><span>This is a very brief Bill before the House and I believe it won’t 

</span><span>take  long  to  debate.  Seeing  it  is  the  last  day  of  Parliament,  an  opportunity  will  be 

given  close  to  4.00  pm  to  Honourable  Members  to  speak  to  their  electorates.  

However,  Mr  Speaker,  if  you  will  allow  me,  I  would  like  to  make  my  Greetings  to 

them  right  now,  rather  than  later.  But  before  I  do  that,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to 

move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the International Partnership Amendment Bill be now Read  

a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  all who are listening in to the radio this afternoon, to our people in the 

outer islands and on Rarotonga.  To the public servants in the outer islands and to the 

</span><span>Island Councillors listening in to our broadcast, to the Mayors’ Forum in Atiu. I hope 

</span><span>you are having a good time there.  

</span></div><div><span>Today is the day of the opening of the Mayors’ Forum.  I would like to apologise for 

</span><span>not  being  there.  I  am  unable  to  attend  the  opening  of  the  Forum  although  I  was 

specially asked to declare the Forum open. I had to excuse myself because the last Bill 

to be presented in the House is my Bill.  However, Mr Speaker, a senior officer from 

my  Department  has  gone  in  my  place  as  Minister.  He  will  extend  to  them  my 

apologies. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I would like to extend my Greetings to my place of birth. To the Mayor, to the 

Ariki Vaine and the Aronga Mana. My Greetings also  go to  the Chief Executive, to 

the Government  Representative and to all Public Servants on the island of Mangaia. 

To the Church leaders and everyone on the island. I trust that everything is alright with 

all  of  you.  Tomorrow,  the  other  two  Members  of  Parliament  for  the  island  will  be 

coming back and I hope that your meeting with them will be an enjoyable one. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly I would like also to extend my Greetings to my Committee members who are 

</span><span>working very hard on Mangaia and I would like to say don’t work too hard because 

we  don’t  want  all  the  voters  to  come  o</span><span>ver  to  our  side.  We  want  some  for  the 

</span><span>Opposition.  Greetings to you all and you already know when we shall meet. I don’t 

</span><span>want  to  make  an  announcement  on  the  radio  or  the  other  group  will  get  jumpy  and 

start running away. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Speaker, coming back to the International Partnership (Amendment) Bill. As 

I said it is a very short Bill. It has been on the Order Paper for some time now.  It was 

tabled  together  with  the  Trustees  (Amendment)  Bill,  which  we  passed  about  two  or 

three  weeks  ago.    Like  that  Bill,  which  is  now  an  Act,  this  Amendment  Bill  is  of  a 

similar  nature,  to  correct  some  of  the  omissions,  some  of  the  typographical  errors 

which occurred in the 1984 Act, which is the principal Act. I specifically mention the 

year  1984,  Mr  Speaker,  otherwise  I  would  be  accused  of  committing  errors  in  Bills 

</span><span>which in this case I wasn’t responsible for.  Yes, Mr Speaker, the principal Act was 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>2108 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>passed in 1984 and part of this Amendment Bill in front of us is to correct some of the 

mistakes  that  occurred  in  the  principal  Act.    However,  Mr  Speaker,  there  are  other 

additions  and  some  other  amendments  to  that  Act  which  is  before  us.  For  example, 

you will find in Clause 2 that the definition of Trustee Company has been amended so 

that the new definition will include any wholly-owned subsidiary of a Trust Company 

and  this  extension  also  will  make  the  new  definition  consistent  with  other  Offshore 

legislation. 

</span></div><div><span>The  more  substantial  change  is  an  amendment  to  Section  55  of  the  principal  Act 

</span><span>whereby  the  word  “general”  is  deleted.    Th</span><span>is  allows  for  a  Trustee Company to  be a 

managing partner in an international partnership.  I believe, Mr Speaker, this change is 

necessary  because  there  are  countries  which  incorporate  this  amendment  in  their 

legislation.  For  example,  Mr  Speaker,  similar  United  States  structure  require 

managing  partners  and  a  section  as  amended  will  allow  us  to  comply  with  these 

United States structures and thus open up a potential new market. 

</span></div><div><span>A further change, Mr Speaker, particularly to Clause 5, which reflects the deletion of 

</span><span>the word “general” in Section 55. It removes the distinction between a ‘general’ and a 

</span><span>‘managing partner’.</span></div><div><span>Those  are  the  major  improvements  in  the  principal  Act  and  as  I  pointed  out  earlier 

other changes are merely typographical errors. 

</span></div><div><span>While we are talking about Trustee companies, Mr Chairman, I thought I would raise 

the  issue  of  money  laundering  because  when  we  debated  the  Trustee  Company 

(Amendment) Bill, the Leader of the New Alliance raised the issue.  He specifically 

mentioned an article in t</span><span>he Reader’s Digest.  When I made inquiries of the issue with 

the Trustee Company’s principals on our island, I was informed that this article was 

</span><span>written  about  ten  years  ago  and  since  then  a  lot  of  legislation  has  been  through  this 

House to correct the accusation that was mentioned in the article - </span><span>I haven’t read the 

</span><span>article myself - and at the same time to improve the security of our offshore industry. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I was informed it would be a rare case if money laundering comes through 

the Cook Islands because we only have five Trustee Companies on the island.  At the 

</span><span>same  time  we  only  have  two  Class  “C”  banks  through  which  money</span><span>-laundering 

activity could be put through and we only have two of those.  While some Offshore 

</span><span>jurisdictions  have  many,  many  Trustee  Companies  and  many,  many  banks  through 

</span><span>which money-laundering could take place, our system is easier to police. 

</span></div><div><span>At  the  moment,  Mr  Speaker,  I  have  in  front  of  me  a  Report  on  money-laundering 

issues.    The  actual  Report  itself  is  called  a  1998-99  Report  on  Money-Laundering 

</span><span>Type Policies.  Unfortunately, I haven’t had time to go through the Report itself, Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, but reading the preamble it states that the Cook Islands is one of the safest 

places to do Offshore Banking business. Our legislation is such that it is very difficult 

for money-laundering to take place. The Offshore industry in our country knows very 

</span><span>well that if anyone of them breaks the rule, they will automatically lose their license.  

</span><span>However, Mr Speaker we cannot help but continue to be vigilant so that no monkey 

business is allowed to occur. If it did, it will not only destroy our creditability and our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2109 

</span></div><div><span>revenue source but it also means that the reputation of our offshore industry will be at 

stake.   

</span></div><div><span>So,  Mr  Speaker  I  urge  people  in  our  Offshore  Industry  to  be  careful  and  not  to 

concentrate  on  greed  but  to  be  very  vigilant  and  make  sure  the  reputation  of  the 

country is looked after.  And if the country is well looked after, so will the personnel 

</span><span>working in this industry.  So, Mr Speaker that’s </span><span>all I need to say about the matter, but 

</span><span>there’s a lot more to it as I have explained.</span></div><div><span>We know there’s some amount of secrecy involved in our Offshore business, which is 

</span><span>necessary.    As  we  know,  Mr  Speaker,  the  secrecy  provisions  as  required  by  the 

Offshore  banking  industry  is  necessary  otherwise,  they  will  not  have  any  clients.  

However,  I  urge  the  personnel  in  the  industry  to  be  vigilant  and  warn  them,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, that in our society, there’s no such thing as a secret. So, if some wrongdoing 

</span><span>occurs the whole island will know, because our coconut wireless is far more advanced 

than the satellite communications or computer technology.  

</span></div><div><span>So,  Mr  Speaker,  I  will  end  here.  Therefore,  I  strongly  appeal,  Mr  Speaker,  to  the 

</span><span>people  involved  in  this  industry to  be vigilant in  what  they do and to  work together 

</span><span>and  to  co-operate  for  their  benefit  and  the  benefit  of  the  nation.    Therefore,  in 

conclusion, Mr Speaker, I repeat the Motion that:  

</span></div><div><span> The International Partnership Amendment Bill be Read  

a Second Time.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Can I have a seconder, please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member, Mii Parima. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate, Leader of the 

</span></div><div><span>Democratic Alliance Party 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  Greetings  to  you  and  Greetings 

also to all the hard working staff in this Department. To all Honourable Members in 

this House, to our people who are listening in to our debate this afternoon, Greetings. 

Special Greetings to the people of the Northern Group islands. In a few days we will 

be meeting on your islands. To the people of the Southern Group islands, Greetings to 

you all. Greetings also to the Mayors who are in Atiu for the Mayoral Forum. I hope 

this radio transmission is clearly received in Atiu.   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  disappointed  that  no  Minister has come over to  open the Forum. I would have 

expected  at  least  one  Minister  to  come  across  to  open  the  Mayoral  Forum  this 

morning. Unfortunately, it looks like none of them wanted to come over and do that.  I 

could have asked my Deputy Leader of the Opposition to come and open that Forum, 

Mr Speaker. This Forum of Mayors in Atiu are representatives of each of the islands 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>2110 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>in this country and they should not be let down by a Minister from Cabinet.  For that 

reason I will be rushing to Air Rarotonga this afternoon to get me a seat tomorrow so I 

</span><span>can catch up with what’s going on, at least to present the Democratic Alliance Parties 

</span><span>views  </span><span>on  queries  from  the  Mayor  of  Atiu.  So  I’m  apologising  on  behalf  of  the 

</span><span>Minister of MOID in that, he is not able to come over to the Forum. 

</span></div><div><span>I will reserve my Greetings to my people when the time is due, so I will get on to the 

Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>First, I would like to give a special Greetings to the people, to the associations, to the 

Offshore  Banking  Association.    To  the  Chairman,  Secretary,  Committee  and  to  the 

various Offshore Trustee Companies; to all the staff members who are working in this 

industry, I give you special Greetings this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>The Minister of Finance did indicate earlier on that it was during the Democratic Party 

time that some amendments were made. He cited typographical errors, which he has 

brought  into  the  House  this  afternoon  for  corrections.  Actually  this  was  introduced 

</span><span>before  my  time  but  I’m  very  proud  to  be  associated  with  the  Democratic  Party  in 

</span><span>encouraging the establishment of Offshore Banking for the benefit of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>Recently,  I  have  expressed  my  concern  over  the  casualness  within  the  Industry 

especially amongst the Executives in regards to submitting their concerns to Members 

of  Parliament.  Especially  during    the  in-</span><span>camera  discussions.  But  I’m  pleased  to  say 

</span><span>that  that  was  overcome  by  a  very  good  explanation  from  the  Members  of  the 

</span><span>Association. Now, I’m very happy with what they are doing.  During the earlier part of 

</span><span>this Session, we received a letter of explanation about one of the Bills that we passed 

with regards to Offshore Banking. I now understand the role that the Executive of the 

Association  of  Offshore  Banking  has.  It  is  obvious  that  they  have  been  trying  their 

best to ensure that what is put into the House to be amended is all for the benefit and 

for the progress of the industry. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to see that a close liaison between the industry and Government continues 

to ensure that what the Minister of Finance said is maintained. I do not want to find 

this country going through some laundering of dirty money.  A lot of our people do 

not  really  understand  this  industry.    When  we  talk  about  things  secretly  and  in  -

camera, before we finally legislate I am sure people will be querying what secrets if 

</span><span>there  are  any  which  are  kept  away  from  the  public.  It  is  only  right  that  our  people 

</span><span>understand the whole situation with regard to the Offshore Banks, that is, secrecy is to 

protect our clients that put their money through the system in order that their money 

back home will not be a disadvantage to them where ever they are.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to give an example in the United States. Lately, a law suit was brought by 

certain plaintiffs against  some defendants just because they know a certain person has 

a lot of money. They sued claiming damages just to get their hands on some of that 

money. This is one of the good reasons why people like to invest their money offshore 

</span><span>so people who sue them for no good reason cannot get their hands on their money. It 

</span><span>is safe in the hands of people in the Offshore banks such as the Cook Islands. I hope 

this brief explanation will help people listening in as to why there is secrecy and why 

people invest through our Offshore Banks.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2111 

</span></div><div><span>We see it as a good source of revenue for the country and on top of that, these banks 

employ a lot of our people to help them.  There are quite a few people employed by 

these companies, and as far as I know they are paid well.  Of course they deserve what 

they  are  paid.    I  was  quite  impressed,  Mr  Speaker,  I  heard  that  some  of  the  senior 

employees  of the Trust  Companies have been moving from one company to another 

because one is offering better pay than the other. That is very healthy, Mr Speaker, it 

shows  that  the  industry  is  alive  and  attracting  better  employees  within  the  country 

itself. You know, we talk about a brain drain - people leaving the country and going 

elsewhere to  find greener pastures  -  I want  to  say this. We are lucky that we have a 

brain  drain  from  the  outside  into  our  country,  with  regard  to  this  industry.    To  me 

there  is  some  balance  here.  You  have  from  overseas  people  employed  by  the  Trust 

Companies. They apply their expertise here. Its only right that we offer our Thanks to 

them  for  their services. But  I would like to  remind the Offshore companies  - I have 

said  it  before  and  I  will  say it again  -  that there should be an element  of training in 

their operations as an investment in this Offshore banking industry.  Even in terms of 

scholarships where they send our people overseas for training so that they will come 

back and work here. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  people  have  the  qualifications  suitable  to  start  in  the  industry  but  for  further 

</span><span>training,  the  industry  should  place  some  priority  there.    You  see  there  is  a  big 

difference  in  employing  one  of  ours  and  bringing  someone  from  outside.  They  will 

need accommodations, adaptations, and encounter all sorts of problems. Whereas our 

people, if given the opportunity may do better. They can start a family, build a house, 

knowing they have security in their employment. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  one  industry  that  I  know  that  we  hardly  give  any  input  into.  Apart  from  the 

Acts  we  pass  in  the  House.  Time  is  overdue  for  something  to  be  done  some 

contribution  should  be  made  to  the  industry  such  as  a  promotion  or  a  kind  of 

recognition.  This is long overdue, Mr Speaker. I would like the Government to offer 

some kind of pledge to this industry because it generates top revenue  for our country. 

They  deserve  the  support  of  the  country.  They  provided  employment  for  our  people 

and they earn us monetary in excess of $6 million pa. I do not hesitate to say they are 

turning over something like $6 million a year.  I give them nothing but praise for their 

efforts but as the Minister said, I am asking that they must maintain a clean bill and  

make  sure  that  no  laundering  of  dirty  money  comes  through  our  country.  The 

reputation  of  the  Cook  Islands  in  offshore  banking  is  in  their  hands.  If  that  is  the 

</span><span>position  we  maintain,  clients  will  easily  be  attracted  to  invest  their  money  in  our 

</span><span>Offshore industry here. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  other  speakers?  

The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>ASSISTANT  CLERK:</span><span>  A  Bill  intituled  An  Act  to  amend  the  International 

Partnership Act 1994.

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I will now resolve Parliament into the Committee of the Whole to 

deal with the Clauses.
