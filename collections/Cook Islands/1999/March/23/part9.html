election.  I know I have accomplished a lot of work in my constituency over the long 

period of time that I was your Member. I also would like to acknowledge the efforts of 

my hard working Committee in my Constituency of Avatiu/Ruatonga and also on the 

island of Palmerston.  To my Patron and my Committee, and to all the hard working 

Members of my Constituency, Kia Orana to you all.

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to my 2 colleagues who will be running the same race, Greetings also 

to you two. I am confident that you will support me until such time that you no longer 

want me as your Member for Avatiu/Ruatonga and island of Palmerston. May God be 

with you all, Kia Orana.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Leader of the House.  May I call for Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Member T. Marsters 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to?</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the House has forgotten that he has told me secretly that he will allow 

Members  to  speak  for  5  minutes  only.    And  the  Leaders  8  minutes  each.    You  may 

continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span> Greetings to you, Mr Speaker and Greetings also to our people 

listening  to  us  this  afternoon.  I  would  like  to  remind  the  Central  Committee  of  the 

Cook Islands Party tha</span><span>t we will be having a meeting at the Aitutaki Hostel at 7 o’clock 

</span><span>tomorrow evening. As is usual, Members of the Cook Islands Party when the Central 

</span><span>Committee calls for a meeting that means it’s for all supporters of the CIP. You have 

</span><span>heard the message relayed to you by the different Chairpersons in the electorates, now 

I just want to remind us all again by this message over the air.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to remind us all of our Party Conference which will be held on the 27th, 

28th  and  29th  of  April.  You  may  have  received  the  message  by  now  in  the  Outer 

Islands, I just want to keep us reminded by this over the air.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, yesterday when I was attempting to say my congratulations and farewells 

to 2 of our Members in Parliament who declared their position to retire from politics, 

mainly the Honourable Minister Ngereteina Puna and the Honourable Member Mataio 

</span><span>Aperau, I was rudely interrupted by the Leader of the Opposition.  Well, I guess it’s 

</span><span>typical  of  the  man,  Mr  Speaker.  We  can  allow  him  to  say  anything  he  wants  to  say 

without any interference, especially when it comes to congratulations. And when the 

occasion  concerns  people  leaving  this  place  that  warrant  an  important  reaction from 

us, he tries to call me to a Point of Order.  I was very disappointed because never once 

in  my  7  years  in  this  House  have  I  called  him  to  a  Point  of  Order  when  he  was 

congratulating people.  But never mind, Mr Speaker, he has excused himself from the 

House, because obviously he knew that I had something to say about him.  

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  rose  to  speak,  Mr  Speaker,  looking  at  the  points  I  wanted  to  highlight,  I 

</span><span>realised I might take about an hour of this Parliament’s time.  He reminded everybody 

</span><span>listening  in  yesterday  that  I  had  already  spoken  and  therefore  I  have  forty  more 

minutes to say what I want to say.  

</span></div><div><span>I was listening carefully to the warrant by the Queen’s Representative and there was 

</span><span>no  time  limit  as  to  when  this  House  should  rise  today,  therefore  I  would  like  to 

believe, Mr Speaker, that this House will continue until every single Member of the 

House has said what he wants to say. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2125 

</span></div><div><span>I  was  wrapping  up  my  statement  yesterday  concerning  the  Honourable  Minister 

Ngereteina Puna.  I was saying, Mr Speaker, that by virtue of what he did in making 

way  for  a  new  fresh  face  to  come  in  and  represent  our  party  in  his  electorate  in 

Aitutaki.  By  virtue  of  his  decision  to  step  down,  Mr  Speaker,  he  has  elevated  the 

morale of that electorate to yet another level.  My best wishes, and no doubt the best 

wishes of every Cook Islands Party supporter today goes to Teina Bishop.  A true blue 

blood CIP.  Your mother was a staunch supporter and hard worker of the CIP. I know 

Teina  you  will  carry  the  standard  of  the  CIP  with  credit.  By  virtue  of  what  the 

Honourable  Ngereteina  Puna  has  done,  the  party  will  contest  this  election  with 

confidence  and  success.  Therefore,  my  wife  and  our  family  wish  the  Honourable 

Ngereteina Puna the best  of luck to you and your wife during your retirement years. 

May  you  spend  an  enjoyable  time  with  your  immediate  family  and  your  extended 

family. 

</span></div><div><span>As  a  Party  contesting  the  1989  general  elections,  the  odds  were  against  us  winning 

Government, which is always the case when you are in Opposition, especially moreso 

when  a  Government  has  some good programmes in  place. However, I must say, Mr 

</span><span>Speaker,  now  that  it  is  history,  but  for  some  extravagances,  such  as  the  infamous 

</span><span>travels  of  Government  Members  at  the  time,  it  might  have  been  difficult  for  us  to 

topple the Government of the day.  But under the good leadership and a co-operative 

team  we  were  able  to  topple  the  Government  of  the  day  despite  all  the  good  things 

they had going for them.  Our candidates, the personalities were important at the last 

elections. The quality of each candidate was foremost in the minds of the executive of 

the  Cook  Islands  Party.    That  is  how  the  Honourable  Member  Mataio  Aperau  came 

into  the  fold.    We  will  not  traverse  the  ins  and  outs,  the  pros  and  cons  of  the 

Honourable Member because that is water under the bridge now. 

</span></div><div><span>When I took  the position as Minister of Works in late 1991, I was charged with the 

responsibility of setting up the infrastructure in  readiness for the 1992 South Pacific 

Festival  of  Arts.    The  Prime  Minister  could  not  have  given  me  a  better  Second  in 

charge.  He  could  not  have  given  me  a  better  man.  He  gave  me  the  Honourable 

Member Mataio Aperau to assist. We quickly realised there were three main areas that 

needed addressing.  We, in Government, realised the need for good clean water supply 

and adequate water supply. Government needed good facilities in order that we could 

invite  the  people  who  were  coming  to  the  festival  and  give  them  good  facilities  to 

</span><span>perform. Government needed to ensure that there were good roads. In the Honourable 

</span><span>Mataio, I put my whole trust.  What he did is now history. 

</span></div><div><span>Allow me to highlight a few of the projects supervised by this Honourable Member.  

He  was  responsible  for  the  tidying  up  and  revamping  of  the  National  Stadium.    He 

was responsible for monitoring the progress of building the National Auditorium.  He 

was required to reseal all the main roads including the main crossroads in Rarotonga.  

He was  required to  reclaim  and prepare the Avana Harbour site for activities in that 

area.  I picked up the tail  end, previously under the direction and supervision  of the 

</span><span>Prime  Minister  himself  and  the  Honourable  Mataio  Aperau,  the  main  second  road, 

</span><span>‘Ara  Maire  Nui’  in  Central  Avarua.  I  carried  on  the  job  originally  started  by  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Mataio  Aperau  and  the  Prime  Minister  in  the  area  now  known  as  the 

Punanga Nui. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>2126 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Businesses and homes along the stretch of the foreshore from Tupapa will appreciate 

the  work  put  into  the  protective  wall  along  the  foreshore.    These  were  all  projects 

started by the Prime Minister and the Honourable Mataio Aperau to be picked up by 

myself  in  1992.  The post Festival  years saw the Honourable Member together with 

the  Honourable  Boy  Tepai  constructing  new  water  intakes  on  Rarotonga  adding  2 

million  gallons  of  water  a  day  into  our  main  water  supply.  New  bridges  were 

constructed  under  the  supervision  of  the  Honourable  Mataio  Aperau  in  Rutaki  and 

Takuvaine.  He was also responsible for the repair of the Avatiu bridge and the main 

bridge in Ngatangiia.  The Honourable Mataio Aperau did not rest only in Rarotonga, 

he  was  directly  involved  with  the  planning  and  construction  of  the  Manihiki  and 

Pukapuka airports as well. He was also directly involved in the planning and costing 

of the construction of the Manihiki and Pukapuka airports as well as the repair work 

on  the  Penrhyn  airport.  He  also  supervised  the  planning  of  the  proposed  airport  in 

Palmerston.  Sadly that did not eventuate due to some indifference on the island itself.  

Mr  Speaker,  I  could  go  on  and  on  about  this  Honourable  Member.  Seriously,  Mr 

Speaker,  there  are  so  many  things  that  he  has  done  for  this  country  that  this  House 

should  now  let  the  Honourable  Member  depart  into  the  political  wilderness  with 

</span><span>grace. 

</span></div><div><span>Tuaine and our family and our children and their families join us today in wishing the 

Honourable Member and Mama Tere a good retirement.  You have done so much for 

this country.  All we can say is thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>To both Honourable Members, Ngere and Mat I say go my friends.  Thank you, for all 

your advice and support.  God be with you. 

</span></div><div><span>My  thanks  also,  Mr  Speaker,  goes  out  to  my  own  electorate,  Murienua.    To  the 

Aronga Mana, all the Mataiapo, to our senior citizens, our mapu, our children.  Thank 

you very much for your assistance, for your help, for your moral support of me and my 

family in the past five years, especially to my hard working Committee and to those 

who have been very close to me insofar as politics is concerned.  Kia Orana to you all.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  U.  SIMPSON:</span><span>  Mr  Speaker,  and  to  all  staff  Members  of  Parliament,  I  wish  to 

extend to you all my appreciation for the service that you have provided.  I would like 

also  at  this  time  to  extend  to  you,  Sir,  on  behalf  of  my  colleague,  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member, Norman George, who is not present in Parliament this afternoon because he 

</span><span>is involved in another appointment and he is not able to be here. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to extend to the Prime Minister my word of acknowledgment, 

to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  to  all  Honourable  Members.    I 

extend to you my thank you on behalf of my wife and my family.  To the Honourable 

Leader of the Opposition and to your Deputy and to all Honourable Members on the 

Opposition  side,  Greetings  in  the  love  of  God.    To  the  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance 

Party and your Deputy, I extend also to you a word of acknowledgment. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  acknowledge  the  Minister  of  Education,  Ngereteina  Puna  and  the  Honourable 

Member,  Mataio  Aperau.    I  wish  you  all  the  best,  may  God  bless  you  in  your 

retirement.

</span></div><div><span>To the Mayor, Roger Malcolm, and the Island Council of Atiu, the Deputy Mayor and

</span><span>being held in Atiu right now, I extend to you all God’s blessing.</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  extend  to  every  single  one  of  us  in  our  various  walks  and  various 

activities, may God bless you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To our two electorates on the island of Atiu, to the Chairman and vice-Chairman and 

the Committee Members and supporters of the New Alliance Party, may we continue 

in the same spirit as we venture into the future and may we feel confident in the next 

election. For those who will be in  the race for the next  election, I would like to  say 

</span><span>let’s run the race with joy.  And for those who will be continuing in the House, may 

God continue to bless us all and let’s not have hard feelings for each other. Thank you, 

</span><span>Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Greetings to you, Mr Speaker.  Greetings to the Clerk and to 

the Interpreters who are busy this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  Parliament,  as  this  is  the  last  day  of  our

Greetings  to  the  Pu  Tapere,  Teava  Mataiapo,  the  title  held  by  George  Matutu,  and

</span><span>Committee  who  have  been  recently  elected  into  office.    May  God  bless  you  all 

because you have a great task ahead of you. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  extend  a  special  Greetings  to  the  hard  working  Committee  of  my 

electorate because it was through their hard work that I am able to represent them in 

this House.  I would like to thank you all for the confidence that you have in me that I 

am able to be in this for 5 years since 1994. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time  to  acknowledge  and  to  extend  to  the  two  Honourable 

</span><span>Members who wish to retire from the life of politics this afternoon.  Greetings to the 

Honourable  Member,  Ngereteina Puna for the time that you have dedicated to  serve 

our  people  of  Aitutaki.  I  know  you  have  done  very  well  in  high  office  serving  your 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>2128 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>people.    There  may  have  been  some  difficulties  and  so  on  but  we  are  not  going  to 

</span><span>dwell on those.  I’m just going to  say to  you thank you very much for the excellent 

</span><span>service that you have provided to the people in your country.  I believe you are a man 

of God that God will provide for your needs as you stay at home with your family.     

</span></div><div><span>In  the  short  time  that  I  was  in  Parliament  I  came  to  know  the  Honourable  Member 

Mataio  Aperau  as  a  hard-working  man  who  carried  out  his  work  as  a  Member  of 

Parliament quite seriously. He served his people and I also became quite close to him 

</span><span>in this short time we’ve been in Parliament.  I want to tell you, Mr Speaker, these two 

</span><span>Honourable Members are the only Honourable Members who have told me off in this 

House when the Honourable Member, Ngereteina Puna, was the Leader of the House 

and  position  of  the  Honourable  Member  Mataio  Aperau  was  Government  Whip.  I 

want  to  inform  you, Mr Speaker, that I did  learn a lot from  those scolding from  the 

</span><span>two  Honourable  Members.      I  want  to  thank  them,  I’m  sure,  Mr  Speaker,  I will not 

</span><span>come across any one else who will teach me as much as they have. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, Mr Speaker, I would like at this time to extend my congratulations to a great 

man of our country, Tupui Ariki Henry, who represented this country in events in New 

</span><span>Zealand where he won 3 gold medals and 1 bronze from track events in the 70+ age 

</span><span>group.  

</span></div><div><span>To close, Mr Speaker, I would like to  say to my electorate of Tupapa/Maraerenga, I 

trust that I have served you well. In my efforts to put my all in everything that I have 

done and to believe that what I have done is the best I could give to serve you.  I will 

not  hesitate  to  let  you  know  that  I  was  involved  with  the  Reform  process,  which 

affected  this  country  resulting  in  layoffs  from  the  Public  Service,  and  also  for  the 

many changes that occurred in many departments. I admit I was a part of this and I am 

not  ashamed  to  say  so  because  I  believed  it  was  necessary  for  the  benefit  of  this 

country. I feel for those who have suffered the consequences of those decisions and I 

also share their suffering. 

</span></div><div><span>I just want to let you know that this is the first time in 30 years that this has occurred 

to our country and we in Government realise that we will suffer the consequences of 

our actions at the coming elections, but that does not worry us. We did not avoid the 

difficult issues, we had to do what was right for the country as we head into the 21st 

century. We did our job to the best of our ability. True, we have been through better 

</span><span>times  under  a  different  Government,  but  we  are  now  in  difficult  times  and  it  was 

</span><span>necessary for these measures to be carried out in order to improve our situation.  

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned in the book of Ecclesiastes, there is a time for everything under the sun, 

there  was  a  time  when  the  economy  was  good,  the  people  were  happy,  but  when 

things  were  bad,  as  we  have  seen  in  the  last  two  years,  we  experienced  some 

difficulties.  Our  vision  for  the  near  future  is  that  the  economy  will  improve  and  we 

will be able to lift our heads up high and other countries will admire us for our ability 

to get ourselves out of our past difficulties.   

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to extend to my colleagues that will be running this same race in our 

constituency, to Meleaone Tumii and to Mr Eddie Drollet. I wish you both the best in 

to  my  people  of 

your  campaign  efforts 

</span></div><div><span>the  coming  election.  So, 

</span></div><div><span>for 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2129 

</span></div><div><span>Tupapa/Maraerenga, if you still have confidence in me and you would like me to be 

your  representative  again,  then  so  be  it.  Lastly,  I  would  like  to  wrap  up  my  speech 

with this Psalm, Psalm 22 verse 1 - </span><span>‘My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 

Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?’. Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Our time is up, the Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>LEADER OF THE HOUSE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this sitting be extended until the completion of the Honourable Members’ 

</span><span>Greetings to their respective Constituencies. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Leader of the House.  May I call for Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member U. Matata 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to?

Honourable Members.  I would like at this time, Mr Speaker, to support the views and 

the expressions of gratitude by Honourable Members who have spoken before me.  So 

</span><span>therefore, Mr Speaker, I’ll try and make my speech brief.</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  say  Greetings  to  my  electorate,  to  the  district  of  Puaikura,  Akaoa, 

Vaiakura, to Tinomana Ariki to the Aronga Mana of the district of Puaikura and also 

to the various religious organisations in my own electorate, I say Greetings to you all. 

I would like to greet the Mayor, the Vaka Councillors and the Village Committee and 

the  Councillors  of  Puaikura.  Just  because  Parliament  is  about  to  be  dissolved  it 

</span><span>doesn’t  mean  that  we  are  no  longer  Parliamentarians  and  we  will  no  longer  support 

</span><span>you  in  your  efforts  in  the  communities.  We  will  always  be  sharing  the  work  in  the 

Constituency.  I  wish  to  remind  the  people  of Puaikura that we will have a Working 

Bee to clean the road from Black Rock to Rutaki on Saturday.  This message will also 

come on television as a reminder.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  members  of  the  CIP  for  electing  me  to  represent  your 

interests in Parliament. Now that time has come to an end and the position will be put 

back into the hat so we can choose again who will represent you in Parliament. Today 

I  would  like  to  thank  you  all  for  your  support  over  the years. I would like to  say to 

every member thank you all for having confidence in me.  

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to say a few words on behalf of the Honourable Member, Boy Tepai, 

who is not present in Parliament today as he had another function to attend today, to 

the people of Ruaau, thank you on behalf of your Member. Thank you for having the
