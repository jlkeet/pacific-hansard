</span></div><div><span>MR  J.  MARURAI:  </span><span>I  was  talking  about  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  New 

Alliance Party. All of our hopes rest on this Executive Committee of the New Alliance 

Party.    I  will  leave  that  there  and  turn  to  my  island  of birth.  To Numangatini  Ariki, 

Kavana,  Aronga  Mana  of  Mangaia.  Greetings  to  you  all  in  the  grace  of  our  God.    I 

believe  that  we  will  carry  out  our  election  campaigns  over  the  next  3  months  with 

calmness. I believe also that whoever works hardest will take the crown. I will talk to 

my electorate of Ivirua, to  my Committee, to  you Nga and the Committee. I believe 

you  are  taking  it  easy  now  because  you  have  finished  all  your  preparations.  I  will 

come back tomorrow and we will meet on Friday.  I do not think we have much left to 

do. You have already told me we are okay.  

</span></div><div><span>To every one of us who will be involved in this race, although I am a NAP candidate, 

I trust each and every one of us will be returned here.  I wish, as already said by the 

Honourable  Member  Tom  Marsters,  although  we  argue  in  here,  when  we  meet 

outside, we are friends again. When we come back here next time some of us will be 

missing.  I trust those who replace them we will also become friends.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEWETT:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  Greetings  to  you  to  your  staff 

Members under your service.  On behalf of my wife and family, I extend to the Prime 

Minister, who has led us all this time you have done very well.  I want you to know 

you  have  the  confidence  of  my  people  right  up  to  this  day.    Greetings  also  to  the 

Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party, the Leader of the 

New  alliance  Party  and  your  Members.    I  would  like  at  this  time  to  take  the 

opportunity  to  thank  the  Leader  of  the  DAP  and  the  leader  of  the  NAP  for  their 

support  for  me  so  that  I  may  be  beside  my  wife  while  she  was  undergoing  medical 

treatment in New Zealand.  It is my belief we will all be brought back into this House 

</span><span>after the elections. I have no doubts, Mr Chairman, I will definitely be coming back.  

</span></div><div><span>At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  extend  my  thanks  and  Greetings  to  my  hard  working 

Committee in my constituency in Tautu-Vaipae-Vaipeka. I would like at this time to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2131 

</span></div><div><span>extend to my Chairman, Poona George and to my secretary, Temanu Unuka, and your 

families,  and  to  my  hard  working  committee  and  all  of  my  supporters,  for  the 

confidence they had in me, for putting me in this House since 1989.  

</span></div><div><span>What  I  will  do  in  our  first  meeting  when  come  back  during  campaign  time,  I  will 

account  for  all  the  work  I  have  carried  out  on  your  behalf  and  every  expense  that  I 

have incurred, on your behalf since 1989 until today.  

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  also  to  Manarangi  Ariki  and  your  spouse  and  to  the  Aronga  Mana  in  my 

electorate - Kia Orana to you all. Greetings also to the various religious organisations 

in my electorate of Tautu-Vaipae-Vaipeka and to the members in your organisations - 

Greetings to you all in the name of God. 

</span></div><div><span>May I also extend to my two colleagues, who will also be in this race ahead of us, to 

Nga Tuakura, and Kete </span><span>Ioane. The scriptural verse says, “many will run the race, but 

only  one  will  take  the  crown”.  Best  wishes  and  may  the  race  be  run  in  peace  and 

</span><span>kindness. I believe my people that we have had some rough times but we have come 

through  them.  We  must  realise  that  we  will  always  encounter  some  bad  times  and 

</span><span>some good times as we go through life.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to bring to you, my people, a saying from the great man Job. We know 

that Job was severely afflicted by disease yet he had been perfectly well prior to this. 

</span><span>He was a healthy person but was struck down with this disease, by God, to test Job’s 

</span><span>faith.  Although his wife tried to tempt him to curse the Lord before he died, he did 

</span><span>not. He replied gently, ‘is it only the good that we should thank God for and not</span><span> the 

</span><span>bad?’.  So I will ask the same question of you my people.  Is it only the good that we 

</span><span>will look at and not the bad? This is all I have to say to you - vote for Thomas Hewett 

and his Government in the days ahead of us. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to extend to the Honourable Member, Ngereteina Puna and 

the Honourable Member, Mataio Aperau who will be retiring soon, my best wishes for 

your retirement. I will miss them. This is one of the Ministers who have supported me 

in the works in my constituency.  Also the Honourable Member, Mataio Aperau who 

was  there  to  support  me  during  the  Constitution  Celebrations  in  Rarotonga.  

Nevertheless,  Mr  Speaker,  this  is  their  choice  as  we  go  ahead  and  I  believe  the 

Honourable Minister has put his confidence in this young man who is Teina Bishop.  

</span><span>And I would like to extend on behalf of the Honourable Member, Paora Teiti who is 

</span><span>committed to another errand, trying to get cargo on the plane to go to Aitutaki tonight.  

The Honourable Member, Paora Teiti is extending to you all his appreciation and that 

of his wife and his family, and to let you know also that you will meet him soon. 

</span></div><div><span>May I also extend to Tai Herman, of DAP, and to Jenny Shipley, both of whom are 

also  contesting the seat,  the best  wishes of Paora Teiti and myself. To the people of 

Amuri  Ureia,  Greetings  also  from  the  Honourable  Member,  Paora  Teiti.    So  to  my 

friend, John Tini, the Leader of the DAP has no faith in you, so come and join me in 

</span><span>my party. So, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to extend my Greetings to 

</span><span>my people and to tell them that on Friday we will be meeting again. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>2132 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  DEPUTY  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    The  Honourable 

Member, Mataio Aperau. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  M.  APERAU:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker.    To  the  Deputy  Speaker  and 

Speaker of the House, it is with sadness that I stand up to speak as this is my last time 

to  speak  in  Parliament,  I  would  like  to  say  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    And  to  all  staff 

Members, workers in the Parliament, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the  Cabinet  Ministers,  to  all 

Honourable Members on the Government side - Kia Orana 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  and  Deputy  Leader  and  to  your 

Members, to the Leader of the New Alliance Party and your Members - Kia Orana to 

you all and to our people who are listening in and I hope that they are listening in as 

we come to the end of Parliament this evening. 

</span></div><div><span>Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my 

people  of  Rangiatea.  On  behalf  of  my  wife,  my  family,  and  myself  I  would  like  to 

extend to you all my sincerest thanks for putting your confidence in me to represent 

your interests for the past 10 years in this Parliament. I believe I have accomplished 

most of that which I promised to do for you. To the Chairman and his wife of the hard 

working  committee  which  was  responsible  for  bringing  me  back  into  this  House,  I 

would like now to return the gratitude and say how grateful I am. 

</span></div><div><span>And  to  the  various  religious  organisations  in  our  village,  to  the  leaders  of  the 

Churches and to your congregations, I say Greetings to you all.  To the Ui Ariki, Pama 

Kainuku, and the Ui Mataiapo, I say Greetings to you also. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to turn to the Prime Minister of this country.  I would like to 

thank  you  and  the  Cook  Islands  Party  for  putting  your  confidence  in  me  and  for 

allowing  me  the  honour  of  working  alongside  you  for  10  years.  Even  though  I  just 

</span><span>came  out  of  the  bushes  you  didn’t  look  down  on  me.  To  you,  Mr  Prime  Minister, 

</span><span>thank you very much for the years that we have worked together. 

</span></div><div><span>Right  up until  the time that I worked together with  the Honourable Tom Marsters, I 

believe that the work we accomplished together - he has highlighted that. Today, I am 

working with the Deputy Prime Minister.  Therefore, I would like to give my sincerest 

thanks  to  these  Ministers  who  have  put  their  trust  in  me.  I  can  tell  you  now,  Mr 

Deputy Speaker, that I have been very happy over these last 10 years as I have worked 

for our country.  Today, maybe this afternoon, I will cross my legs take a very deep 

breath and let it out very slowly.  Again, I would like to thank you very much, also the 

thanks of my wife and our children, we would like to thank you very much for all that 

you have done.  I would like to say to you Honourable Member Ngamau Munokoa to 

say thank you for providing us all with food day in and day out without ever moaning 

about it.  Also to Mama Tere in the kitchen, thank you very much for looking after us 

all Members in this House.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  words  of  encouragement  to  all  Candidates  for the next  General 

Election  for  the  island  of  Rarotonga  and  also  for  the  Outer  Islands,  my  words  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2133 

</span></div><div><span>encouragement  to  you  all.    Also  the  candidates  who  come  after  me  for  the 

Constituency of Rangiatea, I would like to give my words of encouragement to you. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  give  my  words  of  thanks  to  the  Honourable  Minister,  Tupou 

Faireka, because we were representatives of our country as we sailed the seas to give 

our  protest  for  the  nuclear  weapons  testing  programme  by  France  in  Moururoa.  I 

would also like to tell your people, Honourable Member that you have fixed the water 

</span><span>problem in your area, which they have complained about for so long. You haven’t told 

</span><span>them that you have completed the water improvements f</span><span>or your constituency’s Water 

</span><span>Mains  from  Avana  to  Tupapa,  from  the  main  road,  the  back  road  and  also  the 

crossroads. Also some bad areas on the roads especially in the back roads in Tupapa, 

these have been upgraded.   

</span></div><div><span>At  this  point  in  time  I  would  like  to  thank  Honourable  Members  for  all  the  good 

wishes, the best wishes that you have given to myself and to my younger brother the 

Honourable Ngereteina Puna.   

</span></div><div><span>My  last  word  of  thanks  goes  to  my  wife  and  my  children  for  looking  after  me  well 

</span><span>over  the  years,  providing  me  with  clean  clothes,  feeding  me  and  sending  me  off  to 

</span><span>these meetings.  Thank you very much for what you have done and for your patience.  

</span><span>Our verse in closing, I would like to give to you is ‘I look to the mountains, do I find 

</span><span>help there? I find </span><span>help with the Lord who created the heavens and the earth’. Amen.  </span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Education, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to give my congratulations, my best 

wishes as we are doing at the moment.  As I saw my colleague the Honourable Mataio 

Aperau  rise,  I  thought  to  myself  this  is  our  chance,  we  will  give  our  best  wishes 

together and to the House.   

</span></div><div><span>In our lives as Politicians there are two very important areas, the two most important 

areas  for  a  Member  of  Parliament  would  be  the  maiden  speech  of  that  Member  of 

Parliament and also their final speech and I would like at this point to give my final 

Greetings and thank you to people.   So, I would like to ask Honourable Members if 

you really feel  sorry for us, for myself and the Honourable Member Mataio Aperau, 

we have ten raffle tickets left to sell for the Touch Association so please prove your 

sorrow by buying the last few tickets. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I would like to thank the Lord for giving me this opportunity, this time to be 

the Member of Parliament for my home island of Araura and also for my electorate of 

Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara. I spent five years as a Member for the island of Araura 

and 16 years as a Member for Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara.  I would like to give my 

thanks  to  the  people  of  Araura,  to  the  people  of  Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara  for 

putting me into this House as their representative.   

</span></div><div><span>In  this  time,  I  have  had  the  honour  to  serve  with  the  first  Prime  Minister  of  this 

country,  the  late  Sir  Albert  Henry,  and  also  I  had  the  honour  of  serving  with  my 

present Leader of today and my leader for nearly 15 years, the present Prime Minister 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>2134 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Sir Geoffrey Henry.  I would like to thank both of them, although Papa Arapati cannot 

hear  my  voice  but  his  children  can,  for  electing  me  as  the  representative  of  Araura 

Enua and the representative for Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara and for electing me as a 

Minister of our Cabinet.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  point  to  thank  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  of  the  last  10  years,  the 

Deputy Prime Minister, the Honourable Inatio Akaruru, the Honourable Vaine Tairea, 

the  Honourable  Tiki  Matapo,  the  Honourable  Pa  Pokino,  the  Honourable  Tepure 

Tapaitau, the Honourable Tupou Faireka and to my colleagues who were Ministers at 

one stage, the Honourable Tom Marsters and the Honourable Dr Joseph Williams.  I 

would like to thank the Lord for we have worked together for one purpose and that is 

to serve our people.  I would like to thank you, Mr Speaker, Papa Tuti Taringa, to all 

your  staff  and  to  all  Members  in  the  Opposition,  to  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic 

Alliance Party, to  the Leader of the New Alliance Party, to all my colleagues in our 

position, Kia Orana to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>To all my colleagues in the Government Caucus, I would like to thank you all as we 

have worked well together over the years.  I would also like to send separate Greetings 

</span><span>to  my  two  colleagues  from  my  island.  To  the  Honourable  Member  for  the 

</span><span>Constituency  of  Ureia  and  to  the  Honourable  Member  for  the  Constituency  of 

Vaipeka.  Kia Orana to you all.  This is the time for looking back and I would like to 

look back to the people who used to be people we looked up to in the CIP, like Harold 

Brown and Rima Brown, my sister and brother in law, they are well known as Mr and 

Mrs T.  To Papa Kiikore, and to Mama Varomana Charlie, thank you very much for 

everything  you  have  done  over  the  years.    I  would  like  on  behalf  of  my  wife  and 

family to thank two people who were like parents to us every time we returned to the 

home  island  To  my  brother  Tupuariki  and  your  wife,  Purotu  Puna.  Thank  you  very 

much for all the good things you have done and for looking after us over the years. 

</span></div><div><span>I cannot forget the person who nominated me when I first joined politics. I think I am 

the only person who was nominated by a king, the king of Britain, Papa King George, 

</span><span>and Papa George Kuraariki. These two have passed away now, it’s sad. Also to every 

</span><span>one of you who nominated me in the elections after that, five altogether, I would like 

to thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>To the elders in the CIP on Araura, in the electorate of Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara, to 

</span><span>those who have passed away like Mama Rikarika. It’s sad. To Papa Iosua Ka, an uncle 

</span><span>of mine, I am thinking of you although you have passed away. He was a great source 

of strength and encouragement to me in politics, thank you.  Thank you also to Papa 

and  Mama  Rani.  An  Aunty  of  mine,  Mama  Ti  Kuraariki.  Her  house  was  used  as 

campaign headquarters during the elections. It was close to the polling station but the 

electoral officer did not see us but we could see as the people came out after casting 

their votes. This way, we could work out who had not voted so we would chase them 

up. I would like to thank you for the use of your house over </span><span>the years, Mama. It’s sad. 

It’s true that they are no longer here with us to hear this message of thanks but their 

</span><span>children  are  listening.  These  people  were  the  founders,  the  source  from  which  the 

</span><span>Party emerged, the same way they are the source of these children - </span><span>‘te mato i pao ia 

mai ei ratou’. There is an old Aitutaki saying: “Oro koe ki Toreaiva, uri mai koe, te tu 

ua atu nei au.’. That is the way with the Cook Islands Party </span><span>- it is still standing.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2135 

</span></div><div><span>Also  to  another  aunty,  Mama  Metua  Tetevano  who  passed  away  recently.  She  has 

been an inspiration for me over the years. To Papa Solomona Tetevano, Kia Orana to 

you.  To all the elders who are still around, to Mama Maara in Nikaupara, to Mama 

</span><span>Tina who is in the hospital, how sad. To Mama ‘Right On’ a.k.a. Ma</span><span>ma Tapeka and to 

all the elderly supporters of the CIP too numerous to mention, please forgive me but I 

am unable to express my thanks to each of you individually because the first bell has 

rung already. My thanks to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>My  last  word  of  thanks  goes  to  my  beloved  wife  and  children  for  looking  after  me 

</span><span>over the years. I have a verse, taken from Ezekiel. This is God speaking; 17:23: “I will  

plant it on a high mountain, on Israel’s highest mountain.  It will grow branches, bear 

</span><span>seed,  and  become  a  magnificent  cedar.  Birds  of  every  kind  will  live  there  and  find 

</span><span>shelter in its shade”. To you my colleagues I would like you to be like this tall tree so 

</span><span>that as Honourable Members our people can come to you and this Honourable House 

of  Parliament  can  be  like  this  shady  tree.  These  are  my  words  of  encouragement  to 

you. To those of you contesting, I wish you all the best.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  my  congratulations  and  encouragement  to  Teina Bishop who is 

</span><span>going to be a candidate in the next general election. I encourage you. God bless you 

and help you win the race. I am sitting here to keep your seat warm. To all candidates 

from all parties, I hope the elections are contested in the spirit of true friendship and 

peace.  I  would  like  to  say  I  have  no  doubt  about  which  party  is  going  to  win  the 

election. It is unfortunate but there can only be one winner. Be strong my boy, Teina 

</span><span>Bishop. Hang on tight to that crown so it doesn’t fall into another hand. Again, I give 

</span><span>my thanks to everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> I rise, Mr Speaker, to support the Motion before the House. Before I 

go any further, I would like to give my thanks to these two Members of this House, to 

these two pillars of this House, to the Honourable Member, Ngereteina Puna and the 

Honourable Member, Mataio Aperau.  We have all heard the words of congratulations 

</span><span>that have been given to these two Members so I don’t want to repeat all of that but I 

</span><span>would like to remind us that this Honourable Minister has been our representative in 

the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.   I think he was the second person to 

represent our region and the first I believe was Iaveta Short.  I went with him to the 

Conference that was held in Malaysia and I was proud to see how he was honoured by 

Members  of  Parliament  throughout  the  region  for  the  good  way  and  the  upright 

manner  in  which  he  carried  out  his  responsibilities.  So  I  wanted  to  highlight  this  to 

show  our  people  that  this  Honourable  Minister  has  been  able  to  take the flag of the 

Cook  Islands  and  the  Region  to  these  big  regional  meetings  of  the  Commonwealth 

Association.  There are times that we have criticised him and I would like to tell him 

now that the majority of those times have just been in jest and I would also like to say 

that he is a Minister that we have all been able to respect. There are very few in this 

Parliament  that  we  could  say  the  same  about.    I  believe  it  will  be  very  hard  to  find 

somebody to replace him. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>2136 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  congratulate  and  to  thank  the  Honourable  Member,  Mataio 

Aperau.  We all know he is not a man of many words but he is a worker.  I think we 

all know - </span><span>I’m not too sure but I know </span><span>- that most of his work was not in this House 

but in his own constituency. When he became a Member of Parliament for Matavera 

we all saw the change in  the young people. The young people started to show some 

interest in their community and in the Church by becoming more active in those areas. 

</span></div><div><span>I have also seen him work alongside the Orometua to help solve a lot of the problems 

that the young people in his constituency have faced. I want to thank him for his work 

for our young people. Therefore, to my two colleagues, I would like to say thank you 

for being yourselves and for being fine examples not only for us in this House but for 

people in the whole country to look up to. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  send  my  Greetings  out,  Mr  Speaker,  to  all  the  people  in  the  Cook 

Islands  To  the  supporters  of  the  Democratic  Alliance, to  the supporters of the Cook 

Islands Party, to everyone in this country - Kia Orana to you all.  To all the different 

title-holders and to all the children, Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  send  separate  Greetings  out  to  my  constituency  on  the  island  of 

</span><span>Rakahanga.  To all the people on the island, title and non-title holders - to the Ariki 

Tewhakaheo  and  your  good  wife  and  to  your  children  -  Kia  Orana.  To  the  Ui 

Mataiapo, the Ui Rangatira on the island, to the religious organisations - Kia Orana to 

</span><span>you all.  To all the different organisations on the island. I’m not saying</span><span> goodbye to my 

people.  I am saying Kia Orana to you all.  We meet today over the air and maybe very 

soon in the very near future we will be able to meet in person.  I would like to thank 

you  for  coming  up  with  the  idea  that  you  will  have  only  one  candidate  in  this  next 

General Election so I would like to thank you for this good spirit that you have. 

</span></div><div><span>I come back now to this House, to all the Honourable Members of this House.  It is 

that time again where we are not too sure who is going to be returned to the House and 

</span><span>who isn’t. I would just like to remind us that this is the time that is given to our people 

</span><span>to select who will return and who will not but I believe that we will all come back into 

this House except for our two colleagues who have decided to retire. I think the rest of 

us,  should  all  be  encouraged  because  it  is  nearly  that  time  again  when we go to  the 

polls.    The  only  difference,  I  think  is,  when  we  come  back  it  will  be  with  a  new 

Government  because  it is  time for a change.  So, if it is  that wa</span><span>y, then please don’t 

</span><span>worry  about  it because this Government  has  had ten years, it is  time for a change. I 

</span><span>think the important thing here is to remember that we have done what is best for our 

country and for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>To  you,  Mr  Speaker,  thank  you  for  the way you ran our meetings although some of 

</span><span>these things haven’t been too good. Thank you for all the good things you have done.  

</span><span>Thank  you  also  to  your  staff,  to  the  Clerks,  to  the  Interpreters,  to  our  staff  in  the 

kitchen.  Thank you very much.  I think, for the Members and for everybody, the last 

couple of days have been very tiring for everybody as we have had three sittings per 

</span><span>day.  I think if we work this hard all the time then our people will not moan about us 

</span><span>not  doing  anything.    I  waited  for  somebody  to  congratulate  the  House  through  the 

newspaper for the good work that this House has been doing over the last couple of 

</span><span>days, but still there has been no thanks. But that doesn’t matter because we all work in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2137 

</span></div><div><span>the hope that what we are doing is for the good of our people and for the good of our 

country.  Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  again  I  would  like  to  thank  you.  To  all  the 

Honourable Members of this House and to our people, thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker, in the 

name of our Lord, to all the staff of this House, to the 2 Clerks, to all the rest of the 

staff, to the staff in the kitchen, to the groundsman, Kia Orana to you all.  Kia Orana 

to  the  Prime  Minister  of  this  country  today  who  I  believe  is  a  good  Leader  and  a 

source of pride for us as he goes to meetings overseas. Greetings also to his wife and 

the rest of the family.  To the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party Honourable Dr 

Terepai  Maoate  and  his  good  wife,  Kia  Orana  to  you,  to  the  Leader  of  the  New 

Alliance Party Honourable Norman George and his good wife, Kia Orana to you.  Kia 

Orana  also  to  my  colleagues  in  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  Kia  Orana  also  to  all  the 

Honourable Members on both sides of the House, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to take some time, Mr Speaker, to give my special congratulations to the 

2  Members  who  have  indicated  their  retirement,  that  is  the  Honourable  Minister 

Ngereteina Puna and the Honourable Member Mataio Ape</span><span>rau.  I don’t think there are 

</span><span>any  words  that  I  could  use  to  show  my  respect  and  thanks  to  the  two  Honourable 

Members.  

</span></div><div><span>To the Honourable member, Ngereteina Puna, we all know his energetic style in this 

House. We are aware of the good work that he has done in this House. I would like to 

tell  everyone  of  the  good  work  that  he  has  done  as  a  Cabinet  Minister  and  also  the 

trust  that  the  Prime  Minister  has  in  him.  Anything  his  colleagues  in  Cabinet  have 

given him, he has been able to carry to the end. I would like to say, Mr Speaker, that 

this is one Minister that I have been dependent on for a lot of things a lot of times. I 

am able to trust him to do things. Therefore, to you my colleague, the closest thing I 

can think of to express my deepest gratitude to you is to say to you, Ata Wai Wolo my 

friend. (Thank you in Pukapukan).  

</span></div><div><span>To my colleague, Mataio Aperau, the Honourable Member for Matavera, it is so sad.  

Everytime we give him something to do from Cabinet, we know it will be done to our 

satisfaction  because  he  has  assisted  the  Prime  Minister,  he  has  assisted  the 

Honourable  Tom  Marsters,  and  he  is  now  assisting  me.    As  he  does  his  work,  we 

know that in the past Assistant Ministers used to be paid, but these days we know that 

they are no longer paid, This man does it for the love of the job. The only thing for 

him is that the job is done. When you give something to him to do it is done. As was 

shown to us by the Honourable Member for Murienua Tom Marsters, this is also what 

I  have  seen  with  this  Honourable  Member.  You  discuss  with  him  something  that  is 

required, something that needs to be done and you leave it all up to him knowing full 

well,  that  whatever  you  have  discussed  with  him,  it  will  be  achieved.  I  feel  sorry,  I 

</span><span>don’t  really  want  to  lose  him.    Those  are</span><span>  my  words  of  encouragement  to  the  two 

Honourable  Members.  May  the  Lord  help  you  in  the  days  ahead  during  your 

retirement. May he look after you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>2138 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Today, the Queen’s Representative gave us notice that this Parliament is going to be 

</span><span>dissolved.  This  means  we  are  no  longer  Members  of  Parliament.  Looking  at  the 

Honourable  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House  today,  Mr  Speaker,  I  see  that  our 

time has come and we are to be judged by our people. There are those who will blame 

and there will be those who will support us. On the day of the election is the Day of 

Judgment. Our people will give us a verdict as to whether we served them well or not.  

Therefore, I would like to encourage each and everyone of us as we put ourselves in 

front of our people and let them judge us on the day of the election. 

</span></div><div><span>At this point, Mr Speaker, I would like to send my Greetings out to the people in my 

constituency on the island of Pukapuka and the island of Nassau, Kia Orana to you all 

in the name of our Lord.  I would also like to give my thanks to all the Cook Islands 

Party Supporters on my two islands or in my constituency for giving me their support 

as  their  Member  of  Parliament  as  their  representative  since  1968  up  until  today.  

Thank  you  very  much  to  my  people  for  your  support, for your trust  in  me and I am 

certain that you are happy with the way that I have served you over the years.  I would 

also like to agree with your request that I should not retire in this General Election.  So 

may the Lord bless and keep you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  send  my  Greetings  out  to  the  candidate  for  the  Democratic 

Alliance Party in my constituency to Mr Tiaki Wuatai. Kia Orana to you my son and 

you will see very soon exactly what the world of politics is all about, but I would like 

to say to you, be patient, be humble so that God will help you. To you and those of our 

people  who  are  supporting  you,  I  would  like  to  give  my  Greetings  to  you  all  and  I 

hope these elections go well. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  my  thanks,  Mr  Speaker,  to  everyone  here,  we  all  come  in  here 

looking good, doing what we are supposed to be doing. I would like to thank the Lord 

for  the  spouses  of  all  the  Members  of  Parliament  who  have  patience  and  who  have 

helped us Members of Parliament as we go about the work that is required of us. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  a  time  we  would  like  the  leaders in  our religious  organisations to  be able to 

help keep the peace.  This is a time when people change.  I would like to give thanks 

to you all and to the Members of your congregations.  I would like to give thanks to 

the central committee of the CIP.  To the Members of the Executive, to the Members 

of  the  Central  Committee.    It  is  up  to  you  to  plan  how  we  are  to  be  successful.    I 

</span><span>would like to give Greetings and encouragement to you to work hard for the general 

</span><span>election.   

</span></div><div><span>To close, Mr Speaker, may I remind every one who is going to be in the race of the 

</span><span>words that Jesus  spoke, which is  relevant  to  us:  “If one of you wants  to  be great he 

</span><span>must be the servant of the rest.  If one of you wants to be the first he must be the slave 

</span><span>of all.”  For even the son of man did not come to be served, he came to serve and to 

</span><span>give  his  life  to  redeem  many  people.    I  believe  these  words  our  Lord  said  are 

appropriate for each of us as we move towards the election.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  I  would  like  to  send  my  Greetings  to  all  the  people  of  this 

country  especially  those  who  have  supported  and  encouraged  me  in  this Parliament.   

What  you  have  done  is  allow  me  to  reach  a  maturity  that  I  have  not  experienced 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2139 

</span></div><div><span>previously.  That is the maturity to respect others of dissimilar political opinions.  If 

we continue to respect our fellow men we will grow to be a better nation.  I would like 

to thank the people of Manihiki for giving me the opportunity to represent them in this 

Parliament.  To  the  Ui  Ariki,  Aronga  Mana,  and  all  the  people  of  Manihiki,  not 

forgetting my strong supporters, the people who have worked hard to make it possible 

for me to be elected as Member of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  Mr  Tangiatua  and  Solomona  Toroma  of  Manihiki  and  their 

committees.  These are two people who engineered my success, with the help of our 

supporters  in  the  last  general  election.    Not  forgetting  the  support  from  my  own 

family.  I would like to thank all of them for what they have done.  Thank you to all 

the  Members  of  Parliament  for  showing  me  the  support  required  of  a  leader.  

Especially  from  yourself,  Mr  Speaker,  and  your  staff.  It  is  only  through  experience 

that we learn. I would like to give a special thank you to all Democratic Alliance Party 

supporters throughout the Cook Islands and in New Zealand, especially the leader of 

this political party, the Honourable Terepai Maoate, and Caucus Members Dr Pupuke 

Robati and Aunty Mau. Even though there is only four of us we stayed together as a 

united small team.  The large number in the CIP who is governing now outnumbered 

</span><span>us.      I  do  not  think  we  have  failed  to  represent  the  views  of  the  Opposition  in  this 

</span><span>House. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  say  thank  you  to  the  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  and  his 

colleagues  the  Honourable  Upoko  Simpson  and  Jim  Marurai.  To  all  Government 

Members for the excellent fellowship in this House.  As previously stated by a former 

speaker, our people might think we are fighting here, let me assure our people - it is 

only in  words  -  the  minute we step out of the House we are one family, a family of 

parliamentarians.  It is nice to see Parliament carry on this tradition.  I wish the new 

parliamentarians should carry on the same tradition.  It is my hope that those who are 

successful will do a better job than we have done in the past five years. 

</span></div><div><span>I  say  farewell  to  the  Honourable  Minister  Ngereteina  Puna  and  the  Honourable 

Member Mataio Aperau, your decision not to run in the next election has shown our 

people that you are gentlemen and you are bowing out gracefully. All I can wish you is 

the  best  for  the  future  and  you  go  knowing  you  have  served  your  people  well.  Not 

often do we have the opportunity to express our good wishes when Members are still 

alive.  Many times we express our gratitude when they have already passed away so 

</span><span>my  best  wishes  and  that  of  my  wife  and  children  goes  to  the both  of you, to  fellow 

</span><span>parliamentarians, and to the people of the country, thank you very much. 

I wish everybody all the best. God bless you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Honourable Minister, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker.  To the staff of this Honourable 

House,  Kia  Orana  in  the  name  of  Our  Lord.    Special  Greetings  to  the  Honourable 

Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey, to the Deputy Prime Minister, my colleagues in Cabinet 

and to the Members of Government, to the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable 

Dr Terepai Maoate and your Members, and to the Leader of the New Alliance Party, 

the Honourable Member, Norman George and your Members - Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>2140 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>To our people listening in to this last meeting in this Session of Parliament, Kia Orana 

to you all in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>To  my  people  in  my  constituency  of  Titikaveka,  to  the  Aronga  Mana,  the  Ui 

Mataiapo,  the  Ui  Rangatira,  to  the  leaders  in  the  religious  sector, to  all the people  - 

Kia Orana to you all.  To all the Mama and to all the Papa in my constituency - Kia 

Orana to you all and may the Lord be there to help you along.  Kia Orana also to all 

the young people, to all the young men and women, to all the children - Kia Orana to 

you  all.    Kia  Orana  also  to  all  our  papaa  friends  who  have  chosen  to  live  in  our 

constituency - Kia Orana to you all.  I would like to thank the Lord for all the times 

that we have worked together for the benefit of our people and community. 

</span></div><div><span>Special Greetings, Mr Speaker, goes to my Pastor, Pastor Pere and his good wife and 

their  family.    To  all  the  Pastors  and  to  the  congregation  of  the  Apostolic  Church 

throughout the Cook Islands - Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>And lastly, Mr Speaker, I would like to give my thanks to my wife and to our children, 

those  on  the  island  and  those  overseas.    I  would  like  to  thank  you  very  much  for 

</span><span>looking after me over the years to this very day. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Lord for this opportunity to be able to meet with my people 

over the air this afternoon.  I will never forget and have never forgotten that you have 

given me the opportunity to serve you, my people, in this House.  The fact that there 

are  different  political  organisations  in  our  community,  Mr  Speaker,  has  not  been  a 

worry to us as we have worked together with the Opposition up to today.  Each person 

has the right to choose their political affiliation but this has not caused any separation 

in  the  people,  Mr  Speaker.  It  has  caused  us  to  work  together  for  the  benefit  of  the 

community. 

</span></div><div><span>We  all  know  that  Parliament  will  be dissolved today, at  the end of today’s business 

</span><span>and it will not be long before there will be a General Election and Members will be 

elected  into  this  House.    We  have  to  work  together  now  and  also  right  up  until  the 

General Election. So we shall continue serving until such time the people decide at the 

elections whether they want us back. In the meantime, we should continue to uphold 

the  Word  of  God.  My  verse  comes  f</span><span>rom  Romans,  15:1:  “We  who  are  strong  in  the 

faith ought to help the weak to carry their burdens. We should not please ourselves.” </span></div><div><span>Greetings to every one, may God bless you all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Greetings  to  you  Mr  Speaker.    Greetings  to  all  staff 

Members  in  the  House  and  Greetings  also  to  all  Honourable  Members.    Maybe  at 

times,  Mr  Speaker,  I  have  been  disorderly  in  the  House  and  even  to  the  extent  of 

having you order me out of the House but I thank you anyhow for bearing with me. 

</span></div><div><span>And to all Honourable Members, to the Prime Minister, to the Deputy Prime Minister, 

to Cabinet Ministers and to all Honourable Members. If I have been harsh during our 

time of debate, I pray that you will just bear with me. This is the part we play and we 

</span></div><div><a>Page 36</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2141 

</span></div><div><span>must play our part in order to help our country.  Greetings to you all and to your wives 

and your families. Greetings in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  also  to  the  Queen’s  Representative,  Sir  Apenera  Short  and  to  Lady S</span><span>hort, 

Mama  Teaia  Mataiapo.    Although  they  have  aged,  they  are  always  there,  wherever 

they are required and always ready to  carry out  the calling they have been called to.  

They  are  a  couple  of  people  whom  I  love  very  much  and  I  give  to  them  special 

Greetings, and to their children also.  And without forgetting Papa Tangaroa who was 

</span><span>the former Queen’s Representative and to his wife who has just passed away. To him 

</span><span>and his children, may God bless you.  

</span></div><div><span>To the Leader of the New Alliance Party, the Honourable Member, Norman George, 

to  his  Deputy,  the  Honourable  Member,  Jim  Marurai  and  to  the  Honourable  Upoko 

Simpson  -  Greetings  to  you  in  the  name  of  Our  Lord.    And  I  thank  all  of  us,  the 

Honourable Members on the Opposition side because I believe and trust that we have 

worked together a lot of times in order to pull Government back on the right track to 

help  our  country.  Greetings  also  to  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance 

Party,  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Robert  Woonton  and  the  Papa  of  the  Party,  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Dr  Pupuke  Robati.  Greetings  also  to  our  dear  sister,  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member  Aunty  Mau  Munokoa.  Also  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  Honourable 

Members  in  the  Opposition  for  the  support  they  have  given  me,  also  the  support  of 

their families. I thank you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would also  like at  this  time also,  to  give my appreciation  and gratefulness to  Papa 

Tom the Patron of the Democratic Alliance Party and to the President, Fred Goodwin, 

the  General  Secretary  Aporo  Dean,  for  the  great  work  they  are  doing  in  the 

Democratic Party Committee.  I would like to extend special Greetings to Pa Tepaeru 

Upokotini Marie Ariki, the President of the House of Ariki and to all Members of the 

House of Ariki on the island of Rarotonga and in the Outer Islands, I extend to you all 

my  thanks  and  Greetings.  To  the  Aronga  Mana  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga  and  the 

Outer Islands of the Cook Islands, Greetings to you all.  To the Mayors of the southern 

group in the Mayoral Forum in Atiu, Greetings to you all and to all Island Councillors 

and  Mayors  in  the  Northern  Groups  and  the  Southern  Groups,  Greetings  to  you  all 

also.   

</span></div><div><span>To the churches in our country, we should appreciate the service they have provided 

</span><span>and for committing themselves in prayer for us and for helping us, for encouraging us 

</span><span>in our various endeavours in the service of our country.  I hear Honourable Members 

quoting from the Bible and appreciating God for what God has done for them, I really 

appreciate all these. We should thank God overall and for us to  believe in our heart 

that  it  was  God  who  called  us  into  this  place  to  serve  his  people.    We  have  to  ask 

ourselves, who am  I to  be in  the position that I have and why am I elected into this 

Honourable House?  Is it because of my knowledge, it is because of the honour given 

to me, it is because of love, is it to serve? It is my own belief, Honourable Members, 

</span><span>this is God’s doing. We have to bear in mind that it was God who has given us this 

</span><span>talent and let us not forget that.   So we should acknowledge and thank God for all that 

</span><span>he has done for us, so we shall look forward to His call to represent the interests of our 

people in this House after the coming election.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 37</a></div><div><span>2142 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>To the two Honourable Members, the Honourable Minister, Ngereteina Puna and the 

Honourable Member Mataio Aperau, thank you for utilising the talent that you were 

</span><span>given. If they have made use of it, praise them and if they haven’t made use of it, let 

</span><span>praise them also.  The sad thing is a lot of us may not return to this House, not because 

</span><span>we didn’t use our talents. Mr Spe</span><span>aker, if we do return we should make the most of our 

</span><span>talents while we are in the House. For those who don’t make it back, may God bless 

</span><span>them. As for those who will be returned, may God bless you too as you carry out your 

work for the benefit of the country.  

</span></div><div><span>This  time,  I  would  like  to  send  Greetings  to  our  young  people  and  to  the  various 

sporting  bodies  in  our  country,  together  with  all  church  organisations,  uniform 

organisations. I would like to extend to you all my acknowledgment of your services.  

And </span><span>to all Womens’ Organisations in our country, Greetings to you all.</span></div><div><span>I would like to bring to our attention in this Honourable House that there would be 2 

women who will run in the race in the Democratic Alliance Party. I would like also to 

extend  my  words  of  encouragement  and  Greetings  to  all  Democratic  Alliance  Party 

supporters all over the Cook Islands.  I encourage all the Democratic Party Committee 

</span><span>and Candidates who will be running in this next election. We will meet very soon. To 

</span><span>all  Executive  Officers  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  supporters  on  the  island  of 

</span><span>Rarotonga,  those  who  are  always  present  in  our  meeting  and  where  ever  there’s  a 

</span><span>gathering, I would like to say thank you for your support. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to my Ui Ariki in my electorate and to the Aronga Mana and my supporters.  

I  ask  you  to  bear  with  me  because  all  this  time I have been representing you, it has 

been in the Opposition and we have become aware that there is not much I have been 

able to achieve for you from the Government. I hope that through prayer we will be 

successful this time around. 

</span></div><div><span>May I send special Greetings to all Cook Island Party Supporters, New Alliance Party 

Supporters and Independence Supporters all over the Cook Islands. May I ask them to 

give  my  Party  the  opportunity  to  run  this  country  and  to  prove  ourselves  to  you.  I 

believe  Mr  Speaker  that  will  be  our  Party  who  will  be  in  the  right  position,  in  the 

better position to run our country in the future. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  my  own  wife,  and  my  children  and  my 

</span><span>family for their support while I was in politics.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you, Kia Orana to all 

Honourable  Members  of  this House, Kia Orana also  to  our people listening in  to  us 

this evening. First  of all, I would like to  bring to  you the best  wishes of the Mayor, 

Island  Council,  Aronga  Mana  of  the  island  of  Pukapuka  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  to  the 

Ministers  in  this  House,  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  to  all  Members  of  this 

Honourable House, Kia Orana to you from the people of Pukapuka. 

</span></div><div><span>During our very enjoyable meeting that we had, the people and the Mayor asked me to 

pass  on  their  best  wishes.  Same  also  from  the  island  of  Manihiki  and  the  island  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 38</a></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>2143 

</span></div><div><span>Penrhyn.  From the Mayor of the island of Penrhyn, the Island Council, Aronga Mana, 

religious organisations, and the people of Omoka and Tetautua, I bring you their best 

wishes.  I would like to send my Greetings to the people of the Northern islands, to the 

central  Government  Representatives;  the  acting-Government  Representative  on 

Pukapuka,  the  Government  Representative  on  Penrhyn,  although  he  was  not  there it 

was  his  home  we  used  while  we  were  on  his  island,  and  to  all  those  people  who 

helped  us,  thank  you  all  very  much.  To  the  Island  Councillors  on  Manihiki  Petuera 

Kora and Mona Toroma who looked after us while we were on their island, I send my 

Greetings to you. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  bring  the  best  wishes  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of 

Samoa, to you, Mr Speaker, and to all the people of this country.  The Prime Minister 

sends his best wishes and thanks to us because we have given our condolences to them 

on the passing away of their former Prime Minister, Tofilau Eti Alesana. We all know, 

Mr Speaker, that their former Prime Minister was a very hard working man who did a 

lot  to  serve  his  people.  I  was  at  the  state  memorial  service  held  in  Samoa  at  the 

Parliament  building  and  at  the  funeral  service  in  the  new  church  which  the  Prime 

Minister built on Mt. Vaea.  

</span></div><div><span>We have heard the notice that has been given to us from the Queen’s Representative 

</span><span>which tells us this is the last day this Parliament will meet and a new Parliament is to 

be elected. I look  back and it seems  like only yesterday we came into this House as 

Members of Parliament. The time has passed so quickly it seems like only yesterday.  

Over the last five years we have gone through many changes. The time of hurricanes, 

the time of calms.  We know over the last few years there have been changes in the 

way  the  country  has  been  run  that  have  never  been  seen  before.    We  have  found  in 

these  times  that  we  have  had  to  take  stock  of  what  we  are doing in  Parliament. We 

have  to  look  at  what  we  are  doing  as  a  Government  and  what  we  will  be  doing 

tomorrow.  Over this period of five years we have had to look very carefully at ways 

of  strengthening  the  country  to  ready  ourselves  for  the  year  2000.    There  has  never 

been another time in the history of this country that we have had to look as carefully 

as  we  have  at  the  way  the  country  is  progressing,  since  the  country  became  self-

governing in 1965. 

</span></div><div><span>In the period from 1965 to 1968 Government was dreaming of what the country would 

become in the future. At that time we were just opening the door to self-government. 

</span><span>In opening this door, we found it was not going to be an easy road to go along. This 

</span><span>has been the same for the last three years.  It has been hard for us to try to put down a 

foundation in order to build a very strong house for the country for the future. Tears 

have  flowed.  There  have  been  times  when  we  have  been  angry  with  one  another. 

There have been criticisms not only in the House but also over the airwaves and in the 

newspaper.  Some people have been saddened and this has strengthened some.  As we  

meet  with  our  people  in  meetings,  we  have  found  out  exactly  what  our  people  are 

thinking. These three years have been a time when most of our people were involved 

in carving a canoe for the future of this country. This has not been an easy track, we 

</span><span>all know it is not something we have done easily. The important thing is we have set 

</span><span>the direction for us to follow. With strength and courage, we can do it together. May 

the  Lord  be  thanked  for  giving  this  small  country  a  challenge,  for  giving  us  proper 

</span></div><div><a>Page 39</a></div><div><span>2144 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>direction. It is true we have talked about each other and bad-mouthed each other. The 

important thing is we have left it behind us and moved on. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  come  across  instances  in  this  House  where  people  are  arguing  and  getting 

mad and you can see the veins coming out in the neck because they are so angry.  The 

ears go red and their eyes are red and glaring. But after this anger has passed, we all 

become human again and realise that we are servants of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  special  Greetings  to  my  colleagues,  Mr  Speaker,  to  the 

Honourable  Minister,  Ngereteina  Puna  and  to  the  Honourable  Assistant  Minister, 

Mataio  Aperau.  Mr  Speaker,  they  have  chosen  to  withdraw  from  this  political  race.  

This, Mr Speaker, is the last day that they will be seen in these seats that their people 

have elected them into.  There will be others that will follow, Mr Speaker, but history 

will always tell us that that is the seat of the Honourable Member, Mataio Aperau and 

that  is  the  seat  that  was  used  by  the  Honourable  Minister,  Ngereteina  Puna. 

Generations will follow, Mr Speaker, but they will know that these two seats are the 

seats  of  two  Members  that  were  elected.    They  did  not  bring  their  seats  and  just 

acquire  these  seats,  Mr  Speaker,  they  were  elected  into  these  seats.    I  know,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, that in the past as they have worked with me, as they have worked with each 

</span><span>other  and  as  they  have  worked  with  their  colleagues  in  Cabinet,  that  I  know,  Mr 

Speaker,  that  they  have  done  their  work  very  diligently.  For  them,  the  appropriate 

</span><span>verse is: ‘thou faithful servant, it is now time for you to come to me’, that is, for you 

</span><span>to go back to your people and there you will see how happy your people are with you. 

I wish to leave this prayer with you, your wives and your children and grandchildren 

as you travel the deserts and the valleys of this world that the staff of the Lord be with 

you  at  all  times.  I believe also  that we will not  drift  apart.  We will still be friends.  

The friendship that we have forged will remain today and in the future. 

</span></div><div><span>Those of us in this Honourable House who will be in the contest for the next General 

Elections, may the good Lord be with us all. And to all those, Mr Speaker, who intend 

to be in this race in the next couple of months, to all three political parties and also, 

Mr  Speaker,  to  the  independents  who  also  intend  to  be  in  the  race,  I  would  like  to 

</span><span>hope that the good Lord be with you all.  My wish, Mr speaker, is that we don’t tell 

lies  to  our  people.    Don’t  try  and  make  things  up  that  are  not  true.    Don’t  try  and 

</span><span>change t</span><span>he pawpaw into a coconut tree.  Don’t try and make trouble where there is no 

</span><span>trouble.  By doing these things, by telling the truth, we will ensure that the race that 

</span><span>we are going into will be a peaceful one. 

</span></div><div><span>To the people of my constituency, the length and the breadth of my constituency, from 

the mountain of Te Kou to the seas, from Tupapa down to Ruatonga, this is a Tapere 

Ariki  in  this  country.    To  the  Aronga  Mana,  to  all  the  different  organisations  in  my 

</span><span>constituency, to the young people, to the women’s</span><span> organisations - this is the time that 

we as Members of Parliament give you, our people, our best wishes. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank you, the people of my constituency, for giving me this mantle of 

</span><span>leadership, five years, ago to wear. So, I would like to give my thanks to everyone in 

</span><span>this House, Mr Speaker, to everyone that is intending to compete in this race that we 

are going for. We all know that we as human will go through this race but the result is 

in the hands of the Almighty.

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank you Mr Speaker and to all the staff of this Honourable House for 

all the work that you have done over the last five years. I would like to apologise, Mr 

Speaker  for  our  sometimes  stubborn  and  childish  behaviour  over  the  last five years. 

May God bless you and your wife after the dissolution of this Parliament. Thank you, 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Prime  Minister.    Before  we  close  for  tonight,  I 

would like to send some Greetings myself. To the Prime Minister, to the two Leaders 

of the Opposition, to all Honourable Members of this House, Kia Orana in the name 

of  Our  Lord.    I  would  also  like  to  send  my  best  wishes  to  your  spouses  if  they  are 

listening in - Kia Orana also to them.  Kia Orana also to all the people of this country, 

</span><span>to  the  Papa’a  and  the  M</span><span>aori,  the  Aronga  Mana  of  this  country,  to  all  the  religious 

organisations in this country, if you are listening in this evening, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  special  greetings  out  to  the  Honourable  Member  Mama  Mau 

Munokoa as you are the only woman Member of Parliament. I would like to say Kia 

Orana to  you Mama Mau.  The way that you have looked after the Members of this 

House and also the staff of this House, by providing them with food. I would like to 

give  you  the  thanks  of  the  staff  of  this  House  and  also  the  Members  of  this  House.  

This  is  a time, Honourable Members, that we can reflect  on the things that we have 

done  and  to  weigh  them  up  on  proper  scales,  not  on  Monkey  scales  but  to  actually 

weigh up whether we have done all that we set out to do over the last five years.   

</span></div><div><span>This is not just for the Honourable Members of this House, but this is for everybody in 

this country who have any type of title or position and who is working for the benefit 

of  this  country.    Honourable  Members,  if  you  have  done  everything  properly,  our 

people will know and they are watching you. I know you will have no problem.  But if 

</span><span>you haven’t, then they will look away from you.  It doesn’t matter what you have been 

</span><span>elected to do, this is the time to apologise to the people. I have been listening and have 

been  reading  the  complaints  of  a  few  people  about  Honourable  Members  of  this 

House.   Some have tried to degrade the position of this Office by trying to reduce the 

number  of  Members  of  Parliament  of  this  country.  </span><span>I’m  certain  that  if  they  were  a 

</span><span>Member  of  Parliament  today  they  would  not  be  agreeing  to  this  idea  to  reduce  the 

numbers of Member of Parliament. I am certain that these people who are trying to do 

these  things  are  people  who  would  not  get  elected  by  the  people  of  our  country  as 

Members of Parliament.  But whose fault is that? It is their own.  Even though some 

</span><span>Members  of  Parliament  are  in  some  cases  ignorant,  and  even  though  some  of  them 

</span><span>have tattered diplomas, and some may not have had a full education, our people have 

seen them at work and they are satisfied with them. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  two  Honourable  Members  who  will  be  retiring  in  this next  election, I would 

</span><span>like to give and my staffs’ thanks. I would like to tell you two that this step you have 

</span><span>taken will be sad because you have been used to working everyday. But nevertheless, 

</span><span>God’s bounty is everywhere, it is just up to us to go and look for it.</span></div><div><span>To  end  my  message  to  you  Honourable  Members  of  this  House,  if  there  has  been  a 

</span><span>time that any Member in this House has been hurt by the way that I have conducted 

the business of this House, then I would like to apologise to that Member. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 41</a></div><div><span>2146 

</span></div><div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  say  a  special  thanks  to  the  Honourable  Members  of  this  House  for 

giving me this title, this office for the last 5 years.  Because you have given me this 

office without qualms. To the Government, I would like to thank you for this honour 

which I have today. Because of this Honourable Office that you have bestowed upon 

me, I have been able to receive other Honourable titles from throughout the world.  I 

was asked about 2 years ago to leave our country and to go to Britain and work for an 

Honourable Organisation there. But I did not look at myself, I looked at this country 

and  I  promised  that  I  would  stay  and  try  to  help  to  bring  our  country  out  of  the 

economic doldrums that we were in.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to send separate Greetings out to the Queen’s Representative and Mama 

</span><span>Maui.  May the Good Lord bless and keep us all Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask an Honourable Member to please close us with a prayer?
