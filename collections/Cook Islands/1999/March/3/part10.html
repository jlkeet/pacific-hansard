<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>We will postpone the clauses of the Bill and deal with the 

Schedules.  Schedule No.1. Agriculture.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $490,280 for Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>PERCA. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $388,000 for PERCA stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>I  am  saddened  because  you  did  not  look  my  way  when 

putting  the  Agriculture  Vote  Item,  Mr  Speaker.    Nevertheless  you  have  made  your 

</span><span>decision but I am saddened because this is one of the most important Vote Items that 

</span><span>should be discussed. 

</span></div><div><span>Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, I think this is an area that PERCA would be able to look 

into as to how we are going about our business.  So I rise now, Mr Speaker, to support 

the  Vote  Item  for  PERCA  because  I  know  they  are  doing  a  good  job  and  trying  to 

illuminate for us areas that need to be looked into.  They will also be required to look 

into  the  area  of  Agriculture  because  this  is  important  where  we  are  able  to  bring 

finances into our country.  If we are successful in the Agriculture sector, we are then 

</span><span>able  to  ex</span><span>port  our  produce.    Therefore  earning  new  cash  into  our  country  but  that’s 

</span><span>okay, Mr Chairman.  This is an area that the Democratic Alliance Party would like to 

strengthen in order to improve our Agriculture sector. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>1658 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  happy  with  the  Report  that  PERCA  has  been  presented  to  this  House,  Mr 

Chairman,  but  the  sad  part  is  that  we  have  not  been  able  to  adhere  to  the 

recommendations made by these PERCA Reports. 

</span></div><div><span>I can recall also the Report brought about in regard to the Housing Corporation.  They 

have  reported  all  the  problems  they  have  come  across  and  the  last  Government 

suffered by it.  This is one of the most important departments that we ever have most 

especially  for  our  young  married  couples  with  children.  This  should  have  been  an 

opportunity for them to  build  something for themselves but  they have to go through 

the hard way nowadays in order to get what they wanted.  This is one of the very few 

reports  submitted  by  the  PERCA.  PERCA  also  made  another  Report  regarding 

Agriculture  Department  and  the  Head  of  Department.    The  Report  that  we  have 

received resulted in a way that the Head of the Ministry of Agriculture resigned from 

his  job  because  there  was  no  money.  It  saddened  me  Mr  Speaker  because  the  real 

concern  here  is  that  the  culprit  is  the  Minister  who  directed  the  funds  to  be  sent 

elsewhere  yet,  the  Head  of  Ministry  for  Agriculture  suffered  the  consequences  and 

was forced to resign.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  May  I  interrupt  you  Honourable  Member.    Come  back  to  the 

Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    I am  only speaking about  this 

point,  Mr  Chairman  because  of  the  amount  of  money  that  has  been  allocated  for 

PERCA.    I  believe  that  this  Appropriation  is  in  order for the type of task they were 

given to carry out.  This is one of the few things that has come up with the Report by 

PERCA and the action set by the then Minister of MOWEPP in order for the people to 

see  what  integrity  really  is.  When  he  sees  there  is  a  mistake,  then  he  has  to  set  an 

example and take the initiative instead.  But the example demonstrated by the Minister 

of Agriculture is unsatisfactory.  Today, I hear that Poona Samuel has lost his job and 

I am very disappointed.  I want the Minister to tell us why Poona has lost his job and 

</span><span>not the Minister.  There’s so much that this Com</span><span>mittee has done.. 

</span></div><div><span>The  main  point  that  I  wish  to  stress,  Mr  Chairman  is  for  the  first  time  the 

recommendation by the PERCA Committee is now adhered to and they have carried 

out their instructions in terms of the Budget.  This is one of the few good things that 

they  have  done  to  keep  people  warned  to  take  extra  precautions  of  what  they  do.    I 

wish to thank them the Committee members and their Chairperson. I wish them all the 

best as they carry out their responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>I am finished here, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  to  give  my  strong  support  to  the 

</span><span>Appropriation  of  $380,000  for  PERCA.  I  am  happy  Mr  Chairman  with  the  views 

</span><span>expressed by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition that he supports the report by 

PERCA.    But  there  is  one  thing  that  he  did  not  even  mention  about  this  PERCA 

Committee and that is he did not even say that it was Government who appointed this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1659 

</span></div><div><span>Committee to carry out these responsibilities.  I wish to say Mr Chairman that I take 

pride  in  what  the  Government  has  done.  Because  I  want  the  Members  from  the 

Opposition side to rise up and say good things about the PERCA Committee because 

the Government appointed these people. This Government does not fear at all to give 

these responsibilities to our people. This Committee is looking into every Department 

of Government to see how funds are expended. 

</span></div><div><span>This Committee has the right to go into any Department of Government to see if they 

are  carrying  out  their  job  properly.  The  Government  has  no  fear  at  all  when  they 

appointed PERCA to oversee that Government policies are carried out. They did not 

want to air the beauty of establishing PERCA. The Opposition did not want to appoint 

the Committee of PERCA.  This Government did not have any fear at all. They can 

write about anything and carry out their responsibilities without fear.   

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Point of Order 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> What is your Point of Order Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> He is talking about the work of these people but the subject that we 

have before the House Mr Chairman is the Appropriation.  Whether this appropriation 

amount is enough or not.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> If these views were not raised by former speakers it would not have 

been talked about.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  I was not talking about anything else Mr Speaker I was talking 

</span><span>about the $388,000 allocated to PERCA whether it is enough or not.  I wasn’t talking 

</span><span>about Agriculture, I was not talking about Poona, I was not talking about the Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> I think Mr Chairman, that the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister is 

being  irrelevant.  I  would  like  the  Honourable  Member  to  come  back  to  the  subject 

before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Continue Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  We are talking about PERCA, a body that the Government has 

</span><span>appointed  to  carry  out  their  jobs,  their  responsibilities  and  to  watch  over  the 

performances  of  the  various  Government  departments.  That  is  why  we  are 

appropriating the $388,000. I would like the Member from Rakahanga to be patience 

because they never came up with the idea of making empowering Ministers to carry 

out  the  responsibilities  given  to  them.    I  would  ask  the  Honourable  Member  to 

acknowledge  the  appointment  of  such a committee.  When the Honourable Member 

Pupuke  Robati  was  in  power,  he  increased  the  allowances  of  overseas  travel.  The 

Ministers and Cabinet supported that. They were doing these things at the time.   

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>Point of Order…. he was poi</span><span>nting that we were the ones who are 

doing dirty work. I would like to say that we did not do any dirty work he did it.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>1660 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Continue Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>What I’m talking about is wasting ........(interruptions)</span><span>

This  is  why  they  were  not  able  to  establish  PERCA  body  to  carry  out  these 

responsibilities because there was no one to review the things they are doing. We are 

not  afraid  so  we  appointed  this  body  and  that  is  what  they  doing.    So  I  support  the 

appropriation for this body in order for them to do their work. I am proud to say we 

the  Cook  Islands  Party  appointed  these  people  to  these  positions.    Every  time  the 

Members of the Opposition rise and praise the work of PERCA, I am happy because it 

was us who appointed this committee.  I support this appropriation Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable  Member Dr Pupuke Robati.   

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  this  appropriation.  I 

actually planned to rise and recommend for an increase to this vote but how can we 

</span><span>increase it if we don’t have the money to do so.  The only allocation we did not look at 

</span><span>Mr  Speaker  is  the  Ministerial  Support.  This  money  should  be  diverted  back  into 

PERCA.  In the last report, the committee revealed that Cabinet made unscrupulous 

decisions.  However, the legislation provided them with the power to investigate but 

again short of investigating Members of Parliament. This is a fact. They are directed 

to  look  at  matters  relating  to  the  little  people  but  when  it  comes  to  matters  of  this 

House, this committee has no power.  One thing we need to look at is that the Cabinet 

</span><span>Ministers’ responsibilities are being reduced and they are putting these responsibilities 

</span><span>into  the  hands  of  this  committee.  I  therefore  recommend  that  Ministerial  salaries  be 

reduced.  I  am  saying  that  because  it  was  through  the  report  of  this  committee  that 

revealed things in the housing and other departments. Then we were able to discover 

the  mismanagement  of  Government  money.  It  was  through  the  work  of  this 

Committee.  In  the  last  report  of  the  PERCA,  they  indicated  that  the  budget 

appropriation  was  not  in  order.    The  budget  procedure  was  wrong.    I  appreciate 

PERCA because they are unveiling the wrongs by this Government.   I would like to 

thank these people, this committee and I would like to see their allowances increased.   

</span></div><div><span>Those who are not hard workers should have their pay reduced and given to those who 

work hard.  Mr Speaker I rise to support and to thank the PERCA committee for the 

work  they  are  doing  and  our  Government  will  not  forget  them  when  we  come  into 

power. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Greetings to you Mr Chairman and to your staff Members.  Greetings 

to  the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, the two leaders of 

the Opposition and all Honourable Members of the House, and to our people who are 

</span><span>listening in to the debate today.  Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1661 

</span></div><div><span>When we came to this allocation, I felt I should get up and say something.  The sum 

appropriated for PERCA is $380,000.  I feel this is not enough but even if we have to 

allocate money to other departments, it will never be enough.   

</span></div><div><span>This reminds me when I was a young boy. Our parents were not well off. We used to 

have  only  one  loaf  of  bread  between  the  three  of  us.    One  piece  is  naturally  not 

enough. Today, I have to try and stretch my dollars. A piece of bread is not enough to 

feed me.  

</span></div><div><span>I know the Appropriation for PERCA will not be enough but if they try to work it out 

properly  it  will  be  enough.    The  purpose  of  the  Committee  is  to  look  into  various 

</span><span>problems  encountered  by  various  departments.  It  isn’t  easy  to  audit  and  carry  out 

</span><span>investigations.  I</span><span>t isn’t an easy thing to do.  I believe in many cases they have to look 

</span><span>after  themselves.  The  Opposition  wanted  to  know  what  Government  is  doing  about 

certain  things.  That  is  why  this  Committee  was  put  in  place.  The  leader  of  the 

Opposition  asked if we were not ashamed to beg to have our debt restructured.  We 

need good leaders who are not ashamed to stand up for the good of the people.  These 

are  the  qualities  of  a  leader.  They  are  not  afraid  to  stand  up  for  the  good  of  their 

</span><span>people.  This is why Government is not afraid to elect a Committee to go out there and 

</span><span>find out what is happening to Government spendings. They are not afraid, they are not 

ashamed. Government appointed this Committee to find out what is wrong and report 

back to Parliament.  This is why I said earlier I do not believe this Appropriation will 

be  enough  for  this  Committee  because  of  the  nature  of  their  work.  The  fact  is  they 

work  outside  normal  working  hours,  to  investigate  areas  Government  has  requested 

them 

their  findings  and 

</span><span>recommendations to us and we discuss them and that’s all there is to it.  This is why I 

</span><span>support the allocation for this Vote Item even though we know it is not sufficient.   

</span></div><div><span>investigations,  bring 

</span></div><div><span>into.  They  do 

</span></div><div><span>their 

</span></div><div><span>look 

</span></div><div><span>to 

</span></div><div><span>The  Leader  of  the  Opposition  said  PERCA  grabbed  Government  by  the  ears  so 

Government will come back to the budget process that PERCA thinks is right.  This 

budget  was  not  made  by  PERCA,  this  budget  was  made  by  Government.    It  is  not 

appropriate for PERCA to make a budget, it is not in their terms of reference. If we 

rise  to  speak  in  the  House  please  do  not  tell  lies,  do  not  make  things  up  telling  the 

people what  we are trying to  do in  the House for the betterment of our people.  We 

know  the  general  elections  will  be  held  very  soon.  Every  time  a  Member  of  the 

Opposition rises to speak, they try to politicise the issue.  They try to use whatever the 

</span><span>newspaper  says  for  their  own  benefit.    I  would  like  to  say  that  if  you  want  to  be  a 

</span><span>leader do not  be afraid,  do not be afraid to stand up to the Governments, then  your 

leadership qualities can be assessed. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $380,000 for PERCA stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Education Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>1662 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  the 

Appropriation for PERCA and to thank them for the good work they have done in this 

financial  year.    Thank  you  also  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  for  his  praises  of 

Government because by praising PERCA he is praising Government because PERCA 

and Government is the same thing.   

</span></div><div><span>As  also  explained  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  this  Committee  of  PERCA  was 

established because we, as Government, put them in place. This Committee does not 

belong  to  the  Opposition  but  to  us,  the  Members  of  Parliament.    We  also  heard  my 

colleague,  the  Honourable  Member  from  Amuri-Ureia  teaching  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, the Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate about leadership qualities. I 

agree  with  him  and  I  think  he  was  correct.    But  we  all  know  this  gentleman,  the 

Member of Parliament for Ngatangiia.  This is just the way he is.  I know him from his 

head to his toes and he has always been rather afraid.  The only good thing about this 

gentleman  is  that  he  listens  to  his  advisers  as  explained  to  us  yesterday  by  the 

Honourable Prime Minister about his two American advisers. All he has to do is listen 

to  his  advisers  and  open  his  mouth.  I  think  we  should  leave  it  up  to  the  people  to 

decide whether they would like a leader such as this who is rather afraid and listens to 

everybody else. 

</span></div><div><span>I see in today’s newspaper that there is an Australian gentleman by the name of Phillip 

</span><span>Santy who has recently joined the Audit Office as an Audit Adviser.  So I would like 

to  welcome  this  gentleman  and  his  wife  and  their  children  to  the  Cook  Islands  and 

also hope that whatever he does will be of benefit to PERCA. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I sit down, I would like to say something to the Local Governments and also to 

the  Vaka  Councils  that  have  been  put  in  place.  It  is  our  duty  to  see  that  the 

Appropriations that are given to us out of public funds are utilised in the best possible 

way. We must also be aware that the PERCA is also entitled to look into these ways 

and means, the ways that we expend these finances.  I hear rumours around the island 

that the Local Governments of the Outer Islands and the Vaka Council Governments 

think  that,  whenever  they  get  the  funds  from  Central  Government  they  can  do 

whatever they want with these funds. I would like to remind you that this is not how it 

</span><span>is supposed to be done.  There are certain protocols we must adhere to and if we don’t 

</span><span>adhere to these protocols then PERCA is entitled to investigate into what we do with 

these funds. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> What funds?  There are no funds. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  The Honourable Member from Amuri mentioned about the piece of 

bread that he used to eat daily. Likewise, we should make use of these funds like that 

piece of bread.  We should look after this money and maintain it probably exactly as 

we drink French tea, lemon tea, and milk. These are some hints to make this piece of 

bread last a little longer. 

</span></div><div><span>So to PERCA you now have your $380,000 and this is a lot of money if we are careful 

</span><span>in the way we administer it.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>1663 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $380,000 for PERCA stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Crown Law: 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $264,910 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  I  rise,  Mr  Chairman,  to  oppose  this  Appropriation.    The 

reason that I am  opposing this Vote Item is that I can see there are not enough staff 

Members in this Office.  The staffs of this Office are leaving and I can see that there is 

only one person working in this Office, that is Janet Maki.  Maybe Mr Chairman, she 

has someone there to help like assistants or clerks </span><span>–</span><span> I am not too sure. But as we can 

see from the results, when Bills come into this House they are not completed and there 

are so many things that are going on because there is too much work this young lady 

has to do.  But it is surprising to see Mr Chairman, that if we look at some other Vote 

Items they have been increased. 

</span></div><div><span>In  this  Schedule  we  can  see  there  has  been  no  improvement  to  the  allocation  for 

</span><span>Crown Law.  If we look at the Appropriation for the Prime Minister’s Office we see 

</span><span>that  this  has  been  increased.    I  would  say  then,  Mr  Chairman,  that  what  would  be 

wrong if we were to give some assistance to Janet Maki to help her out because the 

work she is doing is for our benefit in this House.  I would like you Mr Chairman, and 

</span><span>for us here to know that a person was brought into the Prime Minister’s Office into the 

</span><span>Policy Division and this person is being paid in excess of $100,000 per year. 

</span></div><div><span>And we also see Mr Speaker that there has also been a Media Officer employed in the 

</span><span>Prime  Ministers  Department,  Prime  Minister’s  office  with  a  salary  round  about  the 

</span><span>same regent.  I am asking why be assistance not given to the Crown Law Office?   We 

</span><span>need to give some assistance to this young lady because we might turn round one day 

</span><span>and this young lady has gone. We are putting a very heavy burden on this young lady 

and the work that we are giving to her. I am asking why are we employing a Policy 

Officer? You will not be Government in the future.  Why do you need a policy?  Why 

do we have to put this sum of money upon two people and yet these two people are 

not from here they are from overseas.  (Intrerrupted) 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  think  Honourable  Members  that  you  wait  until  we  get  to  that 

appropriation, then you can start talking about it. 

</span></div><div><span>DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I am only trying to compare the difference between these two and 

trying to say that these people are afraid to object to it. And the Minister was saying 

</span><span>that  he  knows  me  but  he  doesn’t  know  me.    He  attended  a  New  Zealand  school.    I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>1664 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>attended  school  here.    He  was  never  in  Aitutaki  to  play  rugby  because  I  have never 

</span><span>seen him there.  I’m not like him who is often scared. If I don’t agree with the leader I 

say so.  I’m only responding to what they said Mr Speaker. I am one of the excellent 

</span><span>rugby players at the time and I was never scared.
