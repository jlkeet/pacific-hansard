<div><span>BILL READ THE FIRST TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Can the Honourable Minister please name the date and the time of 

the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:  </span><span>Forthwith Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>1652 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you</span><span>Honourable Minister. The Appropriation Amendment 

Bill is now ordered for a Second Reading, forthwith. 

</span></div><div><span>Appropriation Amendment Bill, Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Finance, Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  Greetings  to  you,  to  all  your  staff  Members, 

Honourable  Members  in  the  House  and  to  our  people  who  are  listening  in  to  the 

debate this afternoon, Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the 1998/99 Appropriation Amendment Bill be Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  we  must  realise  the  Supplementary  Appropriation  is  always  brought  on 

the  first  few  week  of  the  month  of  June.    The  idea  being,  at  that  stage  the 

Supplementary  Estimates  reflect  the  actual  expenditure  of  Government  for  the  year 

because  the  main  budget  which  is  always  introduced  in  July  reflects  the  projections 

made  by  Ministries  as  to  revenue  Government  intends  to  collect  together  with 

proposed expenditure.  But this year as we all know, it is impossible for us to bring in 

the  Supplementary  Estimates  at  the  end  of  June  because  under  the  Constitution, 

Parliament is due to be prorogued by the 24th of March this year.  Yes, because that is 

the  day  five  years  ago  that  the  last  general  election  was  held.    So  another  general 

election  is  due  this  year.      Thus,  Parliament  must  rise  by  the  24th  of  March.  

Therefore, it is necessary to bring this amendment in today because as we all know the 

procedures of the estimates require ten days in the Committee stage before it can be 

passed.  So, although the Supplementary would have reflected the actual figures up to 

the end of February it will have to rely on projections for the months of March, April, 

May and June. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  it  is  my  honour  and  pleasure  to  present  the  1998-1999  Appropriation 

Amendment  Bill.    This  Appropriation  Amendment  Bill  was  foreshadowed  in  my 

1998-1999  Appropriation  Bill  speech  and  incorporates  the  year  end  tidying  up  the 

</span><span>government’s financial books.</span></div><div><span>In view of the coming Election, it is unlikely that Parliament will be able to consider a 

further Appropriation Bill before the end of the financial year. 

</span></div><div><span>An  essential  strategy  announced  in  the  1998-99  Appropriation  Bill  was  the  planned 

debt  restructuring  programme.    I  am  pleased  to  advise,  Mr  Speaker,  that  the 

Government has been successfully renegotiating the major debt with Italy, Nauru and 

New Zealand.   

</span></div><div><span>The  agreements  marked  the  end  of  negotiations  which  have  been  both  lengthy  and 

complex  and  which  culminated  in  a  meeting  with  the  major  creditors  of  the  Cook 

Islands Government in Manila in September last year.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1653 

</span></div><div><span>Prior to the debt restructuring, the total face value of the Cook Islands interest bearing 

debt  including  the  claims  by  Italy  and  all  other  creditors  was  nearly  $200  million.  

Because  of  write-offs  in  the  agreements,  the  face  value  of  the  debt  reduced  to  $127 

million.    If  the  value  of  the  additional  concessions  granted  such  as  extended 

repayment terms and low interest rates are taken into account the debt reduces to $77 

million. 

</span></div><div><span>Unfortunately, it has not been possible to reach agreement regarding restructuring of 

the debt owed to France but negotiations are continuing and the Government remains 

hopeful of a satisfactory resolution.  

</span></div><div><span>A  significant  change  in  the  presentation  of  the  Estimates  is  the  replacement  of  the 

</span><span>Schedule  “budget  at  a  glance”  with  “statement  of  fiscal  responsibility”.    This 

</span><span>Statement has been included to avoid any misunderstanding as to whether the Budget 

meets the fiscally responsible guidelines in accordance with Section 23 of the MFEM 

Act 1995-96. 

</span></div><div><span>I am pleased to report that the key indicator for fiscal responsibility of ensuring that 

</span><span>total operating expenses of the Crown in each financial year are not more than its total 

</span><span>operating revenues - has been achieved.  The original budget shortfall of $1.27 million 

has been reduced to a break-even level.   

</span></div><div><span>This,  Mr  Speaker,  shows  the  wisdom  of  this  Government  by  not  acting  hastily  and 

making drastic cuts in the public sector staffing and services provided as some would 

have wished us to have done when the original Appropriation was tabled. 

</span></div><div><span>I am  also  delighted to  report Mr Speaker, that the Government  has made significant 

progress  towards  the  second  key  indicator  of  achieving  and  maintaining  levels  of 

Crown  net  worth  that  provide  a  buffer  against  factors  that  may  impact  adversely  on 

</span><span>the Crown’s net worth in the future.</span></div><div><span>The  debt  restructuring  referred  to  earlier  have  substantially  reduced  major  debt  and 

ensured that repayments of this debt during the early years will be at a level that can 

be sustained and will assist in the recovery of the economy.  Current indications are 

that our growth will be higher than anticipated when negotiating the debt repayment 

agreement and any increase in the growth of the economy will be for the advantage of 

</span><span>all Cook Islanders and not just our creditors as has been the case in the past. 

</span></div><div><span>Total taxation revenue remains unchanged from the original budget of $34.4 million.  

There  is,  however,  a  reduction  of  $1.3  million  for  import  levies  matched  by 

corresponding increase in company tax.  The original budget for total taxation revenue 

was  at  the  time  the  Budget  was  prepared  indicated  an  optimistic  forecast.    I  am 

pleased  to  report  that  this  optimistic  target  is  becoming more achievable as the year 

progresses. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to add Mr Speaker, that the new tax package was introduced in 1997 and 

</span><span>as forecasted at the time it will take the country time to realise the benefits of that tax 

package.  It appears now that the expected benefit is now beginning to be realised.  I 

would like to add that the new tax package was introduced in 1997 and as forecasted 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>1654 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>at the time, it would take time for the country to realise the benefits.  It would appear 

now that, the benefit forecasted is beginning to come into fruition. 

</span></div><div><span>The Government’s contribution to the New Zealand Superannuation Scheme for those 

</span><span>public servants who still belong to the scheme is reduced by the trustees of the scheme 

from  11.2  per  cent  to  7.2  per  cent  of  salary.    This  has  meant  a  reduction  in  the 

</span><span>Ministry’s budget of some $370,000.  In the original budget dividends of $3 million 

</span><span>were anticipated from  contributions  from the CIIC.  Sadly this will not be achieved.  

The  major  contributor  to  this  dividend  was  the  repayment  of  the  loan  for  the 

restructuring of the Rarotongan Hotel.  While this will still be received there is doubt 

that it will be received by 30th June.  Included in the Appropriation Amendment Bill 

is  an  operational  dividend  of  $400,000  from  Telecom  Cook  Islands.    This  has  been 

confirmed by Telecom and agreed by CIIC that when it is received a dividend to the 

Crown of the same amount will be declared. 

</span></div><div><span>A  new  item  in  the  Appropriation  Amendment  is  the  sum  of  $158,000  for  interests 

received on Crown funds.  There has always been interest received but generally of a 

significant nature.  This has been achieved through changes in banking arrangements 

</span><span>and in the way the investment of surplus funds is managed. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally,  Mr  Speaker,  I  will  repeat  my  closing  words  when  I  introduced  the  original 

Budget  Bill.    The  Government  is  committed  to  continuing  the  tight  financial 

management that has been in progress over the past two years. 

</span></div><div><span>Government  is  also  conscious  of  the  urgent  need  to  grow  the  economy,  as  we  are 

</span><span>however, restricted by limited resources and it is Government’s duty to allocate those 

</span><span>limited resources equitably, and to take into account the cultural, social and economic 

impacts while doing so.  To concentrate on one at the expense of the others will make 

our Nation a poorer one. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have much pleasure in commending this Appropriation Bill to you. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Mr  Minister.    May  I  call  for  a  Seconder 

please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Mataio Aperau. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Appropriation Amendment Bill be now Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Now I call for a speaker please.  </span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Member  Dr  Terepai  Maoate,  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance 

</span><span>Party. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1655 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  Kia  Orana  to  you  this  afternoon 

and  also  your  staff,  Kia  Orana  also  to  Honourable  Members  of  this  House  on  both 

sides and also to all the people listening in this afternoon.  I would like to send some 

separate greetings out to those of our people who have suffered loss in the last couple 

of days. I would like to send our sympathy out to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  Mr  Speaker  to  give  separate  greetings  to  the  Minister  responsible  who 

presented  this  budget  to  us  because  I  feel  sorry  for  him.  I  give  him  this  separate 

greeting  and  also  to  the  Honourable  Member  Mataio  who  finds  it  hard  to  give  his 

support to this Appropriation Bill.  I cannot blame them for finding it hard to support 

this bill because there is nothing in it.   

</span></div><div><span>I thought when I first glanced at this bill we were talking about $47,000,000, but after 

querying with the other side of the House I was told it is only $37 million.  We can all 

remember  Mr  Speaker  in  the  last  ten  years  there  has  always  been  a  supplementary 

budget, which I will always call a patch up budget.  Now we come to the budget we 

</span><span>see before us today I’m pleased to see that there has been some changes some attempts 

</span><span>to change the budget.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to present us with a picture Mr Speaker for us to see to look at and just 

using it for an example we all know that kids like to play marbles.  In some cases, the 

players will each get a couple of marbles each that the teacher will give them so that 

they can play.  But the problem is that a lot of children do not want only two marbles. 

They want three and sometimes four marbles.  In addition, sometimes the teacher will 

tell them that it is okay you will get some more marbles soon. When they play marbles 

and another beats one, the victor will then ask the loser for his marbles. The loser will 

say it is okay I will get the marbles soon.  And to make this story shorter Mr Speaker, 

the Inspector of school  arrives and wondered where they got all the marbles.  In the 

end the Inspector then grabs the teacher by the ear and drag her into the office to tell 

the teacher off for informing the children that there are more marbles when she knows 

there are no more marbles.  And ever since then Mr Speaker this Inspector has been 

trying to correct this teacher. 

</span></div><div><span> This  is  what  has  happens  Mr  Speaker.  Although  PERCA  has  been  advising 

Government,  the  Government  has  always  contradicted  PERCA.  We  know  from  the 

report of PERCA that budget process for the 1998-99 was not done properly. Today, 

</span><span>PERCA is reprimanding Government. PERCA is saying that what has been done was 

</span><span>not  done  in  accordance  with  the  MFEM  Act.  So  I  would  like  to  thank  PERCA  Mr 

Speaker for what  they have done in trying to explain to Government not to give out 

marbles that they kno</span><span>w they don’t have.  We said before when we went through the 

</span><span>Appropriation Bill that there is no money.  We have already told them that the dream 

they have that they would receive funds from the sale of the Rarotongan Hotel will not 

happen  because  there  is  no  money.    So  what  do  we  see  now?  We  see  that  all  that 

Government pursued was a dream.  They tried to increase the Appropriation in order 

to  get  some  work  done.  However,  we  find  that  nothing  has  happened  because  there 

</span><span>was no money to do that.   

</span></div><div><span>So what we can see from the report is that this is a not a good budget. They are trying 

to wipe this loan. But because they have been reprimanded by PERCA and they were 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>1656 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>being told off, they seem to be very much agitated. We tried to correct this Bill as to 

what should have been done in the first place.  The Minister is trying to blind himself 

</span><span>from  the  signs  of  growth  in  the  near  future.  I’m  saying  do  not  dream  about  this 

</span><span>because the people are getting frustrated and angry with him. 

</span></div><div><span>We should feel sorry for this Appropriation Bill before us today.  This is why I was 

not surprised when the question was put for the Second Reading and no one wanted to 

rise and speak on it.  We all feel ashamed.  I heard cat-calls when I was rising to speak 

for the question to be put.  What do you think of that Mr Speaker? 

</span></div><div><span>We hear mention of a dividend from Telecom today. I am saying why did we pull out 

of Telecom in the first place. We know they made a profit of some $12 million. If we 

still had our 60% share ownership, we would have had a better dividend. But because 

of all the debts, we had to sell this very valuable asset.  This is what is wrong with the 

administration  today.   When we were in  administration we had a big reserve.  They 

went on a spending spree, there was no money returned to the reserves.  We can see 

how the Superannuation scheme failed when no money was paid.  They are bragging 

that they have been able to bring the national debt down. One would think they would 

</span><span>have been able to get rid of it altogether.   

</span></div><div><span>This  is  such  a  shameful  situation  to  be  in.  Because  if  you  go  to  a  shop  and  take 

something out on credit, at the end of the month you go back to the shop. Would you 

be able to tell the shop owner you are not able to pay your debt?  This is shameful.   

</span></div><div><span>We  all  remember  the  explanation  in  Te  Manava  Media.    It  was  said  that  when  the 

Government  took over the Sheraton project, they did not listen. What happened was 

that they went to Italy and begged to have the debt restructured, maybe even cried in 

the process.  I would have felt very ashamed.  This is the result of this situation in the 

newspaper. The Prime Minister tells  us  there will be no problem  if we were to loan 

money.  It has been on TV in an interview that they were wrong. He is right to admit 

this. Everybody is aware of it.  I feel sorry for the public servants that are trembling 

today because they are aware we do not have a balanced budget. Some will have to be 

let go and some are left in fear that they will be transitioned.  

</span></div><div><span> I do not want any more Members from Government to stand up and tell us there is no 

</span><span>problem.  That  would  be  a  lie,  this  sort  of  thing  is  still  happening.    Don’t  lie  to  the 

</span><span>people  by  telling  them  the  economy  is  getting  better  because  it  is  not.    This  is  a no 

</span><span>growth budget and the PERCA report tells us that.  This supplementary budget we see 

</span><span>today is trying to hide the areas that are wrong in the budget.  I don’t want you to tell 

</span><span>lies to our people that we have a good economy because it is not.  As an example, the 

Minister asked what  is supposed to be done with Agriculture and he said we should 

</span><span>bring the food to the people’s mouths and feed them. We do not see this happening.  </span></div><div><span>We see Poona was sent home because there was no money to pay him. If the Minister 

was sent home it would have been a lot better.  I think what should have happened is 

</span><span>that the Minister’s job should have been given to Poona that would have been a better 

</span><span>solution.  It  is  the  same  with  all  those  Ministers  sitting  at  the  back  in  this  House.    I 

would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Ngereteina  Puna  for  an  extension  of  my speaking 

time. Never mind Mr Speaker I will sit down. Thank you.
