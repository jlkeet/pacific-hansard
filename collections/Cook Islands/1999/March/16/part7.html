<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>I don’t think the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister will have any problem with that.</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Welcome into the political ring. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> So I am very proud and excited of the news that came to 

me this morning and I am proud to announce that to the whole nation.  I want to make 

it  known  to  him  and  the  people  of  Pukapuka  that  I  shall be sailing on a boat  to  see 

them in </span><span>the very near future.  I can’t use the public money to charter a flight to come 

</span><span>and see them in  the Northern Group so  I will go on a private boat  and pay my own 

fares. 

</span></div><div><span>So, thank you Mr Speaker.  I am very happy to make that announcement.  No doubt in 

the  very  next  few  days  I  will  be  happy  to  make  further  announcements  of  the 

successes of the Democratic Alliance Party candidates. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  shall  come  back  to  the  principal  and  merits  of  the  Companies 

(Amendment) Bill.  However, I am concerned Mr Speaker.  I am concerned because at 

this stage, we have experienced that a lot of small businesses and Companies closing 

</span><span>down.  They are no longer operating.  They’ve wound up.  They’ve lost their business 

</span><span>and they have now gone overseas or trying to make ends meet, Mr Speaker.  I guess, 

Mr Speaker, there were about 30 or more businesses, small businesses especially, that 

have closed down in the recent years.  As a result of that we know people have lost 

their  jobs.    The  economy  has  gone  down.    Everything  has  collapsed.    Now  the 

question we have to ask ourselves in this Honourable House is, Why?  Why has this 

</span><span>happened?    It’s  not  our  fault  in  the  Opposition,  I  am  sure  of  that  Mr  Speaker.    We 

didn’t run the affairs of this country for the last ten years.  </span></div><div><span>However, one thing I can remind Members of this House, which is, we have always 

</span><span>maintained our arguments in saying the country is going downhill and for Government 

</span><span>to do something about it. We aired our concerns in 1992, Mr Speaker and they didn’t 

</span><span>even listen to us.  All they said was that we were scared of borrowing. I must admit 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>1854 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker that I am always concerned and scared of borrowing more than my ability 

to pay. But not this crowd, Mr Speaker.  I am scared.   How can I be a Leader if I am 

scared of borrowin</span><span>g a lot of money?  That’s what they keep saying.  That’s what they 

</span><span>keep telling me.  Now as we come to look at it now Mr Speaker, who has been right 

all along?  Because even the Prime Minister said having more and more loan will not 

affect the economy of t</span><span>his country.  It’s in the paper.  I can show you a copy if anyone 

is interested.  The economy has gone down Mr Speaker.  There’s no doubt about that.  

</span><span>The  economy  has  gone  down  to  the  deepest  that  we  have  ever  experienced.    Now 

</span><span>that’s something for those w</span><span>ho have criticised us, for those who have said that loaning 

money will not turn the economy down to experience.  I want them to realise that it 

has Mr Speaker.  Maybe they will admit their mistakes now. Or they will say sorry to 

our people and ask them to </span><span>give them another chance to correct that mistake.  I don’t 

</span><span>think the people are foolish enough to accept that. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  when  I  look  at  the  Amendments  submitted  for  this  House  by  the  Honourable 

Tiki  Matapo  to  consider,  it  is  concentrating  on  the  administration  of the Companies 

Act.    Yes,  it  deals  mainly  with  the  returns.  Instead of the licences it deals  with  the 

returns.  They  will  be  getting  revenue  from  those  returns.    It  appears  to  me  the 

</span><span>emphasis is on trying to upgrade the system of administration and raising the fees to 

</span><span>improve the revenue to the Government kitty.  Now the question I would like to pose 

is  are  these  Amendments  going  to  create  growth  to  the  economy?  Are  these 

Amendments  creating  incentives  for  small  businesses?    Because,  Mr  Speaker,  gone 

are the days that we created these obstacles, stumbling blocks to progress, especially 

in  the  growth  of  the  economy.    Gone  are  those  days.    Yes,  anything  that  will  be  an 

obstacle to the progress of a business or the economy should be avoided.  We must not 

be  creating  these  obstacles  Mr  Speaker.  We  should  be  making  laws  to  create 

incentives for the growth of the economy.  We must not be seen to make laws that will 

discourage  small  businesses  but  we  should  be  bringing  into  this  Honourable  House 

laws that will facilitate the growth of the economy from businesses, especially small 

</span><span>businesses.    That’s  our  job  Mr  Speaker  and that’s the job  of the Government  of the 

</span><span>day.  To pass  laws  that will facilitate the growth of the economy.  Especially at this 

time when the economy is really down at its lowest. Anything that we create, we pass 

in  this  House  which  obstructs  growth  will  be  seen  as  a  threat  to  the  growth  of 

businesses, to the growth of the economy.  People will be standing back and saying, 

Hey, is this good for me or not? 

</span></div><div><span>Not so long ago, Mr Speaker, we had a VAT and Income Tax Amendment Act passed 

</span><span>in  this  Parliament.  And  part  of  that  Act  shows  that  small  businesses  which  have  a 

certain level of turnover will have to be registered because of the changes in the Act.   

We see in these Amendments, the VAT Amendment and the Income Tax Amendment 

that if the turnover is between $30,000 and $40,000 per annum then you are required 

to register as a small business.   There are a lot of small businesses in our country Mr 

Speaker,  who  do  not  want  to  register  as  small  businesses.    But  because  it  is  now  a 

requirement then they must register as a small company.   We know that a lot of these 

small  businesses  do  not  want  to  register  but  they  need  to  do  so  now  because  of  the 

</span><span>legal  requirements.    Today  the  Minister  is  saying  that  they  must  also  make  annual 

</span><span>reports on their returns.    I am also surprised to know that this has been in the pipeline 

since 1995. I think maybe the person who drafted this Bill was asleep.  Now he woke 

up  and  decide  to  continue.  Particularly  when  you  have  to  consider  the  delay  in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1855 

</span></div><div><span>submitting  it  to  the  House.  However,  I  don’t  believe  that  this  delay  is  due  to  the 

</span><span>present Minister Mr Chairman, because this Minister is the only Minister that I have 

always  congratulated  for  the  hard  and  punctual  submission  of  Bills  to  this  House.  

Now,  we  see  that  there  is  a  rush  by  other  Ministers  to  bring  their  legislation  to  the 

</span><span>House.  So I can’t really see what the motive is in trying to rush this piece legislation.  

</span><span>We all know that next week this House is going to be dissolved. Over the last couple 

of  days  Mr  Chairman,  we  have  had  so  many  Bills  coming  into  the  House.    Today, 

</span><span>before the House we see that there are two Bills and I’ve heard that there will be an 

</span><span>Electoral  Amendment  </span><span>Bill  coming  through  soon  plus  other  Bills.  I  don’t  know  how 

</span><span>we  can  dispose  all  these  businesses.    I  feel  sorry  for  this  attitude  Mr  Speaker.  

</span><span>Government seems to be trying to lead us as if we don’t know what is happening. But 

it doesn’t matter Mr Speaker.</span><span>We will do what we can but I don’t understand why we 

adopted this kind of attitude.  In the past, we’ve had a lot of time.  In some cases we 

</span><span>come into this House for one day, then we adjourn.  Then we come in for another two 

days and then adjourn.  What is happening now because is not going to solve anything 

much. Whenever a task is done in a hurry, there is always a side effect.  There were 

</span><span>references  that we are dumb.  I don’t believe that.  They are the ones who are dumb 

</span><span>because we know that there are only a few more days before the end of this Parliament 

</span><span>and they are forcing all kinds of Bills through this House in such a short time.  At the 

</span><span>same  time,  they  expect  us  to  find  ways  to  revive  our  economy  in  a short time.  We 

know  that  the  Reform  process  Government  has  introduced  is  still  a  long  way to  go.  

There  is  an  emphasis  for  transparency  and  accountability  but  look  at  what  is 

happening. I think this is a more important area Mr Speaker for us to concentrate our 

energy that is to provide some incentive for our business people in trying to revive our 

economy.      Those  are  my  views  Mr  Speaker.    Especially  to  try  to  encourage  our 

business sector. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. Can I have the next speaker?   The 

Honourable Member Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR.  ROBERT  WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker,  Kia  Orana  to  you  on  this 

beautiful evening.  Kia Orana also to the Honourable Members of this House and Kia 

Orana to our people listening in this evening.  Through you Mr Speaker I would like 

to send my regards to my friend on Te Uru O Te Watu, Mr Tiaki Wuatai.   I know my 

friend  that  you  are  up  to  a  very  difficult  challenge  but  I  would  like  to  invite  you  to 

endure the struggle because those who endure the pressure will get the crown.  I know 

that  you  are  a  man  of  good  standing  in  your  community  and  that  you  have  a  strong 

standing  amongst  your  own  people.  I  know  your  people  elected  you  to  be  their 

representative. 

</span></div><div><span>I come back to the merit and principle of the Bill before the House Mr Speaker, which 

is of great concern to us. This Bill will affect the performance of our private sector.  If 

you look at the explanatory note in this Bill the very first thing you will come across is 

a penalty and an increase in fees in registering a company. However, the other penalty 

imposed on our private sector is the increase in the fines.  What we are creating Mr 

Speaker is more hurdles for our people.  With the economy now in chaos, it will just 

discourage  more  of  our  people  from  going  into  private  business.  It  also  imposes 

penalty  on  our  people  who  have  companies  and  have  their  documents  missing  from 

the Registry of Companies. I understand back in 1992 there was a fire in the central 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>1856 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>administration building and a lot of the companies’ documents were lost in that fire. 

</span><span>To me Mr Speaker the onus is on the Government to provide the documents for those 

</span><span>companies.  It’s not the company’s fault that these documents were burnt in the fire.  </span></div><div><span>This is what this legislation will put into practice.  If you fail to provide the documents 

of your company, either you will be struck off the register or you will be fined.  It is 

sad because we look at the fire and not only did the country lose company records, we 

</span><span>also lost the building that housed these documents.  We couldn’t replace that building 

</span><span>because we failed to insure it.  In a way we are asking for some kind of insurance from 

our people to make sure their documents are in place and in Court.  To me this Bill 

will  discourage  a  lot  of  our  people  and  I  would  like  to  know  what  happened  to  the 

common  saying  that  the  economy  should  be  private  sector  driven.    I  do  not  see any 

way how this legislation will encourage the economy to grow.  With the state of our 

</span><span>economy  we’re  in,  we  should  be  looking  for  incentives  to  encourage  our  people  in 

</span><span>private business to be more innovative.  This should be one of the Bills that should be 

laid to rest in the House until the next Government comes in because it took over four 

years  from  its  inception  to  its  introduction  to  the  House.  To  me  it  can  only  be 

detrimental to our own people who are in private businesses.   

</span></div><div><span>I would ask the Minister of Justice, perhaps he could put this Bill on hold for the next 

ninety days, and maybe then we should look at it again.  While the principle of it is to 

support and make the work of the Justice Department easier I can only see a number 

of  penalties  imposed  on  our  people  in  the  private  area.    As  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition  mentioned  a  lot  of  people  have  closed  their  businesses  and  left  the 

country,  many  many  more  are  trying  to  make  </span><span>ends  meet.    It  is  government’s  job  to 

</span><span>make it easier for our people to earn a decent living, not to create more hurdles for our 

people to try and achieve.   

</span></div><div><span>To conclude what I have to say, I do not see any benefit whatsoever for our people if 

we  enact  thi</span><span>s  Bill.    It  will  in  no  way  change  the  economy’s  tailspin  it  is  in  at  the 

</span><span>moment.  It can only be detrimental to our well being.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker.  To the staff members of this House, 

Kia  Orana.    Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet 

Members, to the two Leaders of the Opposition, to Members in Government and the 

Members on the Opposition side. Kia Orana to  you all this evening.  I believe there 

</span><span>won’t  be  that  many  people  listening  to  our  debate.    They  are  probably  all  watching 

</span><span>television.  However, I would like to send greetings to the people in the outer islands 

and to the people on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I rise to  give my support to  the Amendment Bill  before the House and 

also to present my views on this.  I would like to congratulate the Minister responsible 

for his explanation on the Amendment Bill.  This Amendment Bill has already been 

made  but  because of things that are happening with  the business  community we see 

there are other Amendments superseding this one. The Ministry responsible will not 

make any Amendments to the Companies Act unless something has provoked them to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1857 

</span></div><div><span>do so.  Maybe there have been some instances where companies have been breaking 

the law.  This is probably why they brought the Amendment so these companies will 

not break the law anymore.   

</span></div><div><span>It  is  not  just  recently  that  small  businesses  are  closing  and  the  owners  are  leaving.  

This  has  happened  many  times  in  the  past  and  although  this  Amendment  is  in  this 

House, more will still close down. I do not believe some of these small businesses that 

closed  recently  have  closed  because  they  knew  of  the  existence  of  this  Amendment 

Bill.  I think they closed for their own reasons and left the country.   

</span></div><div><span>What I would like to hear from the Opposition is why was this matter left until now 

when  there  is  a  General  Election  coming  very  soon,  before  it  is  introduced  in  this 

House.  We  all  know  that  these  are  typical  cynical  comments  from  their  bench. 

Whenever  there  is  something  before  the  House  which  they  think  will  benefit  them, 

they always question why it was left until now.  In this case, I have not heard it at all.   

</span></div><div><span>From the views of our people, I believe they know exactly what Government is doing 

and  what  is  happening at  this time. Why would Government  introduce a Bill  if it is 

</span><span>detrimental  to  the  people?    Why  would  Government  wait  until  this  late  stage  when 

</span><span>there  is  an  election  very  soon  before  submitting  a  controversial  Bill  to  Parliament? 

Why?  They  are  also  saying,  it  will  be  bad  for  the  people.  Do  you  really  think 

Government is so narrow?  No! The reason is because Government knows that what it 

is doing is for the benefit of the people.  The Government knows there is an election 

coming  up  very  soon.    Government  knows  it  might  be  hurting  some  people.  I  am 

waiting for the first speaker to question the introduction of this Bill but it never came.   

I waited for the second time but  nothing came. Government did not try to bring this 

Act  to  Parliament  as  a  campaign  trick.  Government  is  attempting  to  tidy  up  the 

existing Act.   

</span></div><div><span>This is the time that this Bill was completed and now Government is bringing it into 

Parliament  to  be  enacted.  Likewise  the  Bill  by  the  Honourable  Minister,  Tepure 

Tapaitau.  This is not a campaign effort. When a Bill is processed, assessed to meet 

the  required  standards,  then  the  Ministers  place  them  on  Notice  in  this  House.    By 

right,  the  Opposition  should  target  the  worthiness  of  the  Bill.    I  believe  these  Bills 

were submitted to Parliament because there is a need to rectify difficulties experienced 

under  the  prevailing  enactments.  This  legislation  is  not  brought  into  this  House  to 

</span><span>create a conflict but in order to rectify the problems.  That is why, Mr Speaker, I rise 

</span><span>to acknowledge this piece of legislation. This Government is not scared of losing the 

election. We are used to conducting our affairs in a responsible manner. 

</span></div><div><span>I  don’t  want  the  Honourable  Member,  </span><span>Pupuke  Robati  to  speak  on  the  point  I  was 

raising.  He had better look for other things to say but not on my point.  Thank you Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Our next speaker is the Honourable Minister of Agriculture, Vaine 

</span><span>Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you and greetings to all of 

the  Honourable  Members  in  the  Chamber  tonight.    To  our  people  listening  in,  Kia 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>1858 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Orana.    Special  greetings  to  your  staff  members,  I  beg  your  indulgence  for  the  long 

hours that you are required to work. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to support the Bill brought in by the Minister of Justice.  The first 

point we need to look at Mr Speaker, is this Bill.  The principal Act was legislated in 

1971 and it was brought about based on the New Zealand Act 1955.  It is actually a 

New Zealand Act.  If Honourable Members would take the time to find the principal 

Act,  you  can  actually  find  Clauses  of  this  Act  which  were  amended  or  seen  to  be 

irrelevant to the Cook Islands.  In other words, what I am trying to say, Mr Speaker, is 

that  the  principal  Act  is  really  a  straight  out  New  Zealand  Act.    Now  it  has  been 

almost  28  years  ago.    The  question  I  suppose  that  ought  to  be  asked  in  the  House 

tonight is, why now?  When the Minister introduced the Bill, he said it was actually 

drafted four years ago.  Right.   So again  I pose the question why now?  Why has it 

taken so long, four years to bring it into the House?  There are various explanations 

from the three Honourable Members before me, including the Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>You  see,  Mr  Speaker,  something  happened  as  far  back  as  five  years,  four  years.  

Something happened in this country.  That very thing, Mr Speaker, is the reform.  And 

</span><span>in  that  reform  the  vision,  the  direction  where  this  country  is  going  to  go.  Part  of  it 

</span><span>required  the  economic  development  of  this  country  to  be  tightened  and  vigorously 

advanced.    The  way  to  do  it  is,  to  follow  the  current  footsteps  of  the  Government.  

And  that  was  to  open  itself  up  and  be  subjected  to  transparency.  I  must  admit,  Mr 

Speaker,  we  were  not  succeeding  in  all  phases.    But  this  Government  made  a 

commitment and that was for the economic development to be driven by the private 

sector.  That is what we did.   What Government did then is to instigate legislation to 

allow this to happen and I am positive, Mr Speaker, I am sure - without any doubt in 

my  mind  if  we  have  introduced  this  Bill,  then  the  whole  country  would  have  been 

jumping  on  our  back.    More  so,  the  Opposition  Members.    It  is  simply  because 

</span><span>Government  hasn’t  done  its  part.  When  Government  reduced  the  size</span><span>  of  the  public 

service there was a need for those people to be accommodated out there somewhere 

and the only ones who could do that is the private sector. 

</span></div><div><span>That is what this is all about.  Our economy is to be driven by private sector initiatives 

and the Bill the Minister of Justice tabled in Parliament tonight is exactly doing that. 

</span></div><div><span>It had nothing to do with small companies paying thousands and thousands of dollars 

</span><span>to  allow  them  to  operate.    It  depends  on  the  share  capital  of  the  company.    If  you 

</span><span>started the company and the share capital is $1,000 it is only about $10 or $20.  Let 

</span><span>me  correct  myself.    It  is  $20.    It’s  totally  dependent  on  the  size  and  amount  of  the 

</span><span>share capital of the company but one of the key issues as far as I am concerned is both 

in  the  private  sector  and  the  Government  driven  economy  must  be  based  on  the 

integrity and honesty of dealing in businesses. 

</span></div><div><span>The Government has done its part.  It has opened its books.  The PERCA for instance 

is  exactly  one  area  targeted  for  that  purpose.    That  is  the Government  watchdog for 

</span><span>everything in terms of spending public money.  This Bill before the House is saying, 

</span><span>come  on  guys!    I  have  people  in  the  Registrar  of  Companies  doing  the  recording.  

Somebody has to pay for it and somebody in that company has to file an annual return.  

</span><span>They  have  to.    You  can’t  imagine  the  Registrar  of  Companies  or  Government  staff 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1859 

</span></div><div><span>working  in  that  office  going  around  finding  private  records  of  private  enterprise.   

</span><span>That’s  ridiculous.      Company  records,  business  records,  and  p</span><span>rivate  companies  are 

confidential.   They are the ones who has been asked to furnish those returns so that 

their records can be kept  intact  and up to  date.  I will go further to say that we will 

catch you if you manipulate the records and if we do, we will sue you to Court.     That 

is what is important.   Those two things were incorporated into this Bill.  I asked the 

</span><span>Minister why not we didn’t have a Free Trading Act?  Maybe that is the way to do it. 

</span><span>Make everybody say this is how much you can go. We looked at that in depth.  It is 

not fair to interfere with the daily operations of businesses.  That would not be a good 

legislation.  The  opportunity  should  be  given  to  the  innovators  to  be  flexible  in 

developing  this  small  country.    We  must  however  be  mindful  that  it  is  typical  for 

legislation passed in this House to be irrelevant in a couple of years down the line.  So 

new Amendments need to be considered to update the Act. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  how  important  is  this  Amendment  Bill  to  the  development  of  our 

country.  </span><span>It isn’t something that is thought of overnight.  It had taken a considerable 

</span><span>time.  We sat on it for the last month.   We were soliciting advice from various people 

amongst  our  business  communities.  Sure,  there  were  both  negative  and  positives 

</span><span>reactions as expected.   Then somebody had to make a final decision.   I believe that a 

</span><span>lot of time should be committed to the consultation process to take place. Mr Speaker, 

the Bill before the House is part of the whole Reform process of the development of 

our  economy.  This  Government  has  done  its  part  to  put  in  place  the  necessary 

legislation  to  enable  Government  to  be  seen  transparently  and  to  improve 

accountability.  We looked at the private sector and legislated appropriate legislation 

to  encourage  the  developments  in  that  sector.    I  can  never  forget  the  day  when  our 

problems  were  in  its  infancy  stage  in  1994.  34  million  dollars  were  transferred 

offshore  within  the  period  of  three  months,  four  months  to  be  exact.  That  was  the 

actions of 11 companies.  Everybody knows in  this House that $30 million extracted 

from a fragile economy such as ours spell a big problem for the country. I only wished 

at that time that we had this piece of legislation in place.  Further, I only wish that not 

all our company records had been gutted in that tragic fire some times ago. We would 

have been in a better position to monitor what was happening.   

</span></div><div><span>With those comments Mr Speaker, I say thank you very much indeed to you.  That’s 

</span><span>my belief.  We have legislation in place and it is necessary at this time to be passed by 

this House. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister for Marine Resources, Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>    Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you and greetings to 

all staff members. Kia Orana to all the Honourable Members in the House and to our 

people listening to our debate.   

</span></div><div><span> Mr Speaker, I rise to support the Bill before the House.  You know Mr Speaker, if we 

were to just take a moment and look at the principal Act which is the subject of the 

Amendment  before  the  House  tonight,  straight  away  you  will  agree  that  you  are 

looking at a archaic enactment.  Archaic and old because if you count back to 1955 the 

legislation  is  44  years  old.  That  principal  Act  was  taken  out  of  the  New  Zealand 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>1860 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>legislation  of  1955  and  applied  to  this  country  in  1970.  Still  archaic  and  old  Mr 

Speaker because we are looking back at 25 years ago.  The time is right Mr Speaker.   

The time is right to amend that old and archaic law.   

</span></div><div><span>Now Mr Speaker, if we look at the amendment before the House tonight, we will see 

that it has five main objectives.   Five main objectives Mr Speaker although the Bill 

outlines about 14 Clauses.   

</span></div><div><span>Number 1 is  to increase the fees payable to the Registrar by Companies. Now when 

we take an example Mr Speaker and look at those fees what this Amendment before 

the House is trying to say to us, for 20 years we have been paying or companies have 

been paying for certificate of Registration at $1 dollar.  And Mr Speaker that was the 

piece of legislation from New Zealand in 1955, applicable to this country.    And that 

$1 dollar is found in the principal Act of 1970 as applied to the Cook Islands in the 

First Schedule.   Now the Amendment that we have before the House is to increase the 

fee  to  $20  dollars.    Taking  the  number  of  years  from  the  time  that  legislation  was 

made applicable to this country we are increasing the fee by $1 dollar per year.     

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker that is why I said the time is right.  The Minister of Justice is too lenient, 

</span><span>too  soft.    Maybe  Cabinet  is  a  bit  too  soft  too.  Maybe  the  fees  should  have  been 

increased to $200.  If we look at the Bill before the House Mr Speaker it is asking for 

an Amendment to the principal Act.  There is a need to amend and review the fees in 

the principal Act.  That is the first of five objectives this Bill is attempting to achieve.  

The  second  objective  will  give  the  Registrar  of  Companies  the  right  to  examine 

Company records and see if that Company is breaching any provisions in the principal 

Act.    If  there  are  any  breaches,  he  is  empowered  to  see  if  there  are  any  criminal 

activities  involved  in  those  breaches.    That  is  the  number  two  objective.    Number 

three  is  to  introduce  the  concept  of  annual  return  fees  and  to  do  away  with  annual 

licence  fees.    Number  four  objective  is  to  introduce  to  this  legislation  some  new 

offences  such  as  Companies  making  false  statements,  fraudulent  statements  or 

fraudulent  declarations.    No  doubt  the  reason  for  that  is  to  catch  those  who  are 

committing fraud or making false declarations so their records can be straightened out 

and if necessary prosecution may be initiated.  The last which is number five, is to do 

with  an  increase  in  the  number  of  people  defaulting.    This  default  is  committed  by 

individuals in the Company or by the Company itself.  Make no mistake the Company 

will also be treated like a person because in the law a Company is an entity in itself. 

</span><span>He is like a person. 

</span></div><div><span>That  is  the  principles  and  those  are  the  objectives  of  this  Amendment  before  the 

House.    It  amazes  me  because  I  have  gone  through  the  pages  of  this  piece  of 

legislation and I do not see anything relating to companies going bankrupt, companies 

moving to New Zealand, people moving away or the bankruptcy of this country.  Mr 

Speaker it amazes me when we play politics in this House. When we play politics on 

</span><span>the radio and on television interviews.  I don’t know Mr Speaker but without doubt, 

</span><span>our people are aware of what we are doing, what we are saying on television and on 

</span><span>radio.    Without  doubt,  they  will  judge  us  by  our  actions.    That  is  why  we  go  to  a 

</span><span>General Election because we have to safeguard the principle fundamental rights of the 

people.  To give them that right to elect who they want.  To give them that freedom to 

elect representatives they think will serve them well.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1861 

</span></div><div><span>Again, thank you Mr Speaker and as I sit down, I wish to reiterate that I support the 

Companies Amendment Bill before the House tonight.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you,  to  all  Honourable 

Members of the House and to our people who are listening in, if they are.  I would like 

to  send  greetings  to  my  people  on  the  island  of  Rakahanga  this  evening.    I am  glad 

because they have agreed with the request from the Island Council to go to Manihiki 

to meet with the Prime Minister who will be there.  I would like to ask them to take an 

empty  sack  with  them.    They  might  be  able  to  get  their  share  of  the  Coca  Cola  the 

Prime  Minister  might  be  bringing  with  him.    I  would  like  to  assure  them  that  the 

Prime Minister is not bringing any money with him but he might have Coca Cola with 

him.  I would like to wish the Prime Minister well on his trip.  Maybe he knows there 

will be no point in him going to Rakahanga this is why the Island Councils are going 

to Manihiki.   

</span></div><div><span>I  was  listening  to  the  statement  made  by  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  with  regard  to 

reform.  We all know what reform means.  It was the reform which forced the sacking 

of  more  than  2,000  of  our  people  and  the  reduction  of  the  remuneration  of  public 

servants. We all know there are a lot of small shops owned by our Maori people which 

were closed.  We can see the Government is looking after itself because originally, the 

fee was $10 and now it is $100.  Our young people will get scared.  They have been 

going to workshops which encouraged them to start small businesses.  They are still 

under the impression that the fee is $10 but as soon as they start their business, they 

will see that it is $100. The Minister is telling us that this Amendment Bill is in line 

with  the  New  Zealand  legislation.    I  would  like  to  ask  him  if  the  New  Zealand 

legislation has increased the fees to $100 or not.  I have tried to encourage my friends 

</span><span>on  Manihiki  to  form  a  little  Company  for  their  pearl  farms  but  now  I  won’t  try  to 

</span><span>encourage them because the fee for forming companies is increasing. 

</span></div><div><span>I was surprised to hear the comments by the Minister of Agriculture when he told us 

</span><span>that  we  have  lost  $31  million  in  fees.    Why  didn’t  he  explain  the  loss  of  the  $30 

</span><span>million in the Sheraton project.  Instead he turned around and stated that $31 million 

has been lost in Company Fees.  What is more important I think is this $30 million in 

</span><span>the Sheraton.   And as we know today, we don’t have a hotel any more.  This has been 

</span><span>taken over by the landowners.  All we have left is the debt. 

</span></div><div><span>Looking at this Amendment Bill, I can see that this has been drafted in a hurry.  We 

all know in the field of athletics, we always speed up in the last lap.  I can see on our 

Order  Paper  that  there  are  a  lot  of  Bills  falling  in  like  rain  over  the  next  couple  of 

days.  So our people will think that these people are working very hard.  I think our 

people  have  already  made  their  minds  up  and  formulated  their  own  opinions  so  we 

should just leave them alone for now.  We know so much about this Government.  We 

</span><span>have  also  heard  about  people  who  probably  can’t  keep  up  with  the  political  game. </span><span>They’ve told us that they want to retire.  I am waiting for my colleague from Avatiu to 

</span><span>make his announcement. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>1862 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I find it very hard to support something like this, Mr Speaker and just in case the Cook 

Islands  Party  becomes  Government  again  they  might  put  another zero on the end of 

</span><span>this and the fee will be $1,000.  That doesn’t matter though Mr Speaker.  Maybe as we 

</span><span>go through the individual Clauses  we will find some secrets  that Government might 

want  to  reveal,  such as this $31 million that was mentioned.   This is the first time I 

have  heard  of  this.    Maybe  as  we  go  through  the  Clauses  we  will  find  some  other 

money.  Thank you Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Tangata Vavia, the Member for Nukuroa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  the  staff  of  this 

House. Kia Orana also to the Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, to Members 

of Government, to the Leader of the Opposition and Members of the Opposition - Kia 

Orana to all of you this evening. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise Mr Speaker to support this Companies (Amendment) Bill so it becomes one of 

the laws of the Cook Islands.  We heard Mr Speaker, the explanations made by those 

who spoke before me, explaining how this Companies (Amendment) Bill came to be.  

I  heard the 1955 Act  is  the principal Act  and we are making an Amendment to  that 

principal Act tonight.  I think before the introduction of that Act into the Cook Islands 

there  was  only  one  company  in  the  Cook  Islands.    I  would  say  that  was  the  CITC 

because we all know that the CITC has just celebrated the 100th year of their trading 

</span><span>in the Cook Islands.  After that I don’t know of any other company being formed but 

</span><span>there were some co-ops.  So I think that we should commend the CITC for being able 

to have traded in the Cook Islands for so long. They were around long before this Act 

was  made  in  this  country.    So  from  1955  until  now  it  has  been  just $1 to  register a 

company.   Since, there are round about 800 companies registered in the Cook Islands.  

This is a large number of companies trading in the Cook Islands, Mr Speaker and yet 

</span><span>it  only  cost  $1  to  register  those  companies.    I  don’t  know  what  else  Government 

should have done to enable companies to be formed.  I wouldn’t be surprised that th</span><span>e 

New Zealand Companies Act require fees that are a lot higher than the one we intend 

to enact.  After all these years, we can see that there is only a small increase of $100 

fees payable to the Registrar of companies.  To register an overseas company the fee is 

$100.  

</span></div><div><span>If we look at the interpretation we see the types of companies that are allowed to trade 

</span><span>in the Cook Islands.  Shouldn’t we be trying to strengthen the position of the Registrar 

</span><span>in our country?  We can see, Mr Speaker, that to register a company is $100 and for 

registration  of  an  overseas  company,  it  is  still $100.  Secondly, Mr Speaker, we see 

under Miscellaneous Fees, we have an increase in share capital and an increase in the 

number  of  Members  in  the  Company.    There  are  about  ten  Miscellaneous  Fees  that 

range from a maximum of $50 down to about $30, to $20, to $10, to $5 and the last 

we  see  here  is  a  fee  of  $2.    These  are  not  big  amounts  Mr  Speaker  which  a  person 

</span><span>can’t start a company.  I am certain that when the Companies Act was introduce</span><span>d into 

</span><span>this country these fees were not part of that Act because there weren’t any companies 

</span><span>around in those days.  There was probably only one lawyer in those days.  Not today. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1863 

</span></div><div><span>So I have no problems with these increases in fees Mr Speaker because right next to 

that I see that there is mention of companies having a nominal share capital.  

</span></div><div><span>We see here Mr Speaker. It starts with a company having a nominal share capital of 

less  than  $1,000.    The  Annual  Return  Fees  is  $20  dollars.    This  goes  right  up  Mr 

Speaker to a company having a nominal share capital of more than a million dollars 

and they still pay annual return fees of $1,000 dollars.   If we try to match the share 

capital of these companies with an amount they are required to pay in fees, there is no 

comparison Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  look  at  the  new  offences  introduced  in  respect  of  any  companies 

making  false  statements.    If  we  listen  to  the  overseas  news,  there  are  companies 

conducting  fraudulent  activities.  In  a  lot  of  cases  they  win  their  cases, or they serve 

short  terms  in  prison,  and  yet  their  penalties  are  really  peanuts  compared  to  the 

damages they cause.  Mr Speaker in 1955, none of these questionable activities were 

</span><span>conducted  here.    But  today,  can’t  we  see  these things happening here?  The</span><span>refore, I 

would like to ask us all to agree that we incorporate these offences into our legislation 

</span><span>as we are trying to do right now.  I do not see any reason why we shouldn’t pass this 

</span><span>Bill because we need to strengthen the legislative parameters to relate to the kinds of 

</span><span>developments we are now engaging in our country today.  We need this legislation to 

safeguard our country in the future.  I believe it is appropriate for these companies to 

pay  these  fees.  There  is  also  a  provision  in  this  Bill  for  the  protection  of  Donor 

agencies registered in  the Cook Islands namely the Creditors.  They are safeguarded 

under  this  Bill.    Keeping  in  mind  that  if  a  Company  is  liquidated the Creditors will 

also be affected.  That is all I have to say on the Amendment.   Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member of Vaipae/Tautu, Thomas Hewitt 

</span></div><div><span>MR THOMAS HEWITT:</span><span> Greetings to you Mr Speaker Kia Orana also to all your 

staff members. Greetings  to  the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet 

Ministers and the Honourable Members on the Government side. To the Leader of the 

Democratic Alliance Party, your Members, the Leader of the New Alliance Party and 

to your team Kia Orana. Greetings also to our people listening in to our broadcast. To 

those who are not listening in, Kia Orana to you.  

</span></div><div><span>I now come to the Bill before the House Mr Speaker.  I will not prolong my speech.  I 

rise Mr Speaker, to give my support to this Amendment before the House.  This piece 

of  legislation  is  giving  us  a  direction  into  the  future.  I  believe  that  is  why  the  New 

Zealand legislation was also introduced into our country. To forewarn us to take some 

precautionary measures.  When I looked at this piece of legislation Mr Speaker, it is 

quite clear. I thought, Mr Speaker, that this piece of legislation was meant to penalise 

our people. This piece of legislation is showing us that there are areas in the private 

sector  which  require  our  attention.  Therefore,  the  Minister  and  his  staff  members, 

together  with  the  lawyers  drafted  this  Bill  and  submitted  it  to  this  House  for 

consideration. There are five principles that this legislation is providing. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, the increase of the fees to be paid to the Registrar.    

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>1864 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  to  give  the  Registrar  the power to  examine company records, in  order for 

them not to break the law.   

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, the introduction of the Annual fees to be paid to the Registrar.     

</span></div><div><span>Fourthly,  the  introduction  of  some  new  offences  that  the  company  may  commit  and 

lastly, the increase of fines to be imposed upon the offenders.   

</span></div><div><span>However,  when  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  spoke,  I  thought  this 

piece of legislation was targeting to penalise us. He said that this piece of legislation is 

meant  to  harass  the  people  of  the  Cook  Islands  and  that  this  legislation  will  cause 

bankruptcy to some of the businesses. Mr Speaker, before this piece of legislation was 

introduced into this House, there were businesses that have gone bankrupt.  Yet, in the 

views  of  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  it  seems  that  the  reason  why 

these happened due to this Bill. He also said to let the people judge us.  Our people 

will judge on the day of the election. Those who served well will be rewarded well.  

Unlike those who did nothing during their term in this House. This Government has 

nothing to hide.  We are not scared of what need to be introduced into this House for 

</span><span>the benefit of the people we serve. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Point of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a point of order on the Floor.  What is your point of order 

Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  When  the  letters  of  guarantee  were  signed  and  sent 

overseas  somebody lied.  The Honourable Member is  saying this Government never 

tell anything wrong.  Tell me what happened to the letters of guarantee? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is no Point of Order Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> You said one thing and then you did another. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  There  is  no  Point  of  Order  Honourable  Member,  please  carry  on 

with your speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> No lying in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> This is bad Mr Speaker.  The Leader of the Democratic Alliance 

Party is like a child bouncing all over the place. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> What is your Point of Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> The Honourable Member is getting unparliamentary and he 

is getting personal instead of talking about the Bill. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1865 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  When  we  look  at  what  the  Honourable  Member  was  saying,  it  is 

only proper that we all start respecting each other as Honourable Members. You have 

to withdraw what you said and carry on with your speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEWETT:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Therefore  Mr  Speaker,  this  piece  of 

legislation the Minister has introduced is good. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Before you can continue Honourable Member you have to withdraw 

what you have said. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Mr Speaker I want to withdraw what I said.  

</span></div><div><span>But I was trying to speak on a point raised by the Honourable Member.  I believe the 

introduction of an annual fee will be of benefit to the country as we proceed into the 

future.  This piece of legislation will not be against us.  As stated by the Leader of the 

Opposition,  this  legislation  will  not  become  a  burden  on  us.  One  objective  in  this 

legislation is an annual fee. You only have to pay it annually not daily.  Just like the 

payment of your motor vehicle licence, it is the same principle.  That is why I rose to 

make it clear to our people that this legislation is not against us.  I give my support to 

the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Greetings to you Mr Speaker, to your staff and to our people 

who are listening in to our debate tonight.  Greetings also to my people on the island 

of Pukapuka and Nassau. 

</span></div><div><span>We all heard the candidate for the Democratic Alliance Party for Pukapuka.  He spent 

his time in New Zealand.  This man is a teacher and the Democratic Alliance Party is 

crucifying him.  The Democratic Alliance Party is using him.  I am sorry the $500 fee 

which he </span><span>will be paying from his pocket will end up in the next Government’s coffer 

</span><span>after the election. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to speak on the subject before the House.  No matter how much the Minister 

tried to clarify everything, even the Minister of Police tried and I thought  everything 

</span><span>was clear but they still do not understand it so that is why I rose. All our efforts were 

</span><span>not enough to explain the situation to the Honourable Member for Rakahanga. What 

he did was to request the members of the Island Council to bring a bag and fill it with 

Coca-Cola.  What is wrong with these Members in Opposition? I think he has got a 

big  problem,  he  must  be  sick  in  the  head.  I  am  happy  that  the  Island  Council  of 

Rakahanga  will  travel  to  Manihiki  to  meet  the  Prime  Minister.    The  purpose  of  the 

meeting  is  for  the  Prime  Minister  to  explain  the  purpose  and  the  progress  of  the 

devolution process.  I do not believe the Mayor of Rakahanga has explained it clearly 

to them.  The Prime Minister is up north to clarify the matter and to avoid any further 

</span><span>ambiguities. 

</span></div><div><span>I listened to the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party.  They were not talking about 

the  Bill.    He  was  not  even  talking  on  the  principle  and  merits  of  the  Bill.  He  was 

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>1866 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>talking  about  a  loan  and  about  businesses  that  went  bankrupt,  and  he  never  talked 

about this Bill.  When his Deputy got up he said something else. Mr Speaker, these are 

the same people who want to be the leaders of the country.  

</span></div><div><span>The  Minister  of  Police  got  up  to  show  us  that  there  are  only  five  objectives  in  this 

Amendment.    He  even  read  the  provisions  to  increase  the  fees  payable  under  the 

principal Act, to give power to the Registrar to inspect company records to see if the 

provisions of the Act has been breached, or to detect any criminal activities. There are 

also provisions which introduced the concept of annual fees or how to abolish annual 

licence  fees,  provisions  on  new  offences  in  respect  of  any  company  making  false 

statements  or  fraudulently  destroying  properties  during  liquidation  and  fraudulently 

carrying on businesses. 

</span></div><div><span>And 5, to  increase the amount of default fines payable to any Company or officer. I 

</span><span>can’t  see  anything  to  do  with  loan  here,  nor  the  economic  decline.    In  these  5 

</span><span>objectives  in  the  Bill,  I  would  say  these  are  the  elements  necessary  to  reform  the 

principal Act.  As explained earlier by the previous speakers, the principal Act had its 

days. 

</span></div><div><span>The  administration,  services  and  overhead  costs  have  all  increased  but  the  rates 

presently applied are those from the year 1955.   The Amendment to the principal Act 

is  appropriate  because  this  is  that  right  time.  The  Minister  of  Justice  was  in  order 

when  he  brought  this  Bill  at  this  time.    We  should  not  concern  ourselves  with  the 

views expressed by the Opposition side.  Those are typical of them.  It seems that they 

are  very  much  alarmed  that  Government  is  prepared  to  work  up  to  the  last  hour  of 

</span><span>Government. Anyway, we don’t even know the date of the Election.  So Government 

</span><span>will  carry  on  doing  the  work  including  the  refurbishing  of  those  old  enactments  to 

bring them in line with current developments. 

</span></div><div><span>There  are  some  more  new  legislation  to  come  in  and  we  will  introduce  these 

legislation after the next Election.  I only rose when I heard the Opposition Members 

who failed to concentrate on the Bill but spent their time talking politics. 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  Minister  and  his  Secretary  for  what  they  have 

done in preparing the Bill that we have before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>By the way, I urge the Honourable Papa Pupuke Robati not to worry because the new 

</span><span>Member for Raka</span><span>hanga will be Piho Rua.  So that’s the only small news.  Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  Our next speaker is 

the Honourable Minister for Education and Tauranga Vananga, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you,  Kia  Orana  to  all 

Honourable  Members  of  this  House  and  to  your  spouses.    Kia  Orana  also  to  our 

people  listening  in  to  our  debate  tonight.    Kia  Orana  also  to  the  people  in  my 

homeland Aitutaki and especially to the people in my electorate of Arutanga, Reureu 

and Nikaupara.   I would like to say Kia Orana also to my warrior, Mr Teina Bishop 

and your good wife - Kia Orana to you.

</span></div><div><span>1867 

</span></div><div><span> We heard from this elderly gentleman in the Opposition, the Honourable Member, Dr 

Pupuke Robati saying that maybe my time is up and that this is why I am retiring.  But 

I would like to tell him that my time is not up.  I know there is a young man, who is 

ready  to  take  up  this  challenge.  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Members,  why  is  he  just 

hanging on? We know that the years are catching up on him. 

</span></div><div><span>We  also  heard  earlier  on  the  gentleman  from  the  constituency  of  Matavera,  the 

Honourable  Member  Mataio  Aperau  when  he  told  us  that  he  is  willing  to  give  a 

chance to a younger person to take over the stage. Therefore, I would like to say to my 

older brother, to my friend, the Honourable Mataio Aperau, Kia Orana to you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  There  is  a  Point  of  Order.    The  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  not  have  minded  if  the 

Honourable  Minister  had  expressed  congratulations  and  good  words  about  the 

Member that has expressed his retirement.  But when he went into mentioning about 

their candidates and promoting them during this time, I do not wish to encourage that.  

I  see  that  is  getting  irrelevant.    So  I  would  like  to  ask  him  to  just  congratulate  the 

Member who has expressed retirement and stop campaigning and promoting for their 

successors.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    You  can  continue  speaking 

Honourable  Minister  but  if  you could  please confine your remarks to  your greetings 

and when you finish, then come back to the Amendment Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    This  is  just  because  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati 

has said that our time is up, that is why I am responding.  He said that the time for the 

Honourable  Member,  and  me  Mataio  Aperau  is  up.    This  is  why  I  replied  to  those 

comments  but  I  would  like  to  say  to  him  that  even  though  he  insists  that  his 

</span><span>Committee will not let him step down, I don’t believe what he is saying. I would like 

</span><span>to remind him to read the report of the Political Review Commission. There are areas 

that might help him and other Members that have been around for a long time. It will 

help them make up their minds. Before I go onto the Bill before the House, I would 

</span><span>just like to ask the Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati not to mention the words 

</span><span>Coca-Cola  in  this  House any more.  By doing so he is  degrading this good product.  

Further, the CITC is not able to be in this House to respond to the degradation of this 

name.    So,  if  he  wants  to  use  the  word  Coca-Cola,  beware  that  he  is  belittling  that 

name  and the producers of this product.  He can use the word  </span><span>“koke koke”</span><span>   if he so 

desires. 

</span></div><div><span>We should speak in this House like adults and not like children. I would like to thank 

the  Honourable  Minister  Tiki  Matapo  and  also  the  head  of  this  Ministry  Mr  Terry 

Hagan  for  bringing  this  Amendment  before  this  House  which  we  all  know  is  long 

overdue, to the tune of nearly 28 years.   As also indicated by my colleagues from the 

island of Aitutaki, they as well as I, would like to know where the burden is, that the 

Members  of  the  Opposition  are  speaking  of  when  they  refer  to  this  Companies 

</span></div><div><a>Page 37</a></div><div><span>1868 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Amendment Bill.  We cannot find any burden placed on our people by this Bill. About 

</span><span>three or fours year ago, while in the Registrar’s office one of the staff members told 

</span><span>me that it is about time that the fees were increased.  The fee of $1.00 was not worth 

the time and effort spent in producing a receipt for $1.00 and I would like to thank the 

Honourable Minister and his staff for introducing this Amendment.  

</span></div><div><span>Looking at Clause 5, I see that the Minister has brought some new sections into this 

Act to try to improve it. This is giving the Registrar the powers to inspect any records 

</span><span>or accounts of any company and I can’t see anything wrong with these new sections.  

</span><span>The people that are against the introduction of this Amendment Bill, are people that 

we believe are the people who would like to do things that are not in accordance with 

the law.  Part (b) provides that the Registrar can direct a person to make an inspection 

of any company records on his or her behalf.  Section (c) of this section tells us that 

any  person  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  the  Registrar  is  able  to  appeal  this  to  the 

Court.   We find that Clause 11 is also introducing new sections.  I will not go into 

each of these sections but I think we should look carefully at this Clause 11.  All of us 

should  support  this  Amendment  brought  into  the  House  by  the  Minister  to  try  to 

correct the Companies Act.   

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, Mr Speaker reading in the paper recently we were aware that Papa Sir Thomas 

Davis  has  a  column.    I  was  quite  surprised  about  his  views.  He  wrote  about  the 

business sector with special reference to people registering companies.  These are the 

people  Government  is  relying  on  to  drive  the  economy.  I  was  also  quite  surprised 

because in this article he was trying to reprimand the businesses sector for favouring 

the  Government  with  a  tone  that  implied  support  for  Government  to  win  the  next 

election. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE: </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR.  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker:  The  Honourable  Minister  is 

</span><span>grossly  irrelevant  because  he’s  picking  on  Papa  Tom  who  is  the  wizard  of  this 

</span><span>country. He is a wise man ignored by people like this Minister.  If there is anyone to 

be  praised,  it  is  Papa  Tom.    Mr  Speaker  I  am  just  unhappy  with  the  way  the 

Honourable Minister is belittling Papa Tom. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  so  surprised  with  this  hypocrite,  who  in  1986 

knifed  Sir  Thomas  Davis  in  the  back  and  threw  him  out  of  the  position  of  Prime 

Minister  of  this  country.    Now  today  he  is  getting  up  to  praise  Papa  Tom.  What 

hypocrisy! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I interrupt you Honourable Member.  I think it is appropriate that we 

</span><span>don't mention peoples’ names in this House if they are not here to protect themselves.    

</span><span>I would like to ask an Honourable Member to close us with a prayer.
