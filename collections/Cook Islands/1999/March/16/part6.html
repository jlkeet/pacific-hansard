<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Companies Amendment Bill.  The Honourable Minister Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Companies Amendment Bill be Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to you Mr Speaker and to all the staff Members of Parliament.  Greetings to 

all the Honourable Members in  the House and to  our people listening to the debate.  

To those Members who are still on the way, the Prime Minister, Kia Orana to them 

too. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  the  Companies  Amendment  Bill  serves  to  address  several  areas  found 

lacking  in  our  existing  legislation  today.    In  fact  this  is  to  bring  the  Companies 

legislation  more  in  line  with  current  practices  today.    The  first  concern  is  the 

recouping  of  costs  by  reviewing  costs  and  fees,  something  that  has  not  been  done 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>1852 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>since 1971.  Other concerns dealt with in the Amendment include better management 

</span><span>and  control  of  Companies’  records  and  affairs  and  defining  of  offences.    This 

</span><span>Amendment Bill serves a number of functions.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  this  is  the  first  review  of  Companies  fees  since  1971.  The  first  Schedule, 

which forms part of the Bill, establishes equality with other charges and fees currently 

levied by the Ministry of Justice.  My colleagues in Cabinet will recall in 1997 there 

was an Amendment to Court costs fees allowances and charges as negotiated with the 

Rules Committee.  The Rules Committee comprises of the Chief Justice, the Solicitor 

General,  and  the  President  of  the  Law  Society.  Secondly,  it  will  empower  the 

Registrar to inspect Company records and act to ensure compliance with the Act.  This 

Amendment  therefore  Mr  Speaker  brings  our  law  in  line  with  the  New  Zealand 

legislation.  Thirdly, it amends the principal Act by requiring Companies to submit an 

annual  return,  at  the  same  time  pay  an  annual  return  fee.  The annual  return fee will 

replace the annual licence, which has been paid by Companies up to now.  This will 

enable a much improved administration of Companies and again is based on existing 

New Zealand legislation.  Further, the amendment introduces new offences widening 

the policing powers of the Act which under existing law is limited to that of making 

</span><span>false  statements.    The  amendment  will  cover  the  making  of  false  statements,  the 

</span><span>fraudulent  use  of  property,  its  destruction  or  concealment.    And  the  concealment  of 

property,  debts,  books,  payments  of  any  Company  under  liquidation.    Including  the 

altering  or  falsifying  of  books,  records  or  documents  of  any  Company.    Finally  the 

offences  include  obtaining  transfer  credit  or  property  by  fraud  with  the  intent  to 

defraud  creditors.    This  also  increases  fines  payable  by  officers  or  Companies  in 

default.  Until now, this has been $10 and today this amendment seeks to increase it to 

the amount of $100.  The total Companies resident within the Companies Division of 

the  Justice  Department  are  760  to  800  Companies.    There  has  not  been  a  review  of 

this  particular  Act  since  1971  and  some  of  these  amendments  which  I  have 

highlighted were problems which have been encountered by the Justice Department in 

implementing  some  of  the  requirements  of  the  Act.    One  of  the  significant 

amendments is the requirement on the part of Companies to furnish an annual return 

to the Justice Department. 

</span></div><div><span>The first draft of the Bill goes back to 1995.  But I am pleased to say that I am able to 

bring this before the House to be enacted.  Undoubtedly it will help the policing of the 

Act and hopefully a better response from the Companies in their requirements under 

</span><span>the Act.   

</span></div><div><span>Those are my comments I wish to make Mr Speaker, thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>Can I have a Seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Mii Parima 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time?

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to  you, to  your staff 

members and to all the Honourable Members who are here.  To our people listening in 

Kia Orana.  Greetings also to our people in the Outer Islands who are having a better 

reception at night. 

</span></div><div><span>Through you Mr Speaker, I would like to extend special greetings to the newly elected 

candidate and congratulate him, the Member that will be standing for the Democratic 

Alliance Party on the island of Pukapuka and Nassau.  I know that the Prime Minister 

is  going  to  visit  the  islands  in  the  Northern  Group  and  no  doubt  the  people  of 

Pukapuka will receive him with their new candidate, Mr Tiaki Wuatai.  Therefore, I 

am very pleased to make the announcement Mr Speaker, through you, to the people of 

</span><span>Pukapuka.  They’ve made the right choice and I am very pleased with that.</span></div>
