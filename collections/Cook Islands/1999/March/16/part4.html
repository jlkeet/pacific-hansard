<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $723,800 for Marine Resources stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Our speaker is the Honourable Minister Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  you,  to  the  Honourable 

Members on both sides of the House. To the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party 

and  to  the  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party,  to  my  Cabinet  colleagues,  and  to  our 

people who are listening to the debate, Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I would like to thank the staff of Parliament who is making it possible for 

our people to hear what transpires in Parliament.  The staff removed everything from 

within  Parliament  and  now  they  have  brought  it  back  in  order  for  us  to  have  this 

sitting this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>From Government’s point of view I would like to acknowledge the support from the 

</span><span>Opposition to put in place, although I had some doubts, the action taken by Parliament 

last Friday to allow a more lengthy adjournment in the event we are hit by a cyclone.  I 

would  like  to  acknowledge  the  support  from  the  Opposition  benches.    Maybe  the 

message  for  all  of  us  in  this  House  and  the  incoming  Government  is  to  look  at 

providing a better facility for Parliament.  W</span><span>e don’t want some drastic natural disaster 

</span><span>to  happen  again.  Moreover,  when  we  enter  the  summer  period,  it  is  very 

</span><span>uncomfortable sitting in a very hot room to debate serious matters. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1833 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman coming back to the business of the House, which is the Appropriation 

for Marine Resources to the tune of $723,800.  This is one Ministry where I have a lot 

of  respect.    I  spend  time  and  acknowledge  the  effort  that  the  staff  members  of  this 

Ministry  of  the  HOMs  down  to  the  junior  staff  members,  in  pursuing  further 

developments  in  respect  of  the  marine  that  contribute  to  our  economy,  despite  what 

we did back in 1996.  Credit must be given to the staff and the HOMs as well as the 

Minister  responsible,  the  Honourable  Tepure  Tapaitau.  Because  above  all,  whatever 

happens  i</span><span>n  those  Ministries  out  there  comes  back  to  the Minister’s desk.  It  doesn’t 

</span><span>matter  which  way  one  looks.  One  thing  we  need  to  understand  is  that  it  does  not 

matter  whether  anybody  here  does  anything  good  politically  or  otherwise,  nobody 

would acknowledge you for that.  That is really part and parcel of our political life.   

</span></div><div><span>The Minister got a lot of criticisms during his time when he looked after the Ministry 

of Marine Resources.  It even affected his family. It affected his extended family, his 

island, and his colleagues in Government! 

</span></div><div><span>Again, I am saying through you, Mr Chairman, this is part and parcel of our political 

life.    Even  Members  of  this  House  have  been  called  dumb.    People  were  critical  of 

</span><span>them because we didn’t have any tertiary certificate, or</span><span> proper education.  But then I 

</span><span>challenge  them  all.    I  challenge  them  all  to  come  into  this  House.  Leave  whatever 

education  qualifications  you  have  out  there,  leave  your  law  degrees  out  there,  leave 

your  Doctorates  and  Economics  degrees  out  there.    Leave  them  out  there  and  come 

into this House.  Debate every matter of concern to our country here in this House.  I 

tell  you,  Mr  Chairman,  they  will  be  hiding  under  the  table.  Because  political  life  - 

politics is a profession. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span> And the staff of Marine Resources are professionals. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor. Honourable Member, what 

is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  I  have  been  listening  to  the 

</span><span>Minister  raving  on  and  on.  I’d  hoped  he  would  return  to  the  Vote  Item  of  Marine 

</span><span>Resources but he went on about leaving certificates and degrees at home.  We didn’t 

raise these subjects.  It’s them.  It’s them who tried</span><span> to run us down by saying that we 

are uneducated. That is why we are responding to those comments from the Members 

on  the  Government  bench.  So  I  would  like  through  you,  Mr  Chairman,  to  ask  the 

</span><span>Honourable Minister to come back to the Vote Item and don’t try</span><span> to get back to those 

ridiculous comments. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I  agree  with  the  Honourable  Member.  Therefore,  I  will  ask  the 

</span><span>Honourable Minister to try to come back to the Vote on the Floor but let us all beware 

</span><span>of such irrelevancies in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>1834 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I am bringing the issue of professionalism. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Point  of  Order,  Mr  Chairman.  We  are  not  talking  about 

professionals here, Mr Chairman.  He is irrelevant, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  If  it  is  related  to  Marine 

Resources, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>    Exactly  Mr  Chairman,  because  what  does  the  Honourable 

Leader  of  the  Opposition  think  the  staff  of  the  Marine  Resources  are?  They  are 

professionals. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> What is your Point of Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>193, Mr Chairman.  If the Minister is mad at me I don’t .. .</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  . . . mind that but I want him to stick to the debate on the 

Floor.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Come back to the point Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  in  supporting  the  Appropriation  for  $730,800 

which  has  been  appropriated  for  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources,  I  am  just 

beginning to wonder now who is going to use that money. The cats or the fish? Or the 

people who work in there.  They are human beings.  They are professionals expending 

the budget that this Parliament is appropriating.  Now if the Honourable Leader of the 

DAP thinks I am irrelevant, try and chew on that because I am leading up to that point.  

That is the importance of the Appropriation of the $730,800.  Because it is given to a 

team  of  professionals  who  in  turn  are  trying  to  spread  that  across  the  community.  

Even the environment is getting some of it.  The Local Government of Rarotonga is 

getting some of that.  Whom does he think did the survey to the lagoons and allowed 

the Local Government of this island or any other island to do the survey? Those very 

professionals  are  working  in  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  of  which  we  are 

appropriating money in this Parliament.  And this Parliament is going to continue to 

do exactly that, whether it is this Government, the Cook Islands Party or not!  This is 

our role in the future development of this country.  That is what I was leading up to 

Mr Chairman.  

</span></div><div><span>There are various projects already in the pipeline for the development of the Northern 

Group fisheries and related activities in that region of the country.  I take note of some 

of those points, some of those future visions, some of those developments. That is in 

line with what the Minister said when he introduced the topic.  He was arguing that 

this is not just a political ca</span><span>mpaign, it isn’t.  And to allow the Minister to implement 

those  programmes  he  needed  the  appropriation,  the  support.    That’s  why  this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1835 

</span></div><div><span>appropriation  is  important.    This  happens  to  be  one  of  the  key  areas  of  economic 

development of this country and everyone in this House agrees that marine has a huge 

role in our development. 

</span></div><div><span>Some of our local people have got into deep sea fishing ventures and we know what 

</span><span>happened.    Some  of  them  failed  but  that  doesn’t  mean  it  is  the  end  of  the  venture. 

</span><span>Who  is  in  position  to  </span><span>revive  it?    It’s  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources.    The  very 

</span><span>Ministry that we are debating its Appropriation.  That is what this Appropriation is all 

about. 

</span></div><div><span>Again, I acknowledge the effort that the Minister and his staff have contributed to our 

developments.    I  compare  them  to  Cyclone  Hali  that  came  and  swept  through  the 

Cook Islands in the last couple of weeks.  In spite of the rain, the waves and the wind, 

or  the  storm,  the  work  of  the  Ministry  must  proceed.    It  is  still  going  to  continue 

because this Ministry happens to be one of the lifelines of our country. 

</span></div><div><span>With  those  views  I  would  like  to  leave  my  other ten minutes until  perhaps later on.  

Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Our  speaker  now  is  the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  I  will  not  take  too  long  on  greetings.  

Greetings to you, Greetings to all Honourable Members of this House and our people 

listening in to our debate. 

</span></div><div><span>I am  not  going to  use most of my time to speak.  I just rise to respond to the views 

expressed  by  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  and  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member, Dr Pupuke Robati while they were talking about this Appropriation.  I don’t 

</span><span>think  I  will  be  mistaken,  Mr  Chairman,  because  they  were  actually,  at  their  time  of 

speaking, saying the very thing I am going to quote.  As stated by the Minister before 

me,  they  were  also  very  critical  about  me  and  the  Honourable  Member,  Thomas 

Hewett. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor,  Honourable  Member.  

Honourable Member, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  The  Honourable  Member,  Paora  Teiti  is  not  speaking  on 

the Vote Item.  He is moving away from the Vote Item and addressing the Honourable 

Member, </span><span>Dr Robati and me.  I don’t see any relevancy about this to the Vote Item in 

</span><span>front of us. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> If I had been out of order when I was speaking . . . 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>1836 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Well if the matter is related to 

something that has been said in the House during the debate on the Vote Item, then I 

think  any  Member  has  a  right  to  talk  on  that  matter.  Therefore,  I  would  like  to  call 

upon the Honourable Member to go straight to those matters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  I  believe  you’ll  agree  with  me  that  I  was 

</span><span>speaking  on  the  appropriation  debated  by  the  previous  two  Honourable  Members.   

This is our problem.  We talk without seriously being considerate of the words which 

come from our mouth.  If someone respond then we feel bitter about it. There was a 

</span><span>question, which I wanted to pose but I know they couldn’t reply. They also wanted to 

</span><span>question the Honourable Thomas Hewitt and I. I did ask them to pose theirs.  I know 

the  Member  was  </span><span>implying that I am  ignorant.   Although they didn’t specifically say 

</span><span>that I was ignorant their expressions did imply the meaning of their speeches.  I know 

they  have  qualifications.  However,  their  qualifications  are  in  medicine,  not  in 

Parliamentary work. They are Parliamentarians, just like us. 

</span></div><div><span>ROBERT  WOONTON:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  Point  of  order.  Irrelevancy............  Thank 

you, you have drawn your attention to his irrelevancy. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> I will now respond to the views of the Honourable Member Pupuke 

Robati.  He said that Aitutaki did not put any restrictions on the </span><span>paua</span><span>. He queried why 

</span><span>Aitutaki  didn’t  put  any  restrictions  on  the  harvest  of  clams.    I  am  now  on  the  Vote 

</span><span>Item of Marine Resources.  Let me remind him that the Marine Resources Department 

in Aitutaki has restricted a particular area.  Why should he question me why an area 

</span><span>has not been restricted?   I know what I am talking about. I don’t say anything just for 

the sake of it.   I’m not like him. When we are ta</span><span>lking about the coconut, he is talking 

about pineapples or other things.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Honourable Member, it is getting to the stage where you might end 

up following the same pattern. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Mr Chairman, the authority for the </span><span>raui</span><span> of the paua is not vested in the 

Marine Resources.  Another body is responsible. 

</span></div><div><span>DR.  P.  ROBATI:  </span><span>Point  of  Order.  Irrelevancy.  People  listening  to  our  debate  might 

</span><span>think that we are arguing in this House.  The Member is screaming at the top of his 

voice. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Honourable  Member,  allow  the  Interpreters  to  complete  their 

parts before you continue.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Mr Chairman, the reason I am in this House is because I am a person 

who speaks out, and I speak the truth. I am a person, who has preached a lot in church, 

</span><span>and I do it vocally. I speak loudly so people don’t go to sleep.  Why is he saying that I 

</span><span>should speak softly?  I am a person who is used to speaking loudly.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1837 

</span></div><div><span>He said, why didn’t Aitutaki </span><span>raui</span><span> the </span><span>paua</span><span>?  Mr Chairman the </span><span>raui</span><span> was practiced in 

Aitutaki  from  the  time  of  our  forefathers.  To  this  day,  we  are  still  practicing  it.  In 

Aitutaki, a different body is responsible for planning, implementing and monitoring it. 

Rarotonga was not the first to practice this tradition. Putting the </span><span>raui</span><span> on the paua Mr 

</span><span>Chairman is the Island Council’s responsibility.  </span></div><div><span>DR. P. ROBATI: </span><span>(Interjection) I told him that Mr Chairman because I was trying to 

explain another way of saving the </span><span>paua.</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>It is true Mr Chairman that these two gentlemen have got their degrees 

in  whatever  field  they  specialised.    But  I  know  better  than  them  how  to  talk  in  this 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>Concerning the </span><span>raui </span><span>on the </span><span>paua,</span><span> Mr Chairman, this is the responsibility of the Island 

</span><span>Council. I don’t want to waste my time speaking on the </span><span>raui</span><span> and on the Island Council 

because  I  am  speaking  on  the  Marine  Resources  appropriation  before  the  House.    

This  is  why  we  always  get  into  trouble,  because  we  have  an  agenda  before  us  and 

other Members start introducing all kinds of issues, which deter us from concentrating 

on  our  agenda.  Then  we  find  ourselves  in  trouble.  I  would  like  to  tell  these 

Honourable  Members  Mr  Chairman,  that  my  qualification  is  in  speaking.    I  do  not 

</span><span>have  a  doctor’s  qualification.  If  they  have  that,  go  to  the  hospital  that  is  where  it  is 

</span><span>required.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  about  the  appropriation  for  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources.  My 

congratulations  to  the  young  people  working  for  Marine  Resources  in  Aitutaki.  Mr 

Chairman, we all know that on the island of Aitutaki, we have the crabs or </span><span>upaki</span><span> and 

the lobsters. These are seasonal food. If only they could look into these for export, I 

believe that the island will also benefit. My time is up Mr Chairman, Thank you for 

giving me the opportunity to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.      Can  I  have  the  next  speaker 

please?  Our next speaker is the Honourable Thomas Hewitt. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWITT:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Kia Orana to you and to your staff this 

afternoon.   Kia Orana also to the Prime Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister and to 

all Ministers in Cabinet. To all Government Members, to the Leader of New Alliance 

Party  and  your  Members,  and  to  the  Leader  of  Democratic  Alliance  Party  and  your 

Members  greetings.    Kia  Orana  to  our  people  listening  in  to  our  deliberations  this 

afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  Mr  Chairman  to  give my support to  this allocation for the Ministry of Marine 

Resources  of  $723,800.00.      My  congratulations  and  thanks  go  out  to  the  Minister 

responsible for Marine Resources and to the staff. They need this amount in order that 

the Ministry can work through until the end of June.  I would like to give my greetings 

to the workers of the Ministry on my island of Aitutaki. I believe Mr Chairman that 

</span><span>this Ministry has worked very hard on the island to improve some areas in the lagoon 

</span><span>of  Aitutaki,  for  the  benefit  of  the  people.  I  know  some  things  that  this Ministry has 

been doing while I was on the island.  I believe the funds allocated for the Ministry is 

not enough but then again, I also believe that this will have to suffice until the end of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>1838 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>June.  As my colleague from the island of Rakahanga put it, maybe it would be a good 

idea to impose a </span><span>“raui”</span><span> on the clams.  I would like to remind the Honourable Member 

that  the  </span><span>“raui”</span><span>  on  </span><span>paua</span><span>  has  been  done  ever  since  the  time  of  Papa  Tikaka  was  the 

Mayor of the island but our people were still discretely harvesting it and many were 

not  caught.  Today  the  Mayor,  Tai  Herman  together  with  his  Councillors  are  still 

putting in place the </span><span>raui</span><span> for the </span><span>paua</span><span> again.  If you require </span><span>paua</span><span> for a specific purpose 

then you must contact the Mayor and the Island Council to get permission.   

</span></div><div><span>In the five years since I have been in Parliament, this department on my island started 

to domesticate paua.  I believe there were people who were given the opportunity to 

farm  </span><span>paua.</span><span>  The  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  were  responsible  for  assisting  these 

people  in  setting  up  their  farm.    As  my  colleague  from  Aitutaki  pointed  out,  the 

comment made by the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party is true in saying that 

we are not the most brilliant people.  Nevertheless, I am trying my best in my capacity 

as  a  Member  of  Parliament.  I  do  not  want  to  go  back  and  start  beating  him  again 

because  my  colleague  has  already  done  that,  so  why  should  I  hurt  him  any  further?  

We might do him some bodily harm and he might not be able to continue as leader of 

the Democratic Alliance Party. Then they would have to elect a new leader. 

</span></div><div><span>The  other  area  I  would  like  the  Minister  to  look  into,  which  was  mentioned  by  my 

colleague, is the possibility of the Ministry of Marine Resources setting up a farm for 

lobster.  Lobsters are being sold in the motels, including the Akitua Resort for $12 a 

kilo.  These crabs we call </span><span>“Upaki”</span><span> sell around for about the same price.  I am asking 

whether  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  could  set  up  a  farm  for  </span><span>“Upaki”</span><span>  and 

lobster.  This would be of benefit to the people of the island.  Maybe Mr Chairman, 

the project  the Minister is  thinking of for his  island which is  the shipping of fish to 

Hawaii  and  the  United  States,  could  be  done  jointly  with  the  export  of  lobsters  and 

</span><span>Upaki</span><span> to Hawaii.  There are areas set aside by the Ministry and the Island Council in 

Aitutaki for replenishing the fish stocks such as Bonefish on the island.  This matter 

would also be of benefit to the people.   

</span></div><div><span>Some  time  ago,  a  friend  of  mine  came  to  the  island  and  asked  me  to  take  him  out 

fishing.  I thought  he wanted to go fishing for Rock Cod.  He told me he wanted to 

fish for Bonefish, so I took him to one of the Motu.  He told me Bonefish is a type of 

fish  where  a  lot  of  tourists  would  like  to  go  game  fishing.    After  we  caught  one  of 

these Bonefish he showed it to  me and then suggested the farming of this particular 

</span><span>fish.  I told him that the people love the meat of this fish.   Then he took the fish he 

</span><span>caught off the hook and let it go.   

</span></div><div><span>Maybe if we could farm these fish on the island it would be of interest to the tourists 

and again the benefit will go to the people.  This is why I rose to give my support and 

to  present  my  views  on  this  issue.    I  also  wish  to  congratulate  and  thank  the  young 

people working in the Ministry of Marine Resources on my island.  They are very hard 

working young people.   

</span></div><div><span>The  Ministry  division  there  placed  fish  aggregation  devices  or  FADs  around  the 

</span><span>island.    I  also  believe  the  young  men  are  experts  in  this  area  of  FADs  installations.  

The  fishermen  on  the  island  are  pleased  about  them.    These  young  people  in  the 

Ministry have been able to provide them with FADs to attract fish for easier fishing.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1839 

</span></div><div><span>In my Constituency there is a FAD anchored off the reef and we do not allow anybody 

to  anchor  onto  this  device.    We  have  somebody  there  to  look  after  the  buoy,  Mr 

Jubilee Reu.  His responsibility is to ensure that nobody ties their boat onto the FAD 

and if anybody does, he is out there in his boat chasing them off.  If boats hang onto 

</span><span>the device it won’t be long before the anchor of the FAD breaks and then nobody will 

</span><span>be able to fish around there.  On the Arutanga side of the island the buoy had broken 

and  drifted  away.    They  told  me  that  it  might  have  been  a  ship  that  went  past.    I 

believe something aside from a passing ship must have caused the break because there 

were  fishermen  who  anchored  to  the  buoy  in  December.  The  FAD  unfortunately,  to 

the demise of all the fishermen broke from its mooring and drifted off. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that this young man, Mr Jubilee Reu is a very reliable man to look after the 

buoy  in  our  constituency.    Therefore,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  to  give  this 

young  man  formal  recognition  by  giving  him  a  job  in  the  Ministry  to  maintain  the 

</span><span>buoys  around  the  island.    It’s  not  cheap  to  replace  these  buoys,  it’s  not  cheap  to 

replace  the  moorings  or  the  concrete  block  that  anchor  them.    It’s  not  cheap  to 

</span><span>purchase all these facilities.  So I think it would be a good idea to give this young man 

this monitoring job.  This young man, Mr Chairman, is a good fisherman, a good diver 

</span><span>and he has also been responsible for harnessing these buoys. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  always  believed  in  his  ability,  Mr  Chairman,  to  look  after  these  devices  that 

have been given to us by donors. These devices are for the benefit of the people and 

he has been able to look after these in the past.  I think if these aggregate devices keep 

</span><span>breaking off their moorings then we will find that the donors won’t be willing to give 

</span><span>us any more of these devices especially if we are not able to look after these devices 

properly. 

</span></div><div><span>At the time when Ben Toma was the Minister of Marine Resources, I sent this boy to 

Manihiki,  since  he  is  a  Manihikian.  I  wanted  him  to  go  to  Manihiki  and  learn 

something about these aggregate devices.  He was there with another son of ours from 

Manihiki, Mr Ned Howard to learn how these devices were used. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  again  encourage  the  Minister  to  please  consider  employing  this  young  man 

because  this  man  has  done  a  good  job  with  regard  to  taking  care  of these aggregate 

devices.    I  support  the  budget  that  has  been  allocated  for  the  Marine  Resources  of 

$723,800. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you and your staff, and 

to  the  Honourable  Members  of  the  House.    Kia  Orana  especially  to  our  listening 

public. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, while I have spoken on the Vote Item regarding Marine Resources last 

week. However, there are certain areas of concern which I want to raise in the House 

today, especially when the Minister of Agriculture earlier made an inference that the 

</span><span>Opposition  has  no  regard  for  the  Marine  Resources’  staff  members.    Quite  to  the 

</span><span>contrary,  Mr  Chairman!    We  have  the  highest  regard  for  our  Marine  Resources 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>1840 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>workers,  especially  the  former  Marine  officer,  the  former  HOMs  like  Julian 

Dashwood, Colin Brown and quite lately who just resigned, Mr Raymond Newnham.  

We have the highest regard for these boys who have high academic achievements in 

Marine developments.  There has never been any question as to their professionalism 

in  their  job.    I  want  to  state  for  the  record  that  we  never  questioned  any  of  their 

qualifications.  And even to all the other marine workers spread throughout the Cook 

Islands.  To me, these boys, these young men and women are dedicated workers and 

even  achieved  very  high  quality  work  outputs,  especially  in  pioneering  the 

development of the spat collection in Penrhyn.  In fact, young Bertram was a pioneer 

in  developing  how  to  sustain  young  pearl  shell  spat  and  he  was  nominated  as  the 

Government Worker of the Year in one particular year. 

</span></div><div><span>Since  the  discussion  on  the  Marine  Resources  budget,  there  has  been  a  number  of 

points  raised  by  my  constituents  regarding  the  Marine  Resources  pearl  farm  in 

Manihiki.    In  fact,  I  made  inquiries  with  the  Chief  Executive  of  the  Cook  Islands 

Investment Corporation as to the facts surrounding the Marine Resources farm sale in 

Manihiki.    The  Chief  Executive  of  the  CIIC  assured  me  that  the  Marine  Resources 

Farm has been sold.  The concern brought up by the people of Manihiki is the sale of 

</span><span>the reserve area where this farm is situated to a private individual.  However, I have 

</span><span>been assured it is not the farm area that has been sold.  It is just the assets of the farm.  

I  was  also  surprised  that  a  much  larger,  more  substantial  offer  was  made  for  the 

purchase  of  assets  of  this  particular  farm  but  the  CIIC  refused  that  offer.    The 

information I have received was that this farm was put on sale and it was sold for a 

very cheap price.  The concern expressed by the Island Council of Manihiki was that 

no offer was made to the people of Manihiki to purchase this particular farm.  Instead 

the farm was sold to one particular individual. 

</span></div><div><span>I also understand, Mr Chairman, that when this Marine Resources Farm was started by 

the  former  Minister  of  Marine  Resources,  Ben  Toma,  the  Island  Council  and  the 

people of Manihiki  had a share in this farm.  The people of Manihiki want to know 

where  their  share  is  now  that  the  farm  has  been  sold.  Where  is  their  ten  per  cent 

interest in that farm has gone to.  I was surprised that the CIIC with the approval of 

Cabinet has sold this particular farm to one individual rather than consider the welfare 

of the whole island of Manihiki.  Are we too stupid to be considered for the purchase 

of this farm?  Come on.  I want it recorded that if the farm was made available to the 

people  of  Manihiki  we  will  be  interested  in  purchasing  that  farm.    I  know  a  very 

</span><span>substantial  amount  of  Government  money  went  into  that  farm  before  the  current 

</span><span>Minister  of  Marine  Resources  took  over  the  farm.    I  also  am  aware  that  the  return 

from this farm has not been what it was proposed. 

</span></div><div><span>The  other  question  raised,  Mr  Chairman,  is  the  availability  of  the  EIA  recently 

performed on the island of Suwarrow.  I understand some of the people involved in 

conducting  this  EIA  have  a  pecuniary  interest  in  starting  a  pearl  farm  in  Suwarrow 

itself. I am aware that the EIA that has been put out is favourable for people to go and 

farm  pearls  there.    I  question  the  restriction  of  this  Report  to  the  people  who 

</span><span>conducted the EIA and who have interests in starting pearl farms in Suwarrow. I have 

</span><span>one question for the Minister. Could the Minister tell this House and the people of this 

country whether there is any proposal before Government to sell and encourage pearl 

farming by foreigners in Suwarrow?   Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>1841 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Utia Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  UTIA  MATATA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker,  Greetings  to  you  and  to  all 

Honourable Members on both sides of the House.  Greetings to all the staff members 

and to all our people who are listening in to our debate this afternoon, Kia Orana.    

</span></div><div><span>We have come through a very difficult spell but through the love of God, His affection 

and His Grace, our prayers have all been heard.  

</span></div><div><span>Now I will come back to the budget of the Marine Resources.   I will not talk about 

the pearl, the lobster and other farming in the outer islands.  Rather, I will talk about 

the marine restrictions of the island of Rarotonga. We should acknowledge the  </span><span>Raui</span><span>

programmes  on Rarotonga. I think 5 different areas were subjected to restrictions.  I 

thank the people of Rarotonga for the respect and the support of the </span><span>raui</span><span> imposed by 

the  </span><span>Aronga  Mana.</span><span>  The  </span><span>Raui</span><span>  of  Rarotonga  is  slightly  different  from  those  in  the 

Northern Group or in Aitutaki.  Our lagoon is much smaller than that of those islands. 

Therefore,  we need to  know what  benefits  can derive from  these  </span><span>Raui</span><span>. I believe Mr 

Chairman that the reason of these marine restrictions on the island of Rarotonga is to 

preserve marine life.  In the areas where we have the </span><span>Raui,</span><span> the population of trochus 

has increased.  Our trochus is all around the island now.  We know that Aitutaki is the 

only  island  that  is  benefiting from  this trochus in  monetary terms.  But  in  Rarotonga 

the  trochus  has  been  consumed  domestically.    For  the  simple  reason  the  people  of 

Rarotonga is not able to capitalise on the monetary benefit of the trochus.   

</span></div><div><span>No plan has yet eventuated. I am not sure how many tons of trochus shells have been 

wasted. In addition, I would like to Marine Resources Department to establish some 

plans to make the people of Rarotonga aware that there is economic benefit from the 

trochus.  And I am aware Mr Chairman that farming sea cucumber is also economical.  

There  are  countries  farming  sea  cucumber,  seaweeds  and  other  marine  resources.  I 

think that there were discussions on these matters in the past but no concrete plan was 

designed  to  realise  it.  When  I  look  at  Rarotonga,  I  see  all  these  potentials  from  our 

lagoon.  Let  us  not  concentrate on the fish.  Once these restrictions lapse it will not 

take long for the people to deplete our fish stocks in the lagoons.  The restrictions in 

the  Rutaki  area  were  opened  after  nine  months.  The  biggest  stock  noticed  was  the 

trochus.  Today  there  is  another  restricted  area  from  Kavera  to  Vaiakura.  And  this 

restriction in Puaikura is a big and a wide area and people are restricted from fishing 

there.      And  the  people  have  recommended  that  these  restrictions  in  this  area  in 

Puaikura should be left up to just before Christmas and open it to the people. By that 

time we will have sufficient stock for the Christmas festivities.  And I still believe the 

trochus is the most economical marine venture we can develop from these activities. I 

have  not  much  else  to  say  Mr  Chairman,  but  I  will  give  my  full  support  to  the 

allocation in the budget for the Marine Resource 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. Are there any other speakers?  

</span><span>The Honourable Member, Mataio Aperau. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>1842 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  M.  APERAU:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman,  Greetings  to  you,  Greetings  to 

Honourable Members in Government and in the Opposition. Greetings to our people 

who are listening in to our debate this afternoon, Kia Orana to you all.    

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  this  Budget  allocation  to  the  Marine 

Resources.    We have heard of the views of the Honourable Members before us.   I 

believe the issue has been thoroughly thrashed Mr Chairman. It looks as if we will be 

stuck on this vote item for some times. So please allow me to extend my appreciation 

to some persons in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>First, Mr Chairman, I wish to make an announcement. </span><span>I would like to thank God for 

the opportunity to be a Member of Parliament for this country and I would like at this 

time to give Greetings to my Constituency and the people who put their confidence in 

me to represent them for two terms in Parliament.  The majority of the people of my 

electorate believed I am the best person to be their representative in this House.  It is 

nearly time for another general election and we know the things that are done where 

candidates go out and ask for the support of their people.  I did that in my time and 

promised them what I would do for them.  It is my belief that I have done the majority 

of  the  promises  I  made  to  my  people  in  the  ten  years  I  have  been  a  Member  of 

Parliament.  I also believe whoever comes after me will have an easier job.   

</span></div><div><span>One gentleman I would like to thank very much is at present in New Zealand and he is 

very ill and that is Mr George Taraare.  This is the man who submitted my name to the 

General  Secretary  of  the  CIP  at  that  time  in  order  that  I  become  a  Member  of 

Parliament for the village.  I still have not been able to figure out why he thought to 

put me here.  We know at the time I was working closely with the General Secretary 

of the Cook Islands Party the Honourable Tom Marsters.  This is how it came about 

that I was a candidate for the Cook Islands Party.  That general election is history now. 

</span></div><div><span> I was lucky to become a Member of Parliament.  When I became a Member I worked 

for three Ministers.  In the time I worked for them they were all capable Ministers and 

I offered all my support to each one of them.  In 1989 I worked for the Prime Minister 

and at the time, he was responsible for the Ministry of Works.  Soon after that the new 

Member for Puaikura the Honourable Tom Marsters became my Minister.  It was at 

that  time  the  Ministry  of  Works  became  the  Ministry  of  MOWEP.    Today  I  am 

assisting the Deputy Prime Minister.  I would like to thank these Ministers in so far as 

</span><span>they have helped me and for accepting my assistance in this department.   

</span></div><div><span>There were other people whom I have worked with over those years.  When I started 

off  the  Secretary  was  George  Cowan,  then  there  was  Teanau  Taripo  and  Potiki 

Mataroa.  We are all aware of the great efforts they have done in our country.  We also 

had  people  like  Tua  Henry,  Ken  Browne,  Bates  William  of  the  Water  Department, 

later the Head of the Ministry was changed to Tui Short assisted by Maine Brown.  I 

would like to thank them.  There were a lot of projects we did together and which we 

did well.   

</span></div><div><span>The Head of the Ministry today is Keu Mataroa, assisted by Tipokoroa, Ben Parakoti 

and  the  workers  there.  To  all  the  workers  in  the  office  of  MOWEP  thanks  and 

congratulations for the good work you have done that I have been involved in.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1843 

</span></div><div><span>In  October  last  year,  my  Electoral  committee  had  a  meeting  and  I  informed  the 

meeting that my wife and I have decided I will not stand for the next election.  It has 

always  been  my  belief  to  give  ten  years  to  my  services  to  the  people  of  my 

Constituency and my country.  I believe it is time for me to retire and give the reins to 

a  younger  man.    I  would  like  all  Members  of  Parliament  to  know  who  the  next 

Honourable Member will be who will replace me.  His name is Iotia Atera.  This man 

does  all  the  community  work  in  my  village.    It  does  not  matter  what  kind  of  work, 

everybody in my village knows this is the young man who does all that work.  He is a 

Deacon  in  the  Cook  Islands  Christian  Church,  and  he  is  also  Chairman  of  the 

Christian Youth of Rarotonga.  I believe this young man should come into this House 

and carry on the responsibility of looking after our people from here. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to congratulate and thank Mama Mau for giving me food all these days 

that we have been meeting.  To everyone who will be competing in the next general 

election, God bless you all.  It is of no use for me to say, let us have a clean campaign.  

We always say this but later on somebody is sued for all kinds of election practices.  

Therefore, I would like to encourage everyone in the House and our people who are 

</span><span>new to this game. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank you Mr Chairman, all your staff for working together with 

me over the last ten years. 

</span></div><div><span>I again  give my support to this Appropriation for the Ministry of Marine Resources.  

There  was  one  area  of  concern  to  me  in  this  Ministry,  at  one  stage.    We  can  all 

</span><span>remember there used to be a prawn farm in the village of Matavera.   I don’t want you 

to ask the Minister any questions about this because he doesn’t know anything about 

</span><span>this  farm.    We  know  that  this  farm  was  trialed  twice  and  this  was  done  very  well.  

When  this  farm  was  established  the  water  intake  had  not  been  put  in  place  in 

Matavera.  Shortly after the implementation, we can remember that there was a water 

intake  installed  in  Matavera  and  one  in  Tupapa.    That  was  detrimental  to  the  farm 

because  no  water  reached  this  farm.    We  tried  to  hang  on  with  the  hope  that  there 

would be enough water to  fill  the prawn farms.  But we actually received very little 

water from  the intake. I told the staff of the Water Department to turn the water off 

because at that time water was being carted from Matavera to various areas in Avarua, 

Nikao and the Airport.  So I thought it was better to sacrifice the prawns rather than 

</span><span>have  our  people  suffer  from  lack  of water.  There were 40,000 prawns in  this farm.  

</span><span>These all died.  This is the reason that this farm had to be abandoned, that is the water 

</span><span>wasn’t reaching the farm.  All of the water was going into the water mains.</span></div><div><span>One body I would like to thank very much is the New Zealand Overseas Development 

Assistance because this is the group of people who helped us so much, especially the 

Water  Department.    So  I  would  like  to  again  thank  the  New  Zealand  High 

Commission for all the assistance they have provided us. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my views, Mr Chairman.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Justice and Lands, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>1844 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman. Kia Orana to you.  Kia Orana also to 

the staff members of this House.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members, to the Prime 

Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and all Members of Government.  

Kia Orana to  the Members in  the Opposition.   To the Leader of the Opposition,  the 

Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate and your Members, to the Leader of the New Alliance 

Party,  the  Honourable  Norman  George and your Members  - Kia Orana to  you all in 

the name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to all our people listening in this afternoon.  To all our guests, tourists 

on the island, to all our friends and family members from overseas - Kia Orana to you 

all in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>A  special  greetings  through  you,  Mr  Chairman,  to  our  National  Seven-a-Side  team 

who  has  just  returned  from  Fiji.    They  competed  in  the  International  Seven-a-Side 

Tournament  in  Fiji.    To  the  tour  Leader,  Colin  Brown,  the  National  Coach,  George 

and to  all the members of this National Squad congratulations for the good effort to 

represent  your  country  in  the  Seven-a-Side  Tournament  in  Fiji,  Kia  Orana  and 

welcome  back  home.    I  am  quite  certain  that  this  is  a  very  good  placing  that  they 

achieved  in  this  tournament,  Mr  Chairman.    The  best  part  though,  Mr  Chairman,  is 

that  we  were  represented  by  our  young  boys  from  the  Cook  Islands  and  not  by  our 

boys from either New Zealand or Australia. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise,  Mr  Chairman,  to  give  my  support  for  this  Appropriation  for  the  Ministry  of 

Marine  Resources.  I  would  like  to  give  my  special  greetings  to  the  Minister 

responsible for Marine Resources, the Honourable Minister Tepure Tapaitau and to all 

the staff of this Ministry.  I think you will agree with me, Mr Chairman, that this is a 

very  important  Ministry  because  they  are  responsible  for  the  development  of  the 

Marine  Resources  of  our  country  and  in  particular  the  Pearl  Farming  Industry.  The 

benefits that we can get from our ocean, Mr Chairman, are infinite.  However, I also 

think,  that  in  one  particular  area,  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  must  attempt  to 

protect  our  ocean  and  prevent  anything  detrimental  to  our  marine  from  entering  our 

country.  Maybe we will say that Pearl Farming is a new industry in our country.  So 

we will have to be very careful to prevent anything happening to this industry.  I think 

our Ministry is aware of all the dangers that are associated to this industry. From the 

experiences of the countries within the region, we should be able to be better prepared 

</span><span>for any such dangers. 

</span></div><div><span>I am very glad, Mr Chairman, to see that a lot of our young people qualified in Marine 

Resources is returning home and is now working to develop this industry.  They are 

doing  their  best  to  improve  ways  and  means  to  derive  benefits  out  of  our  marine 

industry. 

</span></div><div><span>There  was  mention  of  Mr  Ron  Powell  and  also  Mr  Ioaba  Marsters in  the times that 

they worked for the Marine Resources.  I think if they were alive today they would be 

</span><span>very happy to see that our young people have gone overseas, qualified and are back to 

</span><span>improve  our  situation.  Had  they’ve  been  here  now,  I  am  sure  they  would  be  very 

happy  with  the  progress  we’ve  made  in  this  industry.    We  can  see  today,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, the results of all the great efforts of these young people.  Above all, I think 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1845 

</span></div><div><span>it  is  important  to  note  that  these  young  people  have  been  working  closely  with  the 

public and the folks in the industry in order to gain some inroads as we see it today.  I 

think that there are some pearl farmers who may not be happy with what is happening 

but if they were to look at this industry in the long term, they will be able to see the 

benefits of what our young people are doing. 

</span></div><div><span>I think that the whole purpose behind sending our young people overseas to get these 

qualifications  was  to  bring  them  back  to  help  the  industry  to  grow  to  a  better  level.   

We  can  see  the  people  of  Manihiki  are  reaping  the  benefit  of  this  industry.  Pearl 

farming is now extended to Penrhyn and the people are beginning to enjoy the benefits 

there. The return from these pearl farmers will revolve in this country to help all of us. 

</span><span>Although  the  cyclone  devastated  the  island,  it  hasn’t  discouraged  the  people  from 

</span><span>reviving  and  maintaining  their  farms.  The  Minister  announced  last  week  that  a  new 

project  will  be  established  in  Penrhyn  and  I  am  very  excited  about  that.  While  the 

costs will be met out of this budget, the benefit that will be derived from this fishing 

venture will be of benefit to the people of Penrhyn.  I recall the dilemma encountered 

by  one  fishing  company  on  Rarotonga  a  few  years  back.  Lucky  Matapuku  was  an 

</span><span>inspiration  in  the  fishing  industry  but  the  unfortunate  occurred  and  Lucky’s  venture 

</span><span>went down. As a result, he had to sell a piece of his land to absorb the loan that he has 

</span><span>instigated.  I have heard that he may lose his property.  I do not know whether that has 

</span><span>actually  happened.  Maybe  Lucky  didn’t  have  enough  experience  in  certain  areas  of 

</span><span>this venture. However, I think it is a matter which Government could also look into to 

see where we could assist.  

</span></div><div><span>I recall the time when the Minister of Marine Resources was Ben Toma.  He gave me 

a draft legislation for the lagoon of Titikaveka to consider. There and then, I told him 

my mind was made up if he wanted to know. I told him to take the proposed Bill he 

was preparing to Manihiki.  If he were going to create a Bill then it would pay if he 

drafted  one  to  restrict  the  people  in  the  other  districts  of  Rarotonga  from  fishing  in 

Titikaveka. Now, the imposition of the </span><span>Raui</span><span> has realised what I had in mind. I thank 

all  the  members  of  the  </span><span>Koutu  Nui</span><span>  and  the  </span><span>Aronga  Mana</span><span>  of  the  districts  around 

Rarotonga  and  the  support  of  the  NZODA.  Thank  you  also  to  the  Environment 

officers  for  the  combined  effort.  There  are  a  number  of  marine  problems  we  are 

encountering,  likewise  the  reefs  and  the  lagoons.   In regards to  Titikaveka, we have 

great concern for the sailing, skiing and motorboat activities in the lagoon which often 

disrupt  the  marine  life  forms.  Many  people  inquired  what  the  law  was  over  these 

</span><span>activities, I told them that I did not know.  The only fast solution would be to puncture 

</span><span>these speed-boats. There is no law against this, but these are matters that need to be 

considered by the District Council of Takitumu.  

</span></div><div><span>As a result of the </span><span>Raui</span><span>, we have experienced an increase in trochus population in the 

lagoon.  Similar to what the Honourable Member Utia Matata was saying.  Through 

these marine restrictions, our people are now more conscious of the benefits we can 

reap from the sea. The conservation of our lagoon and its resources is for our future 

generations.  This  is  one  of  the  few  major  developments  in  many  countries.  The 

</span><span>environment,  the  ecosystem,  and  the  marine.  There  are  a  number  of  articles  and 

</span><span>reports  regarding  the  environment  and  of  course,  experts  and  environmentalists  are

</span></div><div><span>Through  you,  Mr  Chairman  I  should  thank  the  staff  of  the  Marine  Resource  in 

Rarotonga and in the outer islands for the great work they are doing. Thank you, Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Mama Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS.  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>  To  you  Mr  Chairman,  Honourable  Members  in  the  House 

and to everybody present, Kia Orana.  Our special welcome to the lady in the public 

gallery.  

</span></div><div><span>Last  week  I  have  spoken regarding the views expressed by the Honourable Member 

Utia  Matata  and  the  Honourable  Minister  Tiki  Matapo  especially  concerning  the 

trochus. I have spoken about this matter and I would like to encourage the Honourable 

Members in the House not to spend too much time talking about these things.  Let us 

try  to  establish  some  legislation  to  protect  the  trochus  population  that  is  growing  in 

our lagoons.  I believe within the various areas that we have put marine restrictions, 

our resources will multiply.  I would like to focus on our own area in Nikao.  We need 

to protect these areas. There are people harvesting close to the boundaries of the </span><span>Raui</span><span>. 

We  need  to  work  hand  in  hand  with  the  </span><span>Aronga  Mana</span><span>,  the  Mayor,  and  the 

Councillors.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  encourage  the  Councillors  and  the  Mayors  on  Rarotonga,  to  rally 

together because this will be a money making venture for us.   I share with the views 

of the Mayor of Aitutaki  when he said  last year there were tons of trochus exported 

from Aitutaki and the money revolved on the island.  He said he banned the export of 

trochus for at least a year.  At the harvest time inspectors inspect the quality and the 

size of the trochus required.  In Aitutaki they brought all the trochus together and had 

them  checked.  Then  they  boiled them and removed the meat  for home consumption 

and the shell for export.   

</span></div><div><span>We should be doing a similar project in Rarotonga.  They are harvesting in Aitutaki 

and we should do the same in here. Then combine the harvest and it export overseas.  

In February next year, that will be the second year of the restrictions on our lagoon.  I 

have  shared  this  with  the  people  of  my  community.    We  agreed  to  a  two  year 

restriction term and then we open the lagoon, harvest the trochus and bring them all 

together.  We have decided that no other village will be involved in this.  We do not 

mind the people of Rarotonga sharing in the flesh of the trochus but the shell remains 

for the people of Nikao.  We will combine this with the Aitutaki harvest. Meanwhile 

we will move the  </span><span>Raui</span><span> to  another area for one year to  allow the trochus to multiply 

and to mature.  Let us not waste our time just talking.  Let us do something about it, 

</span><span>let’s put in legislatio</span><span>n to protect our marine life like the outer islands.   

</span></div><div><span>I  believe  what  the  Honourable  Member  Utia  Matata  said  regarding  the  seaweed 

around  the  island.  I  have  seen  it  happen,  the  Honourable  Member  has  shown  the 

variety of seaweed we need to go into.  The Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati 

also  looked  into  the  matter  because  he  has  an  interest  in  it.    When  the  Honourable 

Member  brought  the  matter  up  it  reminded  me  of  an  experience  when  I  was  in 

Kiribati.

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I would like to call upon the young people of Nikao for a working bee.  

Those who were not at church on Sunday, I wish to bring this notice to you. There are 

a lot of rubbish and branches hanging onto the roads which need to be cleared away.  

Bring bush knives, rakes and assemble at the Social Centre at 4.00 p.m. We will start 

the clean up from the Social Center. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Honourable Member Mataio Aperau, I appreciate your openness in informing 

the House and the people of your intention to step down at the next General Election. 

The work you were involved during your term in Government is well noted. To you 

and to the Honourable Ngereteina Puna good luck and may God bless you two in your 

future endeavours.  The remaining Members will have to continue serving our people.  

May God bless you two. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>I now call upon the Honourable Minister for Marine Resources, 

Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>I think it is about time to respond seeing that everybody has 

contributed to the Vote Item 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  speak  from  now  until  we  close  and  probably  continue  tomorrow  when  we 

resume. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  you  Mr  Chairman.    To  the  Clerk  of  Parliament,  the  staff  Members  of 

Parliament,  Kia  Orana.    Greetings  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister, 

Members  of  Government,  Cabinet  Members,  the  leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance 

Party,  the  leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  who  could  be  in  Court  right  now.    To 

everybody, Kia Orana in the love of God. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings also to the people of our country who are listening in, likewise to those who 

are  not,  Greetings  to  you  all.    Greetings  to  my  electorate  and  to  all  the  people  of 

Tongareva.  What I will be saying not only affects you but the people of the northern 

group as a whole. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman  when  I  started  speaking  on  the  budget  appropriation  for  Marine 

Resources I was talking about an organisation which is establishing a fishing venture 

in  the  northern  group.    In  response,  we  heard  all  the  criticisms  from  the  Opposition 

bench. They are claiming that we are dreaming Mr Chairman.  They alleged that this 

has political  overtones.  And why is it that we did not implement this project five or 

ten  years  ago.  Why  now?  Why  is  it  right  before  a  general  election?    Mr  Chairman 

when I was elected in 1994 we looked into a fishing venture for tuna, wahoo, trevally 

and lobster for the lagoons of the northern group. 

</span></div><div><span>We  tried  to  foster  a  project  for  six  months.  We  made  a  lot  of  money  and  one 

fisherman made $100 nett per day. His catch was transported by boat to Hawaii and 

the  mainland  USA.    In  1994  when  I  became  a  Member  of  Parliament,  the  Island 

Council of the Island of Penrhyn and I evaluated the fishing industry. We carried out a 

research to identify possible outlets to market the fish efficiently.  In our assessments 

there  was  one  dominating  factor.  That  is  to  improve  the  airport  by  concreting  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>1848 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>runway.  Tarsealing  was  a  far  fetched  option  which  in  the  long  term  would  be  more 

expensive.    With  the  additional  complexes,  the  project  will  also  provide  water  to 

supply  the  homes.    The  water  will  have  to  be  stored  in  a  reservoir  and  from  there 

tapped into the homes. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, those Members who have been to the Marshall Islands would have seen 

that they have concrete runways and the water is drained into a reservoir where that 

reservoir  supplies  the  homes  with  water.    If  we  were  to  look  at  this  project,  Mr 

Chairman,  we  can  see  that  the  benefits  from  the  lagoon,  the  ocean  and  the 

improvement  of  the  airport  will  generate  three  main  products  for  the  people  of 

Tongareva. 

</span></div><div><span>This  plan  was  not  forged  yesterday  or  today.    If  this  was  created  yesterday  or today 

then I would accept those as fair comments and that this is politics. But it is not. This 

was fully documented in the past years, Mr Chairman.  We submitted this project to 

many donor organisations for their considerations.  Some people came and reviewed 

these  proposals.  They  concluded  that  the  project  was  risky  and  they  might  lose  out.  

So  they  left.    There  were  many  people  who  registered  their  interest,  Mr  Chairman.  

</span><span>Today,  we  have  this  group  of  people  who  are  coming  in  with  their  money  and  they 

</span><span>will go off to Penrhyn to put in place contractual agreements with the people through 

</span><span>the  Island  Council.    This  project  is  not  Government’s.  This  project  has been put  in 

</span><span>place by the private sector in conjunction with private people outside of our country.  

They  have  finally  come  to  a  point  where  they  are  putting  the  final  touches  to  this 

</span><span>project.    This  then,  Mr  Chairman,  is  what  has  been  happening  and  I  don’t  like  the 

</span><span>insinuations that Government has slept on it for too long.  We heard them saying, why 

has Gove</span><span>rnment left it too long.  Why didn’t Government do it in the past?  Why have 

</span><span>they waited until now?  These views are rather childish. 

</span></div><div><span>There are a lot of benefits for these people, Mr Chairman, as this is going ahead.  We 

need to have a lot of areas in the lagoon to breed fish.  Because we need these milkfish 

as  bait  for  these  ten  smaller  boats  that  will  be  going  out  to  bring  fish  back  from 

Manihiki,  Rakahanga  and  the  other  islands.    We  are  not  looking  at  10  or  20,000  of 

these milkfish. We need millions and millions of these fish for the sister fishing boats. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  past,  Mr  Chairman,  the  Island  Council  and  my  people  have  been  asking  me 

what  the  situation  was  in  terms  of  these  proposals.    They  wanted  to  know  whether 

</span><span>there has been any feedback.  I told them that these people have come and gone but 

</span><span>let’s  just  wait  and  see.    Today  I  am  able  to  advise  them  that these investors will be 

</span><span>back and they will be meeting with the Island Councils to iron out the last few details.  

I  will  leave  this  here  for  now  Mr  Chairman  and  we  will  wait  and  see  what  sort  of 

criticisms will arise in the future with regard to myself, my people and this project. 

</span></div><div><span>These are the things Mr Chairman, that I have said in this House before and if I say it 

again, be it the second or the third time. Mr Chairman, I am elected representative for 

the people of Tongareva.  I work for them and when my services are needed for me to 

</span><span>go back home I will not hesitate to do it.  Irrespective, Mr Chairman, if I am needed 

</span><span>here, if the need arises for me to go back and see my people, without hesitation, I shall 

go back. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1849 

</span></div><div><span>There  was  a  question  posed  by  the  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  last  week  Mr 

Chairman.  I was glad of his question.  He asked what sort of assistance I was giving 

and  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  to  the  pearl  farmers  of  the  Northern  Group.  

That  is,  to  the island of Manihiki  and the island of Tongareva.  We in  the Southern 

</span><span>Group  don’t  know  much  about  the  issue  of  pearl  farming  but  what  is  required 

</span><span>sometimes is that there need to be some lines put in place along the seabed. There has 

to  be  a  line  anchored  which  could  be  up  to  220  metres  long.    This  line  has  to  be 

anchored, while ropes of about 8 feet are latched to it.  This cannot be achieved, Mr 

Chairman, by skin divers.  This has to be </span><span>done by people with aqualungs.  You can’t 

</span><span>just take somebody off the street and put this diving gear on them and tell them to go 

and  dive.  What  we  need  are  divers  who  are  certified  by  diving  instructors  from 

Rarotonga.  These diving instructors must be certified as well by international diving 

institutions and this is how the Ministry of Marine Resources is involved. 

</span></div><div><span>When  pearl  farming  started  on  the  island  of  Manihiki,  the  Ministry  of  Marine 

Resources  put  in  place  as  part  of  their  assistance  to  the  pearl  farmers,  a  field  unit. 

They did have the knowledge as to how to go about it. So the Ministry then gave them 

the assistance through the field unit and the members of the field unit were there to lay 

</span><span>the lines for them.   And while this was happening the Ministry of Marine Resources 

</span><span>also sought some donor agencies outside of the country. This is to enable the Ministry 

to take certified diving instructors to teach the pearl farmers on the island of Manihiki 

so they can become certified divers.   

</span></div><div><span>There was a lot of money involved, Mr Chairman, to teach a person to dive. The costs 

are in the range of $300 to $400.   In order to make it easier on ourselves what we had 

to do was to get together a group of between 20 to 30 people and then we talked about 

the need for an instructor.  From the year 1985 up until the year 1992 this assistance 

was  going  to  Manihiki  alone  because  the  people  of  Tongareva  had  not  agreed  that 

pearl farming be started up there.  Towards the end of the 1992 and at the beginning of 

1993, when the people of Tongareva finally agreed that this venture be started on the 

island after a series of meetings with the Minister of the Marine Resources Ben Toma, 

at the time, assistance was then given to the island of Penrhyn. 

</span></div><div><span> This then Mr Chairman is in response to the question as to what type of assistance the 

Ministry of Marine Resources has been giving to pearl farmers.  This is one of those 

things that we have been doing to assist the pearl farmers. Government has also been 

</span><span>extending  tax-exemptions  to  our  pearl  farmers,  a  form  of  help  we  normally  give  to 

</span><span>Agriculture persons. I think the people in the Northern group were not aware that there 

was such a thing as tax-exemptions on agriculture equipment but today they are aware 

of that type of assistance. There are other forms of help we provide.  

</span></div><div><span>Today, the Cook Islands Development Bank has opened the loaning facilities to them. 

Today  Mr  Chairman,  there  is  an  Association  in  the  Northern  Group  between  the 

people of Tongareva and the people of Manihiki.  It is very strong. That is the Pearl 

Federation.  The Federation has managed to solicit funding for the purchase of lines, 

</span><span>floats, ropes, and other amenities.  These equipment has been sold to pearl farmers at 

</span><span>a rate a lot cheaper than what business people on the island of Rarotonga are charging.  

That then is my answer to the question raised by the Leader of the New Alliance Party.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>1850 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>This in response to the question Mr Chairman and it is this is in line with the policy of 

Government.  We  as  a  Ministry  has  been  helping  private  individuals.  Government 

policy is to strengthen the private enterprise.   If we look at the past, a lot of assistance 

has  always  gone  to  farmers  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga.    Government  has  been 

assisting in the past in bananas, oranges, pineapples and planting of taro.  The islands 

in the outer islands Mr Chairman never got any such assistance. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> I will interrupt you Honourable Member.    I would like to ask 

that you move for progress to be reported to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That progress be reported to the House. 

</span></div><div><span>LEADER OF THE HOUSE: </span><span>Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the debate on the Appropriation Amendment Bill be Adjourned until
