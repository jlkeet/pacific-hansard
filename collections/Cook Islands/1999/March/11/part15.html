<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Order, please. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> So you have to have patience and bear with us brother.  There 

</span><span>will be pressure at times and there will be pleasure at times.  So I don’t know whether 

</span><span>this is pressure but you are calling out it as pleasure. I will ring Putangi tomorrow and 

tell him never mind, everything will be okay, he has no worries.  

</span></div><div><span>I  have heard the praises for the service you provided, as expressed by the Honourable 

Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party,  the  Honourable  Norman  George.  He  is  quite  right, 

you have done some good but you also had some failures which I will not discuss right 

</span><span>now as it won’t look right. I don’t want to heap too much praises on you at this time. 

</span><span>We are still debating and there may come a Bill before the House where I am required to 

</span><span>criticise you and I can’t because it will cancel out my earlier praises. So the main thing 

</span><span>here is, bro, that you have shown that you have had enough of the torture that we keep 

inflicting on you, so it is better for you to retire.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  No pain, no gain. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Best wishes for the future. I have often thought what it might 

be  like  to  retire.  Maybe  it  will  be  comfortable,  calm  and  peaceful  and  I  will  have  no 

cares in the world. The best thing about today is that we have the opportunity to say our 

praises  to  you  directly  because  you  are  actually  present  in  the  House.  On  other 

</span><span>occasions, we don’t have the opportunity to tell someone what we think of them because 

</span><span>they  died  or  have  gone  away  and  are  no  longer  in  this  House.  This  is  a  wonderful 

</span><span>opportunity because you are here in front of us in this House and you don’t have to hear 

</span><span>it from somebody else later. So to you, Jackie, and your children, may God bless you all 

with long and good lives. 

</span></div><div><span>I  come  now  to  the  matter  raised  by  the  Honourable  Member,  Joseph  Williams  of  the 

Overseas Seat.  I am sure, Mr Speaker, you can recall what we said during the Second 

Reading debate of the Constitution Amendment No.23 Because, we supported the first 

part  of  the  Amendment  of  this  Constitution  No.23.  We  supported  this  willingly,  Mr 

Speaker, without any hesitation. At the time Government workers were being laid off or 

put  into  transition  because  Government  could  not  afford  to  pay  them  anymore.  We 

supported  the  move  to  reduce  the  number  of  members  in  Cabinet  because  Public 

Servants were being laid off. Our views have not changed - Cabinet should be reduced. 

We were very sorry about this state of affairs. We lost over 2000 Public Servants. That 

was a very sad memory for me Mr Speaker if I think back of the pain and sorrow, and 

the  financial  difficulties  many  people  experienced.  They  had  to  leave  for  overseas  in 

order to get work so they could maintain their mortgages and payment for their cars or 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>1814 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>whatever.  They had to do that because they had to find employment. There was nothing 

there in the private sector or anywhere else. Because of that, Mr Speaker, we expressed 

our full support to reduce Cabinet when the Bill was introduced into the House. 

</span></div><div><span>As  to  the  second  part  of  the  same  Amendment,  which  introduces  a  Minister  from 

outside  of  Members  of  Parliament,  we expressed our strong opposition. We could  not 

see anywhere in the Amendment, or in the explanatory notes, or Interpretation, to show 

how  the  outside  Minister  will  be  appointed,  what  sort  of  checks  and  balances  are 

available.  We could not find anything like that in there and we could not agree to that 

part of the Amendment.  To me, Mr Speaker, I saw that as a kind of nit-picking from the 

Political Reform Report recommendations. When you look at the recommendations, Mr 

Speaker,  it  indicates  that  the  recommendation  wants  a  reduction  of  the  Members  of 

Parliament in this country as well.  If I remember, it was recommended to come down to 

17.  From  25  to  17  but  this  was  not  part  of  this  Constitution  Amendment.    And  the 

</span><span>question  is  why  wasn’t  that  made  part  of  the  Constitution  Amendment?  The  simple 

</span><span>reason and simple answer to that is because there was a need to look further into each 

constituency  for  the  views  of  the  people  and  the  way  to  do  that  was  to  put  it  to  a 

Referendum. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  taken  a  delegation  to  Mangaia,  Mr  Speaker  to  establish  the  Committees,  to 

confirm  the  Committees  for  each  constituency  in  Mangaia.  I  found  that  none  of  the 

</span><span>constituencies  said  that  they  don’t  want  a  Member</span><span>  of  Parliament  for  them.  So  that  is 

opposite to what the Report says that Mangaia only wants one Member of Parliament for 

them. So there is a need for a Referendum. I see it a conflict here. Whereas the Report 

recommends  that  Mangaia  only  want  one  Member  of  Parliament,  none  of  the 

constituencies  expressed  that  view  when  we  went  there.  Therefore,  I  am  saying  Mr 

Speaker, I see it as a package. When you talk about an outside Minister for Cabinet, you 

should  look  at  it  in  terms  of  the  total  component  of  the  Parliament  as  well  as  the 

component of a Cabinet.  Those are the two main reasons why I gave my objection to 

that part of the Amendment. The third part ...   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I think, Honourable Member, you are spending too much time on the 

principles  and  merits  of  the  Bill.  We  are  now  dealing  with  the  Motion  on  the  Floor.  

Please come back to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to say this much Mr 

Speaker, at that time we objected to it because of these deficiencies.  I would like to ask 

for your patience Mr Speaker because I am coming to my point. And the point is now 

that the Honourable Dr Williams have come up with the alternative that is to introduce 

checks and balances. In particular, the request to the Prime Minister. I hope he took note 

of it where it says, he and his Government will not activate the programmes of the third 

</span><span>paragraph from the top, which says, “we will agree for you to vote in favour of the Bill 

</span><span>if  the  Prime  Minister,  in  a  pronouncement  to  Parliament,  registers  an  irrevocable 

undertaking that he and his Government will not activate Constitution Amendment No. 

</span><span>23 until further and more necessary amendments are made by the next Parliament”. </span></div><div><span>I am pleased to see, Mr Speaker, that No. 2 of the Amendments is included, as he has 

already read. It is confirmation. It gives an indication that there is going to be, with the 

support of the Government and especially the Prime Minister, that there will be checks 

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1815 

</span></div><div><span>and  balances  put  in  place  for  the  appointment  of  this  outside  Minister.  Even  though 

some  of  these  proposed  changes  looks  alright  to  the  Honourable  Dr  Williams,  it  will 

take care of the discrepancies with the appointment Minister. I still think that there is a 

need  to  review  what  he  has  proposed  for  the  next  Parliament.  That  satisfies  me,  Mr 

Speaker, because at least now I know...  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> You have run out of your speaking time, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move that: 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, the Leader of the Opposition, be given normal 

extension speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Members.    And  I  can  see  the  Honourable 

Member Dr Pupuke Robati rising to second the Motion.  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Dr P. Robati 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  thank  you  also  to  Honourable 

Members  of  this  House.      I  know  I  spent  most of my speaking time talking about  my 

brother, so forgive me.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we want all the recommendations that need t</span><span>he people’s vote to be referred 

</span><span>to  the  people.  And  for  all  those  recommendations  by  the  Committee,  which  can  be 

implemented,  we  have  no  problem  with  that.  As  we  said,  the  next  Government  can 

implement that any time. However, I am indicating to the Honourable Dr Williams now 

that I have expressed our satisfaction with the changes that have been proposed. At least 

we can see that Government is going to ensure that this Constitution Amendment will 

not  be  activated  until  the  next  Parliament  makes  the  necessary  changes  including  the 

ones he has proposed here. This is what I like to ask him, can he trust the Prime Minister 

for what he is asking?  Can he trust this Cabinet for what he is asking?   Can he trust his 

own Party, his own Government for what he is asking? I would also like to ask the same 

to the Honourable Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  You  know  well,  Honourable  Member  that  the  Honourable  Member, 

Tom Marsters, cannot speak. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Can  I  ask  him  the  question?  Does  he  trust  this  Prime 

</span><span>Minister?  Can  he  trust  the  Cabinet,  can  he  trust  this  Government  for  what  they  have 

asked here because it is they who asked for it in this letter. We all know that the Prime 

Minister sacked the Honourable Dr Williams.

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Mr Speaker, Point of Order. Point of Order. Point of Order, 

Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> We all know that the Honourable Tom Marsters had to resign 

because  the  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet  did  not  give  the  money  that  was  required  to 

help him. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Point of Order.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Relevancy in Debate, Mr Speaker. It is something he and the 

Honourable  Pupuke  Robati  are  used  to  doing.  If  we  talk  about  the  pawpaw,  they  will 

start talking about the sea cucumber. He has been talking about the sea cucumber for too 

long.  We  are  now talking about  the pawpaw. May I ask you Mr Speaker, to  bring the 

Honourable Member back to the subject or ask him to sit down? He is wasting our time.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  The  Point  of  Order  is  relevant,  Honourable  Member.  Please  come 

back to the Motion on the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker, but I am on the subject. Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>I  am  referring  to  Dr  Williams’s  proposal.    I  am  asking  him,  and  he  should  be  in  the</span><span>

House now to listen to what I have to ask him. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  You  understand  Honourable  Member  that  the  Honourable  Joseph 

Williams  cannot  answer  to  you  in  this  House  tonight  because  he  has  already  used  his 

speaking time.    

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T.  MAOATE:</span><span>So don’t I </span><span>have the right to ask the question, Mr Speaker? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  The  only  advice  I  have  for  you  is  to  shut  up.    Please  continue  and 

speak on the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>Well, I haven’t been told like that to shut up before. I think 

</span><span>this is unparliamentary.    

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Would  you  please  take  your  seat,  Honourable  Member?  I  will  now 

call upon the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker...  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I have not finished my speaking time, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I have ordered you to sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>What is the reason for that? I haven’t done anything wrong. I 

</span><span>just continued to speak on the Motion, what is my fault? Tell me what is my fault?  

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1817 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The reason is, you are being very cheeky to the Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>I am not being cheeky, Mr Speaker. You are the one who said 

</span><span>‘shut up’ to me, I didn’t say anything like that to you.</span></div>
