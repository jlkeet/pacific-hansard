</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Today, they are telling everyone in here that we are ignorant 

yet we went to school for a longer time than they did. All they did was eat mangoes and 

here they are today making out that they are the intelligent ones. They have a cheek to 

call us stupid. Mr Chairman, there are others in that back row that I would like to say 

some things about, but I will not. I think I will stop here.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA: </span><span> I want to raise a Point of Order. That is an insult from someone 

trying to be a political leader. He is insulting Members of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Are  there  any  other  speakers.  The  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman. I rise to support the Appropriation for the 

Ministry  of  Marine  Resources.  Like  everybody  else  before  me  Mr  Chairman,  it  is  an 

important industry.  It is not an industry which gets going straight away at the flick of a

and the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party, both of were former Ministers of the 

Ministry, ....
