<div><span>(MORE INTERJECTION BY MR N. GEORGE - INAUDIBLE) 

</span></div><div><span>As of yesterday, Mr Chairman, I have been informed that they have secured the amount 

of $5 million dollars to begin this operation as soon as possible. For our people in the 

Northern group this is a big business. We were engaged in this business in 1985 for 6 

months. Our fish at the time and our other seafood was transported to Hawaii by boat. 

However, because of the irresponsible manner of those involved in the Island Council, 

and  you  know  it,  the  project  came  to  a  stop.  I  want  you  to  know  that  we  have  been 

talking about this project for two years now. The Island Council is fully aware of what 

we have been discussing and today it is going to happen. This is good news for you the 

people of the Northern Group.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Norman George, Leader of New Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Firstly, Kia Orana to you this afternoon.  

Through  you  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  send  my  greetings  to  the  people  of  my 

homeland  Enuamanu.    Kia  Orana  also  to  the  Honourable  Member,  Upoko  Simpson, 

who has gone to the island of Mitiaro with Mrs Tauri Baker. I hope you two are having 

a good time. Kia Orana to  the people of Akatokamanava and to Mrs Tapu Enjoy who 

went to the island. We all hope that you are having a good time too. To all the people of 

the Islands of Nga-Pu-Toru, we the Members of Parliament of the three islands of Nga-

Pu-Toru are praying that you will not be hit by the Cyclone heading this way. Let us all 

pray and hope that the Lord will protect us all.   

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, Mr Chairman, to my people on the island of Araura, Kia Orana to you all on this 

beautiful afternoon in the name of Our Lord. What you did last night in the village of 

Vaipae was unbelievable. You poured out into the street outside. I was afraid some of 

you  would  be  hit  by  cars  as  there  were  so  many  of  you  attending  our  meeting  -  the 

meeting of the New Alliance Party. You came to  listen to our riveting conference last 

night.  No rock was thrown on to the roof of the building. The crowd was mesmerised 

last night. Mr Chairman. I have been to Vaipae many times in the past 10 years, but last 

night  there  was  five  times  the  crowd  that  I  saw  on  previous  occasions.  My  heart  was 

very glad to see this. This is the best political meeting I have ever held that I have ever 

been to in the beautiful village of Vaipae, Araura Enua.
