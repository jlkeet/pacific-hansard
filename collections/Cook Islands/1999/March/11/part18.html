<div><span>(COMMOTION IN THE HOUSE) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> What is your Point of Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Using unparliamentary conduct. There is no Honourable Member in 

this House called Teina Bishop. I would like you to ask the Honourable Prime Minister 

to withdraw that misleading statement. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. Mr Prime Minister... 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  How  do  you  withdraw  that?  The  Honourable  Member  is 

going to be the next Honourable Member.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>No way. Don’t get cocky. </span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>1818 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> I listened very carefully to the tribute paid by the Honourable 

Member Terepai Maoate, the doctor and the Leader of the Opposition. I was waiting and 

waiting for him to announce his retirement from politics, for he had indicated to some of 

his friends in Aitutaki and to some of his friends in Ngatangiia that he was planning to 

retire  before  the  next  election.  If  he  so  wishes,  I  am  prepared  to  write  his  retirement 

</span><span>speech for him.  He won’t need to consult his two wizards of Oz from America. </span></div><div><span>I want to make it clear Mr Speaker, that I accept the arrangement whereby, if it becomes 

my job to do so, I will make an amendment to Amendment No. 23 to make provision to 

ensure  that  there  is  integrity  in  the  selection  of  a  Minister  who  is  not  a  Member  of 

Parliament.  I want to make it clear, Mr Speaker, that I am saying that, and I would like 

the Member for the Overseas seat to convey this. I am saying this not because Joseph Ka 

has called for an irrevocable commitment from me. I am saying this because I agree with 

the  principles  enunciated  by  Professor  Hodges  so  that  there  is  a  provision  in  the 

Constitution that ensures the integrity of the appointment of somebody from outside of 

Parliament. So that in the highly unlikely event that the Honourable Member Dr Terepai 

Maoate  will  become  the  Prime  Minister,  he  will  not  be  able  to  appoint  one  of  his 

wizards  from  America.  I  want  to  make  it  clear  that  I  have  a  different  view  about  the 

appointment of a Minister from outside of Parliament from that expressed by the Leader 

of  the  New  Alliance Party and the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party. I support 

the views expressed by the Commission on Political Review and I support the rationale 

that  supports  those  views.    I  am  happy  to  endorse  the  motion  that  Constitution 

Amendment (No. 23) be now read a Third time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Constitution Amendment (No. 23) Bill be Read a Third time? 

</span></div><div><span>May I ask Honourable Members to rise from your seats when you cast your vote?   

</span></div><div><span>Those in favour please rise. Thank you Honourable Members. Against, please rise from 

your seats.  

</span></div><div><span>The result: for the question - ayes - 24.  Against the Question - noes - nil.  Total votes 

24.  Number of Members present also 24.  Thank you, Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>Ayes 

</span></div><div><span>Sir G.A. Henry                                                      Hon. I. Akaruru
