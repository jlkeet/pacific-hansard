</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Order, order please! 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>I  spoke  to  the  Prime  Minister  about  the  public’s  concern 

about this Minister’s behaviour in a public place but the Prime Minister ignored it and 

</span><span>the Minister was not disciplined.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> What is your Point of Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span> The Honourable Member can exercise a little bit more restraint 

in how he addresses Honourable Members in this House.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Please come back to the Bill before 

the House, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Put your pants on.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>I’m  coming  back.  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  talking  about  the 

</span><span>Leadership Code. I am trying to explain why a Leadership Code should be established. It 

will  benefit  us  by  curbing  these  sorts  of  disgraceful  behaviour  from  occurring.  This 

incident gave us a bad name here, it also went to Niue, New Zealand and everywhere. 

The Prime Minister must shape up. This was his fault. He is aware of a problem, which 

is why he is introducing this to the House.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span> It was four times that night.
