<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Really?  Also,  I  do  not  want  a drunken Minister to  go on a 

plane  with  an  open  shirt  and  no  shoes.  What  do  you  think,  Mr  Speaker?  Should  we 

allow these sorts of people to ruin our paradise?  

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Point of Order. Come back. Come back. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> What is your point of order Honourable Prime Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Mr Speaker, we are not talking about a law with regard to a 

Leadership Code. When we bring in the Act for a Leadership Code, that is the right time 

for him to talk about it. What we are doing at the moment is trying to decide whether we 

should bring in a Leadership Code or not. Do not bring your jealousy over the Minister 

into this House so we can see it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Bring your mind back to the Bill, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I will accept your instruction, I will not talk about these two 

gentlemen  anymore.    But  I  can  tell  you  I  was  very  angry  when  I  heard  this  news. 

Because he is my brother-in-law... 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Leave that matter there, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:    </span><span>Point  of  Order,  Mr  Speaker.    I  think  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition  is  getting  too  personal  with  his  attacks  by  naming  the  Members  in  this 

</span><span>Parliament.  Mr Speaker, I want to remind him, ‘Let the man without sin cast the first 

stone’. Don’t make out that you are a man without sin and these other people are sinners 

</span><span>and evildoers.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 40</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1825 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span> The next one on my list was the Deputy Prime Minister but 

</span><span>his news is old news so I won’t go back to the past. He shouldn’t make out he’s a monk 

</span><span>now.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU: </span><span> This man is sick, I think we should send him out.  I will ask the 

</span><span>Doctor beside him to treat him for his illness. This man is crazy. He’s not talking on the 

</span><span>Constitution Amendment No. 25.  He is all over the place, going around picking up all 

sorts  of  rubbish</span><span>,  if  he’s  not  careful  he  might  pick  up  a  pile  of  excreta.  Mr  Speaker,  I 

</span><span>want you tell him to talk like a Parliamentarian not like an idiot. He is jumping up and 

down and all over the place.
