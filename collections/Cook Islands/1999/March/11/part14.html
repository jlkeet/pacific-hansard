<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  great  pleasure  to  welcome  Teina  Bishop  and  Mike  Henry  to  the 

Chamber. Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you  very  much  for  your  indulgence,  Mr  Speaker.  I  now  turn  to  Constitution 

Amendment  (No.  23)  Bill.    For  the  record,  Mr  Speaker,  the  New  Alliance  Party 

supported  the  First  Reading  and  the  Second  Reading  of  this  Bill  and  we  intend  to 

</span><span>support the Third and final reading of it. The most important grounds for our support are 

</span><span>the reduction of Ministers from nine to seven.  I also want to thank the Prime Minister 

and the Cook Islands Party Government for carrying out this Amendment on behalf of 

the New Alliance Party, because it was in our 1994 Manifesto. It was also supported by 

our August 1998 Party Conference well before a Political Reform Commission came on 

the  scene.  Well  before.  We  are  confident  that  the  Public  Review  Commission  copied 

this recommendation straight from our written submissions.  

</span></div><div><span>Talking  about  written  submissions,  I  warn  you,  lady  and  gentlemen  of  this  House,  to 

make  written  submissions  because  people  like  Iaveta  Short  will  quote  things  outside 

those submissions which will suit his argument of the day or the minute.  Surely, when 

an organisation  like a political party commits itself to a written submission, that  - and 

that  only  -  </span><span>is  the  official  position  of  the  party.  You  don’t  quote  all  the  discussional 

</span><span>materials you discuss because you are likely to talk about anything. You are likely to go 

all over the place before you arrive at that written submission. There goes Mr Short, the 

Chairman of this ill-fated Public Review Commission, misquoting me from discussional 

materials. 

</span></div><div><span>I  just  want  to  record  that,  because  I  have  quoted  in  this  House  before  that  that 

</span><span>Commission  </span><span>was  quoting  gossipy,  discussional  materials,  which  weren’t  the  true 

</span><span>position  of  organisations.  But  they  used  it  and  latched  on  to  it  to  support  their 

arguments.  So,  the  golden  rule  there,  from  this  experience,  is  to  stick  to  written 

submissions because you are likely to be misquoted by people like Iaveta Short. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like also to take this opportunity to place on record that while the 

Second Reading of Constitution Amendment No. 24 was held yesterday, my Deputy and 

I  were  on  a  holy  crusade  to  the  island  of  Araura  Enua.  While  we  were  on  this  holy 

</span><span>crusade  this  House  discussed  and  passed  the  Second  Reading  of  Constitution 

</span><span>Amendment No. 24 reducing the term of Parliament to four years.  Mr Speaker, I want 

to  place  on  record  the  total  and  absolute  support  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  for  that 

Amendment  reducing  the  term  of  Parliament  to  four  years.  Also,  I  thank  this  Cook

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Islands  Party  Government  for  carrying  out  yet  another  New  Alliance  initiated  reform 

which you will find in our 1994 Manifesto and also in the NAP Conference records of 

August  1998.    I  want  to  assure  the  people  of  this  country  that  the  Political  Review 

Commission had nothing to do with our position. Our position was clearly established 

well before they were formed. We are slightly embarrassed, Mr Speaker, because these 

brilliant moves just come naturally to New Alliance Party. It is only common sense you 

</span><span>don’t  need  a  Commission  to  tell  you  that  the  people  prefer  a  shorter  term.  You  don’t 

need anybody to tell you that, and we, I’m glad, d</span><span>id not wait for anybody to tell us that. 

</span><span>I’m glad that the Government probably listened to the Political Review Commission and 

</span><span>decided to bring forth this Amendment. So, we want to place on record that NAP will 

campaign in favour of it. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in  our support of Constitution Amendment (No. 23), which is now going 

through its Third Reading, we want to say we have always believed that seven Cabinet 

Ministers  are  the  right  number  to  have  in  Government.  We  did  not  support  the 

appointment of an outsider into Cabinet, we never will. But because it is optional, the 

Prime Minister may do that, it is not compulsory. Because that option is available, the 

New  Alliance  Party  sensibly  supported  this  Amendment  right  from  the  beginning. 

</span><span>Because  we  do  not  support  the  concept  of  this  outsider  being  brought  into  Cabinet,  I 

</span><span>want  to  state  in  this  House  that  a  New  Alliance  Party  Government  will  never  bring 

anyone from outside.  We have enough talented people within our own team to take care 

of  all  Cabinet  posts.    In  the  unlikely  event  another  party  becomes  Government  and 

decides to bring an outside Minister into this House, we will vigorously fight for it to be 

subjected to parliamentary approval. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  New  Alliance  Party  is  committed  to  implementing  this  Amendment 

when it becomes the next Government. However, it will not appoint an outsider so we 

are not going to wait or be subject to any arrangements made between the Member for 

</span><span>the  Overseas  and  his  Party.    However,  I  don’t  think  any  of  us  should  hold  our  breath 

</span><span>be</span><span>cause you wouldn’t need to worry about another Cook Islands Party Government for 

</span><span>at least another ten years from now. 

</span></div><div><span>Now with such a pleasant comment like that I don’t wish to upset anybody and continue.  

</span><span>Finally, Mr Speaker, we want to reiterate our support for this Amendment.  Thank you 

very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Our next speaker is the Honourable 

</span><span>Member, Dr Terepai Maoate, Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and to your staff 

and to all Honourable Members and to our people listening in this evening - Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>A special greeting to Mike Henry and Teina Bishop in the Public Gallery.  I welcome 

you into this Parliament this evening.  I am now trying to see if Putangi is here but the 

friend  at  the  door  is  saying  that  he  is  having  a rest  - having a good sleep. To you my 

brother, the Honourable Member, Ngereteina Puna, greetings to you.  I will be very sad 

and I will miss you in Parliament in the future. We have heard the praises for your work 

coming  from  the  Honourable  Member  for  the  Overseas  Seat,  Dr  Joseph Williams  and 

also  from  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party,  the  Honourable  Norman

</span></div><div><span>George  and  their  best  wishes  for  the  future.  I  am  very  sorry  to  see  that  the  pressure 

applied in your life has followed you all the way to this House in the form of the two 

boys who have come here to demand that you retire. They are here to make sure that you 

do retire.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  It is pleasure, not pressure.
