</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Order, order please! 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> I was happy when you confirmed to me last night that our candidate, 

Papa Nga Tuakura, would be your new Member of Parliament. Oh, what joy!

</span></div><div><span>Ureia  are  calling  her  Jenny  Shipley.    Moving  on  to  the  Constituency  of  Arutanga-

Reureu-Nikaupara where the New Alliance Party candidate is the upright and handsome 

boy, Tereapii Viking. This boy is a good athlete and I am sure he will get a gold medal 

in this race we are in.  The surprising thing is Mr Chairman, the other group that went to 

Aitutaki,  they  took  supporters  from  Rarotonga,  whereas  for  the  New  Alliance  Party 

meeting,  it  was  filled  with  Aitutakians  and  there  were  only  three  of  us  there  from 

Rarotonga. This is a surprise, Mr Chairman, a real surprise indeed.
