</span></div><div><span>Internal Affairs: Interrupted Debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,700,041 stands part of the Schedule. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Honourable Members of the House and our people listening in to the 

debate  this  afternoon,  Kia  Orana.    Before  I  begin,  I  would  like  to  extend  words  of 

comfort  to  the  family  of  Tikaka  Henry.  He  is  an  older  brother  of  the  Prime  Minister. 

Once when we met, we discussed how we would meet one day to compare genealogies 

</span><span>so  we  could  find out  how we are related. Unfortunately, we never found the time and 

</span><span>now  he  has  passed  away.  May  God  comfort  his  children  and  family  in  their  time  of 

grief.

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  stand  to  correct  some statements made earlier. It  was said  that during 

our time in Government we abused the Constituency fund. That we used it for our own 

personal use. I want to say we did not. During our time, when someone wanted to use 

the  fund,  they  made  their  request  to  Cabinet.  We  received  requests  from  Government 

and  also  from  the  Opposition.  This  was  the  practice  during  our  time.  Later,  it  was 

changed.  If  there  was  a  request  for  Constituency  funds,  it  went  to  the  Prime  Minister 

who then made the decision. This is where the problems started. For us Members in the 

Opposition,  our  requests  were  often  not  heard  and  only  Members  of  Government  got 

their requests approved. When I approached the Government for community funds for 

Rakahanga,  Mr Chairman, I was told it had been diverted to  the Manihiki  Member of 

Parliament  to  support  his  community  organisations  and  to  buy  jerseys  for  the  rugby 

team.  We  never  got  our  funds  because  it  was  diverted  elsewhere  for  use  in  the 

Constituencies of Government Member. That meant some Members had double grants.  

</span></div><div><span>That  is  why  I  was  happy  to  hear  what  the  Minister  said  about  the  </span><span>Vaka  </span><span>Councils  of 

Rarotonga.  The  authority  to  manage  their  funds  has  been  granted  to  them  by  the  law. 

The only thing missing is  the funds. This is what happened when you blow your horn 

before the bread is cooked. Ae the Honourable Member for Amuri said do not blow the 

</span><span>horn until the bread is cooked, now the bread is half-cooked.  This is a lesson to him, he 

</span><span>should  not  blow  the  horn  before  the  bread  is  cooked.  The  bread  won’t  cook  because 

</span><span>there is no money. He is saying the money is coming from China but we are not talking 

</span><span>about China’s budget, we are talking about our budget.</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  felt  sorry  for  the  young  people  of  Amuri  because  the  Honourable 

Member  for  Amuri  is  saying  that  these  young  people  are  taking  thei</span><span>r  elderly  people’s 

</span><span>money to buy alcohol. He is saying that the people of Aitutaki have harvested the crops 

he planted. He said he is the one feeding them. If this is true then it is no wonder that he 

is being elected into office by the people. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a proposal  to  make to  the Minister, since we have a number of prisoners. Why 

</span><span>can’t  they  be  used  to  do  community  work  for  the  Vaka  Councils?  They  could  be 

</span><span>allocated  among  the  districts  of  the  island  -  some  to  go  to  Takitumu,  some  to  go  to 

Puaikura. I am sure they will do a lot of good for the community. That is why I want to 

put this proposal to the Minister, I think he will see this will be of benefit. I am sure if 

they are made to work alongside the </span><span>Vaka </span><span>they won’t commit any crimes and they won’t 

</span><span>run away because there will be a lot of people there who will keep an eye on them. 

</span></div><div><span>So this is my proposal to the Minister. Making use of the prisoners in this way will be of 

great benefit to them and to the community. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,700,041 for Internal Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>1788

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Marine Resources: The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $723,000 for Marine Resources stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  Greetings  to  you  and  all  the  staff 

members  this  afternoon.    Kia  Orana  also  to  Honourable  Members  in  the  House.  Kia 

Orana also to our people listening to our debate this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>I  have  pleasure,  Mr  Chairman,  in  presenting  to  this  House  the  Supplementary 

Appropriation  for  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  for  1998-99.    The  allocation,  Mr 

Chairman,  for  Marine  Resources  for  this  financial  year  that  has  been  requested  totals 

$723,800 nett.  Mr Chairman, I believe, this figure is justified considering the important 

functions carried out by the Ministry of Marine Resources.  May I remind the House, Mr 

Chairman, that this is to achieve the sustainable development of our Marine Resources 

for the benefit of the people of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The  appropriation  in  the  booklet  before  us  Mr  Chairman,  seeks  to  support  three  main 

outputs. The areas of Policy, Commercial Development Assistance and Research. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Policy  Output  will  continue  to  set  and  review  guidelines  for  the  Marine  Sector.  

These policies are means to stimulate our economic growth to provide employment and 

ensure that the utilisation of our important resources is sustainable. Concurrent with the 

development  policy  is  the  ongoing  restructuring  of  the  role  and  the  functions  of  the 

Ministry.  Services pertaining to the relevant legislation and Ministerial requests are also 

provided under this Output. This Output asks for an appropriation of $17,000. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  in  the  second  area,  Commercial  Development  Assistance,  its  aim  is  to 

promote the development of commercially viable marine resources for both inshore and 

offshore  marine  resources.  It  is  important  under  this  Output,  Mr  Chairman,  that  the 

commercial  development  has  to  be  ecologically  sustainable.    Technical  advice,  of 

course, to this industry, with limited involvement, is also covered. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  under  that  Output  in  the  Ministry,  it  sets  out  some  of  the  sub-Outputs  for  the 

benefit  of  the  Output  itself.    Now  there  is  the  area  of  the  Commercial  Species 

Development.  An  example  of  that,  Mr  Chairman,  is  the  recent  trochus  harvest  which 

was  done  on  the  island  of  Aitutaki  worth  over  $100,000  to  the  community.    Further 

work in this area includes the transfer of trochus and the giant clam to other lagoons in 

the  country.  The  first  program,  Mr  Chairman,  and  the  other  extension  services  have 

been placed around the island on Rarotonga and also on the other Outer Islands.  This 

includes  the  workshops  conducted  throughout  the  Outer  Islands  on  Aitutaki,  Atiu, 

</span><span>Mauke,  Mitiaro  and  Penrhyn.  It  also  includes  provision  of  support  to  our  thriving 

</span><span>cultured  pearl  industry.    It  provides  advice  to  the  respective  Island  Councils  on  the 

various  management  issues  and  of  course  pursuing  further  means  to  expand  this  very 

lucrative industry. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1789 

</span></div><div><span>The licensing and the surveillance of our offshore </span><span>tuna </span><span>industries has resulted in fifteen 

fishing  vessels  being  issued  licences,  which  brings  in  a  total  of  $385,000  into  the 

country.  In addition, this Output asks for $488,000 in the Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Chairman, we look at the third Output that the Ministry has engaged itself in 

which  is  Research.  It  is  indeed  a  very  important  function  that  the  Ministry  addresses. 

Now the Research Division of the Ministry has the aim of developing and implementing 

research  programs  that  are focused on responsible and sustainable management of our 

marine reserves.  There is the development of Fisheries Management.  There is also the 

continuous monitoring of subsistence fisheries in our islands. 

</span></div><div><span>We have two research stations in the country. These include laboratories and hatcheries.  

The first is the giant clam hatchery, which is located on the island of Aitutaki, and the 

pearl oyster hatchery is on the island of Tongareva.  Whilst monitoring is continuously 

done by the Ministry in other lagoons, it is very important, Mr Chairman, that the health 

or  ecology  of  those  lagoons  be  continuously  monitored.  Particularly,  those  lagoons 

responsible  for  the  cultured  pearl  industry  which  require  clean  water  and  disease-free 

</span><span>conditions.  

</span></div><div><span>Another  activity  Mr  Chairman,  in  which  the  Ministry  is  extensively  involved,  is  the 

well-publicised  and  highly  successful  marine  </span><span>Ra’ui</span><span>  program  which  has  been 

implemented on Rarotonga. The Ministry Personnel inspect the </span><span>Ra’ui</span><span> areas on a regular 

basis. This is important so that rejuvenation effects can be monitored, as well as raising 

awareness of the </span><span>ra’ui</span><span> through school visits and visits to the community. The research 

output requested for, in the appropriation, Mr Chairman, is $218,300.00.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, before I sit down I would like to make an announcement to the people of 

the  Northern  Group.  I  want  my  people  in  the  Northern  Group  to  know  that  there  are 

discussions  finalised  between  representatives  from  the  United  States  of  America  and 

representatives in the Cook Islands, to form a joint fishing venture between the people 

of the North and investors from outside. The venture is to set up a commercial fishing 

company  in  the  Cook  Islands  to  fish  in  our  Cook  Islands  EEZ.  The  initial  task,  Mr 

Chairman,  is  to  establish  a  sustainable  operation  in  the  Northern  Group,  and  to  send 

fresh  fish  to  international  markets  in  Hawaii,  United  States,  by  airfreight  on  a  weekly 

basis from the island of Tongareva. About the setup, Mr Chairman, a representative will 

</span><span>visit the island of Tongareva next week. They will be seeking permission with the Island 

</span><span>Council to establish this fishing business for the Northern Group.  They will also seek 

permission to utilise the runway for the purpose of air-shipping seafood to Honolulu and 

then  onwards.  They  will  also  seek  permission  to  make  certain  improvements  to  the 

airport and the runway, as required to meet international regulations for flight operations 

for the appropriate aircraft. They will seek permission from the Island Council and the 

landowners  to  utilise  and  upgrade  the  older  wharf  to  dock  its  processing  vessel.  They 

will lease and fence 1 acre of land for a 10-year term at the base of the older wharf as a 

supply depot.  I can go on and on, Mr Chairman...
