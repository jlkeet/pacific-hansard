<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>So I now give my support to this Bill. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 41</a></div><div><span>1826 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I have just three things to say. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  May  I  take  it  that  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  is  replying  to  the 

comments raised and to close the debate on the Second Reading? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Yes, Mr Speaker. Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Firstly, I share 

the  view  that  the  enabling  legislation  spoken  of  by  this  Constitution  needs  to  be  well 

prepared and therefore must have prior wide consultation.  

</span></div><div><span> Secondly, I would like to defend all those who are holding the positions referred to in 

the Bill such as the Chief Justice, Judges of the High Court, Justices of the Peace, the 

Ombudsman, the Solicitor-General, the Public Service Commissioner, the Chairman of 

the 

the  Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee, 

Commissioner of Police against accusation that they were appointed because they were 

</span><span>piripiri</span><span> (close to or associated with) to the Cook Islands Party. I take this opportunity to 

defend each one of them against allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition that 

they  were  appointed  on  political  grounds.    They  were  all  people  quite  worthy  of  the 

position that they held. 

</span></div><div><span>the  Director  of  Audit,  and 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  There  is  a  Point  of  Order  on  the  Floor,  Honourable  Prime Minister.  

What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  The  Prime  Minister  is  alleging  that  I  said  that  the 

appointment of these people were political.  I did not say that, Mr Speaker.  I did ask a 

question - was it done in that manner? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I also asked if there was a criteria for their appointment? That 

was  not  answered,  now  I  hear  that  I  said  they  were  selected  because  of  their  CIP 

affiliations.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  That  is  not  a  Point  of  Order,  Honourable  Member  that  is  a  point  of 

explanation. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> But it reflects on my reputation Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Carry on Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you.    

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  When  I  think  of  it,  Mr  Speaker,  having  apologised  to  the 

Honourable  Member,  you  should  have  followed  it  up  with  an  instruction  for  him  to 

leave the House. I take his recent comments as a withdrawal of the allegations that he 

</span></div><div><a>Page 42</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1827 

</span></div><div><span>made earlier on tonight. While I may accept that apparent withdrawal, I leave it to those 

who have been offended to determine themselves what they ought to do. 

</span></div><div><span>And the third point I wanted to make Mr Speaker is that I endorse the Second Reading 

of Amendment No.25.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Prime Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK AT THE TABLE:</span><span> A Bill Intituled: An Act to amend the Constitution.
