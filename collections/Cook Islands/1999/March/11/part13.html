<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Constitution  Amendment  (No.  25)  Bill,  Second  Reading.    The  Honourable  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you all Honourable Members and 

to our people who are listening to our debate this evening.  Mr Speaker, may I seek the 

Leave of the House to deal with Constitution Amendment (No. 23) before we go on to 

Constitution Amendment (No. 25)? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Leader of the House, what is the opinion of the House?  

</span></div><div><span>LEADER OF THE HOUSE: </span><span>Granted.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Leave is granted Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now take the Third Reading of the Constitution Amendment (No. 23) Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Constitution Amendment (No. 23) Bill be now Read a Third time 

</span></div><div><span>Before  we  do  so  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  request  that  the  House  allow  the 

Honourable  Member  for  the  Overseas  seat  to  speak  on  the  Amendment.  I  would  also 

like to extend that privilege to the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the New 

Alliance  Party,  if  they  so  desire  I  have  no  problem  with  that.  I  will  stop  here,  Mr 

Speaker, to allow the Honourable Member for the Overseas seat to speak and also the 

Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  then  I  will  close  the  debate  on  the  Third  reading  of  the 

Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>1806 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I feel sorry for the Honourable Member because at the time we debated on the Bill he 

was not present. 

</span></div><div><span>The Prime Minister has already moved the motion so I will ask for a Seconder, please.  

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Dr Joseph Williams 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker. I realise that this is not common practice 

for anybody to speak on the Third Reading of a Bill.  I thank you and the Prime Minister 

for this opportunity. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  go  on  to  Constitution  Amendment  (No.  23),  let  me  say  first  Kia  Orana  to 

everybody. To you Mr Speaker, to the Prime Minister, Members of Cabinet, this side of 

the House, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the New Alliance Party and 

Members of that side Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>Also,  allow  me  to  spend  a  minute  or  so  to  say  something  about  the  Member  for 

Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara,  the  Honourable  Member  Ngereteina  Puna,  who  has 

announced this afternoon his intention to retire. One chapter in his career is closing and 

a new one will be opening and I hope it is going to be a good chapter. I will recall my 

maiden speech as a Minister back in 1972.  The Honourable Minister was the one who 

prepared  my  speech  which  included  a  traditional  Aitutaki  </span><span>pe’e</span><span>  (chant).  I  say  it  was  a 

traditional </span><span>pe’e</span><span> not like the </span><span>pe’e</span><span> of the Minister of Agriculture yesterday.  What was that 

</span><span>again?  “Get away, get away, you don’t know what you are doing”.</span></div><div><span>I will never forget that. The team we had in those days - I was the Minister of Education 

and he was the Secretary of Education. The help I had and the work that was contributed 

to Education was enormous. I want to salute you my younger brother, for the work that 

you  have  done  for  this  country.    For  those  few  of  us  here  who  will  return  to  the next 

Parliament,  mainly  on  this  side  of  the  House,  we  are  going  to  miss  the  Honourable 

Member.  We  will  miss  your  oratory,  particularly  in  the  true  Aitutaki  language.    Even 

after your sessions in the gym, when you come to the House and you are a bit tired. We 

look around and see you lay your head on your desk, just resting. We will miss that.  But 

</span><span>I don’t think the Prime Minister will miss your snoring.</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>I didn’t snore too badly. Just a little bit. </span></div><div><span>DR  J.  WILLIAMS:</span><span>  I  have  spoken  to  the  Overseas  Constituency  Chief  Executive 

Joseph  Ka  who  has  asked  me  to  convey  to  you,  Jackie  and  your  family,  the very best 

wishes  for  the future, from  everybody in  the Overseas Constituency. We give you our 

best wishes and may God bless you.  

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to the Bill before the House. I came here, Mr Speaker and Members of the 

</span><span>House, with a definite instruction from the Overseas Constituency. That instruction was 

</span><span>to  support  the  first  part,  reducing  the  number  of  Ministers  from  7  to  9,  to  7,  and  to 

oppose  the  second  part,  which  gives  the  Prime  Minister  the  power  to  appoint  one 

Minister from outside of Parliament. They have asked me to express that opposition in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1807 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament.  But  all  that  has  changed  since  yesterday,  since  I  had  a  meeting  with  the 

Honourable  Tom  Marsters  and  the  Prime  Minister  yesterday  in  the  true  spirit  of 

discussion, compromise and consultation. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I want to tell you, Mr Speaker and the House, the reasons why we in the Overseas 

Constituency objected to this.  Perhaps if I give you the views of Professor Hodge from 

the University of Auckland, it will convey to you the basis of that objection. This was 

done  in  the  Talkback  Show  over  Radio  531PI  conducted  by  the  host,  the  big  fellow 

called Joe Ka.  When asked what the faults and discrepancies were in this Amendment, 

this is what he said. First, he said that the principle of this is unique.  He liked it.  He 

liked  the  idea  of  the  Prime  Minister  of  a  country  picking  somebody  from  outside  of 

</span><span>Cabinet.  It’s a novel idea.  This idea should not be thrown out but explored furthe</span><span>r, but 

as the Amendment is presented to Parliament, it had certain deficiencies. The first is that 

there are insufficient checks and balances within the present Bill and there ought to be 

introduced  means  by  which  Parliament  would  be  given  the  right  to  approve  or 

disapprove.    The  Commission  of  Political  Review  did  recommend  this  that  the  Prime 

Minister can appoint somebody from outside of Cabinet, but it did also recommend that 

this be done with the approval of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>The  second  suggestion  was  that  Parliament  be  given  the  right  to  remove  that  person 

through a vote of No Confidence should that person be found incompetent or unsuitable 

for the position at a later date. The idea of giving the Prime Minister the sole right  - it 

</span><span>doesn’t matter who the Prime</span><span> Minister is, whether it is Sir Geoffrey Henry, whether it 

be Dr Terepai  Maoate, whether it be the Honourable Norman George or whether it be 

the Honourable Tupou Faireka - </span><span>it doesn’t matter.  It is not the individual that matters 

</span><span>but it is the position giving that person who holds the office of the Prime Minister the 

sole right to appoint somebody from outside of Parliament without the necessary checks 

and balances to  make sure that person is suitable. On the strength of the comments of 

Professor  Hodge,  people  called  in  objecting,  voicing  their  objection  that  when  the 

Member goes there he must oppose this.  And before I left, I had consultations with the 

Executive and they confirmed their stance. 

</span></div><div><span>As  I  said,  all  this  has  changed  since  the  meeting  that  we  held  yesterday.    I  know  by 

being informed that the Honourable Member, Tom Marsters did voice his objection at 

the  Second  Reading  of  this  Bill  and  so  did  the  Members  of  the  Democratic  Alliance 

Party and again all that has changed since yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>In that meeting that we had, we reached certain agreements.  I asked the Prime Minister 

if I may contact my Constituency to ask them to give me the okay to support this Bill 

tonight in its Third Reading. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will read the fax and 

then I will read the reply that was sent by Joe Ka.  A copy of this fax is with the Prime 

Minister, with  the Leader of the Opposition, and with the Leader of the New Alliance 

Party and the contents of this fax and reply are self-explanatory.  I read from the text. 

</span></div><div><span>“To Joseph Ka from Dr J. Williams. </span></div><div><span> Re:  Constitution  Amendment  No.23  concerning  the  appointment  of  a  Minister  from 

outside of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>1808 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1.    I  have  had  discussions  with  the  Prime  Minister  and  with  the  Honourable  Tom 

Marsters.    I  have  advised  him  that  I  have  a  clear  mandate  from  the  Overseas 

Constituency  to  oppose  this  Amendment.    I  have  also  told  him  of  the  Talkback 

</span><span>programme with Professor Hodge and Professor Hodge’s comments, together with your 

</span><span>comments  and the comments  of the callers.  They have  both  asked me to  support this 

Amendment.    I  have  told  them  that  I  cannot  do  this  without  the  consent  of  my 

Constituency.  Hence, this urgent fax to you. 

</span></div><div><span>As a matter of compromise, we have suggested the following: 

</span></div><div><span>(a)  That  I  be  given  the  right  to  speak  in  Parliament  and  express  the  views  of  the 

</span><span>Constituency”, which I am doing now.</span></div><div><span>“(b) That this Amendment must not be activated until further amendments are made by 

</span><span>the next Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>(c)  That  you  and  Professor  Hodge  prepare  the  necessary  amendments  which  would 

</span><span>incorporate Professor Hodge’s recommendations which were aired on 531PI.”</span></div><div><span>I might add here, Mr Speaker, this suggestion was the Prime Minister’s suggestion and 

</span><span>it is a good one. 

</span></div><div><span>“(d) That this Amendment is presented by the Cook Islands Party as a </span><span>matter of policy 

</span><span>during the General Election.”</span></div><div><span>This is also recommended by the Prime Minister”.</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> In the year, 2000 are you likely to remind us? 

</span></div><div><span>DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span>“(e) The Amendment to include that the Ministers’ appointments 

</span><span>be  approved  by  Parliament  and  vetted  by  a  Committee  that  would  be  set  up  for  that 

</span><span>purpose.”</span></div><div><span>I might add here, Mr Speaker, this is also another suggestion from the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>“2.    That  a  No  Confidence  provision  is  made  part  of  the  new  Amendment  giving 

</span><span>Parliament the right to remove the Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>3.    That  these  provisions  may  apply  to  all  Cabinet  Ministers  (i.e.  those  appointments 

</span><span>from within Parliament also).”</span></div><div><span>Again, I might add here, Mr Speaker, this is the suggestion of the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>And “4.  Any other prov</span><span>isions that Professor Hodge may think necessary to make this 

Amendment a unique one and not a controversial one, as is the case now. 

</span></div><div><span>5.    The  Prime  Minister  has  given  his  word  that  all  this  will  be  done  and  that  the 

Amendment as it stands will not be imple</span><span>mented.”</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1809 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I stand to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Honourable Member be given normal extension of time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Is there a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Mii Parima. 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you Members of the House.  I 

shall not be long.  I am seeking the opinion and probable support of the Leader of the 

Opposition and the Leader of the New Alliance. And lastly </span><span>on this fax, Mr Speaker, “I 

</span><span>seek  your  urgent  consultation  with  the  remainder  of  the  Executive  and  advise  me 

</span><span>tonight,  as  this  will  be  debated  in  Parliament  at  6.00p.m.”,  that  was  supposed  to  be 

</span><span>yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>Since yesterday, Mr Speaker, I have consulted the Leader of the Opposition. We had a 

talk on this particular matter, and I have also discussed this with the Leader of the New 

Alliance  Party  while  he  was  in  Aitutaki,  and  I  sent  him  a copy of my fax. This  is  the 

reply  from  the  Overseas  Constituency  Executive,  by  way  of  Joe  Ka,  our  Chief 

Executive. With your permission, I shall read this.    

</span></div><div><span>“Dear Dr Williams, </span></div><div><span>I have obtained further and several more advice on the Constitution Amendment No. 23. 

</span><span>I have also consulted the Constituency’s Executives. Our decis</span><span>ion was reached through 

the weight of our advice and the wishes of the majority of your constituents and on the 

face of your fax transmission to us yesterday.   We will agree for you to vote in favour of 

the Bill if the Prime Minister, in his speech in Parliament, registers an undertaking that, 

</span></div><div><span>1. That he and his Government will not activate Constitution Amendment No. 23 until 

further  and  more  necessary  amendments  are  made  by  the  next  Parliament.    The 

amendments are to include: 

          (i) That the Minis</span><span>ter’s appointment is vetted first by a Committee to be set up  </span><span>specially  for that purpose and then subjected for approval by Parliament”.</span></div><div><span>In addition, I might add at this stage, that was taken directly from my fax and it was a 

suggestion made by the Prime Minister. The second part I will not read out, it is just the 

appointment, the removal of a Minister by a No Confidence Vote. The remainder is just 

reaffirming what the Prime Minister has suggested in our meeting.  

</span></div><div><span>As I said before, Mr Speaker, Members of the House, I have spoken again to the Prime 

Minister, and to the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party and the Leader of the New 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>1810 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Alliance.  It  appears  we  may  have  reached  some  agreement  in  so  far  as  this  Bill  is 

concerned with a unanimous vote, a Yes Vote. 

</span></div><div><span>I must mention that when I came here I was torn between two loyalties. My loyalty to 

my  Party,  the  Cook  Islands  Party  and  I  was  very  aware  of  the  disruption  that  may  be 

caused by division in my Party if I voted against. In addition, the disunity that would be 

caused within our Party. On the other hand, I was very much torn by my loyalty to my 

Constituents.  They  have  given  me  an  instruction  to  voice  their  opposition.  And  I  am 

sure that some Members of this House have faced this dilemma before. But I was happy 

that the discussion that we had yesterday between the Prime Minister, the Honourable 

Tom Marsters and myself, resulted in  a final  decision which did  not  alienate me from 

my Party and my own Constituency. I say this to you, Mr Speaker, and to you Mr Prime 

Minister, the Overseas Constituency now gives their full support to this Amendment and 

I hope and pray that the rest of us will give the same support.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    To  my  understanding  there  were 

only  three  members  in  the  House  who  did  not  speak  on  the  Second  Reading  of  the 

Amendment  Bill.  I  may  be  wrong.  So  if  that  is  the  case,  now  there  are  only  two 

Members  who  have  not  spoken.  But  since  there  is  a  Motion  before  the  House  this 

evening, I think I will allow speakers to talk on the Motion. And may I suggest that only 

the Leaders speak. I now call upon the Honourable Member Norman George, Leader of 

the New Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  I  applaud  your  fine  ruling.    Mr 

Speaker,  before  I  speak  on  Constitution  Amendment  No.  23,  I  would  like  to  take  this 

opportunity to pay tribute to a fellow Member of this House.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today we were overcome by the sudden announcement that the Honourable 

Ngereteina  Puna  would  be  retiring  at  the  end  of  this  term  of  Parliament.  Some  of  us 

received that information with shock and trepidation. This man, Mr Speaker, is a great 

Cook  Islander  and  a  great  servant  of  the  people  of  this  country.  He  served  his  people 

with distinction. He began his career as an outstanding schoolteacher and before that a 

scholarship  student  from  this  country.  He  progressed  with  his  career  from  the  Public 

Service and into this Honourable House, where and I understand he served for about 20 

or 21 years altogether.  Mr Speaker, his  various roles as a Minister of the Crown was 

conducted  with  competence  and  distinction.  He  is  a  very  patient  man  with  great 

tolerance  and  understanding.    He  is  a  stubborn  supporter  of  his  beloved  Cook  Islands 

Party.  Even  as  his  Political  Party  slowly  submerged  with  the  weight  of  recurring 

political disasters, one after the other, the lone voice of the Honourable Ngereteina Puna 

could be heard singing the praises and support of his Party. 

</span></div><div><span>Even at times when you would expect surrender, he is one of those truly loyal servants 

who  would  never  surrender.  Mr  Speaker,  the  Honourable  Ngereteina  Puna  is  a  good, 

decent,  ordinary  Cook  Islander.    He  is  a  great  patriot, an excellent  ambassador of this 

Parliament not only here but also abroad, unlike one or two of his colleagues.  I also pay 

tribute to him for helping to heal the wounds of political conflict in our community over 

the past decade and a half.  I can say that today political parties are now enjoying free 

competition  in  the  same way we participate in different  sports codes. The Honourable 

Member  Ngereteina  Puna has helped achieve political  relationships  between parties to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1811 

</span></div><div><span>become  highly  competitive  and  great  fun  to  compete  with  each  other,  after  all  we  are 

serving  our  country  in  the  best  way  we  can.  To  my  Honourable  friend  and  brother, 

</span><span>Ngereteina Puna, “</span><span>aere ra e taku taeake”</span><span> (farewell my friend). When we come back in 

this House after May or June we will miss your smiling face, we will miss your slow, 

long monotonous and your habitual stubbornness.  Our message to you is good luck my 

friend and brother, and to your dear and beautiful wife Jackie, good luck to both of you. 

May you have a pleasant retirement with your children, grandchildren, in-laws and your 

people.  May your successor, Tereapii Viking of the New Alliance Party, fill your shoes 

with confidence.
