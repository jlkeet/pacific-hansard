<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>I have full support for it.  Seriously, Mr Chairman, I see Marine Resources as one of the 

</span><span>mainstays  of  the  economic  development  of  this  country.  This  development  has  to  be 

encouraged. I am advised by individual farmers that I am in contact with, that while we 

see the wonderful figures of research and all sorts of activities, the individual farmers do 

not feel they are getting any support at all from Government. Therefore, I would like the 

Minister  to  tell  us  in  this  House,  what  plans  he  has  to  assist  individual  farmers.  Of 

course  this  is  an  area  many  of  us  in  the  Southern  Group  are  not  familiar  with,  but 

certainly we see it as important to our development.  

</span></div><div><span>the  areas 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  also  had  the  opportunity,  Mr  Chairman,  to  visit  the  Library  to  study  the 

Environmental Impact Report on Suwarrow, two weeks ago.  This Report did research 

on the impact of commercial pearl farming on Suwarrow.  I was very pleased with the 

Report.  I find myself supporting what it plans to do.  I noticed they have very carefully 

marked  out 

that  should  be  farmed  along  with  some  very  strong 

recommendations  for  reserving  areas  as  bird  sanctuaries.    I  was  very  impressed  when 

reference  was  made  to  the  effect  that,  such  a  development  could  employ  up  to  100 

people  full-time  and  possibly  another  100  part-time.  The  effect  of  having  three 

commercial  farms  in  Suwarrow  would  employ  these  large  numbers  of  people  under  a 

</span><span>carefully  designed  management  plan.  This  will  allow  both  the  protection  of  the 

</span><span>environment of Suwarrow and limited commercial exploitation of the natural resources 

there. Such a development would result in wages of US$1.3 million paid to local people 

working  there  for  the  first  two  years.  On  top  of  that,  in  the  fourth  year  of  its 

development,  the  Government  is  expected  to  collect  in  revenue,  from  various  taxes, 

about $8 million per year. That certainly is a major input into our national budget and it 

would be a big help, so that is why the New Alliance Party supports such a venture. 

</span></div><div><span>We do have some purists in our community who wants the entire area left as a reserve 

</span><span>for  the  birds  and  the  fish.  Let  me  say  this.  The  birds  and  fish  have  had  the  area  for 

</span><span>millions of years. How about allowing the people of the Cook Islands to share a little in 

a  properly  structured  management  plan  -  the  resources  of  that  island?  We  support  a 

limited development there along the lines recommended by the specialists who studied 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>1792 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the impact.  It  would be along those lines that we would like to see the island develop 

pearl-farming there. 

</span></div><div><span>We also support any fishing venture that is going to be brought to our waters. It can only 

mean  employment  for  our  people,  jobs,  and  also,  it  would  mean  a  boost  for  our 

economy.    In  addition,  I  was  pleasantly  surprised  with  the  Minister  of  Marine 

</span><span>Resource’s  unpaid  political  advertisement  when  he  spoke  on  this  Vote  Item  a  few 

</span><span>minutes ago. I only caution the people  of the Northern Group, particularly Penrhyn, to 

watch  those  Greeks  coming  to  you  bearing  gifts.  Because  when  you  hear  a  sudden 

announcement  of  a  billion  dollar  fishing  development  a  few  weeks from  election day, 

</span><span>one wonders why wasn’t that venture announced</span><span> five years ago?  I would like to voice a 

caution  to  those  wanting  to  do  business  now  to  simply  stand  down  and  wait  for  the 

election  results.    Those  considering  flying  to  Penrhyn  next  week,  I  would  wisely 

recommend that you cancel that trip. These are dangerous times to be making business 

proposals because people will see it as a political gimmick to try to get the Member of 

Parliament for that island elected at the next election. 

</span></div><div><span>I am not saying go away. Don’t go away. Just stick around but don’t go now because it’s 

</span><span>not fair. It could easily be misinterpreted and the time to do this has already expired.  It 

</span><span>is election time and you won’t to be happily accepted because people will be suspicious 

</span><span>because of the manner of this proposal if you simply turn up before the elections. 

</span></div><div><span>I  think  this  is  just  a  sensible  caution  to  everyone  concerned,  those  who  are  publicly 

responsible for looking after State assets like the Government Investment Corporation.  

</span><span>My  advice  is  stand  down  from  whatever  you  are  doing.  Don’t  se</span><span>ll  or  move  anything.  

</span><span>Don’t sign anything until after the elections.  It’s only a few weeks away. If you proceed 

</span><span>to do it unwisely, I might add, if you proceed to do it you might have to answer to new 

bosses  when  you  come  back.    So  that  is  just  a  general  public  interest  matter  that  I 

mentioned. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  have  no  further  comment  to  make.    We  totally  support  the  Vote 

allocation  for  Marine  Resources.    We  support  the  Marine  Industry.    If  anything,  we 

would like to see more done for this industry. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Ngereteina Puna, Minister for Education and Tauranga Vananga. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you  this  afternoon.    Kia 

Orana to all Honourable Members of the House and to your spouses.  Kia Orana also to 

the staff of this House and Kia Orana to our people listening in this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  this  Vote  Item  of  $723,800  for  the  Ministry  of  Marine 

Resources. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I give my brief comments on this Vote Item, Mr Chairman, through you I would 

like  to  send  my  greetings  to  a  </span><span>kaoa</span><span>  (coral  cay)  in  the  lagoon  of  Manihiki  called 

Pohaturoa, also  known as PPL. Kia Orana to my son, Michael, the manager there, my 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1793 

</span></div><div><span>daughter Tarita, to our grandchildren, Henry and Tiano Helena, and to all the family on 

the </span><span>kaoa,</span><span> Pohaturoa. Keep it up. We would like to say that what you are doing is very 

important  for  our  country.  We  would  also  like  to  send  our  greetings  to  another  pearl-

farmer  in  Manihiki,  Henry  Puna,  Akaiti  and  Tuakeu.  All  of  you  who  are  carrying  out 

</span><span>pearl farming business. God bless you all. Greetings also to my daughter Tutu, I haven’t 

</span><span>forgotten  you.  Greetings  also  to  all  the  pearl  farmers  on  the  island  of  Manihiki  and 

Penrhyn. I would like to encourage you to work hard in your pearl farms. It is for your 

own benefit. If you are successful, the country benefits also. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  also  to  the  Honourable  Minister,  Tepure  Tapaitau,  my  colleague,  and to  the 

Secretary of Marine Resources and all your staff for the excellent job that you are doing. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to my home island Aitutaki. To the Ui Ariki and Aronga Mana on the island, 

to the Government Representative and to the Members of the Island Council - greetings 

to  you  all.    Greetings  to  my Constituency, to  the Cook Islands Party supporters in  my 

constituency  of  Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara.  Special  Greetings  to  the  Executive 

</span><span>Committee for the meeting we had last night. I am thanking you for last night’s meeting.  

</span><span>It was a good meeting where we achieved a lot. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman and all Honourable Members, I am happy to announce that I made known 

my intention at this meeting, to stand down from the upcoming elections. I am happy to 

announce that our Committee selected our son, Teina Bishop, to run in these elections 

as  the  candidate  for  the  CIP  for  the  constituency  of  Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara.  So  I 

would like to take this opportunity to encourage all Cook Islands Party supporters in this 

constituency to give their utmost support to our candidate, Teina Bishop. The sun may 

be setting for me but for this young man the sun is rising. My wife and I gladly embrace 

this young man and his wife and support his entry into this House in the near future. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman of Arenikau, who is also my 

brother-in-</span><span>law,  Vaopoaki  Tearetoa,  ‘Mr  T’  is  his  popular  name.  I  would  like  to  thank 

</span><span>him  for  the  way  our  meeting  was conducted in  peace and harmony. Kia Orana to  you 

and your wife and to all our Committee Members.  I would also like to thank my two 

children, Mike and Kuraono Henry for welcoming us to the meeting of the Cook Islands 

Party Executive. Thank you for your hospitality.  

</span></div><div><span>When I look at the Budget for the Marine Resources, I see that a lot of work went into 

</span><span>its preparation. I can see that a lot of skill was required to prepare this Budget in order 

</span><span>that all of our Marine Resources - manganese nodules, pearls and other marine life - are 

considered. I feel sorry for some of the old folks, such as Papa Apenera Short KBE, our 

QR. For a long time, he has held the strong belief that lying at the bottom of the ocean is 

the source of our wealth - </span><span>manganese nodules. I don’t doubt his dream because if it is 

</span><span>mined, this nation would become one of the wealthiest in the Pacific region. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time to  encourage my colleague Minister Tepure Tapaitau, for the 

next  few  months  and  for  the  next  few  years  to  come.  I  am  sure  that  he  will  be  the 

</span><span>Minister of Marine Resources after the next elections. I can also see in the programme 

</span><span>that some appropriation has been made for researching into other marine resources that 

can be utilised. This is a very important function of this Ministry. This is all I have say, 

Mr Chairman, in support of the Marine Resources budget.

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Our next speaker is the Honourable 

Member, Mama Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>I’ll miss you. Who am I going to spar with? So they told you they 

don’t want you any more?</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Mr Chairman, Greetings to you and to all your staff members. 

Greetings  also  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  the  House,  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy 

Prime  Minister  and  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    I  would  like  to  compliment  the 

Honourable Minister, Ngereteina Puna who has announced that he is not standing in the 

coming  General  Election.  God  bless  you  for  giving  an  opportunity  to  your  people  to 

stand. 

</span></div><div><span>Back to the budget allocation, I support the Appropriation for Marine Resources. I am 

thankful for the work of the Minister of Marine Resources and all the staff members in 

that  Department.  Particularly  the  staff,  because  I  have  seen  them  at  work.  They  have 

been very helpful during the Marine </span><span>Ra’ui </span><span>in our village Nikao. I am glad that you are 

using the Marine </span><span>Ra’ui</span><span> in our village to teach our school children. So, to those people 

who are using the site I would like to ask that you to collect your rubbish especially your 

cans and bottles after you finish using the place. When our children come to the site to 

observe the </span><span>Ra’ui</span><span> implemented, they will not be injured by these litter. On my way to 

Arorangi  this  morning,  I  saw  two  vehicles  of  school  children  and  Marine  Resources 

staff at the beach. I am very happy with what they are doing. So, Mr Chairman, I support 

the  Appropriation  for  this  Department  because  the  things  they  do  can  only  be  for  the 

benefit of our country. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mama Mau Munokoa. Our next speaker is the Honourable 

Member, Paora Teiti.  

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Greetings to you and to all staff members, to 

all Honourable Members in the House, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet 

Ministers and the two Leaders on the Opposition side, Greetings to you all in the grace 

of Our Lord.   To our people listening in to our debate this afternoon, greeting to you all 

on this new day. Greetings to my friend the Leader of the New Alliance Party and the 

Deputy  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party,  Jim  Marurai.  Greetings  also  to  your  friend 

</span><span>Harmon Pou, who went to Aitutaki. Thank you for campaigning for the CIP in Aitutaki.  

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  my  friend,  the  Honourable  Member,  Ngereteina  Puna.  Thank  you  for 

informing us with regards to your discussion with your Committee on our home island 

Aitutaki. Greetings to my friend Teina Bishop for accepting the nomination to stand in 

place of our friend Ngereteina Puna. May God bless you. I am happy because I know the 

people of Reureu-Nikaupara-Arutanga will be happy for the decision you have made. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  the  budget  allocation  of  the  Ministry  of 

Marine Resources.  I thank the Minister for explaining what his Ministry does. I would 

like to send my thanks to the Marine Resource workers on Aitutaki. Greetings to you all 

this  afternoon.  I  know  these  Marine  Resources  officers  are  doing  an  excellent  job  by 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1795 

</span></div><div><span>looking after the trochus, paua and other marine life on Aitutaki. May God bless you all 

while you are carrying out an important job that will benefit everyone on Aitutaki.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  want  to  say  something  about  the  good  things  that  I  have  seen  these 

young  people  do  for  Aitutaki.  In  the  past,  there  was  no  set  time  or  restriction  for 

harvesting  trochus,  but  now  it  is  different.  In  the  past  two  years,  trochus  has  been 

harvested with restrictions at the end of the year. It was harvested in 1997, and again at 

the end of 1998, and at the end of this year, there will be another opportunity to harvest 

trochus. This is what I have discovered. The population of the trochus in the lagoon has 

not dropped but has increased tremendously. In the past when the trochus was harvested, 

it took another 2 to 3 years before trochus was ready to be harvested again. These days, 

that is not the case. It can be collected at the end of every year. In addition, I believe that 

at the end of this year there will be another harvest of the trochus. What this means is, 

these young workers of the Marine Resources are doing their jobs properly. They are not 

sleeping on the job. They are carrying out the responsibilities given to them. I know that 

during  the  recent  harvest  they  put  a  </span><span>ra’ui</span><span>  on  a  certain  area  so  that  people may not  go 

there to harvest but people ignored this and harvested both within and outside the </span><span>ra’ui</span><span>

area. They knew who these people were so they warned them and told them not to do it 

</span><span>again.  The  harvest  was  returned  to  where they had taken them. When the harvest  was 

</span><span>weighed,  it  was  discovered  that,  of  the  26  tonnes,  most  of  the  trochus  was  A-grade 

quality. A few were B-grade. What this means is, these young people are putting their 

training to good use. They are working well at their jobs and they are succeeding with 

their surveillance operations. The people of Aitutaki reaped the benefits of the trochus 

industry at Christmas time last year through the money they made from this venture. 

</span></div><div><span>Another  venture  they  are  developing  now  is  the  giant  clam.  The  giant  clam  and  the 

trochus were put into the sea at the same time. However, the giant clam does not appear 

to  have  reached  a  stage  where  it  can  be  exported  for  the  simple  reason  that  people  is 

taking  too  many  of  it.  Why  are  people  doing  this?    The  simple  answer  is  the  local 

Aitutaki clam no longer exists. Why did the local clam die, why did it run away?  Why 

bring  this  new  giant  clam  in?    Mr  Chairman,  I  suspect  they  killed  the  local  clam  and 

introduced a foreign clam to replace the foreign one. At the time the local Aitutaki clam 

started to disappear, they introduced this foreign clam into the lagoon.  The new clam is 

</span><span>of no use to Aitutaki. It’s no use. The people of Aitutaki go on the reef to collect clams 

</span><span>but  when  they  get  there  they  discover  there  is  none of the local  clams left,  they come 

back at night and collect the introduced ones. The only way for these introduced clams 

</span><span>to survive is to bring back the local clams. If the local clam returns then the people of 

</span><span>Aitutaki will not bother the foreign clam again. 

</span></div><div><span>Nowadays, Mr Chairman, people are stopped from taking clams. There are many groups 

</span><span>going  to  Aitutaki  and  they  are  stopped  from  taking  clams  out.  It’s  only  fair,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, because the local clams are disappearing and it was a source of income for 

the Aitutakians. If the local clam were still there, then the source of revenue for Aitutaki 

would be greater. Instead, they are depending on the trochus now. I would like to ask the 

Minister of Marine Resources to find some alternatives to try and revive the local clam, 

</span><span>not  only  for  the  benefit  of  the  people,  but  to  enable  their  own  introduced  clam  to 

</span><span>survive. In the past, people used to send clams to Rarotonga and New Zealand and they 

made quite a bit of money. These days there is nothing left. I think something should be 

done  to  revive  the  local  clam,  to  bring  it  back  to  life.  Maybe  the  biologists  have  a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>1796 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>remedy  for  bringing  the  clam  back  to  life.  Maybe  they  know  the  chemical  which  was 

used to eradicate the local clams. Another marine resource, which was of benefit to the 

people but has also disappeared, is the </span><span>remu</span><span> (sea grapes). The local clam disappeared, 

and  the  </span><span>remu  </span><span>did  too.  The  </span><span>remu  </span><span>was  also  a  major  source  of  income  for  the  people  of 

Aitutaki, as well as Rarotonga. Therefore, this is a humble request to the Minister, to try 

to  bring  back  the  clam  and  other  marine  resources  in  the  outer  islands,  which  were  a 

source of income and food for the people there. Those are my views on the Vote Item, 

Mr  Chairman.  Again,  thank  you  and  congratulations  to  the  young  people  working  for 

Marine Resources on Aitutaki. Thank you also to the Government and the Minister for 

bringing this Appropriation Amendment into the House. Thank you, Mr Chairman 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> I rise, Mr Chairman, to support the appropriation for the Ministry of 

Marine  Resources.    I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Minister  and  the  staff  of  the 

Ministry of Marine Resources on Rarotonga and in my constituency Rakahanga. I was 

happy to hear the Minister announcing a new project on Tongareva.  I am wondering if 

this  is  a  new  project.  I  am  referring  to  the  one  Wilkie  started working on last year.  I 

would like to ask a question to the Minister about trading revenue of $341,000 in this 

</span><span>appropriation.    I  would  like  to  ask  whether  the  trading  revenue  is  from  Government’s 

</span><span>pearl  farm  on  Manihiki  because  this  farm,  which  was  set  up  by  another  Minister,  has 

been around for quite a while. I would like to ask if this is where this money is coming 

from.    If  this  is  the  case,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  how much money has been 

spent on this farm?  Can he also tell us how much has been made from pearls from this 

farm? How much profit was made? Has it reached a million dollars or is it just what we 

see here in this Appropriation Amendment Bill? Could he also tell us how many people 

are employed on the Marine Resources farm? We all know that under the Manihiki By-

Laws, anyone who wants to farm pearls on Manihiki must first obtain a permit from the 

Island Council. And if they are working from a </span><span>kaoa</span><span> (coral cay), have they paid rentals 

for these </span><span>kaoa,</span><span> or the part of the lagoon they are using, to the landowners? 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday,  I  heard  that  the  Marine  Resources  pearl  farm  was  sold  cheaply  to  the 

President of the Cook Islands Party.  I would like to know if this is true. These are my 

questions to the Minister, although he is not the one who set up the farm, he has been 

the Minister responsible since 1994. He should know how this farm was managed, how 

much it cost to run, and what profits it made, if any. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I sit down, I would like to thank Mr Ron Powell and Mr Ioaba Marsters for they 

were responsible for introducing the trochus into our country. I would also like to thank 

Mr Julian Dashwood, because it was during his time that the trochus was dispersed into 

the Outer Islands, especially to the Northern Group.  I know the young man responsible 

for  taking  the  trochus  to  the  Outer  Islands,  especially  to  the  Northern  Group,  to 

Suwarrow, to  Penrhyn and my island Rakahanga was under the direction of Mr Julian 

Dashwood, was Ruru Maoate.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to correct a statement made by the Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. The 

giant clam was not introduced the same time as the trochus because the giant clam was 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1797 

</span></div><div><span>only  recently  introduced.  The  local  clam  had  declined  in  numbers  on  the  island  of 

Aitutaki before the introduction of the giant clam.   

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span>It’s all the same. What’s the difference?  </span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  He  is  asking  ways  to  try  to  improve  the  situation  of  clams  on  the 

island of Aitutaki and I am surprised that he cannot see that the obvious answer is to use 

the  </span><span>ra’ui</span><span>  system.  Instead,  he  wants  chemicals  and  other  methods  to  try  to  revive  the 

clam. All he has to do is to come to Nikao, close to where he lives, to see how the </span><span>ra’ui 

</span><span>works so he can take the idea to Aitutaki.  

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Hey, you talk about Rakahanga. Leave Aitutaki alone. We have a plan. 

</span><span>What’s that </span><span>ra’ui </span><span>for? We don’t want a </span><span>ra’ui </span><span>in Aitutaki.   

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>That’s all I have to say to my colleague. Go to Nikao and you will see 

</span><span>how it is done and maybe you can introduce it to the island of Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span>The Aitutakians don’t want a </span><span>ra’ui.</span><span>I’m not telling them, you go and tell 

</span><span>them.  

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> I am certain that the people of Aitutaki listening in this afternoon can 

hear that he does not want to introduce something good, like a </span><span>ra’ui</span><span>, on the island.   All 

he wants to do is use same old, bad method.  Therefore, again, I would like to thank the 

late Mr Ron Powell, and also Mr Ioaba Marsters, Mr Julian Dashwood and Ruru Maoate 

for bringing the trochus to our country and for spreading it into the Outer Islands. There 

are also other staff members who were involved in this project but the people that I have 

mentioned are the ones I can remember, who spent a lot of time introducing the trochus 

into the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  my  views  and  the  questions  I  have  posed  for  the  Minister.  Thank  you  Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you this afternoon.  Kia 

</span><span>Orana to all Honourable Members of this House.  Kia Orana to our people listening in 

</span><span>this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise,  Mr  Chairman,  to  support  this  Vote  Item  for  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources.  

</span><span>We  heard  previous  speakers  mention  the  importance  of  this  Ministry.  I  can’t  over</span><span>-

emphasise  the  importance  of  Marine  Resources,  especially  in  relation  to  our  country 

because  of  the  size  of  our  ocean.    If  we  compare  the  land  to  the  amount  of  ocean we 

have, the land is only a fraction of the ocean we have. While it looks empty when you 

cast your eyes over the ocean that ocean is full of riches. I feel that for many, many years 

we  have  neglected  to  exploit  the  natural  resources  in  our  sea.  It  seems  when  we  talk 

about  Marine  Resources,  we  are  only  referring  to  the  Northern  Islands.  The  Southern 

Islands are just as important as the North. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>1798 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>It  was  just  recently  that  we  developed  some  </span><span>kind  of  ‘deep  sea’  fishing,  yet  for  years 

</span><span>many  foreign  countries  have  fished  our  waters.  The  figure  that  I  was  given  from  the 

harvest of our ocean was over $US 30 million a year. Therefore, you can appreciate the 

value of our Marine Resources. 

</span></div><div><span>I am delighted to hear the Minister point out that there is a fishing venture planned for 

</span><span>the North, but at the same time, I am surprised why he hasn’t considered the Southern 

</span><span>Group of islands as well. The natures of the fish that are being harvested are migratory 

in  nature.    The  fish  do  not  always  stay  in  the  North.    They also  migrate to  the South, 

especially the pelagic fish like tuna, blue fin and yellow fin, albacore as well.  All these 

fish  are  migratory  in  nature  and  are  not  confined  to  the  North.  They  spread  to  the 

Southern Group islands and further south to the 40 degrees latitude. 

</span></div><div><span>We should encourage our people to take up deep sea fishing, especially with the current 

market prices of tuna and albacore in the canning factories and in overseas markets. 

</span></div><div><span>I was even more delighted to hear that there will be a direct flight to Penrhyn to uplift 

fresh  market  for fish for the Hawaiian market.   Again,  this is  of great  benefit because 

</span><span>there will be better transport for the fish we harvest from our lagoons and ocean.  Not 

</span><span>only that, it will bring in tourist dollars. 

</span></div><div><span>There is  also  the opportunity to  develop  the sports fishermen to  come to  the Northern 

Islands  and  even  Aitutaki.    I  have  had  many,  many  inquiries  from  American  citizens 

who want to come to Aitutaki, Manihiki or Penrhyn to catch milkfish. 

</span></div><div><span>I  don’t  think  our  people  should  be  concerned  with  this  because  these  sportsmen  only 

</span><span>catch the fish and release it back into the lagoon.   So there is no risk of depleting our 

resources,  in  fact  it  will  sustain  the  industry.    I  am  aware  of  the  problem  Aitutaki  is 

facing with  the depletion  of natural  clams.  Now I hear that the  </span><span>remu</span><span> (sea grapes) are 

depleted  too.  I  would  like  to  put  forward  this  hypothesis  that  the  changing  climate  is 

causing this unnatural happening, not only in our part of the world, but to many, many 

other parts of the world as well.  The Great Barrier Reef of Australia has been reported 

to  show  massive  areas  of  coral  death  and  other  marine  life.    Coral  bleaching  is 

associated  with  the rise of temperatures in the lagoons. It  is  also  possible that there is 

contamination of the lagoons in Aitutaki, which is causing some of the depletion of the 

shell population, especially run-off of pesticides and fertiliser. 

</span></div><div><span>I was aware of this two years ago. We had some discussions with the Mayor of Aitutaki 

on  repopulating  the  lagoon  there  with  stocks  from  the  Manihiki  lagoon.  There  is  an 

unnatural  phenomenon  also  occurring,  in  the  lagoon  in  Manihiki,  where  there  is  an 

overgrowth  of  the  oyster  and  as  well  as  clams.  If  the  Marine  Resources  wish  to  take 

</span><span>stock from Manihiki, we don’t have any problem at all, in fact we will invite them to do 

</span><span>that to minimise the overload in our lagoons. I am not talking about harvesting naturally 

growing clams and shells in the lagoon. I am talking about those clams and shells that 

grow on chaplets where we tried to grow pearl oysters. In fact, the clam that grow on our 

</span><span>chaplets become rubbish, and we discard them on the shore and leave them to dry out. It 

</span><span>is  easy  to  transport  these  without  even  prising  them  off  the  rock.  They  are  already 

growing on chaplets. It is just a matter of transporting them to any island which wishes 

to have stocks of clams introduced into their lagoons.  We have done this exercise with 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1799 

</span></div><div><span>Rakahanga.  We  transferred  live  clams  from  Manihiki  to  Rakahanga  to  repopulate  the 

lagoon there.  In fact, it was a very successful exercise.  

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the New Alliance Party mentioned the exploitation of Suwarrow after a 

comprehensive  EIA  was  done  on  that  island.  I  am  delighted  that  we  can,  with  care, 

exploit and harvest some of the natural resources from that island.  

</span></div><div><span>If I may just comment on the Vaka Councils, especially in the Nikao area, those Vaka 

</span><span>Council that have accepted the ra’ui system, with the support of the Marine Resource</span><span>s, 

the </span><span>ra’ui</span><span> system should be encouraged. Sadly though, some of the </span><span>raui </span><span>have been lifted 

and a short time later there was wholesale harvesting from those areas.   So the key is </span><span>to 

</span><span>taporoporo, to </span><span>ra’ui</span><span>our lagoons so we don’t deplete whatever resources we </span><span>have there. 

We  all  grew  up  with  our  grandparents  and  learned  from  them  that  we  do  culturally 

accept  the  </span><span>ra’ui </span><span>system. Each individual who breaks the </span><span>ra’ui </span><span>will be punished by his 

own conscience for having stolen from the public.  

</span></div><div><span>I  have  no  doubt  that  with  care,  we  can  increase  our  return.  This  country  will  stand  to 

gain  a  lot  more  from  our  marine  resources,  with  proper  care  and  utilisation.  If  we 

</span><span>seriously ask ourselves, what else do we have apart from our legacy of the seas? If we 

</span><span>look after it today, it will be there to serve us tomorrow.   Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.      Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member from Nukuroa, Tangata Vavia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VAVIA:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Greetings to you, your staff members and to 

all  Honourable  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House.  To  the  two  Leaders  of  the 

Opposition, Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  Mr  Chairman,  to  give  my  support  to  this  budget  allocation  for  the  Marine 

Resources.  Mr Chairman, I believe that this is one area, if we utilise properly, we will 

benefit greatly from it. I am pleased to hear from the Minister of Marine Resources that 

there  is  a  company  who  is  interested  in  establishing  a  fishing  venture  in  the  Cook 

Islands, to export our fish to other parts of world.  When he talked about the Northern 

Group,  Mr  Chairman,  I  believe  he  was  talking  about  Manihiki,  Rakahanga,  Penrhyn, 

Pukapuka  and  Palmerston  islands,  and  not  about  a  few  of  the  islands  in  the  Northern 

Group.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  about  three  weeks  ago  I  went  to  visit  the  island  of  Palmerston.  I  was 

pleased to hear the idea of a group of young people there who are interested in a similar 

fishing venture. They are very determined but the main difficulty is obtaining a boat for 

that purpose. I am certain that when the boat is obtained they will be successful in their 

venture. I am certain that for all young people in the Northern Group with a similar plan 

who work hard, they will be successful because the sea is second nature to them. They 

have an affinity with the sea. No matter how rough the sea is, they are able to handle it. 

Therefore, I was happy when I heard the Minister talk about this fishing venture. I hope 

that this venture will include the whole Northern Group - Palmerston, Pukapuka, Nassau 

and the other islands in the North.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>1800 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I waited to hear whether this venture will include the Southern Group, but that did not 

eventuate. Still, I remain positive that it will. I hope that in the near future there will be 

further  discussions  by  the  Minister  and  his  staff  about  the  possibility  of  including  the 

Southern Group.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  a  few  days  ago  I  read  an  article  in  a  newspaper,  regarding  shipping 

company  on  the  island  of  Fiji.  This  company  is  exporting  fresh  fish  to  markets  in  the 

USA. This company has one fishing boat on the island of Fiji yet there is enough fish to 

export to  markets  in  the USA.   The director of this company, who is also the owner, 

says  that  it  is  extremely  difficult  to  break  into  the  American  market  because  their 

standards  are  so  high.  If  you  make  one  mistake,  that  is,  if  your  fish  fails  to  meet  the 

standards expected by American markets,  your exports will be stopped. In this article, 

this Company Director emphasised the importance of achieving very high standards in 

order to retain the markets of the USA. He also said that export to American markets is 

very  profitable.    There  are  many  species  of  fish  in  our economic zones in  the Pacific, 

which are white-meat fish, from the reef and in the deep sea that the Americans are not 

fully aware of. This is because not enough of these are exported to their markets.  

</span></div><div><span>This is why Mr Chairman, when I heard the Minister make the announcement that there 

</span><span>is to be a fishing venture established here in the Cook Islands. I was very happy because 

I  could  see  a  great  opportunity  for  us.  However  when  we  get  there,  we  must  be  very 

particular about achieving and maintaining a high standard so the exports will continue, 

unlike  many  ventures  in  the  past  which  have  started  with  promises  and  ended  in 

disaster. We all know why this is, Mr Chairman. The reason is the groundwork was not 

done properly. We did not do sufficient research and preparatory work. We did not have 

the  proper  training,  which  is  why  these  ventures  failed.  We  cannot  point  the  finger  at 

others  or  blame  the  markets.  It  is  our  own  fault.  The  power  to  achieve,  to  bring 

prosperity to ourselves is within our own hands.  

</span></div><div><span>This  company  in  Fiji  is  the  only  one  in  the  Pacific  Region  that  I  know  about  that  is 

exporting all sorts of fish to markets in the USA. It might be a good idea to study their 

operations  so  that  we  may  benefit  from  their  experience.  Although  they  have  been  in 

operation for a number of years, they have only started exporting white-meat fish to the 

USA. As I said earlier, this is a new venture, which the Minister is introducing us to. If 

we take it, we will benefit because we will be using our wealth of marine resources for 

export to the outside world.  

</span></div><div><span>It  reminds  me  of  a  trip  I  went  to  a  New  South  Wales’s  fish  canning  factory. The fish 

</span><span>they  were  canning  came  from  Australian  waters  and  they  were  looking  at  accepting 

imports from Samoa. They were canning Bonito. We spoke to them about the possibility 

of coming from Samoa to the Cook Islands to pick up supplies from us. They were not 

able to comment further and there was no commitment because of the difficulties with 

shipping.  They  would  like  the  fish  so  long  as  it  could  reach  their  factory.  There  is  a 

closer canning factory in American Samoa. Maybe the Minister can look at a feasibility 

study as far as the Southern  Group is concerned, for a holding freezer, so our fish can 

</span><span>eventually be transported to the canning factory.  I know it is hard at times because we 

</span><span>do not have the finances but, Mr Chairman, I want to give my support to the prospect 

that this company will be established soon in the Northern Group.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1801 

</span></div><div><span>I agree with previous speakers that our ocean has not yet been tapped.  Some years back 

when I was still in the Police force, we boarded a fishing mother ship and we had the 

opportunity to look at the contents of that ship.  Although I did not know that I would 

ever be in this House, I felt at that moment that we were being exploited. I felt bad then 

because  we  saw  a  lot  of  fish  in  the  hole,  hanging  row  after  row.  That  told  me,  Mr 

Chairman that we are allowing our fish to be taken off us, out of our back door, without 

getting  a  cent  of  it.    On  the  fishing  boat  that  came  with  the  mother  ship  were  some 

</span><span>Tahitian  workers.  In  our  conversations,  they  asked  us  why  we  weren’t  fishing  down 

</span><span>south,  which  they  call  40  South.  They  said  we  are  the  closest  and  yet  when  they  go 

down there, there are New Zealanders, Americans and fishermen from other parts of the 

world fishing at our back door. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Chairman, we need to look at it seriously now, more than we’ve done in the past.</span><span>

This should be ours - we should be earning something from it but we are not. So that is 

the fishing, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>In regard to our pearl industry, I will not go in depth as far as Penrhyn and Manihiki are 

</span><span>concerned because that’s already been well covere</span><span>d in this House. However, I give my 

</span><span>encouragement  to  those  private  enterprises  that  are  thinking  of  establishing  a  farm  in 

</span><span>Palmerston. I hope that they will be successful because only through trying to find out 

whether we can do so in these islands can we add another dollar to the economy of this 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>So those are my views on this Appropriation, Mr Chairman.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you this afternoon 

and to the staff of this House. To the Honourable Members in this House, to our people 

listening to our debate especially those in the Outer Islands Kia Orana.  I believe that our 

people in the Outer Islands put their trust in their Marine Resources. I would like to give 

my greetings to  the Minister of Marine Resources and all his staff. I hope that he will 

continue  to  be  a  good  advocate  for  Marine  Resources  and  will  continue  trying  to 

strengthen the Ministry of Marine Resources, especially in the areas of fishing and pearl 

farming. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  saddened  to  hear  Mr  Chairman  that  these  ventures  aired  in  this  House  today  are 

being talked about at the last minute.  If only they had been done a lot earlier, we would 

have  seen  the  results  of  those  ventures  now.    I  can  remember  the  former  Minister  of 

Marine  Resources,  the  Honourable  Ben  Toma,  mentioned  similar  ventures  in  the  past 

which  never  eventuated.  We  heard  the  Minister  mentioning  something  about  a  giant 

fishing venture and if this does come to fruition then this will be a very good thing. This 

type of venture should have been prepared and established during the time that we put 

our public servants into transition because this would have helped them out at the time. 

Instead, we see it happening now. For us to talk about this venture at this late period in 

the term of this Parliament is not a good thing because people will think of it merely as 

another  political  exercise.    The  things  that  we  should  be  discussing  and  trying  to 

encourage, are the ventures that are already in place such as Tapi who started his fishing 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>1802 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>venture  and  other  people  who  have  also  started  their  own  business  along  these  lines.  

These  are  the  people  we  should  be  trying  to  encourage  now.  If  we  want  to  help,  we 

should be helping them.  We should be looking at ways to try and help these people by 

way of tax incentives, whereby we can have tax exemptions or some sort of advice from 

Development Investment.  These are the things we should be encouraging.  I </span><span>don’t want 

</span><span>to talk about something that has not happened, something that is a dream, or something 

that involves people from other countries.  What I would like to discuss and talk about 

</span><span>are ventures in this country now and for us to go to people and say, “</span><span>look, how can we 

</span><span>help?”</span></div><div><span>Some people I have spoken about have already started their fishing ventures. They have 

started long-line fishing. They are the people that we should be looking at to help.  All 

</span><span>the money that we have got from licences, I don’t thin</span><span>k we have in excess of $500,000 

</span><span>or half a million dollars at the moment.  Mr Chairman, I don’t doubt that we can fish our 

</span><span>own fish in our EEZ, which is nearly two million square kilometres. Yet, we allow other 

people to fish in our waters. We should be encouraging our own people to go out and 

fish in our waters. This is the sort of thing I hope will happen for our people. The first 

option to fish in our waters should be given to them because they have shown they are 

</span><span>keen. This is what I want to happen, Mr Chairman. They have shown they are capable 

</span><span>but  all  they  want  is  their  Government’s  backing,  then  they  will  go  forth  with  their 

</span><span>ventures. I have no doubt that they will succeed.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, we know that we are part of the United States Fishing Areas Programme 

but the amount of money we get from this Programme is peanuts, as they say. These are 

the  areas  that  the  DAP  are  looking  at  changing.  We  will  encourage  and  support  the 

development of local ventures. The Party will always be willing to support these types 

</span><span>of ventures because we always put “People first”. We have always known that there are 

</span><span>a lot of benefits to be reaped from our oceans. It is time that our people started reaping 

these benefits instead of people from other countries. I believe it is time that our people 

benefited.  I  have  always  felt  sorry  for  our  people  because  this  Government  has  left 

ventures such as this until the last minute and over and above that, these ventures always 

benefit  outsiders  more  than  our  own  people.  A  lot  of  the  benefits  go  outside  of  the 

country instead of remaining here.   

</span></div><div><span>I have a lot of views  on Marine Resources developments  but  I don’t want  to  air them 

</span><span>now otherwise our policy secrets will be revealed.  There have been a lot of things said 

</span><span>about the cultivation of pearls and pearl shell. I listened to those. We want those areas to 

</span><span>be strengthened. We want to encourage our people by assisting them in developing the 

pearl and pearl shell industry. We must encourage them to look at it in terms of its long-

term benefits, not just the short-term. I am quite certain when the Democratic Alliance 

Party  reveals  its  policies  on  pearl  farming,  you  will  be  very  happy  with  our ideas and 

recommendations. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, today I want us to look at the difficulties that pearl and pearl shell farmers 

experience in this industry. I want us to look at the ways in which things can be altered 

</span><span>to  make  life  easier  for  them.  It  is  often  said,  especially  by  those  people  sitting  in  the 

</span><span>back row there that we looked after ourselves only when we were in Government. I am 

going to ask you Mr Minister, to bear with me. I have a question to ask you.   We looked 

at your record and found that during your time as Minister you spent a lot of time on the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1803 

</span></div><div><span>island  of  Penrhyn.  I  have  been  told  that  you  have  been  constructing  a  building  there, 

whether it is for use as a home, or whether it is a building for a business, I do not know, 

but I understand it is completed.  

</span></div><div><span>So,  we  thought  we  should  find out  whether you fit in  the same category that we have 

been accused of, that is, as a Minister, you are looking after yourself first. I would like 

you to explain what this building is for. The second question I have is about the lagoon 

of Penrhyn. I have been told that you were responsible for leasing half of the lagoon on 

the island of Penrhyn to somebody. Is this true? I ask this because there are some people 

there  who  are  unhappy  with  this.  I  would  like  you  to  explain  to  this  House  what  you 

have done, why you did it, and what the purpose is. 

</span></div><div><span>The third question I have  regards the sale of the Government Pearl Farm in Manihiki. 

While I was in the kitchen having my cup of tea, I overheard the Honourable Dr Papa 

Pupuke Robati asking how the Government Pearl Farm on the island of Manihiki came 

into  the  possession  of  Mr  Henry  Puna.  These  are  the  questions  I  want  to  ask  Mr 

Chairman. There are a lot of other questions I would like to  ask but  I better not  stack 

</span><span>them up in case they don’t get answered. </span></div><div><span>There  are  also  some  questions  I  really  wanted  to  ask  the  Honourable  Members  for 

</span><span>Aitutaki, but I won’t waste my time because they don’t know anything. A few days ago, 

Mr Chairman, they had the gall to call my Deputy Leader and me ignorant. I won’t ask 

them any questions because they won’t be able to answer them. They went to a diffe</span><span>rent 

school from ours. I told them not to talk to us like that because when we were going to 

school, they were dodging class to eat mangoes.
