<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 1: Short Title 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 2: Parliament of the Cook Islands 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 3: New Articles 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    I  won’t  be  long  on  this.    I  just 

</span><span>want  to  go  back  and  reiterate  what  I  said  about  the  people  who  have  listed  in  this 

Clause.  I  gave  my  strong  support  to  this.  I  do  not  want  any  appointments  to  be  made 

politically.  Because  today,  Mr  Chairman,  there  are  a  lot  of  Boards  and  Councils 

</span></div><div><a>Page 43</a></div><div><span>1828 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>appointed which have hindered the progress of this country.  These Boards have become 

such a hindrance that they are actually delaying or hindering the growth of this country. 

The  people  are  accusing  the  Board  of  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation.  They 

are  spending  so  much  money  and  not  putting  money  back  into  the  Public  Account  to 

help  the Government.  And when you listen to the comments of the people you cannot 

believe the comments that they are making. You have to listen to what they are saying.  

This is why I support the establishment of a National Appointments Council so that the 

Chief  Justice  or  Judge  of  the  High  Court  in  his  absence,  the  Prime  Minister  and  the 

Leader of the Opposition can make the decision collectively. The main aim is to achieve 

some balance. The way I see it, there are too many of these Boards and they are getting 

out of hand. 

</span></div><div><span>The only area I don't really agree w</span><span>ith is the last part of the Clause where it says, “such 

other officers as maybe prescribed by the Act”. We do not know the limits or the extent 

</span><span>of this part. Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span> Long Title: An Act to amend the Constitution.  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Long Title stands part of the  Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be reported to Parliament without Amendment? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
