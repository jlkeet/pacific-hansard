<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Constitution  Amendment  (No.  25)  Bill  Second  Reading.    The  Honourable  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you.  Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Constitution Amendment (No. 25) be now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Before I call upon the Honourable Minister let us complete the Third 

Reading of the Constitution Amendment (No.23) Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK OF PARLIAMENT:</span><span> A Bill intituled: An Act to amend the Constitution. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  This  concludes  the  Third  reading  of  the  Constitution  Amendment 

(No.23) Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker. Constitution Amendment (No.25) 

Mr Speaker contains only three clauses.  That being the case, I am expecting that it will 

not be necessary for you to tell the Leader of the Opposition to sit down.  

</span></div><div><span>This Bill is seeking to give effect to two of the recommendations made by the Political 

Review Commission,  which in  my view, are worthy of the support of this Parliament. 

Before  I  speak  of  them,  I  ought  to  confirm  that  prior  to  his  leaving  for  Aitutaki,  the 

Leader of the New Alliance Party did tell me that I can be rest assured for his support 

for Constitution Amendment (No. 24) and this Amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>And I should also confirm Mr Speaker, that the Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party 

also gave me his assurance that he would support Amendments No.24 and No.25. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>I have changed my mind since I have been told to shut up.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  I  have  always  known  him  to  be  a  free  agent  anyway,  Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  suggestions  that  came  through  and  quite  strongly  in  the  Political  Reform 

Report  was  the  establishment  of  a  National  Appointments  Council  to  vet  the 

appointment of people who hold judicial and semi-judicial positions. The intention is to 

lend as much impartiality as possible to the appointment of these high positions such as 

</span><span>the Chief Justice, the Ombudsman, the Commissioner of Police, the Solicitor-General, 

</span><span>etc., to lend their appointment as much impartiality as is possible.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>1820 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>The clear view, which is what I support, is that positions such as these should be free of 

any  politics  to  whatever  extent  is  possible  under  human  control.    People  appointed  to 

these positions will then achieve these positions by virtue of appropriate qualifications 

and merit rather than political affiliations. 

</span></div><div><span>Just the other day, the Leader of the Opposition had the occasion to wonder whether in 

fact  the  Justices  of  the  Peace,  who  had  just  been  recently  appointed  were  done  in  a 

manner that was impartial. Establishing a National Appointments Council, in my view, 

will go a long way to assuaging any fear that any of us or any member of the public may 

have  about  these  appointments  being  political.  The  proposal  is  that  the  Council 

</span><span>comprises  three  people  appointed  by  the  Queen’s  Representative,  on  the  collective 

</span><span>recommendation of the Chief Justice or a Judge of the High Court 

</span></div><div><span>There is only one appointment recommended by the Political Review Commission that 

is not in this Bill and that is the position of the Speaker of Parliament.  It is my view, 

and  I  am  not  sure  that  the  Commission  had  the  opportunity  to  hear  that  view  that  the 

appointment of the Speaker is and must remain the prerogative of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Oh, man. Another silly thing.  Absurd!  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  The  Report  also  recommended  the  establishment  of  a 

Leadership Code.  So, a part of this Bill is seeking a constitutional opportunity for the 

Government, after the next election, if it so desired, to put in place an Act to establish a 

Leadership Code for all Members of Parliament, for all Ministers and for all Heads of 

Departments and others who hold top jobs in the Civil Service. I want to make it clear 

Mr Speaker, that when we vote on this Amendment we are not voting into existence a 

Leadership Code.  All we are doing is amending the Constitution so that it provides the 

opportunity  for  an  Act  to  be  subsequently  enacted  to  establish  a  Leadership  Code.    I 

believe,  Mr  Speaker,  such  a  Leadership  Code  is  in  order  and  should  this  Government 

have the privilege of being the next Government, it will enact such a Code. 

</span></div><div><span>The Commission did not recommend it but it is being recommended to this Parliament 

to amend the Constitution in order to allow for the opportunity for an Act to be put in 

place to govern the position of Members in Parliament when it comes to the question of 

crossing the Floor.  When we vote for this Bill, we are not voting against the right of any 

Member to cross the Floor on any issue.  All we are voting for is an amendment to the 

Constitution  to  give  the  incoming  Government  the  opportunity  to  consider  putting  in 

place the management of that process.  The idea, Mr Speaker, is not to prohibit anyone 

from crossing the Floor on, say, conscience issues or other issues. 

</span></div><div><span>Should such an Act come into existence it must be very careful to recognise the right of 

the Member of Parliament to cross the Floor.  At the same time, that Act must balance 

that  right  of  the  Member  of  Parliament  against  the  right  of  those  who  put  him  into 

Parliament.  Again, I want to make it clear Mr Speaker that we are not voting for that 

Act.  We are simply voting for the opportunity, should the next Government so desire, 

to bring in place an Act that manages the process of a Member moving from one side of 

the Floor to another, on any given issue. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Prime Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Mataio Aperau 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Constitution Amendment No.25 Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Norman George, Leader of the New Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I stand to give the support of the New Alliance Party to 

this  Amendment.  I  understand  that  this  Amendment  is  being  put  through  the 

Constitution to enable another Act to be created further down the line. I would be very 

cautious of such a bill being subsequently drafted. We have to realise and appreciate that 

Members  of  Parliament  also  need  the  protection  of  the  law  as  they  also  have  total 

unfettered constitutional rights. If and when an enabling Act is put through, I would like 

to  say  to  this  House  that  this  Parliament  should  make  sure  that  such  an  Act  does  not 

infringe  on  to  the  fundamental  human  rights,  freedom  of  action  of  Members  of  this 

Parliament.  Ironically  Mr  Speaker,  when  you  look  at  the  history  of  this  country,  and 

when you look at the history of this Parliament, many Governments have been formed 

as  a  result  of  Members  of  Parliament  crossing  the  Floor,  as  a  result  of  the  actions  of 

turncoats in Parliament.   It happened to both sides, to both political parties in the past. 

Nobody  can  say  that  it  only  happened  to  so  and  so.  There  has  been,  I  think,  equal 

amounts  of  Floor  crossings.  If  we  had  to  mark  the  steps,  I  am  sure  it  will  balance  up 

with those going from this side to that and that side to this.  

</span></div><div><span>It is understandable, Mr Speaker, that those with a high degree of honour, those with a 

high code of leadership standards detest turncoats. So, I can understand the feelings that 

there ought to be some regulation. I would also like to see the new enabling legislation 

allow Members to express Motions of No Confidence, and to take part in Motions of No 

Confidence, and not be restricted to non-meaningful acts of conscience. I would not like 

the freedom of any member of this House to express a Vote of No Confidence in either 

his own Government or in anybody in this House. I would not like to see that legislated 

against  any  Member  of  Parliament.    I  am  quite  sure  the  plain  meaning  of  confidence 

means  that  a  Member  can  express  either  confidence  or  no  confidence,  as  a  matter  of 

conscience, as a conscionable decision in his own right as an individual.  

</span></div><div><span>Those are my comments about that part of the Constitution Amendment. Now, I move 

on to Part II, I have very little to say about it.  I support the concept, Mr Speaker, of a 

National Appointments Council. I am quite sure that an enabling Act needs to be passed 

to  put  into detail such an appointment. I would assume that the recommendation must 

come  from  Cabinet,  that  is  the  natural  right  of  Cabinet  to  do  so.    Therefore,  this 

provision is a good clean one, to put the future of all appointments in this country well 

and truly above politics.  

</span></div><div><span>The  third  and  the  last  provision  of  this  Amendment  applies  to  the  creation  of  a 

Leadership Code in future legislation. Mr Speaker this is another triumph for the New 

Alliance  Party  policies  because  you  will  find  it  in  the  last  Alliance  Party  Manifesto.  I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 37</a></div><div><span>1822 

</span></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>have always claimed throughout the last four years, this Government, with all its good 

intentions  has  copied  a  lot  of  our  materials  from  that  Manifesto.  I  congratulate  this 

Government for being good students and followers of the New Alliance and for taking 

this wonderful action on our behalf. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  there’s  an  air  of  sadness  about  this  Amendment.  Today,  we  were  first 

</span><span>saddened  by  the  announcement  of  the  Minister  of  Education  that  he  is  retiring.  Now, 

this evening, we hear the Second Reading of this Bill by the Prime Minister.  Is this a 

symbolic act on behalf of the Prime Minister? Is he saying goodbye to this House?  Is he 

trying to create something for the AG period of this country, </span><span>meaning the “After Geoff” 

</span><span>period, to create a Code of Leadership for all succeeding Governments.   Is this the last 

</span><span>hurray, the last goodbye, to say “you guys, after I’m gone, you behave yourselves”.  Is 

</span><span>he  finally  handing  over  the  reins  to  Harmon  Pou  of  Takuvaine?  My  friend,  the  Prime 

Minister, rest assured that I am just looking for angles for this provision and when I see 

</span><span>history being formed, I am not shy to take a hint and to make a hint about it. There’s too 

</span><span>much sadness in this House this evening, too much sadness. Mr Speaker, a Leadership 

Code is an essential component for Members of this House, for Ministers of Cabinet, for 

the  Prime  Minister  and  for  Heads  of  Ministries,  and  for  Speakers  of  the  House.  Why 

</span><span>would,  and  why  should  any  Member  of  Parliament  resist  such  a  move  to  regulate our 

</span><span>ethical  standards  in  public  offices?  Mr  Speaker,  not  only  are  we  the  New  Alliance 

supporting  to  this  Amendment.  We  are  making  an  undertaking  to  be  committed  to 

making sure that if, as the Prime Minister says, if the people of this country so sensibly 

and graciously votes New Alliance into Government, we will be committed to passing 

the enabling legislation to bring in a Leadership Code. By voting for these Amendments 

in this House tonight, Mr Speaker, we, the New Alliance Party are committed to making 

sure  that  a  Leadership  Code  will  be  legislated  before  the  end  of  this  year,  1999.  Mr 

Speaker,  this  commitment  will  be  repeated  in  our  Party  Manifesto  for  this  General 

</span><span>Election.    We will commit it in  writing because we don’t</span><span>want  to  be ‘shortened’, as I 

have been misquoted by Mr Short.  I don’t want anybody to say later on, that you said 

</span><span>that there should be no Leadership Code, when in fact we made our commitment now in 

this House, we will vote for this Amendment, and we make an undertaking to put it in 

our election Manifesto. This country and the people who know me know that my word 

is  my  bond.  My  undertaking  is  my  commitment.  Those  are  my  brief  comments.  We 

support  the  Amendment.  We  will  be  voting  in  support  of  it,  I  would  like  to  ask 

Members - to remind them, I do have a political meeting to go to after this, would you 

</span><span>please  hurry  up,  I’m  getting  late  already.  Thank  you  very  much,  and  good  night  to 

</span><span>everybody. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. May I call for the next speaker? The 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. Greetings to you.  I rise to give my 

</span><span>views on the Constitution Amendment.  I listened closely to the Prime Minister’s views 

</span><span>on the first part, which is the Declaration of Political Parties. These are his own views, 

not those of the Commission of Political Review. However, when I look at his views, I 

think  it  would  be  a  good  idea  to  examine  it  further.  Because  this  has  already  been 

touched  upon  by  the  Electoral  Act  which  we  passed  recently.  When  the  names  of 

candidates  are  nominated,  the  political  party  shall  be  put  next  to  the  name  of  the 

</span><span>candidate.    When  I  look  at  this,  I  don’t  see  a  problem  with  it.  It  will  only  assist  our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 38</a></div><div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1823 

</span></div><div><span>political system.  However, I would like to ask why this Amendment is being brought in 

at this time? Whom do you suspect? In our Party, we have already clearly indicated our 

policy  for  the  nomination  of  candidates.  If  there  are  two  nominations  from  one 

Constituency,  we  will  have  a  vote  to  confirm  who  the  candidate  will  be.  If  there  is  a 

candidate whom we have doubts about, that is, we believe he will join another party, the 

</span><span>constituency will tell us. If a candidate’s political party affiliation is clearly defined, it 

</span><span>may reduce problems during election time. However, this Amendment does not place a 

restriction on a Member who wants to cross the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>I don’t have any problem with the first part. The second part of this Amendment regards 

</span><span>the establishment of a National Appointments Council. The big question here is why is 

there  a  need  for  a  National  Appointments  Council  at  this  time.    The  Prime  Minister 

explained the situation with the appointment of the Justices of the Peace, the CIIC and 

other  areas  that  have  been  stated  in  here.  Positions  which  this  National  Appointments 

Council  will  be  responsible  for  selecting  include  the  Justices  of  the  Peace,  the 

Ombudsman, Solicitor General, Public Service Commissioner, Chairman of the Political 

Public Expenditure Review Committee, the Director of Audit, Commissioner of Police, 

and  other  officers.  This  fulfils  a  recommendation  for  reform  by  the  Committee  of 

</span><span>Political  Review. This  is  a common disease which is why this Report recommended a 

</span><span>reform  to  cure  it,  and  rightly  so.  This  Government  is  biased  too  much  towards  Cook 

Islands Party supporters, which is why this recommendation came about. A Committee 

will  make  appointments  on  a  non-partisan  basis.  I  thank  the  Committee  of  Political 

Review for bringing this recommendation in. I feel this recommendation is in order. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, the Leadership Code. We have already decided this in our Manifesto. In fact, this 

is with our lawyers at the moment for drafting and when we come into power we will 

implement this.  I am not concerned about this Leadership Code because our group does 

not require rules to tell us how to behave. This section of the Constitution Amendment 

comes too late, Mr Speaker. You will recall when a Minister misbehaved recently, his 

indecent  behaviour  occurred  on  a  public  road  and  was  reported  in  the  newspaper. 

Everybody  knew  about  his  activities  because  it  took  place  on  a  public  road.  If  the 

Leadership  Code  had  been  established  at  that  time,  the  Minister  would  have  been 

punished for his indecent behaviour.
