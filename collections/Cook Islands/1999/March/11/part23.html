Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate to continue with your speech and please come 

back to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I thought you had expelled him.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  now  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  to  speak.    Honourable 

Members,  I  would  like  to  apologise  to  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Maoate  for 

interfering with your right of speech in the House earlier on tonight. I realise now that I 

was  too  hard  on  the  Honourable  Member,  especially  when  I  asked  the  Honourable 

Member to shut up.  So, I now apologise to the Honourable Member.
