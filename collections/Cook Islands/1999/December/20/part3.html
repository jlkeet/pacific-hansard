</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Bear  with  me  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    I  will  have  to

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No.10 The Annual Report of the Office of Public Expenditure

</span></div><div><span>Before I do so, may I first extend greetings to you and to the Parliamentary staff. To 

Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House,  to  the  Prime  Minister,  members  of  Cabinet, 

Government  Members  and  also  the  Opposition  side  of  the  House,  their  leader  and

</span><span>debate, to the visitors on the island, to all our friends and relations who are visiting for 

Christmas, Kia Orana and welcome. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>358 

</span></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker I stand in support of the report by PERCA. It sounds better when you say 

PERCA.  We  are  referring  to  the  Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee  and  Audit.  

</span><span>This  committee is  the watchdog of Government’s  activities carried out  b</span><span>y  Ministers 

and  politicians  and  also  the  activities  of  Heads  of  Ministries  and  public  servants.  

When  you  have  nothing  to  fear  from  this  type  of  body,  you  will  welcome  its 

existence. I join those who welcome it by saying that it is a much needed body to act 

as a policing agent to check on the decisions and actions of the Executive branch of 

Government.    In  the  short  time  that  I  have  been  in  Government,  I  am  one  of  those 

lucky people who have attracted the attention of this committee. I have been subjected 

to two investigations which did not embarrass me in any way and if you know what 

you are doing is  right  and  you are not  breaking  any law  I am  comfortable with  that 

work.    I  do  have  a  number  of  strong  observations  too.    First,  curb  the  tendency  of 

PERCA to make impulsive investigations  because  I feel  a lot of investigations  were 

conceived  inside  a  bar  where  these  drunks  examine  Government  and  in  that  state 

decide  with  their  colleagues  to  investigate  and  thus  an  investigation  is  formulated 

from that.  We get publicity from it and the investigation gets underway. 

</span></div><div><span>There  are  also  instances  where  I  have  a  feeling  that  some  of  the  reasons  for  the 

</span><span>investigation  was  self  nominated  by  PERCA  themselves.    Mr  Speaker  I  draw  an 

</span><span>analogy  to  what  happens  in  the  fire  service  in  New  Zealand  every  year  where  a 

fireman is arrested for starting a fire so he can go and investigate it.  Year after year, if 

you look at the history, some fireman ends up in prison because he got bored sitting 

around doing nothing and so he started a fire. He rushes to the station, get on a truck 

and go put it out.  It is my great suspicion that many investigations were nominated by 

PERCA  itself  to  justify  its  existence  or  for  self  motivation.    I  find  it  difficult  to 

eliminate malicious investigations as well.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker may  I venture to  suggest  that the legislation should be amended so that 

only  written  complaints  by  members  of  the  public  must  be  lodged  before  an 

investigation is carried out. And if a citizen feels so strongly about  a certain matter, 

then  that  citizen  should  not  hesitate  to  put  a  complaint  down  in  writing  and  be 

</span><span>prepared to have that citizen’s name published in that particular report.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this eliminates malicious reports founded in pubs, founded maybe in the 

office.    This  will  eliminate  malicious  abuse  of  the  Office  of  PERCA  so  that  only 

concerned  citizens  with  genuine  concerns  and  prepared  to  put  their  name  down  in 

writing should be able to lodge complaints. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  obtained  examples  of  this  kind  from  the  Ombudsman  who  visited  us 

earlier  this  year  from  Queensland  who  said,  that  the  moment  they  require  people  to 

put their complaints down in writing it reduced the amount of complaints coming in 

considerably  by  up  to  50  per  cent.    I  compare  the  anonymous  complaints  to 

anonymous abusive letters to the Editor in the Cook Islands News.  I maintain to those 

anonymous  creeps  that  write  letters  to  the  Editor  to  put  your  name  down  if  you  are 

man enough to do so especially when you are attacking other people.  But I know that 

many of those letter writers will continue to wear skirts. 

</span></div><div><span>However, the principle is here.  There is nothing at all to stop anyone from making a 

complaint. However, we are all asking for responsibility and accountability so if you 

are not responsible enough to put your name to a complaint then how can you expect 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>359 

</span></div><div><span>respectability from others?  In addition, any allegation that we are only interested in 

the names so we can take revenge and take all kinds of retribution is utter nonsense.  

</span><span>That doesn’t happen any more</span><span>.  There are enough laws to protect the rights of citizens 

and I would say, God have mercy on a Minister that reacts personally to a complaint.  

I am quite sure that the publicity he will get from will make sure that he will regret it 

to the end of his days. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  urge  this  Parliament  to  consider  the  creation  of  a  Conflicts  Commission.    A 

Conflicts  Commission  will  protect  those  in  high  offices  against  allegations  of 

favouritism, nepotism, etc. etc.  Somebody said to me once that if you have ethics you 

do not need a Conflicts Commission.  I do not agree with that.  There are differences 

and  limitations  to  both.    Because  of  our  small  population,  we  are  bound  to  come 

across  the  appointment  of  a  relation  to  your  office  or  the  awarding  of  a  contract  to 

somebody  that  you  know,  because  of  our  smallness.    No  ethic  can  justify  depriving 

that relative from getting a fairly competed tender to get a job. If we are going to just 

rely on ethics then we are going to victimise our relations.  Mr Speaker, if a relative of 

mine  makes  a  bid  for  a  publicly  tendered  job  because  that  person  is  my  brother  or 

nearest relation in order to be cleared of any allegations of misuse of office, I would 

</span><span>like to submit that tender to the Conflicts Commission to clear it before considering 

</span><span>that tender.  No doubt in my application to that Commission, my CEO will say one of 

the  tenderers  is  a  relative  of  the  Minister.  The  Minister  just  wants  to  notify  the 

Commissioner  about  him  and  to  advise  the  Commission  that  the  Minister  will  be 

taking no part in the making of a decision.  In the event that the relative gets the job, 

at least the public will know that it has gone to the Conflicts Commission.  They have 

checked it and satisfied that the Minister had nothing to do with awarding the tender.   

</span></div><div><span>I think we need something like that to clear the air because for too long I am sure that 

some of us in Ministerial offices have victimised our own families because of public 

accusations.  We really need a Conflicts Commission to protect Heads of Ministries, 

to protect even the private sector in case they are accused of favouring their own kin.  

This is an important office to clear our conscience when awards are given, especially 

the cruel anonymous letters to the Editor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span> I conclude Mr Speaker by saying that I wholeheartedly support 

the work of PERCA but  they must not  be able to  run away  and manage themselves 

without some constraint.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister of Internal Affairs Ngamau Munokoa 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Woonton,  Minister 

responsible for Legislative Services. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you and greetings 

</span><span>also  to  all  staff  members  in  the  House.  Kia  Orana  to  our  people  listening  in  to  our 

debate  this  afternoon.    A  special  Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet,  Caucus 

members, to the Leader of the Opposition and Members in the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>360 

</span></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Through you Mr Speaker, if I may extend greetings to my constituency in Manihiki. 

To the Mayor and the Aronga Mana, the Councillors and the people of Manihiki </span><span>–</span><span> Kia 

Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  stand  to  support  the  paper,  the  Annual  Report  by  PERCA  to  this 

Parliament.  I should at the same time thank the previous Government for introducing 

the Public Expenditure Review Committee as a policeman for our country, especially 

to  check  in  areas  where  the  public  fund  is  expended.    While  it  is  the  first  such 

committee that has been set up but it is without some fault.  This particular committee 

has presented to this Parliament on a number of  occasions several  reports regarding 

the expenditure of public funds.  While they may have had some teething problems it 

is  time  this  Parliament  gave  PERCA  some  teeth  in  the  administration  of  their  Act.  

While they can only report to this Parliament what misdeed or unlawful act has been 

preformed outside there, they  are really helpless  when it comes to  taking matters of 

national concerns further. 

</span></div><div><span>It  goes  without  saying  that  this  is  one  of  the  Acts  introduced  to  bring  about  more 

</span><span>transparency and more accountability from our Government Departments and Ad Hoc 

</span><span>Bodies  and  areas  where  monies  are  expended.    While  the  former  Government  may 

have  formed  PERCA,  I  have  no  doubt  the  present  Government  will  support  the 

functions given to this Body.  As stated by the Deputy Prime Minister earlier, some 

areas  of  PERCA  are  barely  defined  and  not  clearly  delineated.    I  have  always  been 

surprised how PERCA get to investigate areas that are of concern to them.  There is 

no clear definition of how they can conduct or initiate any investigation.  Perhaps if 

there is protocol put in place as to how PERCA can start or initiate an investigation 

into  any  Government  Department,  perhaps  there  will  be  no  confusion.    Perhaps, 

especially  when  investigation  is  called  it  may  be  put  in  wrong  and  names  of  a 

complainant are put on that report.  This I firmly believe will protect the interests of 

those  accused  and  in  that  way  the  accused  if  found  not  guilty  can  have  recourse  to 

address  the matter of which they were accused.   In other words Mr Speaker, what  I 

am saying is that it will stop malicious persecution of our own people.  Persecution in 

our Media and persecution in the general public at large.  It will also prevent ridicule 

of  those  who  are  accused.    It  also  gives  them  some  safety  as  to  defend  themselves 

because the Law will act for both sides and not just for the accused but  also for the 

accuser.  Often on hearsay, we have condemned our fellow countrymen.   

</span></div><div><span>In  addition,  when  PERCA  looked  into  the  matter  investigated  of  any  wrong  doing, 

often the people accused are free of any crime.  Moreover, often Mr Speaker, PERCA 

finds that there has been a blatant abuse of powers or public funds in many instances.  

Yet, PERCA cannot take the matter further for criminal charges.  I fully support the 

principles of PERCA that has been provided.  This is the kind of work that our people 

think  are  independent  of  any  Government,  independent  of  any  Body  and  their  sole 

performance  is  to  bring  to  light  the  truth  of  any  matter  in  our  country.    I  feel  that 

PERCA  can  also  be  used  to  clarify  areas  where  there  is  a  conflict  of  interests 

especially  concerning  private  business  carried  out  in  our  community  because  our 

</span><span>people, quite often by association that others make, feel that we are guilty of a crime 

</span><span>when we are not.  This I feel will broaden the scope of PERCA especially in the areas 

where  there  might  be  a  conflict  of  interest  or  where  they  can  recommend  to  Crown 

Law or the Police where an appropriate remedy can be recommended by PERCA in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>361 

</span></div><div><span>that instance.  The Law passed to guide the functions of PERCA are no different with 

those created for the Public Service Commission as well as our financial laws on how 

we  can  spend  our  public  monies.    It  is  time  that  we  give  the  Public  Expenditure 

Review  Committee  some  better  aspect  to  cover  the  type  of  work  the  public  are 

demanding  to  review,  particularly  in  Government  Departments  and  in  Local 

Government areas.  I fully commend the work the Committee has done in the past and 

I look forward to their continued good work because with PERCA a lot of our public 

would feel safe. We will not misuse public money and misappropriate the funds and 

PERCA  will  be  there  as  the  eyes  and  ears  of  our  general  public.    Thank  you  Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

There  appears  to  be  none.    I  will  call  on  the  Mover  </span><span>–</span><span>  I  call  on  the  Leader  of  the 

opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G. A HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> Greetings Mr Speaker and greetings to everybody who are 

here  in  this  Parliament,  greetings  in  the  name  of  Our  Lord.    Greetings  also  to  our 

people listening to our debate this afternoon.  Greetings to Papa Tapi the Honourable 

</span><span>Member for Akaoa.  I am here now.  He waited for me to go yesterday and then he 

</span><span>spoke against me.   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  also  happy Mr Speaker with  the speech by  the Deputy Prime Minister and the 

Minister of Health Dr Woonton.  In their speeches I heard them give their support to 

PERCA  that  we  the  Cook  Islands  Party  created.    I  will  await  for  the  speech  to  be 

made by the Honourable Member Pupuke Robati </span><span>–</span><span> if he is able to do so.  If you can 

recall Mr Speaker, when we were Members of Cabinet this matter was brought to our 

attention.  We  changed  the  method  of  auditing  the  expenditure  of  this  country  and 

removed  that  responsibility  from  New  Zealand.  The  first  person  to  object  was  the 

Honourable  Member  Pupuke  Robati.    You  can  also  recall  Mr  Speaker  that  the  first 

thing we did was to amend the Constitution because by making that amendment it will 

bring  about  the  creation  of  PERCA.    When  the  Cook  Islands  Party  Government 

brought this Amendment into Parliament, the Opposition objected to it.  It was not all 

our friends on that side because a lot of them were not in the Opposition at that time.  

I  am  mentioning  four  of  them,  the  Honourable  Member  Norman  George,  the 

Honourable  Member  Robert  Woonton  and  the  noisiest  of  them  was  the  Honourable 

Member Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>As I listen to them now, I can see the spirit behind the committee and the principles 

for which it was established. I can say the Deputy Prime Minister and the Honourable 

Robert  Woonton  agree  with  that  and  I  am  happy  about  it.    I  heard  the  Honourable 

Deputy Prime Minister is worried because there were some investigations carried out 

that  he  believed  the  members  of  the  committee  thought  of  themselves  in  a  state  of 

</span><span>delusion.    Maybe  he  is  right,  I  don’t  know.  However,  his  views  about  our  people 

</span><span>being  able  to  make  complaints  against  anything  they  see  wrong  whether  it  is 

concerning  the  Minister  or  a  Department  or  a  public  servant  or  a  member  of 

Parliament, they can make a complaint to the committee through a letter I agree with 

</span><span>that principle. I think it should be done that way.  This is so those things can be done 

</span><span>in accordance with what we want and that is transparency.  Therefore, it is right that if 

anybody  in  this  country  wants  to  make  a  complaint  against  anybody  who  works  in 

Government,  you  can  write  your  complaint,  making  clear  your  complaint  and 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>362 

</span></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>indicating whom you are. They want us to be transparent but they hide behind all sorts 

of rubbish. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker I would like to support this idea.  I am not supporting Government, I am 

supporting this principle and it is not very often that they come up with a good idea, in 

fact, this is the only time.  According to the Act that established this committee, any 

person in our country is allowed to make a complaint.  I do agree that whoever wants 

to make a complaint should write it down, revealing his identity and do not act like a 

ghost.    I  also  believe  it  is  a  good  thing  that  members  of  the  committee  are  able  to 

investigate things they would like to carry out.   

</span></div><div><span>I  have  just  heard  Mr  Speaker  that  fire  fighters  in  New  Zealand  are  the  one  who 

actually starts the fires.  I am not sure if this is corre</span><span>ct. I don’t believe that firemen in 

New  Zealand  actually  go  to  light  fires  deliberately,  to  burn  somebody  else’s  house 

</span><span>down,  to  give  them  a  job  putting  the  fire  out.    I  do  not  believe  that  rubbish.    It  is 

incredibly stupid Mr Speaker, incredibly stupid.  Maybe that is what this Government 

does </span><span>–</span><span>light fires, burns somebody’s house down so they can give themselves a job.  I 

don’t know where the Deputy Prime Minister got his story from but it certainly is an 

</span><span>incredibly stupid story.  I believe if Government is concerned over by the fact that a 

</span><span>member  of  the  committee  is  able  to  initiate  an  investigation,  then  perhaps  the 

Chairman  ought  to  approach  the  Minister  responsible  to  inform  him  of  the 

</span><span>Committee’s  intention  to  conduct  that  investigation  of  their  own  acc</span><span>ord.    I  have  to 

confess  when  I  was  the  Minister  responsible  for  PERCA,  I  never  knew  what  they 

were going to investigate.  None of them took the trouble to tell me.  Chances are they 

would not take the trouble to tell the Minister of today unless it was a requirement of 

the law to  tell  the Minister.  Therefore, a change in  the law towards that  direction  I 

would not meet with my objection. 

</span></div><div><span>However, there is one aspect of the work of the committee that I believe needs careful 

study.    When  we  were  in  Government  it  became  apparent  that  this  committee  was 

absolutely  anxious  to  get  their  reports  into  the  public  arena  as  quickly  as  possible 

without due regard to  what  may happen to  those accused in  the report.   There is  no 

way any of the report they published could possibly be published without mentioning 

those  individuals  under  investigation.  More  often,  they  are  not.  Those  people 

investigated do not at all look very good when the report is published. I believe that is 

unfair to those under investigation and I believe we in Parliament could look at how to 

protect the rights of those individuals under investigation. Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

call on the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  you  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  Clerk,  to  all  your 

staff, Kia Orana this afternoon.  To the Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, and 

to the Caucus, Kia Orana.  Greetings to the Leader of the Opposition Sir Geoffrey and 

to Members in Opposition, Kia Orana to you all.  I would also like to extend a special 

Kia Orana to our friend the Honourable Dr Williams who is not in the House now. I 

</span><span>understand  he  is  undergoing  medical  attention  in  New  Zealand.    We  extend  to  him 

</span><span>every best wishes for a successful recovery from his operations. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>363 

</span></div><div><span>There is someone missing here.  I have not seen my friend the Honourable Paora Teiti 

who is usually the first one to start up something lively in this Parliament.  Anyway, I 

hope he is in the best of health and to our people listening in and to our visitors to our 

shores - all the best.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give my appreciation to our previous speaker the Honourable Deputy Prime 

Minister,  the  Minister  of  Tourism  and  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  Sir  Geoffrey 

Henry on their  contributions  to  this Report of PERCA.  As Minister responsible for 

PERCA, I am glad to say that I had an informal discussion with the acting Chairman 

while  the  Chairman  was  away  regarding  the  activities  of  PERCA.    I  took  note  and 

expressed appreciation for the work that has been undertaken by PERCA. I think there 

are quite a few of us who do not understand the size and extent of the work that this 

committee covers and sometimes we feel they are grossly over remunerated. 

</span></div><div><span>I am pleased to say that some of the things that we discussed covered the points that 

have  been  raised  by  previous  speakers.  I  look  forward  meeting  with  the  Committee 

when the Chairman is back. 

</span></div><div><span>As far as  I can  recall Mr Speaker  and Honourable Members, the PERCA came into 

</span><span>existence round about the time when this country was having a lot of difficulties with 

trying to adjust or put things into perspective and looking at the areas that demanded 

investigation.  Therefore, what was formed was the PERCA. I understand the National 

Development  Committee  and  perhaps  other  bodies  were  to  look  into  how  best  the 

country can be properly managed during that time of hardship our country was going 

through. 

</span></div><div><span>Whilst I appreciate the comments by the Leader of the Opposition, I would also like 

to  say  that  the  demand  for  these  bodies  including  the  MFEM  Act  changes  was 

required. In fact, it was pressured on to our Government to have these done in order 

that such bodies such as the Asian Development Bank can assist the situation. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> Not PERCA.  PERCA was before that. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I can hear some interjection from the Opposition side that 

PERCA was created before. I think the point here Mr Speaker, is that we were indeed 

troubled and the MFEM Act was certainly in relation to the ADB pressure on to our 

country.  That is what I would like to bring out that it is a lesson that we have learned 

the  hard  way  and  I  think  we  should  all  not  forget  about  that  on  both  sides  of  the 

House.  I strongly believe and strongly support the view that PERCA should continue 

to  exist  and  at  the  same  time,  I  fully  support  the  thought  that  we  should  give  them 

more  teeth.    Having  said  that,  I  would  like  to  say  that  writing  complaints  as  an 

</span><span>approach to laying people’s complaints with the PERCA is the right way to do and not</span><span>

to depend on or to leave them to initiate the investigation themselves.  I am sure this is 

something  that  we  can  bring  into  the  next  Sitting  when  we  have  time  to  prepare  an 

amendment to the betterment of the PERCA Act. 

</span></div><div><span>What is lacking Mr Speaker, in my view is that when the PERCA Report is tabled and 

</span><span>we go through like what has been said by previous speakers, it outlines the findings 

on  one  side  of  the  whole  affair.  Therefore,  in  my  view,  naturally  it  requires  the

</span></div><div><span>for an investigation.  Those are my comments, Mr Speaker.  I think PERCA has been 

doing  a  good  job  and  it  is  still  doing  a  good  job  as  a  Committee  to  safeguard  the 

important  affairs  of  our  country.    I  certainly  take  the  view  that  has  been  expressed 

from both sides that perhaps together we can come up with the best solutions for any 

amendment to the PERCA Act. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank  you Prime Minister.   I  call on the Honourable  Member for 

Oneroa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. POKINO:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, Kia Orana also to the 

staff  of  this  House.    To  all  Honourable  Members  of  this  House  and  to  our  people 

listening in to our deliberations this afternoon.  Kia Orana in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise,  Mr  Speaker,  to  give  my  view  on  this  report.    If  I  remember  correctly,  Mr 

Speaker,  the  PERCA  was  established  in  1995-</span><span>96  but  I’m  not  sure,  Mr  Speaker, 

</span><span>whether they are carrying out the functions that they were meant to do initially.  If we 

</span><span>look  at  this  report,  it  tells  us  that  they  have  investigated  some  complaints  that  were 

</span><span>given  to  them.    I  think  the  majority  was  suspicions  from  some  people  and  they 

</span><span>approached PERCA to follow these up.  I’m not certain whether that was the original 

</span><span>idea  of  why  PERCA  was  established.    I  would  have  thought,  Mr  Speaker  their 

function  would  have  been  to  audit  all  Government  expenditures  and  then  report  to 

appropriate authorities like the Financial Secretary to carry out his duty according to 

the  MFEM  Act.    As  I  see  it  what  they  are  doing  is  they  hear  rumours,  certain 

activities, then they conduct an investigation into those activities. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as we all know, I was the Minister of PERCA before the present Prime 

Minister.  During  my  tenure  as  Minister  of  PERCA,  I  think  I  only  asked  them  to 

investigate  about  three  incidents.  However,  if  you  look  at  the  number  of  reports 

presented  there  were  many  complaints  made  to  PERCA  from  interested  or  affected 

individuals.  I would have thought, Mr Speaker, what they ought to have done is at the 

end  of  the  financial  year  they  investigate  all  financial  transactions  that  the 

Government has conducted and then report to the Financial Secretary. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like at this stage to voice my concern and to point out anomalies 

concerning this committee. 

</span></div><div><span>We  know  Mr  Speaker,  that  PERCA  was  established  by  Parliament  and  PERCA  is 

directly  responsibly  to  you  as  Speaker.  Yet,  the  Minister  of  Finance  is  the  Minister 

responsible for PERCA. However, the Minister of Finance does not seem to have any 

power over PERCA.  Even if the Minister of Finance laid complaints with PERCA for 

investigation,  PERCA  investigates  as  if  an  ordinary  member  of  the  public  laid  the 

complaint.  Once their investigation is completed, they are not obliged to give a report 

to the Minister responsible and that report is directed to  you Mr Speaker.  I thought 

that  is  an  anomaly  that  should  be  looked  into.    I  had  thought  that  the  Minister  who 

</span><span>ought  to  be  the  Minister  responsible  for  PERCA  should  be  the  Minister  responsible 

</span><span>for Parliament.  However, the Minister responsible for the Audit Section of PERCA 

should be the Minister of Finance.  These are some of the matters that we should look 

into, bearing in mind that PERCA has only been in existence for three or four years.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>365 

</span></div><div><span>Like any Act, there are bound to be some anomalies and bound to be some mistakes 

that ought to be corrected.  Yes I think if there are any anomalies and any corrections 

to be made, they should be made as quickly as possible.   

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to show concern in the fact that if a person is under investigation, he 

has  no  recourse  and  he  cannot  answer  any  accusations.    I  think,  Mr  Speaker,  we 

should  make  allowances  for  him,  or  her,  to  be  able  to  defend  himself,  or  herself,  if 

PERCA should investigate that particular person.   

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  matters  that  used  to  concern  me  also  Mr  Speaker  was,  regarding  the 

publication  of  Reports.    Members  of  the  Committee  used  to  be  in  great  haste  to 

publish  the  Report  before  being  submitted  to  the  appropriate  authorities  like  you.    I 

know in the Act, the Report is to be tabled in Parliament when Parliament is sitting. 

However, that provision should be made to enable you, as recipient of that Report, to 

be able to make it public when you see fit and not when they deem it appropriate as 

they  have  been  wanting  to  do  in  the  past.    The  other  concern  is  that  we  are  not 

debating all their Reports as often as they would like.  I think, Mr Speaker, that is our 

choice.  At least the choice of Parliament.  As you know Mr Speaker, Bills are dealt 

</span><span>with urgency in the House rather than Reports.  Because Reports deal with past events 

</span><span>and  by  the  time  we  come  to  debate  it  in  the  House  all  those  events  are  forgotten.  

Therefore,  likewise  PERCA  Reports  are  dealt  with  in  the  same  manner  as  other 

Reports.  They  are  dealt  with  if  there  is  no  urgent  business  to  be  dealt  with  in  the 

House.  Well, I guess Mr Speaker, what I am trying to say is that PERCA takes their 

chances like everyone else.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

call on the Honourable Member Tupou Faireka, Member for Tupapa-Maraerenga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>  Good  afternoon  to  you  Mr  Speaker  and  good  afternoon  to  the 

Staff  of  Parliament.  Greetings  to  all  Honourable  Members  of  the  House,  the 

Government,  Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet,  and  Caucus  Members  of  Government  as 

well  as  Leader  and  Caucus  Members  of  the  Opposition.    Kia  Orana  to  our  people 

listening in on Rarotonga and the Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand up to give my support to this Report which is the Third Annual 

Report from the Audit and PERCA Office.  Within this Report Mr Speaker there are 

two  groups  of  people,  first  is  the  Audit  Group  under  the  directorship  of  Paul 

Allsworth  who  is  the  Auditor  for  Government.    Also  under  the  management  of 

PERCA, managed by Mr Mike Mitchell.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  I  stand  here  to  give  my  thanks  to  Mr  Paul  Allsworth  for  excellent 

reporting up to now.  I also wish to congratulate him for attaining his second term of 

office,  which  the  previous  Government  has  endorsed,  for  another  three  years.    Mr 

Speaker  I  stand  to  give  support  to  the  previous  comments  made  of  the  benefits  of 

setting up PERCA.   There is no doubt in my mind Mr Speaker in a PERCA Report 

that some people will be hit and some people will be disadvantaged where others will 

</span><span>appreciate it.  But let us not divert or go away from the objective of setting up PERCA 

</span><span>and that is to keep a careful watch on the administration and the spending of money in 

this country.

</span></div><div><span>Talking  about  the  Audit  Team,  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  very  appreciative  of  their  task  in 

</span><span>auditing Government Department accounts and keeping a close eye on departments ‘ 

administration of their funds to be in line with the Ministry of FEM’s Act. Because it 

</span><span>is the Audit Team that will indicate some message of investigation to PERCA for full 

investigation.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I will have to interrupt you Honourable Member.  It is time for our 

break.  The sitting is suspended until 3 p.m.
