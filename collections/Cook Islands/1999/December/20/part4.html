<div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 3.00 p.m 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Please be seated Honourable Members.  Parliament is now resumed.  

The  Honourable  Member  Tupou  Faireka  was  the  last  speaker  before  we  went  for  a 

break, please carry on Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. FAIREKA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.   I should not be long now. I was just 

</span><span>talking about the performance of the audit department.  The only disadvantage as I see 

</span><span>the performance of the audit service is that there is not enough funds to send members 

of the audit team to the outer islands to continue audit reporting on the accounts of the 

outer islands.  I think if the auditing of Government services or departments had been 

regular  as  is  the  situation  on  Rarotonga,  a  lot  of  mishandling  of  funds  of  the  outer 

islands  would  have  been  detected  earlier  than  they  have  been.    As  an  example  Mr 

Speaker the situation in Mitiaro recently where one of the public servant employees 

was  convicted  of  mishandling  some  of  those  finances.    As  a  result,  we  lost  some 

$68,000 of public funds and this staff member has been sent to gaol.  Therefore, I will 

urge  the  Government  to  please  look  into  the  problem,  especially  in  assisting  audit 

staff to make regular visits to the outer islands and to sit down with the Mayors, chief 

executive officers and public servants of that particular island.  Most of them would 

not have the experience to do accounting and management so they should go over to 

assist with the accounting of public finance and accounts.   

</span></div><div><span>Lastly,  I  would  like  to  give  my  appreciation  to  the  members  of  the  PERCA  team. 

Since their existence, they have been working very hard, they have not been deterred 

from reporting to Parliament. They were not even deterred to give a report concerning 

Government, Cabinet Members and public servants.  To prove what I am saying there 

are  some  reports  following  this  report.    We  have  read  some  of  the  reports  tabled  in 

this  House  concerning  some  services  performed  by  Cabinet  and  Government.    It  is 

good because it is reported whether their views are right or wrong and whether it is in 

line with the statutory requirements of MFEM and other statutes. However, I support 

the views aired previously that there is some amendments required to be put in place 

so  there  may  be  some  redress  for  people  who  are  being  accused  in  a  report  against 

those accusations.  With those comments, I give my full support to this report. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

</span><span>There appears to be none.  I will put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I shall not be long.  I would just 

like to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament Paper No. 15 be received and that the Rep</span><span>ort’s 

</span><span>recommendations of the Committee be acknowledged 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to put that again to you Mr Speaker: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament Paper No.15 be Received 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Do you wish to speak?  Please continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Yes please Mr Speaker.</span><span>In addition, the contents regarding

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Is there a Seconder to the Motion?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Maria Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers?    There  appears  to  be  none.    I  will  put  the  question.  The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No. 15 The Report by the Public Expenditure Review Committee 

</span><span>and Audit on the Damage to the “KUKUPA” November 1999 be Received?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 16 The Report by the Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit on

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.</span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament Paper No.16 be received and that the conclusions and

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Prime Minister.  May I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Peri Vaevae Pare. 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers?    There  appears  to  be  none.    I  will  put  the  question.  The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>368 

</span></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Paper  No.  17  The  Report  by  the  Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee  and  Audit 

into the Tattslotto Funds, November, 1999.  The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Mr Speaker, if I may ask leave from you I would like to 

move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Papers 17,18,19 and also those presented on the 16</span><span>th</span><span> of December 1999, 

being Papers 7,8,9,11,12 and 13 be all received together 

</span></div><div><span>This is a reflection of the feelings of both sides of the House that all these Papers be 

received honourably and the recommendations and conclusions be acknowledged by 

the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you Prime Minister.   Your request  is  quite unusual.    It has 

</span><span>never been done before.  However, I will ask leave of the House and if we are all in 

</span><span>agreement then your wish is my command.  I am asking the House do you agree that 

the  Motion  proposed  by  the  Prime  Minister  for  the  rest  of  the  Papers  be  put  in  one 

Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>If  I  have  a  dissenting  voice,  then  I’m  sorry  we  will  have  to  abide  by  the  Standing 

</span><span>Orders.    All  right  now,  I  am  asking  for  the  pleasure  of  the  House.    Is  there  any 

dissenting voice?  There appears to be none.  I will put that to the Clerk.  Yes, there is 

now leave granted to the House to proceed as moved by the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Leave is Granted 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Dr Woonton, Minister for Foreign Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Dr Robert Woonton 

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much.  I really don’t understand why you</span><span>are in a hurry.  It’s so cool 

</span><span>in here.  Never mind, you are all busy people.  I call on the Prime Minister</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  very  much  Mr  Speaker  for  your  indulgence.  

Yes, you are right.  As you say, I think it is unusual. However, the reason for that, Mr 

Speaker, is that you have heard comments earlier on where we were dealing with the 

</span><span>other PERCA Reports. One of the obvious points that I can see, Mr Speaker, is that 

</span><span>there is a need for PERCA as a committee and their work to be supported by  further 

amendments to the PERCA Act. That is one of the main reasons why I feel that while 

both sides agree that some of these papers have been long standing and some of the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>369 

</span></div><div><span>papers have been presented recently and for the comments made, I believe that is why 

there is a unanimous decision to support the move that these papers be received and 

acknowledged.  Therefore, there is a lot of deficiency in that, Mr Speaker, and I thank 

all  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House  for  the  co-operation  and  I  am  sure  we  can 

look  forward  to  early  next  year  to  come  back  with  something  that  will  improve  the 

PERCA Act. 

</span></div><div><span>I was going to move that we adjourn, Mr Speaker, but I will leave that to the Leader 

of the House. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Prime Minister.  I call on the Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House do now adjourn until 1.00 p.m. tomorrow, 21</span><span>st</span><span> December 

because we have eliminated all our outstanding papers and when we come back 

in the New Year we start anew 

</span></div><div><span>We will come back tomorrow if there is any further papers to be presented, we shall 

</span><span>deal with that and also our Season’s greetings</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Hon. Tangata Vavia 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers?    There  appears  to  be  none.    I  will  put  the  question.  The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I call on an Honourable Member to please lead us in prayer.
