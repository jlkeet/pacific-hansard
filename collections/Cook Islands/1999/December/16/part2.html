<div><span>PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER took the Chair at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please  be  seated  Honourable  Members.  First,  I  would  like  to 

welcome all Honourable Members back to Parliament this afternoon.  I would like to 

welcome  the  new  executive  arm  of  Parliament,  the  new  Government  and  our  new 

Opposition.  I do pray that we will be able to conduct the affairs of our country as we 

</span><span>used to before, and that God’s blessings will be upon each Honourable Member.</span></div><div><span>I have a few announcements. First, I would like on your behalf Honourable Members, 

to  acknowledge  the  passing  away  of  Mrs  Kopu  Brown  former  Secretary  of  the 

Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs.  She  passed  away  at  the  age  of  54  in  Auckland  New 

Zealand  on  Saturday  the  11</span><span>th</span><span>  of  December  this  year  and  she  was  laid  to  rest  on 

</span><span>Tuesday the 14</span><span>th</span><span> of December at her home in Karekare, Tupapa.  She is survived by 

</span><span>her  husband  Henry  Keta  Brown,  the  former  Ombudsman,  her  children  and 

grandchildren.  I am sure that the Honourable Members will join with me in extending 

our sincere condolences to Henry Brown, his family, children, grandchildren and the 

family on both sides. In particular, to the Honourable Sir Geoffrey Henry an uncle of 

the late Kopu Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, we acknowledge the visit of the Australian Members of Parliament led by 

the Hon. Gary Neale, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives of Australia. 

They visited us on the 20</span><span>th</span><span> of November through to the 4</span><span>th</span><span> of December.  The other 

members of the delegation were the Hon.  Frank  Mossfield,  the Hon. Jim  Lloyd and 

Michael Mclean, Acting High Commissioner of Australia to New Zealand. They were 

accompanied  by  Mrs  Mossfield.  Those  members  who  came  to  the  lunch our  branch 

hosted  for  these  friends  from  Australia,  I  wish  to  thank  you  very  much  for  your 

presence.    There  is  one  matter  that  was  conveyed  to  our  Branch  through  this 

delegation but that will be discussed with our Executive tomorrow.   

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  following  Honourable  Members.  The  Hon.  Tapi 

Taio, Minister of Works and the Hon. Vaevae Pare for their kind donation to make the 

bridge  at  the  back  of  the  Parliament  grounds.  Now,  you  can  see  that  we  have  a 

beautiful bridge over the drainage.  The labour was provided by the Parliament staff. 

</span></div><div><span>And  fourthly,  Honourable  Members,  I  know  that  we  feel  very  happy  this  afternoon 

coming into a cool Chamber </span><span>–</span><span> for the first time.  We thank God for this. It will make 

our work for our country more bearable and more pleasant.  And special thanks to the 

Southcold  Company  of  Tere  Tai  and  his  team  for  installing  an  excellent  air 

conditioning plant. 

</span></div><div><span>Last but  not  least,  I wish to  inform  the  Honourable Members of the appointment of 

</span><span>our new Sub-Editor of Debates, Mrs Tutai Taia Manavaroa as of the 18</span><span>th</span><span> November 

this  year.    Already  she  has  made  a  very  good  impression  on  the  family  of  the 

Legislative Service and we are very happy to have her on board.
