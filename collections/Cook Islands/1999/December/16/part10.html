</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Clause 1: Short Title. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>326 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1: Short Title stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Are there any speakers? There appears to be none. I will put the 

question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1: Short Title stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 2: Interpretation: The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2: Interpretation stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? The Leader of the Opposition Sir Geoffery Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A HENRY  K.B.E:  </span><span>Thank  you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman  I  would  like to 

</span><span>move  a  small  amendment.    That  in  the  definition  of  the  Sovereign’s  Birthday  the 

words “New Zealand” be replaced by the word “England” so that that interpretation 

</span><span>will then read as a whole </span><span>–</span><span>“The Sovereign’s Birthday” shall be the same date as the 

reigning Sovereign’s birthday as observed in England.</span></div><div><span>Now,  I  know  that  there  are  time  scale  differences  between  England  and  the  Cook 

Islands  and  New  Zealand  and  the  Cook  Islands.    But  that  should  not  shift  our 

celebration day if its 4</span><span>th</span><span>October.  If in England they celebrate the Queen’s Birthday 

</span><span>on June 4</span><span>th</span><span> it will be June 4</span><span>th</span><span> in the Cook Islands.  I have no difficulty with the fact 

that  we  are  on  different  sides  of  Greenwich  Mean  Time  because  the  Interpretation 

talks about the date, it does not talk about the day.  We know that today in England is 

in fact Thursday.  Now if the definition had talked about the day then there would be a 

conflict but this definition talks about the date.  If, therefore, England celebrates the 

birthday on June 4</span><span>th</span><span> we too will celebrate on June 4</span><span>th</span><span>.  Then, Mr Chairman, I believe 

that  she  is  the  Queen  of  England  and  she  is  the  Queen  of  the  Cook  Islands  and  the 

Queen of New Zealand, but she was born in England.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    Now  the  proposed 

</span><span>amendment  is  that  the  words  “New  Zealand”  be  replaced  by  the  words  “England”.  

</span><span>Are there any speakers to the amendment?   The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I shall be brief.  Firstly, we are opposed to the 

suggested  amendment.    What  the  former  Prime  Minister  is  proposing  is  changes  

which by tradition we have carried out ever since the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.  We 

have  been  observing  her  birthday  as  long  as  she  has  ruled  and  she  is  75  now.    We 

have  been  following  the  New  Zealand  date,  which  I  believe  is  different  to  that 

celebrated  in  England.    And  because  we  follow  the  New  Zealand  tradition  much 

closer than the English tradition the Convention is bound to follow the New Zealand 

tradition.  Mr Chairman, it is from New Zealand that our calendars are printed and our 

diaries are printed and we have always followed what the calendar states and in fact I 

</span><span>am told that the next Queen’s birthday in the New Zealand calendar will be celebrated 

</span><span>on  June  5</span><span>th</span><span>  next  year.    I  think  if  we  detach  ourselves  from  the  practice  we  have 

followed  for  the  last  75 years,  we  could  get  ourselves  into  trouble.    I  think  it  really 

depends on what date a country decides. For example, Mr Chairman, in Australia they 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>327 

</span></div><div><span>celebrate Her birthday on June 12</span><span>th</span><span> and the authority is the Collins Diary Millennium 

Edition.    There  we  go.    We  also  know  our  right  to  Her  Majesty  is  by  right  of  New 

Zealand  so  therefore  Mr  Chairman  while  we  are  pleased  to  hear  the  view  of  the 

Leader of the Opposition as persuasive as he is, common sense must prevail that we 

stick to tradition.  Therefore Mr Chairman, Government is opposed to the amendment 

suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Are  there  any 

further  speakers  to  the  amendment?    There  appears  to  be  none.    I  call  on  the 

Honourable Dr Pupuke Robati Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Chairman, before I say anything to the Bill before us, I would 

like  to  join  together  with  other  speakers  regarding  this  great  woman,  Kopu  Brown, 

who has served her country. 

</span></div><div><span>It is hard for me to accept this amendment to the Bill because I hold a New Zealand 

passport.    Just  like  what  our  constitution  has  established,  our  entry  to  England  is 

through  New  Zealand.  It  is  hard  for  me  to  accept  that  we  have  to  go  straight  to 

</span><span>England because I am sure one of these days something will go wrong.  What  I am 

</span><span>trying to say is that our people are used to our relationship with New Zealand.  Our 

people will not be happy with us so I believe we should continue with our relationship 

to New Zealand.  I feel we cannot make that adjustment  because it might go wrong 

one  day  and  because  I  hold  a  New  Zealand  passport.    So  I  ask  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition to look at this carefully maybe it is a mistake. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  upon  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, your second speech Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY,  K.B.E.    </span><span>Mr  Chairman  the  Honourable  Member  Pupuke  Robati 

</span><span>was talking about a passport and I thought he was showing us the Queen’s passport.  I 

do not see how a passport can be related to the Sovereign’s birthday.  The pas</span><span>sport we 

carry, the New Zealand passport, is according to the law. We did not create that law, 

New Zealand did that.  It is easy for New Zealand one of these days in the future to 

take the name of the Cook Islands out.  It is a very simple amendment.  All they have 

to do is pluck it out.  The foundation of the passport is not based on the foundation of 

this country.  We are creating the law for this country established on the foundation of 

this  country.    Why  should  it  go  wrong  if  we  are  establishing  our  law  to  the  day 

</span><span>England  commemorates  the  Sovereign’s  birthday.  Here  we  see  what  New  Zealand 

</span><span>celebrates on the 7</span><span>th</span><span> of June.  Australia will be on the 12</span><span>th</span><span>.  What kind of sense and 

order  is  this?    What  is  wrong  with  us  trying  to  say  in  the  day  England  establishes 

theirs.    This  is  what  we  are  trying  to  say.    If  we  do  that  there  might  be  a  mistake. 

Where can that mistake be?  Why?  Is it because Government does not accept that this 

amendment  has  no  relation  to  the  issue  of  the  passport?    What  this  amendment  is 

tryi</span><span>ng  to  say  is,  if  we  try  to  establish  the  Sovereign’s  birthday  on  the  day  England 

</span><span>does, we will never go wrong.  I will stop there. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  on  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member Ngamau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>328 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. MUNOKOA:  </span><span>Greetings to you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to the Clerk, the 

Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Members  of  the  Opposition,  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy 

Prime Minister, my Cabinet colleagues, Honourable Members on Government side. 

</span></div><div><span>Allow me Mr Chairman to speak of this dear mama Aunty Kopu.  We have heard of 

the greetings to the family of Kopu. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now come to the matter that we are debating this afternoon.  I do not agree with 

the  amendment  coming  from  the  Opposition  side.    I  believe  Mr  Speaker  that  our 

traditional practice was w</span><span>e commemorate the Queen’s birthday on the first Monday in 

the month of June.  Because that’s the day we commemorate the Sovereign’s birthday 

</span><span>so this year it will be on the 7</span><span>th</span><span>, the year after on the 5</span><span>th</span><span>, so these are the days we are 

working on, the first Monday of June.  That is what I have to say. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

There appears to be none.  I will now put the Question on the amendment as proposed 

by the Leader of the Opposition and the Amendment is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the definition of the interpretation of the Sovereign’s birthday where it says 

</span><span>New Zealand be amended by omitting the word New Zealand and replacing it 

with the word England 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Lost 

</span></div><div><span>Now back to Clause 2: Interpretation.  Are there any further speakers?  There appears 

to be none.  I will put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2: Interpretation stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 3: Days to be observed as public holidays throughout the Cook Islands 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3: Days to be Observed as Public Holidays throughout the Cook 

Islands stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers?    I  call  on  the  Member  for  Rakahanga,  the  Honourable  Dr 

Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  Just  with  regard  to  sub-clause  (2)  the  days  that  are  not  affected 

</span><span>which  are  Sunday  and  Anzac  Day.    Because  with  Sunday  I  can’t  see  Sunday  as  a 

</span><span>holiday but rather Sunday as a day of worship. 

</span></div><div><span>A few weeks ago there was a ship that was worked on a Sunday.  I think this is a bad 

</span><span>thing that has happened in our country and I think these people should think again and 

</span><span>not to work on Sunday.  I would like to ask the Minister to look into this area and if 

this happens again in the future then their licence should be revoked. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>329 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to Anzac Day, I don’t belie</span><span>ve we should have a holiday on this day. But 

rather that we should have this as a day of remembrance of our people who went away 

to  the  wars  and  also  for  these  people  who  are  not  from  our  country  who  also  went 

away to  those  wars..   I think  August  4</span><span>th</span><span> is  a  day we should celebrate from  morning 

until night.  Those are my views.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank  you.  Are there any  further speakers?  There appears to be 

none.  I call on the Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, we are proposing to  make a small amendment 

for  clarity.    You  see  we  have  heard  the  passionate  plea  of  the  Honourable  Tupou 

Faireka  about  the  effects  of  these  public  holidays  on  businesses  and  strangely  we 

found as you know, Mr Chairman, we inherited this Bill from the former Government.  

Whatever their explanation is for including Tuesday as a statutory public holiday we 

cannot understand because the real holiday should be for public servants only and we 

feel  that  it  should  be  clarified  that  instead  of  Tuesday  being  another  public  holiday 

</span><span>Tuesday ought to be a Public Service Commissioner’s holiday.  </span></div><div><span>Therefore, I propose an amendment, Mr Chairman, to add four words after the word 

</span><span>“Tuesday” which is the very last sentence to continue from the word “Tuesday” “as a 

</span><span>Public  Service  </span><span>Commissioned  holiday”.    I  repeat  that  again  just  to  add  four  more 

</span><span>words at the end of it to say . . .  If I can just read so that it would make sense.  It says 

</span><span>in the last two lines the following days. . .  I’d better read the whole clause.  “Where a 

</span><span>public  holiday  (other  than  a  Sunday  and  ANZAC  day)  falls  on  a  Saturday  or  a 

Sunday, the holiday shall  be observed on the following Monday.   If both Christmas 

</span><span>Day, Boxing Day, New Year’s Day and the day following New Year’s Day fall on a 

</span><span>Saturday and a Sunday, then those public holidays shall be observed respectively on 

</span><span>the next Monday and Tuesday as a Public Service Commissioned holiday.”  To clarify 

that.    You  don’t  get  two  public  holidays  once  after  the  other.    Therefore  the 

</span><span>amendment is as a Public Service Commissioned holiday at the end of that sentence.  

We will also make the same acknowledgment in the Schedule. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  seek  the  indulgence  of  the  House  and  yourself  to 

suspend  the  Sitting  for  about  five  minutes  to  allow  us  to  clarify  this  position.    The 

Crown Solicitor is here with us now.  I would like five minutes suspension. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Can  I  make  another 

suggestion that we suspend Clause 3 and move on to Clause 4 and when the Crown 

Solicitor is ready for the amendment to Clause 3 then we will come back to Clause 3. 

</span></div><div><span>Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Do you require me to move that Mr Chairman? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  By leave of the House,  yes  we can do that.    I  ask the House is 

there  any  objection  that  we  move  to  Clause  4?    Thank  you.    We  will  now  move  to 

</span><span>Clause 4. 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 4: Island Gospel Days 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>330 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 Island Gospel Days stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any further speakers?</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Pa Pokino, Member for Oneroa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. POKINO:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman, to the 

Honourable Members of this House and to our people listening in.  I would also like, 

Mr  Chairman,  to  give  my  condolences  to  all  those  families  who  have  suffered  in 

recent times and especially to the family of Papa Henry Brown and the family of Papa 

Joe and also to other families who have suffered recently. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a few brief thoughts Mr Chairman on this clause but in talking about Clause 4 I 

must also include the Second Schedule.  I would first like to look at sub-clause (3) of 

</span><span>Clause  4.    “In  determining  the  day  to  be  declared  as  Island  Gospel  Day  for  each 

island, regard shall be had to the wishes of the Island Council of the island affected.”</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  the  Island  Gospel  Day  was  initiated  by  Mangaia.    When  the  request 

</span><span>came for the Island Gospel Day it didn’t come from the Island Council but from the 

Orometua on the island.  So the Island Council wasn’t involved in the request.  It is 

</span><span>the  Pastors  of  the  island  that  made  the  request  through  me  as  the  GR  to  the 

Government  of  the  day.    However,  Mr  Chairman,  I  am  not  objecting  to  the  Island 

Council  being  consulted  but  I  think  the  role  of  the  Pastors  whether  Religious 

Advisory Council or Orametuas should be incorporated in this clause.  After all, Mr 

Chairman, it is Gospel Day, it is for the Orometua and not the Island Council. 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  would  like  to  come  now  to  the  Second  Schedule.    I  can’t  see  the  name  of 

Mangaia in here.  Mangaia’s name should be on top of the list because they are the 

</span><span>first island to celebrate the Island Gospel Day. 

</span></div><div><span>I am not sure whether they have been incorporated by Executive Council or whether 

they  are  being  deliberately  missed  out  here.    Whether  in  fact  they  are  deliberately 

being missed out.  I would like to ask the Honourable Jim Marurai what he is doing in 

Cabinet?  What is he doing in Cabinet to allow this to happen?  Maybe it could have 

been  missed  out  in  the  original  Law  or  whether  in  fact  we  have  been  celebrating 

illegally.    I  support  that  we  continue  to  celebrate  illegally.    The  fact  is  that  we  are 

continuing to celebrate Mangaia Gospel Day whether it is illegal or not. 

</span></div><div><span>The  role  of  the  religious  bodies  I  think  should  be  incorporated  into  the  Law  rather 

than the Island Council only.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

I call on the Honourable Member for Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman and to all 

</span><span>Honourable  Members  of  the  House.    The  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister, 

Members  of  Cabinet,  Honourable  Members  in  Government.  The  Leader  of  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>331 

</span></div><div><span>Opposition and the Members of your team Kia Orana.  Kia Orana also to everybody 

in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>First,  I  would  like  to  bring  the  love  and  condolences  from  the  three  sectors  on  the 

Island of Mauke to the family of our daughter, the Late Mrs Kopu Brown.  We would 

like to give our love and condolences although our Leader has given our condolences 

earlier but I would like to ensure that the people of the island of Akatokamanava have 

also shown their condolences and sympathy to the family.  To the family of our son, 

Papa Joe, to his wife and children and family. I would also like to bring the love and 

condolences of the people of Akatokamanava.  Kia Orana also to our people listening 

in to us this afternoon. May the Love of God be with you as well. 

</span></div><div><span>My views, Mr Chairman, with regard to Clause 4 on Island Gospel Days are along the 

same lines as those of the Member for Mangaia, because Mauke was the second island 

in  those  days  to  put  a  request  forward  before  the  Honourable  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry.  I 

had  heard  of  their  visit  to  the  Island  of  Mangaia  and  the  fact  that  he  had  given  the 

island of Mangaia its Gospel Day and I was the one who asked for the island Gospel 

Day for the island of Akatokamanava.  The people of the island were very happy that 

</span><span>he agreed with our request.  So I come back to the Clause and I am looking carefully 

</span><span>at this section in the Bill.  He assured me also that the Island  Council works closely 

with  the  Religious  Advisory  Council.    The  Religious  Advisory  Council  looks  after 

these matters today.  So I would also like the Religious Advisory Council to be added 

to this Clause and not just the Island Council. 

</span></div><div><span>In the Second Schedule as I looked at it, I thought it was a Schedule of new islands 

who have acquired their Gospel Day. However, I see that the first two islands to get 

their Gospel Days are not included and I believe this was an oversight and not done 

on purpose.  Also missing from this list are the islands of Atiu and Mitiaro I would 

like the islands of Nga-Pu-Toru to be included because they are a very important part 

of the country. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Members.    The  Honourable  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Mr Chairman, I rise because I believe if  I do not explain 

this then other Members of Parliament will stand up and give their point of view on 

this particular Clause. There is also the fact that their island has not been represented 

in this Schedule.  In Sub-clause 2, we find that this gives us the procedure of how an 

island  is  to  be  declared  to  have  an  Island  Gospel  Day  and  that  is  by  Order  by 

Executive  Council.    And  those  islands  in  the  Second  Schedule,  Aitutaki,  Penrhyn, 

Pukapuka,  Rakahanga,  and  Rarotonga  have  been  through  an  Order  of  the  Executive 

Council.  So I would like to remind Honourable Members this is how you go about it 

and that is to make a submission to the Executive Council and the Order will be made 

in Executive Council only when you have decided what day will be your Gospel Day.  

Those  are  my  views  on  that  Mr  Chairman.    We  have  also  obtained  advise  from  the 

</span><span>Solicitor General with regard to the day following New Year’s Day and Anzac Day in 

</span><span>Clause 3 (2) we have been informed that this has been modelled on a New Zealand 

</span><span>module and therefore, we do not need to amend Clause 3. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Prime Minister excuse me? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>332 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  so  I  would  like  to  ask  whether  we  can  go 

back to Clause 3 or complete Clause 4 and then go back to Clause 3.  As I said earlier 

there is no need to amend Clause 3. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Let us complete Clause 4 first then we will come back to Clause 

3.    If  there  are  no  speakers  to  Clause  4,  I  will  put  the  question.  The  Leader  of  the 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G. A. HENRY K.B.E: </span><span>Mr Chairman, I propose two small amendments to Clause 

4 (3).  In that second line of Clause 4 (3) the words regard shall be  - 

</span></div><div><span>‘You have regard of or for’</span></div><div><span>This is going to be very difficult for you to explain because we are splitting semantics 

here.  It is not English when the word to is used and the words either or for are used.  

So it is up to Government to decide whether to choose the word or, or for and correct 

what is obviously an English language mistake. 

</span></div><div><span>The second amendment I seek to propose is to take into account the wishes expressed 

by the Deputy Speaker and the Honourable Member for Oneroa.  It is a view seeking 

to  recognise  the  roles  of  the  Orometua  and  Reverends  on  the  islands  affected.    The 

proposal is up to Government to pick up from here as Government sees fit.  That after 

</span><span>the word “wishes of” the following be inserted “Religious Advisory Council and the” 

</span><span>so all that is saying when the day for Gospel Day on that island is determined then the 

wishes  of  the  Religious  Advisory  Council  on  that  island  and  the  Island  Council  be 

sought.  Of course Mr Chairman then you do not just pick any date in the same way 

Australia picked June 12</span><span>th</span><span> and New Zealand decided it to be June 7.  You do not just 

pick  any  date  you  research  and  find  out  the  actual  date  the  gospel  arrived  on  the 

island. The Religious Advisory council particularly the Ora Metua of the Cook Island 

Christian Church are much closer to research resources to obtain the actual date that 

the Gospel arrived on that island.  I support the view Mr Chairman that the church on 

each  island  should  be  part  of  the  consultation  process  on  the  date,  if  not  earlier 

finalised, is finalised. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>I  am  seeking  clarification  from  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition 

whether he wants to move an amendment as he was speaking about or whether this is 

a  suggestion  from  the  Opposition  to  Government.  You  started  off  proposing  an 

amendment  and ended by  saying  you are putting to  Government  a suggestion.  Can 

you please assist the Chair? 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY  K.B.E.</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    No  I  proposed  it  as  an 

amendment but like all amendments moved by the Opposition it is up to Government 

to  deal  with  as  it  sees  fit.    In  that  case  to  formalise  things,  I  move  the  following 

amendments to Clause 4, Sub-Clause 3. 

</span></div><div><span>That in the second line of Sub-Clause 3 the w</span><span>ord “to” be replaced by the word 

“for” after the words “wishes of the” and before the words “Island Council” the 

following be inserted:  “Religious Advisory Council and the”;</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>333 

</span></div><div><span>The  Sub-</span><span>Clause  then  Mr  Chairman  if  the  amendment  is  approved  reads:    “In 

</span><span>determi</span><span>ning the date to be declared as an Island’s Gospel Day for each island regard 

</span><span>will be had for the wishes of the Religious Advisory Council and the Island Council 

</span><span>of the island affected”.</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Will  you  please  speak  to  the 

amendment  as  proposed  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition?    The  Honourable  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Mr Chairman I stand to second the Motion and I would like 

to  say  a  few  words.    I  support  this  amendment  Mr  Chairman  because  it  was  the 

representative  from  the  Religious  Advisory  Council  who  brought  this  about.  

Therefore as a way for this House to show respect to the Religious Advisory Council 

in  order  that  these  days  become  public  holidays.  I  fully  support  this.    I  also  believe 

that the Religious Advisory Council has a very strong position in each island of this 

nation. If the position of the Religious Advisory Council is not strong on any of these 

islands, then this would be of no use.  I also believe the Island Council will not wait if 

that particular sector is  not  strong enough.  With regard to  the  amendment  from  the 

</span><span>word  “to”  to  the  word  “for,”  the  Crown  Solicitor  feels  that  there  is  not  much 

</span><span>difference between the word “to” and the word “for” but has no objection to the word 

“for” being inserte</span><span>d. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  why  I  agreed  with  this  amendment  Mr  Chairman.  Now,  our  work  will  go 

smoothly. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Are there any further speakers?  There appears to be none.  I will 

put the Question, firstly to the amendment: 

</span></div><div><span>That the word “to” be Replaced by the word “for”?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>And the second part, the amendment  is  the insertion  after the word “the” the words 

“Religious Advisory Council and the Island Council” etc. etc.    I will put the question 

</span><span>on that Amendment. The Question is:</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 4: Island Gospel Days, as amended.  Are there any speakers?  There appears to 

be none.  I will now put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 Island Gospel Days as amended stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Now coming back to Clause 3.   I will put the question again. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>334

Islands stands part of the Bill</span><span>? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  put  the  question.    I  believe  the  Prime  Minister  has  already  explained  the 

situation on this one.  The Question is:

Islands stands part of the Bill?

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 6 Repeal stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers?    There  appears  to  be  none.    I  will  put  the  question.  The
