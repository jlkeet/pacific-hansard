<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Public Holidays Bill </span><span>–</span><span> Second Reading 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, to your Clerk 

and to your Staff.  Thank you very much for making this environment a real humane 

one.  I am sure everyone in the House appreciates the cool environment we are in for 

</span><span>the start of this Session today. I am sure with the coolness of the air, we will all be 

</span><span>cool in our debate in this House.   

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to  all Members of Parliament. To the  Leader of the Opposition  and  your 

Members, Greetings.   Kia Orana to  the Deputy Prime Minister, the Ministers of the 

Crown and the Under-Secretaries of Government.  Kia Orana to you all.  Kia Orana to 

our  people  listening  in  today  and  a  special  Kia  Orana  to  the  Government  and  the 

Private Sector. 

</span></div><div><span>Before the House is the Public Holidays Bill. However, before I express my views, I 

</span><span>would  like  to  acknowledge  your  remarks  Mr  Speaker.  That  is  in  regards  to  a  very, 

very prominent lady of this country, the late Mrs Kopu Brown.  She deserves all the 

best  and  kind  words  expressed  for  her  performances  throughout  her  life  for  our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>316 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>country. I am sure I speak on behalf of everyone in this Chamber as well as the people 

of  the  Cook  Islands.    I  am  very  appreciative  of  the  organisers  of  her  funeral,  the 

procession  and  everything  associated  with  it.    She  certainly  is  a  big  loss  to  this 

country. To those other families going through bereavements, my condolences go to 

</span><span>them as well as Mrs Kopu Brown’s family and her friends.</span></div><div><span>The Bill repeals and replaces the Public Holidays Ordinance 1949. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Excuse  me  Prime  Minister?    Can  you  move  the  Motion  for  the 

Second Reading? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have the pleasure to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Public Holidays Bill  be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>As  I  said  earlier,  Mr  Speaker,  this  Bill  repeals  and  replaces  the  Public  Holidays 

Ordinance 1949 as well as re-enacting the same days which the Ordinance sets out the 

</span><span>days following New Year’s Day as new public holidays. Under the 1949 Ordinance 

</span><span>only the Constitution Day and the Cook Islands Gospel Days were carried forward to 

the following Monday if it falls on the week ends.  This coming Christmas and New 

Year</span><span>’s Day will fall on Saturday and therefore it was necessary for this to be brought 

</span><span>into the House for amendment.  We were not only concerned with Christmas and New 

Year  holidays,  we  have  also  considered  the  other  holidays  that  have  not  been 

considered in the Act which falls on Saturdays and Sundays. These should be taken in 

</span><span>lieu on Monday, similar to Christmas and New Year’s days. A few other comments 

</span><span>on this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 1 is the Short Title, there is no Commencement provisions. Therefore, the Bill 

will t</span><span>ake effect as soon as it is assented to by the Queen’s Representative.</span></div><div><span>Clause 2 of course is Interpretation and defines the various public holidays as I have 

mentioned earlier.   

</span></div><div><span>Under Clause 3, it provides National Public Holidays and those days are set out in the 

First Schedule to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span> Clause 4 provides for Island Gospel Days and those days are defined by Orders in 

Executive Council.  

</span></div><div><span> Clause 5, the Orders in Executive Council made under the 1949 Ordinance will 

continue to be in effect as if made by this Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>Clause 6 repeals the 1949 Public Holidays Ordinance, which this bill replaces.  And 

the Schedules are listed in the First Schedule which itemizes the various National 

Public Holidays. The Second Schedule lists Orders in Executive Council which were 

made under the 1949 Ordinance. These shall continue to be in force as if they were 

</span><span>made under this Bill.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>317 

</span></div><div><span>It is my understanding the Bill has been instigated by the previous Government.  And 

I do not see any delays in considering this Bill and deliberating this Bill.   I do not 

have any more to contribute. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Prime Minister.   I call for a Seconder?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Deputy Prime Minister the Honourable Norman George 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker. To you Mr Speaker and to all staff of 

Parliament, Kia Orana.  To the people of the Cook Islands, especially to our visitors 

be  they  tourists  or  our  friends  and  loved  ones  visiting  for  Christmas  and  the  New 

Year, Kia Orana to  you all. To Sir Geoffrey Henry and Members of the Opposition.  

To  our  Prime  Minister,  Ministers  of  Cabinet  and  Members  of  the  Government 

</span><span>Caucus, Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span> Mr Speaker, before I present my views on this Public Holidays Bill, I would like to 

seek your indulgence to pay tribute to a great lady.  Mr Speaker, the late Kopu Brown 

M.B.E. is  a lady of such standing that  I would place her  amongst  the top  leaders of 

this century.  Mr Speaker, you do not have to be a politician, you do not have to be 

elected, and you do not have to have a royal title to show your fineness, as this lady 

has.    Although  we  know  she  is  from  the  Kopu  Ariki,  it  is  not  that  connection  that 

made her what she is.  She is a great lady in her own right.  Mr Speaker, I will always 

remember  her  as  lady  who  was  devoted  to  this  country  that  she  did  not  leave  this 

country  to  find  greener  pastures  as  some  others  have  done.    She  has  served  this 

country well from under colonial times right up to today.  She progressed through the 

ranks of the Public Service until she became the head of a Ministry at the peak of her 

career as well as being head of our Protocol for a decade.  I am very happy to say that 

I was the one who appointed her to the position of Head of our Protocol when I was a 

Minister  in  Government.    She  would  attend  to  any  task  that  was  given  to  her  with 

painstaking thoroughness. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  she  worked  some  horribly  long  hours  away  from  her  family  and 

sacrificed so much to carry out her duties with fineness.  As Minister of the Crown, 

you  could  rest  easy  when  you  know  that  Mrs  Kopu  Brown  is  in  charge  of  any  task 

given.  As a Minister, you could rest easy that it would be successful, that it will result 

in pride being earned for this  nation under her supervision.  She was devoted to her 

uncle Sir Geoffrey Henry as Prime Minister of the country and that is a quality that I 

respected and envied.  She was also very fair and generous to us Opposition Members 

over the  years.  She  would  always make sure all  Honourable Members received the 

respect  and  dignity  that  this  Parliament  bestowed  on  them  and  she  would  not  allow 

anyone to feel unwanted or unrespected under her supervision.   

</span></div><div><span>She excelled in everything she did. Be it netball, community work - particularly in the 

Takuvaine  community,  and  be  it in  the  church. Whatever  role  she  was  charged,  she 

carried  them  out  with  distinction.    Such  is  the  love  that  we  all  have  for  her.    She 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>318 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>would have had probably one of the largest funeral we have witnessed in this country 

for a long, long time.  Mr Speaker, we have lost one of the staunch supports of this 

</span><span>country.    We  have  lost  a  giant  “</span><span>tamanu”</span><span>  tree  that  gave  us  shelter,  protection  and 

coolness in her lifetime.  May her great memories remain with all of us in this House 

who knew her.  May I take this opportunity to extend our condolences and those of 

my  wife  and  I  to  Henry  Brown,  his  children  and  grandchildren,  all  the  families  on 

both sides.  May God comfort and bless you all.  As the Prime Minister said earlier, I 

also  extend  my  message  of  condolences  and  comfort  to  all  the  other  families  who 

have lost loved ones recently. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  support  this  Bill  before  us  wholeheartedly.    Anybody  who  does  not 

support a Public Holiday Bill should be declared an enemy of the state.  Anyone who 

does  not  support  a  Public  Holiday  should  go  to  Bosnia  or  Kosovo  or  one  of  those 

troublesome places.  I thank the Prime Minister for presenting it and I am quite sure 

there will be overwhelming support for it.   

</span></div><div><span>While we are on the subject, may I take this opportunity to remind ourselves that there 

are people who will be working right through the Public Holidays. There are devoted 

</span><span>people who have to keep the hospital running, the Police service running, the Prison, 

</span><span>the Power Station, the hotels and motels and our thoughts should go to them while we 

are  considering  the  happiness  of  the  majority.    My  mind  also  goes  to  those  people 

who work. To the shopkeepers, the restaurant workers and all those who are involved 

in the service industry.  I hope your employers pay you well for working right through 

the holidays. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it troubles  me when workers  come  to  my office complaining about  the 

fact that they are not properly paid; when they work on weekends and public holidays.  

A lot of these are creeping up from hotel and some shops.  These are  matters of grave 

</span><span>concern to Government.  Our industrial laws are not up to date.  I know the Workers’ 

</span><span>Association is concerned about this.  I would like to see our employers display some 

good  will  during  the  period  by  doing  something  themselves  rather  than  waiting  for 

Government to straighten them up.  There is no excuse why there should be an abuse 

</span><span>of workers’ rights.  All the hotels are full to capacity, they are overflowing right now 

</span><span>and I would like to see some initiatives happening over the holiday period.  One of the 

things I would like to make clear is that this Government will be reviewing the Labour 

laws. We want to make sure the correct rates are paid and at the same time be mindful 

of the rights of the employer to make sure that both sides can work and survive.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  working  conditions  of  some  of  our  people  and  their  pay  rates  are 

shocking. It is embarrassing to see it happen right before our eyes and it is something 

I urge this Government to review in the New Year. To ensure that we work alongside 

both  parties  -  the  employers  and  the  workers.    We  need  to  make  sure  that  a  better 

standard  is  reached  and  that  we  no  longer  turn  a  blind  eye  to  it.    I  want  to  make  it 

quite clear that while we are concerned of the rights of the workers, they have to make 

sure  they  are  paid  for  the  work  they  do.  I  am  concerned  with  the  rights  of  the 

employers which we must also ensure that their business does well at the same time. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, that is all I have to say about this Bill.  I totally support it in its entirety.  

Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>319 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  I call on the Honourable Tom 

Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you,  to  the  staff  of 

Parliament  and  to  all  the  Honourable  Members.    Greetings  also  to  our  people  who 

have  taken  the  time  to  listen  to  the  debate  this  afternoon.    In  case  you  think  I  have 

forgotten, I would like to greet the new Deputy Speaker the Honourable Papa Mapu 

Taia for the honour bestowed on him by being elected Deputy Speaker this afternoon.  

I believe, as displaced by the Speaker himself, you will bring credit to the office of the 

Speaker. Both in terms of credibility as well as being fair in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  congratulate  you  also  for  having  the  foresight  to  ensure  that  the 

environment  that  the  Prime  Minister  was  boasting  about  a  while  ago  is  an 

environment  conducive  and  acceptable  to  the  work  that  we  do  in  this  House.  

</span><span>However,  I  don’t  want  to  hear  anybody  i</span><span>n  the  future  trying  to  claim  that  credit. 

Sometimes, Ministers would like to try and claim such a credit.  This is your baby Mr 

Speaker  and  we  all  accept  that  it  was  under  your  foresightedness  that  we  got  the 

pleasant environment today. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the second matter I wanted to speak on was about the late Kopu Brown, 

</span><span>but having listened to the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, I don’t think I should 

spoil  it.  Because  in  my  summary  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister’s  address,  which  he 

</span><span>submitted  to  us  so  eloquently,  represents  the  views  of  every  single  member  of  this 

</span><span>House. I don’t think I should go and spoil it.</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you Tom. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:</span><span>  But  allow  me  the  opportunity  to  say  one  little  sentence  in 

addition  to  the  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Mini</span><span>ster’s  well  put  statement.    The  late 

</span><span>Kopu  Brown  as  I  knew  her  possessed  exceptional  organisational  skills  and  she  was 

one of a kind. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  coming  back  to  the  Bill  before  the  House.    I  looked  through  the  Bill 

today surprised that there was a need for such a Bill.  So, naturally, what was going 

through my mind was to ask what the hidden agenda is. Is there a hidden agenda?  I 

</span><span>couldn’t find any.  I am still not sure whether there is something that I have missed.  

</span><span>Because you see, Mr Speaker, whilst I have a lot of faith in most of the Members on 

</span><span>the  Government  side,  I’ve  got  to  be  wary  about  one  or  two  of  them.    You  see  they 

</span><span>might  just  try  to  sneak  in  something  that  on  the  surface  of  it  looks  good  but  on  the 

back there might be something sinister.   Therefore, Mr Speaker, what I am bound to 

say  on  this  Bill,  hopefully  will  not  lead  me  to  being  labeled  an  enemy  of  the  State 

because the Bill does look quite straightforward and innocent.   

</span></div><div><span>However, Mr Speaker, when you talk about public holidays.  The question is how do 

you  interpret  a  public  holiday.    Because  in  my  interpretation  such  days,  especially 

Good Friday, is more holier than a Sunday.  This was supposed to be the day that Our 

</span><span>Lord  and  Saviour  Jesus  Christ  died.  Therefore,  we  should  celebrate  and  honour  the 

</span><span>day that He died which in my view is more holier than any other day.  And whilst we 

</span><span>squabble over things  happening on Sundays, we don’t seem  to  squabble over things 

</span><span>happening on Good Fridays.  If our trading businesses and shops close down on other 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>320 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>public holidays such as Sundays, how do you compare that with Good Fridays? Some 

shops do open I believe on Good Fridays. Now if Christmas or public holidays fall on 

a weekends, the question is, why is it necessary now then to celebrate Christmas on a 

Saturday and then declare Monday and Tuesdays public holidays as well? 

</span></div><div><span>You see, Mr Speaker, what I am trying to say is whilst we have celebrated Christmas 

on a weekend before, there is no need to celebrate again on Monday and Tuesday. We 

are penalising our business people, our business community by not allowing them to 

trade  on  the  Monday  and  Tuesday.    I  feel,  Mr  Speaker,  whilst  not  celebrating  the 

opportunity  to  have  extra  holidays  on  Mondays  and  Tuesdays  in  this  instance,  this 

Christmas coming especially, I look at our business community and see the loss that 

they  would  incur  in  having  to  double  pay  their  staff  who  may  wish  to  work  on 

Mondays and Tuesdays. 

</span></div><div><span>These  are  service  businesses.  These  are  no  different  from  the  hotels  and  the  other 

service  businesses,  except  if  they  are  to  open  on  Mondays  and  Tuesdays  while  we 

declare  these  as  public  holidays,  then  they  have  to  double  up  the  pay  for  their  staff 

working on those days. 

</span></div><div><span>I also take up the point raised by the Deputy Prime Minister in regards to the structure 

of pay, the inadequacy in some places of staff pay and the need for a review.  I think if 

the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister is genuine about what he is saying, then they 

should look at the Committee which was set up by our Government.  They can look at 

the cost of living and such other matters as staff pays. Their Terms of References are 

relevant to what we are talking about today. 

</span></div><div><span>That is all I want to speak at this time Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  for  the  next  speaker.  The 

Honourable Member, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Clerk, Kia Orana also 

to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, to all Cabinet Ministers and to the 

Caucus of the new Government.  Kia Orana to you all in the name of Our Lord. Kia 

Orana also to all the Members on the beach side. To the Opposition Members, to our 

Leader, the Honourable Sir Geoffrey Henry, to all Members of the Opposition and to 

our two Members who are not with us today, Kia Orana to them as well. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  join in  giving my  congratulations  to  our new Deputy Speaker  </span><span>–</span><span>  Kia Orana to 

you Sir and may you serve well and be a good Deputy Speaker for our House. 

</span></div><div><span>I  extend  special  Greetings  to  the  people  of  the  Cook  Islands,  to  the  people  on  the 

island of Rarotonga and to the people in the Outer Islands.  Kia Orana to you all in the 

name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like through you Mr Speaker to give my condolences to the family of the 

</span><span>late Mrs Kopu Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>This  lady  is  from  my  electorate  of  Tupapa-Maraerenga.    I  would  like  to  extend 

condolences  from  myself,  my  wife  and  our  family,  and  the  people  of  the  village  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>321 

</span></div><div><span>Tupapa-Maraerenga,  the  Ui  Ariki,  the  Ui  Rangatira  and  all  the  people  we  send  our 

condolences  to  Papa  Henry  Brown  and  family.  We  have  heard  all  the  words  of 

condolences  that  has  come  forth  for  her  in  sports  and  Government  and  also  the 

Church  and  works  that  she  did  in  her  life.    I  am  certain  Mr  Speaker  the  C.I.C.C. 

Ekalesia of Avarua will miss this woman because every year when the Pure Epetoma 

is  held  she  never  misses  representing  the  Government  in  this  week  of  prayer.    This 

was something that she did willingly on behalf of Government over the years and as 

we  are  all  aware  in  a  couple  of  weeks  it  is  the  week  of  prayer  and  the  Church  will 

miss her because she has done this for many years on behalf of Government.  So may 

the  Lord  bless  her  and  help  her  on  her  way  and  be  with  her  husband  and  family  as 

they remain. 

</span></div><div><span>I will come back now, Mr Speaker, to the Bill, the first Bill that this new Government 

has brought before the House.  I would like to give my support to this Bill because we 

have  discussed  a  lot  on  the  holidays  that  have  been  listed,  while  we  were  in 

Government.  I think one important area here is the fact that some of the holidays that 

have been listed here were not in the 1949 Ordinance, as far as if these holidays were 

to follow on the week end, Saturday or Sunday, that we move or commute to Monday.  

</span><span>So,  what  we  will  be  doing  with  this  Bill  is  to  ensure  that  any  holiday,  except  for 

</span><span>Anzac  Day  that  follows  on  a  Saturday  or  Sunday,  will  be  celebrated  on  Monday  or 

Tuesday.    I  have  been  thinking,  Mr  Speaker,  what  actually  is  the  reason  for  not 

including  Anzac  Day  into  this  Bill.    I  understand,  Mr  Speaker,  this  practice  we  are 

adopting now is set on overseas precedent but should we follow overseas precedents? 

</span><span>Shouldn’t we create our own justification? The people who attended these Wars are 

</span><span>our  own  blood.  Our  own  people,  our  own  parents,  our  own  grandfathers.    Some  of 

them died for us.  Could not we be more proud to have that celebration where it falls 

on  a  Saturday  or  Sunday  but  be  carried  forward  to  Monday  or  Tuesday?    I  am  just 

pondering those thoughts Mr Speaker because it might be too late for this Bill but  I 

think we should be thinking of the merit of doing something for our people.  

</span></div><div><span>There is also one other observation in regards to the second day that has been declared 

as a public holiday.  You see, Mr speaker, before this Order, the second day of a New 

Year is usually a Commission Holiday.  It is a holiday only for Public Servants.  But 

under this  Bill  we are making it a Public Holiday  that means the private sector will 

have  to  pay  their  employees  this  extra  day.    I  am  curious  to  know  whether  the 

Chamber of Commerce  has been  consulted about  this and if they have had an input 

into this Bill.  I can hear some comments from the other Side that it is our Bill.  The 

Intention that we looked at the Bill we were to leave it as a Commission Holiday for 

the Public Servants.  Believe you me Mr Speaker, the Public Servants themselves will 

plead for this holiday.  If this Paper has been discussed I for one will support it and I 

would have said they would have supported it is a holiday for them paid by the public 

purse.  But you put that issue to the public enterprises and it is going to be a different 

answer. Because if a small business is paying a $1000 a day for an employee he will 

</span><span>have  to  pay  another  $1000  a  day  for  that  extra  day.    Mr  Speaker,  the  country’s 

</span><span>development is going up we should not be stifling that development.  There are some 

money provided through good business, let the business enjoy that and put that money 

</span><span>back into the business.   Government  should not tell  businesses where to  spend their 

</span><span>money.    I  would  have  preferred  if  we  had  struck  that  provision  as  a  public  service 

holiday.    The  Public  Service  Commission  to  give  this  holiday  which  is  optional  to 

businesses  whether  they  open  their  business  on  the  second  day  of  the  New  Year  or 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>322 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>not.  However, Mr Speaker, I strongly support the merit of this Bill in giving public 

holidays  in  relation  to  Gospel  Days  and  Religious  Days  as  we  have  in  the  Cook 

Islands.  As these Gospel Days have become culturally accepted into our custom and 

we should support as we have supported and celebrate the arrival of the Gospel to our 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I will have to interrupt you Honourable Member it is time to have a 

</span><span>break so I suspend the Sitting until 3 o’clock.</span></div><div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED AT 2.30 p.m.</span></div>
