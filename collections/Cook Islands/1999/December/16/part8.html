<div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 3.00 P.M. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>The sitting is resumed.  Please be seated.  I call on the Honourable 

Tupou Faireka Member for Tupapa Maraerenga.  You were the last speaker and you 

have three more minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have a very brief message to say with 

</span><span>regard to the Bill before the House.  I would like to give my full support to the Public 

</span><span>Holiday to commemorate our Constitution date because this was the day we took over 

the  administration  of  our  country.    This  was  a  great  day  for  us  hence  I  strongly 

support it.  I would like to make an appeal to the people of the Cook Islands to come 

together on that day and celebrate this great day when we took over administration of 

our own affairs.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I now call upon the Leader of the 

Opposition the Honourable Sir Geoffrey Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E.</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you and to all of us 

who  are  getting  together  in  this  Honourable  House  to  carry  out  the  responsibilities 

given to us by our people.  Greetings to the Honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime 

Minister, Cabinet Ministers and the rest of the Honourable Members in Government 

and to us also on the Opposition side.  I extend my greetings to our people who are 

listening to our debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>First,  I  would  like  to  say  thank  you  to  everybody  for  the  words  of  condolence 

regarding our daughter Kopu Brown. I believe also the House will join with me and 

the children and family in showing our appreciation for the words of encouragement 

and condolence we have received in the midst of our Parliament today.  Like it was 

said, she was a hard and dedicated worker, she was very consistent in carrying out the 

responsibilities given to her, she has departed from this life leaving a great vacuum.  I 

believe there are few amongst us who will be able to carry out the responsibilities she 

has left behind. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like also at this time to congratulate the Deputy Speaker we have appointed 

today.  To you Honourable Member, congratulations and I wish you well in the new 

</span><span>career  given  to  you.  I  have  heard  that  your  people  were  going  to  appoint  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Member  from  Rakahanga  Dr  Robati  to  be  the  Deputy  Speaker.    Why 

</span><span>didn’t he take the position of Deputy Speaker if he was looking forward to take over 

</span><span>the position of Speaker. I have my suspicions as to why he did not take the position of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>323 

</span></div><div><span>Deputy  Speaker  was  because  the  Leader  of  the  House  has  a  higher  salary.  He  is 

saying he was thinking along that same line.  There are those people who can handle 

the responsibility like the Member from Vaipae/Tautu or Papa Peri.  The Honourable 

Member  Tapi  Taio  will  not  be  able  to  make  himself  available  because  he  will  be 

sailing  on  the  boat  and  who  will  grow  our  cabbages  if  Robert  takes  over  this 

responsibility.  So I thought Mr Speaker that the nomination was in order that is we 

are all behind to support his appointment. 

</span></div><div><span>A brief message to you Sir. As you sit in the chair, you are in now, you are a Demo 

and you are a member of that Party. However, if you sit in the seat of the Speaker, you 

do not  belong to  any Political  Party but  to  this House. You must be neutral.  This  is 

what I request of you. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now move on to the Public Holidays Bill before the House.  I rang the Clerk 

and asked what do we have for business.  He said what he knows is the only one that 

is the Public Holidays Bill.  Only today did I see a copy of the Bill.  I asked myself 

why this Government has chosen the Public Holidays Bill as the first subject for their 

coming  to  power.    Will  this  Bill  become  a  support  to  the  economy  of  this  country?  

</span><span>What  is  the  benefit  to  be  derived  out  of  this  first  Bill  to  come  in  that  need  to  be 

</span><span>adopted.    I  have  thought  about  this  and  I  am  also  thinking  will  this  lot  be  able  to 

support the reform programme we have started in this country.  The numerous things 

we  have  looked  into  for  reform  in  our  country  they  did  not  look  at  them  but  they 

looked at this one </span><span>–</span><span> Public Holidays.  What will this law bring to benefit our country 

in  support  of  the  Health  Department,  also  the  Education  and  Public  Health  of  the 

people.  In order for this Bill to become the first one this Government brought into the 

House, what benefit do we get out of it?  Mr Speaker I read this and I still keep on 

asking  myself,  why?    When  I  thought  about  this,  maybe  this  is  something  that  has 

come out  into a move leading this Government  to  go on a public holiday at  Te Atu 

Kura.  We have heard the Deputy Prime Minister say there will be a celebration at Te 

Atu Kura.  Maybe during the process they got drunk and they made another holiday.  

They were excited and the Honourable Norman George formulated an announcement 

to say there will be a public holiday tomorrow and the people were angry.  They were 

the only ones who were drunk too. They were the only ones who were happy. 

</span></div><div><span>And  this  is  what  the  dear  mother  has  said  </span><span>–</span><span>  I  went  to  see  her  for  Maori  medicine.  

Well  this  is  what  she  said.    Tomorrow  will  be  Friday.    I  will  be  going  to  the  Post 

</span><span>Office to get some money and why didn’t they make that preparation well before. </span></div><div><span>I thank the Manager of the Post Office because she was the only one who didn’t listen 

</span><span>to this silly announcement.  She came and carried out the work at the Post Office to 

pay the people their old age pension and she has carried out the responsibility of the 

</span><span>little  words  that  say  “People  First”  because  the  DAP  Government  forgot  that  their 

motto was “People First”.  Maybe because of this silly move that they have taken to 

</span><span>call a holiday at that time, that is why they brought this Bill for a public holiday into 

the House. 

</span></div><div><span>It  says  the day  following  New Year’s Day shall mean the second day  of January  in 

</span><span>each  year.    The  day  after  the  New  Year’s  Day,  that  is  the  2</span><span>nd</span><span>  January.    I  asked  my 

grand daughter when  I  went  out  to  get  my papers and they were  eating  mangoes.   I 

</span><span>asked her what is the New Year’s Day.  She said January 1</span><span>st</span><span>.  What is the day after the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>324 

</span></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>New  Year’s  Day?    January  2</span><span>nd</span><span>.    Why  Papa?    I  waved  to  her  as  I  went  in  the  car.  

Maybe  these  words  were  not  put  in  there  by  the  Ministers.    Because  my  grand 

daught</span><span>er  knows  that  the  day  after  the  New  Year’s  Day  is  the  2</span><span>nd</span><span>  January  and  they 

</span><span>brought this message into this House.  It’s as if we don’t know what is the day after 

New Year’s Day.  I don’t know whether these Ministers are trying to fool us.  I don’t 

</span><span>know whether the lawyers are trying to make a fool of the Ministers.  I may become 

so childish as to what is written here.  If the Prime Minister should see this he should 

</span><span>go and strangle the lawyer’s neck.</span></div><div><span>And also further on it says the Gospel Day is this day.   It says Christmas Day is the 

25</span><span>th</span><span>  December  </span><span>–</span><span>  good.    Boxing  Day  shall  be  the  26</span><span>th</span><span>  day  of  December  and  then 

</span><span>untidiness came in.  It says the Sovereign’s birthday shall be the same date as that the 

reigning  Sovereign’s  birthday  is  observed  in  New  Zealand.    Wh</span><span>y  do  we  have  to 

follow New Zealand?  The Sovereign  </span><span>–</span><span> was she born in New Zealand?  The Queen 

was  born  in  England  and  we  will  carry  out  our  commemoration  on  the  day  that 

England has commemorated it.  If they are doing this, they should be doing theirs and 

we should be doing ours.  If the lawyer drafted this Bill, his neck should be strangled. 

This also applies to Good Friday and Easter Monday.  It is saying on both days shall 

</span><span>be  the  same  date  in  each  year  as  observed  in  New  Zealand.    Why  do  we  have  to 

</span><span>follow </span><span>New Zealand?  Why don’t we say the day that we observe will be the day that 

</span><span>the Religious Advisory Council has established.  Why do we have to follow like this? 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I observe Mr Speaker what is the benefit that this Bill is brought into the 

House  </span><span>that  will  bring  benefit  to  our  country.    I  don’t  see  any.    When  I  look  at  this 

</span><span>deeply, I see that we are only following the footsteps of others but this is what I have 

to  say.  If  we  are  going  to correct  the  words in  here then  I  will support.   This  is  the 

g</span><span>eneral principle and the merits and principle I don’t support.</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank  you Honourable Member.   I now  call for the next  speaker.  

There appears to be none.  I call on the Prime Minister to reply. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank  you Mr Speaker.  I rise in response to the support 

and a comments made by the various speakers. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the difference that will happen up to 8, 9, 10 years to come but what I have said 

earlier,  some  of  these  will  come  into  effect  at  the  end  of  this  Christmas  and  New 

Y</span><span>ear’s period.  Because of the urgency of this Bill, hence I agreed. I believe that this 

</span><span>Bill has been under the arm of the former Government so we thought we would bring 

it in here so that we should all look at it. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  in  response  to  the  comment  made  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition 

regarding  a  public  holiday  that  we  have  declared  just  lately.    I  would  like  to  assure 

you, Mr Speaker, that there were no drunkards. There was nobody out of their minds 

on the night because I just want to say to  you, Mr Speaker, as for myself I have no 

</span><span>place to  sit so  I  was  walking all over the place.   This  showed that there  were many 

</span><span>people out there at Te Atukura with their request to call for a public holiday.  Because 

of the excitements that night, they felt that they should continue with the celebration.  

I agree with their request because this is the first time they were able to settle down 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>325 

</span></div><div><span>and  relax  after  the  pressure  of  the  political  turmoil.  You  would  agree  with  me  Mr 

Speaker, that the people were so confused at the time and they were raising questions 

about the situations in our country.  I just want to make the people feel that everything 

is  at  peace now in  order for them to  go home and relax with   a feeling of freedom.  

The public holiday that was declared was fit</span><span>ting to the theme of “People First”.</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  also  to  say  to  you  Mr  Speaker,  there  were  a  number  of  Cook  Islands 

Party supporters who were happy with that decision. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe  when  we  go  through  the  Clauses  Mr  Speaker,  we  may  have  some  good 

contributions  and  the  need  to  amend.  If  it  is  appropriate  then  I  will  agree  on  that.  

There is one thing I would like to make known, Mr speaker. I would like to make it 

known that we should revive our Standing Committees.  What we want to see is the 

Bills  Committee,  the  Business  Committee,  the  Standing  Orders  Committee  and 

everything should be given to these Committees because we do not have time to look 

at  these  things  individually.    In  order  for  these  Committees  to  look  at  the  Bills 

carefully  before  they  are  presented  into  this  House.    There  are  other  issues  that  we 

need to look at.  As the Leader of the Opposition has raised, if there is any change and 

</span><span>I see that the changes are in order I have no problem.   

</span></div><div><span>There  are  other  matters  that  we  need  to  look  at  carefully.  This  is  the  one  of  those 

things we need to debate and approve. That is why we have presented this Bill into the 

House.  There are other Bills that have been prepared by the previous Administration 

and  we  are  putting  them  all  together  and  in  due  time  we  will  bring  them  into  the 

House  to  be  debated.    Because  the  committee  has  not  had  the  time  to  look  at, 

including the Public Holidays Bill which is very important, that is why we brought it 

in  early.    There  are  other  important  Bills  that  are  not  ready  yet  to  be  presented  and 

because  there  is  only  a  small  amendment  to  this  Bill  that  is  why  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister recommended that this Bill be presented. I hope that this will settle the mind 

of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  especially  in  hastily  conveying  this  Bill  into  the 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Prime Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Public Holidays Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
