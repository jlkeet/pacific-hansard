<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable  Members,  that  completes  the  Second  and  Third 

Readings of the Public Holidays Bill.  The Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker. I am excited and happy to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Rarotonga Environment (Amendment) Bill be Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>I am so overwhelmed with the spirit of goodwill and co-operation coming from both 

sides  of  the  House,  so  that  this  simple,  simple  amendment  to  the  Environment  Act 

should enjoy a very good passage in this House tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>This Bill deals with a minor glitch in the administration area of the Environment Act.  

I guess we are getting close to the limit of today bu</span><span>t I just thought Iâ€™d better start the 

</span><span>ball rolling on. I believe my friends in Opposition have some interesting observations 

to  make  on  this  tomorrow  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  their  well  thought  out 

considerations on this tomorrow.  They have tonight to sharpen their knives, forks and 

spades for tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  It  is  time to  stop.  Before  I  call  on the adjournment  Motion, I ask 

you Honourable Members to  please remember that at  5 p.m.  tomorrow is  our AGM 

followed immediately after that by the Executive Meeting.  Thank you.  I call on the 

Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House do now Adjourn until 1:00 p.m. tomorrow 

Friday the 17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>The intention was that we suspend now until 7 p.m. and then we meet until 10 p.m. 

but  because  we  have  worked  so  well  and  hard  to  day,  also  that  some  Members  are 

intending to go to this big show tonight this is why we will adjourn now.  Maybe if 

we do the same thing next week we will not need to meet in the evenings. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Matavera Mr Peri Vaevae Pare 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>337 

</span></div><div><span>I put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I call on an Honourable Member to close our meeting with a prayer. 

</span></div>
