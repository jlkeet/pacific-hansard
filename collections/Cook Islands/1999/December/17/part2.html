</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Please be seated Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to all Honourable Members who are present in this Chamber this afternoon. 

I am grateful to see all Honourable Members gathered in this House again.  We would 

like  to  thank  the  servant  of  God  Elder  Totini  who  conducted  our  devotion.    I  have 

forgotten to mention the name of the preacher yesterday Danny Mataroa, so we would 

like to thank both of them. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to remind all Honourable Members about our dress code when we come 

in to Parliament.  We should be dressed in the proper manner and not just for the sake 

</span><span>of wearing a suit without the shoes.  Unless you have a sore on your foot then you are 

</span><span>excused.  This is the standard required of us. If you have other standard then that is 

your decision.
