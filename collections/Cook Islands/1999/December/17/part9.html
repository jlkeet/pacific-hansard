<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>Because  as  you  can  all  remember  when  there  was  an  oil  spill  in  the  harbour  I  was 

blamed that it came off my ship, but about two months later they started to find leaks 

in the pipelines from Triad but I got the blame for it. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to tell you about the problems I am having with a house that I would 

like to build on a hill. It has now been two years and I have had nothing but trouble 

from the Department.  When I went to ask them what the delay was they told me that 

</span><span>they wanted an engineer’s report because according to them this mountain or this hill 

</span><span>was sitting on ash and the hill would move.  This is the report that they gave me and it 

cost me just under $4,000.  Is this what you are saying is good for us, the little people?  

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>352 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>There are the good areas, there are also the bad areas and this is one of the bad areas 

they gave me. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like us to look at this person that we are talking about.  As we all know there 

is always a better person because we can't put our faith in just one person otherwise 

you are then underestimating the others.  When I was having these problems with the 

Environment Service one of the members rang me and talked to me about it and told 

me that your problem is not with me, your problem is with the Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>I cannot blame him because he is my neighbour. I feel that is why he had a problem 

with  it.    I  am  happy  with  the  person  you  have  elected  because  of  the  problems  we 

have encountered in the past and we know that this is holding up the progress of the 

development our country.  I have known a lot of people who have told me that they 

are  aware  of  the  problems  and  some  of  them  have  tried  and  failed  with  this 

Environment Service. I know the Banks are ready to assist these people to build their 

homes on the hills but because of this service, this is not happening.  So I would like 

to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to remind the person that is appointed to look into 

this area and help the little people out there and make sure they do not encounter the 

</span><span>problems I have.  I am aware that this Service has a very large Budget and I also know 

</span><span>their workers are sitting around.   

</span></div><div><span>My  wife  one  day  was  going  to  help  to  collect  cans  with  the  Girl  Guides  and  I  said 

look those are the people trying to hurt us and you are going out to help collect their 

</span><span>cans.  I am not surprised now that I hear they have MA’s and PHD’s</span><span> and that is why 

</span><span>my wife ended up collecting cans for them!  So I’d like to ask you to look into this 

</span><span>area. Money is being wasted. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

The Prime Minister, the Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>   Thank you Mr Speaker.  I was not going to speak but due 

to the comments that we are afraid of the Deputy Prime Minister, I rose to comment.  

The truth is the Deputy Prime Minister is afraid of us.  Because we are all aware that 

there was a workshop held in Europe and five people went from this Ministry and we 

would like to ask how this happened.  There were five of them that went and we heard 

that they travelled First Class.  Who stayed back to work?  Who is responsible?  These 

are the things we were disappointed with the Deputy Prime Minister. We told him to 

look into this area and fix it, because if he does not we will get rid of this service.  The 

people have been talking about this and we are wondering why five people went from 

this Service.   

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I rose because of the comment that we enjoy sacking people.  We all know 

who the champions have been in the last few years.  Nearly two thousand Government 

workers were sacked.  Who did that?  Not us. Therefore, I do not like the fact that we 

are  being  criticised  for  sacking  people.    I  do  not  like  that  because  our  people  have 

already  been  hurt.    In  regards  to  this  Amendment  before  the  House  Puai  Wichman 

</span><span>agrees with it because in his statement he said he will not step down unless the Act is 

</span><span>changed so  we are doing the right  things for him.  I cannot  see what  the problem  is.  

We are doing what he requested, we are changing the Law so he will step down. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>353 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, if he is listening this afternoon, I would like to tell him we are doing this 

for  him.    I  agree  also  with  the  statements  made  by  the  Honourable  Tom  Marsters 

when he told us that he forwarded his resignation. I would like to thank him today for 

putting in his resignation. Whether we thought  of reappointing him or not is not the 

point.  This is the good thing about the Convention that he has talked about because 

he understood that when a new Government  comes in,  these special  posts would be 

looked at and I would like to thank him for what he did. 

</span></div><div><span>These are my views Mr Speaker. I thank everybody for their points of views and ask 

the  Opposition  not  to  talk  about  sacking  because  they  are  the  champions  in  that 

regard.  What we have brought to this House is a special response made by Puai and 

that is what has been done. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Prime  Minister.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

There appears to be none.  I will call on the Minister in Charge of the Bill to reply. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker  I  would  like  to  extend  my  gratitude  to  all  the 

Members in the House who spoke on the Bill.  In particular I would like to thank my 

</span><span>friends in  the Opposition  for the manner in  which they spoke with  passion and fire.  

</span><span>One  can  always  tell  a  new  Opposition,  suddenly  their  humanity  and  passion  arrives 

after ten years of absence when they were in Government. They have no feelings then 

but now it has all come back.  I also thank the Leader of the Opposition for his views 

and  I  want  to  assure  him  that  there  is  no  fear  in  our  Cabinet.  All  you  see  in  our 

Cabinet  are  happy  faces  when  the  combined  Cabinet  and  Caucus  come  together  to 

discuss the serious business of running this country.   I also want to assure this House 

that  the  trust  in  which  my  colleagues  in  Government  have  given  me  will  not  be 

misplaced  because  the  power  they  have  given  me  will  be  used  with  iron 

determination.  I am used to possessing power when I was a police officer. I had the 

</span><span>power to enter anyone’s homes without warrant.  I am used to possessing power and 

</span><span>not abusing it.   

</span></div><div><span>The  existing  provision  in  the  Environment  Act  requires  the  consensus  of  Cabinet 

when  a  new  appointment  is  made  to  the  Board.    So  there  is  still  that  restriction 

because  I  cannot  go  sacking  anybody  without  seeking  the  consensus  of  Cabinet 

because  I  need  their  approval  to  appoint  a  new  member.    Mr  Speaker,  my  solemn 

hope is that this provision will never ever be used.  In moving on, let me also say this. 

It is quite true what the Honourable Member Tom Marsters said and I feel that I was 

remiss in not inviting him into my office. But because of the pressure of work in front 

of me at the time I did not have the opportunity and I apologise to Puai for that.     

</span></div><div><span>I have no personal differences with the man and to me as I explained in the beginning 

this is just a change of team because our team wishes to see some changes.  The only 

way to do this is to appoint our own chairman to bring in some new members to the 

council and to retain some members of the council who are doing some outstanding 

work.    That  explains  the  reason  behind  this.    Everybody  has  given  their  views.    I 

welcome  them  all.    There  are  opinions  given,  well  everybody  is  here  to  give  their 

</span><span>opinions.  I welcome opinions.  They are certainly expressed and it is every member’s 

</span><span>right to do so.  Thank you Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  I will now put the 

question. The Question is:

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to

Environment Act 1994-1995.
