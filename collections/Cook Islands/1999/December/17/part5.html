</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Parliament  is  resumed.    The  last  speaker  before  we  adjourned  for 

afternoon tea was the Honourable Dr Pupuke Robati.  Do you wish to continue? 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Speaker, I was putting a request to the Opposition for them to 

be patient with us and to accept this Bill from the Minister. This is a new broom and I 

think it will be sweeping well.  That is my point of view. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

call on the Honourable Member for Murienua Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  Greetings  again  to  you  and  to  Members  of  the 

House.  I send special Greetings to the former Deputy Prime Minister the Honourable 

Inatio Akaruru. The reason is, I think we will miss the kind of debate that we are used 

to, the strength and maturity of debate from the former Deputy Prime Minister.  I am 

sure that if the Honourable Inatio Akaruru were in this House, he would have shipped 

the other side with a frenzy like they were whipped into a frenzy by the Leader of the 

Opposition  and  members  of  the  Opposition.  Our  friend  Inatio  would  have  done  the 

</span><span>same.  I wish him all the best in his preparations for the forthcoming third by election 

</span><span>for  Pukapuka  Nassau.    No  doubt  in  my  mind  this  will  be  the  third  time  lucky  for 

Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, all this would have been avoided if the Deputy Prime Minister had had 

the courtesy to call </span><span>the chairman up and say “hey can we have a chat?”.  I could not 

</span><span>believe  that  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  would  have  the  discourtesy  in  forgetting  to 

follow that protocol and yet he had the courtesy to contact me regarding the Telecom 

situation.  I  agree  with  his  statement  that  by  convention  when  a  new  government 

comes  in  then  people  holding  special  positions  should  by  convention  voluntarily 

resign.    As  a  matter  of  courtesy  the  party  concerned  in  this  case  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister,  the  Minister  responsible  for  the  Bill,  should  have  had  the  courtesy  also  to 

call the person concerned and say can we have a talk.  That is why I say it surprised 

me because I have gotten to know the Honourable Norman George as a person with 

that  integrity,  not  to  forget  little  things  like  that.    When  he  contacted  me  regarding 

Telecom, I told the boy who came to get the letter that I have no problem with that. I 

have no difficulty, I understand the protocol and convention and I was quite happy to 

surrender my resignation.  What I am saying is that just as a reminder to all of us in 

the House to remember it is a two-way thing.  It is better than taking the heavy handed 

approach.    Because  as  a  result  of  forgetting  that,  we  have  now  before  this  House  a 

poor  piece  of  legislation,  a  poor  piece  of  legislation  in  the  sense  it  was  brought 

specifically to get rid of somebody on a board.  Yet, there was absolutely no need for 

it. 

</span></div><div><span>Let’s look at the qualifications of people we are talking about on these boards.  Let’s 

</span><span>examine how these people were appointed to these boards.  It appears to me the new 

board has been appointed by one person and that is the new chairman of this board.  

</span><span>Let’s look  at how the outgoing board chairman was appointed and let’s reflect back 

</span><span>on  the  manifesto  of  the  Democratic  Party  that  was  read  by  the  Honourable  Teina 

</span><span>Bishop.  What we see here in the manifesto and what has been proposed in the House 

today  totally  contradicts  what  the  Democratic  Party  is  trying  to  achieve.    I  am  not 

surprised because while this is the Democratic Party proposing, the person initiating 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>350 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the Bill is an Alliance person.  The appointment of Puai Wichman as chairman of the 

environment  council  was  totally  left  to  the  decision  of  the  official  and  not  the 

Minister.    Admittedly  I  was  the  Minister  responsible  for  the  service  at  the  time,  I 

would  like  to  say  here  that  all  I  did  was  rubber  stamp  the  decision  made  by  the 

officials.    When  we  were  looking  for  a  new  director  of  the  Environment  Service  I 

called  upon  the  advice  of  a  former  director  of  the  Environment  Service  namely 

Teariki Rongo.  I am trying to answer the comment made by the Honourable Vaevae 

Pare.  I will come back to the appointment of Puai Wichman.  I called on the advice of 

the former director to give me his opinion as to who of these people who had applied 

should be the director. 

</span></div><div><span>When I did that, it was to take me out of the equation, to take the Minister out of the 

equation in  terms  of the appointment or the selection of the Director.  The result of 

that discussion was the appointments made and like the Honourable Vaevae Pare said, 

he was trying to insinuate that there was favouritism.  What  I am trying to say here 

my friend is that there was no favouritism.  It was on the advice of a former Director, 

which  resulted  in  me,  being  able  to  appoint  certain  people,  which  replaced  the 

outgoing Director at the time, namely Tuingariki Short. 

</span></div><div><span>We have to be very careful, Mr Speaker when we start labelling people with political 

</span><span>labels,  calling  these  Directors  as  CIP  supporters.    Because  we  don’t  know  wheth</span><span>er 

they are CIP supporters.  All I can say is that some of the families of these Directors 

were staunch and are still staunch Demo supporters and of course one of the criteria in 

the  selection  of  these  people  are  their  academic  qualifications.    I  think  you  need  to 

know, Mr Speaker that the current Director has  </span><span>–</span><span>she has a Master’s Degree.  I also 

</span><span>believe she is just a few grades away from her PhD and the Director before her had a 

</span><span>Bachelor  of  Science  Degree.    I’m  not  saying  that  the  person  alluded  to  by  Vaev</span><span>ae 

</span><span>Pare wasn’t good enough but if he had been appointed it would have been a clear case 

</span><span>of political favouritism. 

</span></div><div><span>In the  appointment of the Chairman of the Board, and again,  Mr Speaker,  I  want  to 

make  it  very  clear  that  the  Minister  had  nothing  to  do  with  it.  Although  I  did  have 

some input into the calibre of people that we were looking for. The highest priority on 

that list that I gave my Head of Department, Tuingariki Short at the time, was that the 

person appointed must be bilingual.  He must be able to speak  and understand both 

English and Maori and to me that was very important to the person to be appointed. It 

was very important that he should be able to speak and understand both languages and 

the rest of the list involved the ability to communicate, the ability to have a bit of legal 

background if necessary and so forth. 

</span></div><div><span>To cut a long story short Mr Speaker, in the end the recommendation by the people so 

unanimously  to  select  this  appointment  came  up  with  the  current  Chairman  of  the 

Board.  That  perso</span><span>n  hasn’t  let  down  the  trust  that  these  people  have  in  his 

</span><span>appointment. 

</span></div><div><span>You  see,  Mr  Speaker,  this  person,  Puai  Wichman,  has  no  axe  to  grind.    He  has  no 

</span><span>worries  at  all.    He  has  no  problems  with  anybody.    There  is  no  reason  why  the 

</span><span>Minister  should  be  favouring  this  person.    Puai  understands  the  Environmental  Act 

</span><span>from front to back and if he may have seemed to have been stepping on people’s toes 

because  he  was  doing  a  good  job,  I’m  sorry  but  I  support  him.    Because  the  short 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>351 

</span></div><div><span>opportunity I had to talk with him before I exited Cabinet around the same time, my 

advice to Puai Wichman was that he has a job to do and for him to do it properly with 

</span><span>no offence.  I think that’s the problem some people have with Puai today because he’s 

</span><span>been  too  straight  with  the  way  he  discharged  his  responsibilities  in  running  the 

</span><span>Environment Service that has gone to unprecedented levels of efficiency.  It’s just a 

</span><span>pity that we have to lose a good man. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  for  another  speaker.    The 

Honourable Member, Tapi Taio, Member for Akao. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, Kia Orana to your staff, 

Kia Orana to the Members in the Opposition.  I would like our people to know that 

there are only five of them left.  Their Leader is not here.  Kia Orana also to the very 

strong  Democratic  Alliance.    So  I  would  like  the  people  to  know  that  the  fourteen 

Members are all here and that we are going strong. 

</span></div><div><span>I am surprised with you because this is one of the simplest Bills and I can’t see why 

</span><span>you  have  problems  with  it.    You  are  saying  that  you  have  never  sacked  a  Board.    I 

</span><span>would like to tell you that I was a Member on a Board that you sacked.
