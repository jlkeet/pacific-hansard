</span></div><div><span>341 

</span></div><div><span>Please continue Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Yes, I hope that the Honourable 

Poko  Simpson,  the  Honourable  Member  Robert  Wigmore,  the  Honourable  Member 

Papa Tapi Taio, the person that Puai Wichman voted, the Honourable Maria Heather, 

the  Honourable  Vaevae  Pare,  the  Honourable  Member  Kete  Ioane,  the  Honourable 

Deputy  Speaker  feel  comfortable  with  the  thought  that  one  of  their  Ministers  is 

bringing  before  this  House  for  them  to  support  the  creation  of  a  power  that  will  be 

vested entirely in  one Minister to  decide the fate of a Cook Islander who is  doing a 

good job. 

</span></div><div><span>Do you know, Mr Speaker, I can assure you that even if I as the Prime Minister was to 

bring  such  an  amendment  Bill  into  Cabinet,  no  one  on  this  side  of  the  Opposition 

would  agree  with  such  a  proposal?    You  see  lately,  we  have  seen  Cook  Islanders 

</span><span>being treated like rubbish. Tossed out of their offices as if they didn’t count, as if the 

</span><span>family that </span><span>relied on the revenue they brought home didn’t matter. People in the Prime 

Minister’s Office have been sacked and 430 are listed on the list for sacking.</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> No but you sacked 2000. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> Are you trying to match me, eh!  They are saying I sacked 

2,000.  1590 to be exact.  If we were to leave it to the Prime Minister, he would say 

there  were  over  2,000  but  they  were  not  sacked  because  they  were  Demos.    There 

were Cook Islands Party supporters sacked as well.  They were sent home because of 

the  situation  the  country  found  itself  in.    They  were  not  sacked  because  they  were 

Demos. 

</span></div><div><span>We did not sack them because they did not vote for us.  But in this instance, in this 

very  instance,  the  Minister  has  the  power  to  sack  any  person  for  no  reason 

whatsoever.  If you look at what we the Cook Islands Party put in place, Section 8 of 

the original Act, you will find there, Mr Speaker, that the Cabinet of the time was very 

careful  to  put  some  restrictions  on  the  Minister  so  that  he  did  not  do  whatever  he 

</span><span>wanted.    Cabinet  said  to  the  Minister:  “If  you  want  to  remove  a  person  from  the 

Council you have to come to us first.”  I do not see this here.  All these Ministers here 

</span><span>are happy for this Minister of the Environment to charge into the Environment Office, 

like  a  bull  in  a  china  shop  and  break  it  all  apart.    They  are  afraid  of  him  and  he  is 

getting away with whatever he wants.  They are afraid of him including each one who 

</span><span>is sitting on the back bench ………. </span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E: </span><span>and therefore they have allowed him to exercise whatever 

</span><span>power he wants to change the Law whichever way he wanted…..</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> A Point of Order has been raised. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Point of Order 193 Mr Speaker. Irrelevancy in Debate.  

The Honourable Leader of the Opposition is irrelevant when he said we are scared of 

our Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>342 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> You are scared. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. WOONTON:</span><span>  We are not scared.  Can he prove how we are scared of the 

Deputy Prime Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> I will take up the challenge, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Excuse me.  Will you please resume your seat.  Now, the Point of 

Order is really not relevant because the argument of the Leader of the is quite relevant 

to the Bill.  The Point of Order is overruled.  Please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY  K.B.E:</span><span>  You  are  scared.    I  am  saying  you  are  scared  of  the 

Honourable Member Norman George and I challenge you to prove me wrong. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> You are talking rubbish!! 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span>That is what it is all about, isn’t it?  You see Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>when  you  have  to  do  things  right  you  have  to  do  it  right.    During  my  time,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, some of my Ministers walked out on me because they did not agree with me.  

Two coups were attempted against me.  However, I still did what I believe was right. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  Point  of  Order.    193.    I  do  not  see  any  relevance 

regarding  this  Bill  with  the  attempted  coups  on  himself  which  he  suffered  very 

severely. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you I will make a Ruling.  Will you please resume your seat 

Honourable Leader of the Opposition. Because you are now digressing outside of the 

present  Government  and  the  present  Government  Caucus.    You  are  beginning  to  be 

irrelevant.  Would you please come back to the Bill.  I think you are belabouring the 

point.  Move away from that point and speak to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY  K.B.E:</span><span>  I  believe  Mr  Speaker,  you  are  trying  to  make  me  move 

away from saying they are scared of the Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  want  you  to  move  away  from  talking  about  your  time  as  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E: </span><span>Okay Mr Speaker, I was using that as an example of the 

importance of doing things right and doing in what I believe is right. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I believe you have made the point, Leader of the Opposition, and I 

think that is sufficient. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> Yes. The fact of the matter Mr Speaker is, talking about 

doing things right can never be enough.  You can never belabour the point. However, 

</span><span>when the Cook Islands Party Government developed the Environment Act, it gave </span><span>–

</span><span>Cabinet gave the Minister in Charge the authority to remove people from the Council. 

</span><span>Then  it  said  to  the  Minister:  “Before  you  remove  anybody  from  the  Council,  you 

</span><span>come back to the Cabinet and we have a cha</span><span>t about it.”  That is right.  The dismissal 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>343 

</span></div><div><span>must  occur  with  the  concurrence  of  the  rest  of  those  in  Cabinet  but  it  did  not  stop 

there, the rest of the Cabinet said to the Minister that is not enough.  You cannot sack 

</span><span>a person just because you don’t like th</span><span>e shape of his ears.  Now, if he is ill, if he is 

incapacitated by illness, yes that is a good reason for removing him from the Council.  

If he is a bankrupt, yes that is a good enough reason for you to come to Cabinet and 

ask us to have him replaced.  If  he is incompetent in his job, okay.  Cabinet will, if 

you  show  us  that  to  be  the  case,  we  will  support  your  proposal  to  replace  him.  

Cabinet went further and said if he fails to discharge his responsibilities as a member 

of the council, and you came and asked us to have him replaced we will agree.  What 

Cabinet is saying to the Minister is you cannot sack anybody when you feel like it.   

</span></div><div><span>That, says the Cabinet to the Minister, is not right, that is inhumane. You must have a 

good reason  for sacking somebody.  The fact  that  he does  not  support  your Party is 

irrelevant.  The fact that he is a Red Indian is irrelevant and the fact that he does not 

live or go to your Church does not matter.  Cabinet was very careful in insisting that 

in any situation such as this, the authority of the Minister to do whatever he wanted 

was tempered by common sense and doing things the right way.   

</span></div><div><span>This  one  says,  as  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister  of  Environment 

</span><span>Services  I  can  sack  anyone  on  that  Council  any  time  I  feel  like  it.    I  do  not  know 

whether  the  Members  on  the  Government  Caucus  are  happy  about  that.    I  am  sure 

deep down in their hearts they do not believe this is right.   How would each one of 

them  feel  to  see  one  of  their  own,  placed  to  a  decision  such  as  this  where  they  live 

under a regime of threat and fear where there is  no security in  their appointment.  I 

cannot believe Mr Speaker, that currently of what is supposed to be a matured Nation 

with  mature  policies  we  still  see  this  desire,  this  preference  for  power  vested  in  the 

one person.  I cannot understand, Mr Speaker, why the Prime Minister, although I told 

you  before  I  know  why.  And  yet  in  the  moment  of  surpriety,  when  he  should  be 

thinking about what is right and what is proper did he not at one time in his mind be it 

in  the  office,  be  it  in  the  Cabinet,  be  it  at  the  home  even  think  one  moment  that 

perhaps what this Minister is asking for is not right?  I believe Mr Speaker I believe it 

did cross his mind. I believe the Prime Minister knows what this Minister is asking for 

is wrong. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> But he is scared. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  for  further  speakers.  The 

Honourable Tupou Faireka Member for Tupapa-Maraerenga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker good afternoon to you and a 

very  good afternoon to  our Staff and to  the Prime Minister and the Members of the 

Coalition Government.  Greetings also to the Leader of the Opposition and the Caucus 

Members of the Opposition. Kia Orana to our people listening in.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  stand  up  to  totally  oppose  this  Bill  and  to  say  how  sad,  how 

</span><span>disheartened,  how  dejected,  how  despondent  I  am  that  this  type  of  legislation  is 

brought in this House.  This type of action is taking us back to the pre reform era.  In 

1996 we went through a reform process and the country as well as the people suffered 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>344 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>and the Honourable Dr Williams was right in saying that we sacked over a thousand 

public  servants.    We  had  to  do  that  Mr  Speaker  because  the  country  needed  that 

reform.    For  many  years  before  that  every  successive  Government  came  in  and 

brought their own supporters into Government.  You know, most public servants were 

</span><span>employed  during  the  Democratic  Government’s  time.    This  is  a  fact  Mr  Speaker,  I 

</span><span>was  the  President  of  the  Public  Service  Association  at  that  time.    You  know  the 

largest Ministry employing public servants at the time was the Ministry for the Outer 

Islands.  That  was  the  problem  up  to  the  time  that  the  Cook  Islands  Party  was  in 

power.  I  had  to  admit  the  Cook  Islands  Party  was  employing  their  own  people  in 

Government.  As  a  matter  of  consensus  and  agreement  the  Government  through 

Cabinet  and  Caucus  at  the  time  agreed  to  take  the  reform,  heedless  of  the  pain  and 

consequences the country would face at the time.  From my memory, they were Cook 

Islands Party supporters.  We could see a slight change from the Cook Islands Party to 

the Democratic Party.  We knew of that consequence, we knew of that defeat that we 

would get.   We did  not mind.  We were concerned  with  the interests of the country 

and of our people.   

</span></div><div><span>When we took the reform Mr Speaker, we put some messages in place and this is one 

</span><span>of  the  reforms  we  took.    We  put  into  legislation  that  will  support  the  rights  of  the 

</span><span>workers  of  this  country.    During  the  few  months  of  this  Government,  you  heard 

through  the  media  the  Government  of  Dr  Williams  and  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry.  The 

Government was rushing to do things that we were trying to do apart from the normal.  

You see we have also a Government with partnership with the coalition of the current 

Government, with the Honourable Member Norman George.  We faced some of these 

problems at the time.  We could not lay off Board Members, we think are supporting 

the Government of the time.  There were no consensuses in Cabinet to sack the boards 

at  the time.  However,  we did  not  go ahead  and legislate a law  giving  power to  the 

Minister to sack the Democratic Party or Alliance Party members of the board.  We 

did  it  the  right  way.    We  consulted,  we  showed  them  the  protocol  and  we  left  it  to 

them  to  step  down  or  not.    Mr  Speaker  I  am  very  happy  and  proud  to  stand  today 

admitting  we  have  never  sacked  any  board  member  during  our  time.    It  is  indeed  a 

very sad day today especially for members of the Coalition Government.  You know 

in the first few weeks, I was attracted to the theme the Prime Minister preached on the 

</span><span>radio  “People First.”  Mr Prime Minister please I beg you to put into action what you 

</span><span>have  been  saying  to  your  people.    Tell  us,  what  reasons  there  are  in  sacking  this 

Chairman.  I want to tell this House that of all the Boards, of all the Chairmen, this is 

one of the best and most outstanding Chairmen of a board.  More so, he is a lawyer.  

For  the  past  year  when  running  the  environment  council,  we  have  had  a  lot  of 

development and progress. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Point of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>A  point  of  order  has  been  called.    What  is  your  point  of  order 

Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Personal reflection Mr Speaker.  The Honourable Member 

</span><span>is bringing the Chairman of the Board today who everybody knows is Puai Wichman 

</span><span>into his debate. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>345 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Your  point  of  order  is  overruled.    Please  carry  on  Honourable 

Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  FAIREKA:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Mr  Speaker  I  think  it  is  common 

knowledge  that  everybody  knows  what  has  been  transpiring  in  the  last  few  weeks 

concerning this matter.  The Deputy Prime Minister has been in the newspaper over 

this issue.  Mr Speaker, it is quite obvious what this Bill is going to do or whom it is 

aiming at.  As I said during the last few years, I really think there has been progress 

out of the environment service under the leadership of its Chairman of the board. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  Mr  Speaker,  may  I  ask  if  this  is  creating  a  precedent  that  Ministers  may 

follow later. Does this pave the way for other Ministers to have the same authority? 

That  is  if  a  Minister  do  not  like  a  chairman  or  a  member,  Cabinet  gives  him  the 

authority to sack whoever he wants?  Is this setting a precedent for whatever chairman 

</span><span>defies  a  Minister’s  direction?  W</span><span>ould  Cabinet  give  the  authority  to  the  Minister  to 

legislate a law in this House? 

</span></div><div><span>There are reasons for dismissing members and chairmen and they are stipulated in the 

</span><span>Act.  If a Chairman or member does not follow Government policies then by right  I 

</span><span>support  he  should  be  looked  at  and  reviewed.  But  I  have  not  heard  any  of  those 

reasons given by the Deputy Prime Minister who is the Minister of the Environment 

and the reasons stipulated under the Act should be justified to bring into Parliament a 

Bill like this.  Mr Speaker I would have believed that if the Honourable Deputy Prime 

Minister  sat  down  and  ran  through  the  process  with  the  chairman  and  talk  about 

stepping down, I would have expected a good result from that discussion. 

</span></div><div><span>You  see  Mr  Speaker,  the  Chairman  himself  cannot  be  here  to  defend  some  of  the 

allegations  that  might  be  alluded  to  him  and  it  is  quite  unfair  Mr  Speaker,  that  we 

bring a legislation of this sort to sack somebody that is not here.  Indeed, Mr Speaker, 

it is a sad day because this type of action is giving the new Government a very tainted 

reputation. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday,  Mr  Speaker,  you  heard  all  the  members  were  supportive  of  the  Public 

Holidays  Bill  and  everybody  was  elated.  Today,  Mr  Speaker,  that  sort  of 

understanding and common agreement between the two parties is now starting to shift 

especially by this type of legislation.  I did not expect this Government, Mr Speaker, 

to  come  into  this  House  and  bring  a  Bill  to  sack  people.    Because  under  this 

legislation, Mr Speaker, the Minister has the power to sack not only the Chairman but 

also any member of the Board. 

</span></div><div><span>Their contracts, Mr Speaker, are about two years and I am sure that most of the Board 

members  on  this  Board  are  just  nearing  their  term  of  termination.    Why  is  the 

government so impatien</span><span>t to wait and see these people’s appointment come to an end. 

</span><span>What is so bad now in the Environment Service that needed this sort of action? 

</span></div><div><span>I have no problem in some of the new Boards that has been announced.  I think they 

</span><span>have very good criteria. They will have very good attributes to give to the Board.  My 

</span><span>only  concern  here  Mr  Speaker  is  the  way  of  removing  Board  members  from  the 

Board.  Why would they have to be executed?  Why would they have to be sacked?  

Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  appealing  to  the  Honourable  Members  of  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>346 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Government to please re-look at this Bill as there is still time to adjourn it for more 

clarification and amendment.  I am 100 per cent behind you Prime Minister in saying 

</span><span>to our people “People First”.  Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I call on the Honourable Minister 

of Internal Affairs, Ngamau Munokoa.  You have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>   Greetings to  you Mr Speaker, to  the Clerk  and to  all staff 

members. Greetings to  the  Leader of the Opposition and all  your Members.  To the 

Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, to Cabinet Ministers and to all Members 

</span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to all of you.  Greetings to our people who are listening in to our debate 

this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the Bill before the House Mr Chairman because when this 

Bill  was  brought  into  Cabinet,  I  was  one  of  those  that  signed  it.  Although  the 

Chairman concerned is a relative of mine, I was not happy with him. I am a concerned 

person about the environment in my constituency Nikao. Honourable Members I have 

approached  the  Chairman.    I  have  spoken  to  him.  I  have  told  him  the  needs  of  my 

</span><span>constituency but there was no response from him.  I did not come into this House to 

</span><span>look at families or relatives.  I come here to see that things are done for everybody.   

</span></div><div><span>Yes,  sure,  you  people  were  talking  about  attack,  but  you  people  in  your  time  were 

attacking  the  Board.  We  attack  the  person  in  the  face.    You  have  spoken  to  these 

people and then suddenly they fade and they are no longer working.  What I will do, 

Mr Speaker is, I will see and ensure that everybody is there to work and in support of 

anything that will bring a higher standard of life and meet the needs of our people.  I 

</span><span>am  not  here  to  look  at  friends  or  relatives.    Because  you  can’t  af</span><span>ford  to  work  with 

somebody who is always contradicting with the way you see things. That person will 

always  counter  act  against  what  you  propose  to  do.    You  people  on  the  Opposition 

side have been in Government. You have done what you have done to the best of your 

</span><span>ability.  Let’s do our part, let’s do the work, and let’s see it done to our wish.</span></div><div><span>I  will  say  that  my  friend  did  not  carry  out  his  responsibilities.    I  spoke  before,  Mr 

Speaker, to  the  Leader of the Opposition  before  I made the approach  as  Member of 

Parliament for Nikao. Now I speak as Minister of MOWEPP and Minister of Internal 

Affairs. I will ensure that I see to the welfare of the people of the Cook Islands. I did 

not wish to say what I have to say now but I feel that I am compelled to do it.  </span><span>It’s not 

</span><span>that you people are ignorant of what is happening now.  What I want to say right now 

is what has transpired in Court and not being able to carry out their responsibilities.  I 

will stop here. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

call on the Honourable Member, Teina Bishop, Member for Arutanga, Nikaupara and 

Reureu. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE: </span><span> Your heir and successor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:</span><span>  Greetings  to  you  Mr  speaker  and  to  all  of  us  in  this  Chamber.  

Greetings  to  you  all  in  the  love  of  our  God.    Greetings  to  the  Prime  Minister,  the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  to  all  Members  on  the  Government 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>347 

</span></div><div><span>side  and  to  my  Leader,  to  the  people  on  the  Opposition  side  </span><span>–</span><span>  greetings  to  you  all.  

Special greetings to our people listening in to our debate this afternoon </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to 

you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I wasn’t going to partake in the debate of this Bill because as I read it, it 

</span><span>is  the  Rarotonga  Environment  Bill  and  may  I  say  at  this  point  that  thank  God  it 

</span><span>doesn’t affect the </span><span>Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I carry on, may I just read a few text from some notes that were written in a 

well-</span><span>liked book that I have been reading in the last two nights.  It says, “Government 

is a servant and not the master.”  I like that.  This is what bother</span><span>s me Mr Speaker with 

regards to this Bill.  I oppose it because it is against the principle of the reform.  It is 

my  understanding  that  during  the  time  of  the  reform  there  was  an  element  of  the 

powers of the Ministers that were removed as part of the reform programme which I 

strongly  believed  was  good.  Now  we  are  trying  to  re-introduce  this  again.    I  would 

like to join the others in saying that this is a sad day. If we can get this Bill through 

and  I  wish  to  remind  the  Members  of  the  Government,  especially  those  in  the 

Democratic Alliance Party that you stated in your Manifesto that such a thing would 

</span><span>not happen.   

</span></div><div><span>On  page  14  of  your  Manifesto  you  said,  that  this  is  what  you  will  do.    “Where 

</span><span>Government  for  a  justifiable  reason  or  in  the  national  interest  must  retain  any  such 

</span><span>agency we will ensure they are run by competent people from the community.”  And 

you  also  quite  clearly  stated  that  “However,  we  will  put  a  stop  to  the  Cook  Islands 

</span><span>Party practice of using these agencies as heavens of appointment for political cronies 

</span><span>on  their  boards.”    And  you  stated  also  that  “We  will  change  the  empowering 

</span><span>legislation of these agencies to eliminate political interference and appointment by the 

Minister in Charge and to ensure the competent people from the community at large 

with the necessary competency are appointed instead. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this  is  in  the Manifesto  of the Democratic-Alliance Party.   I am  sad to 

say that this Bill today is against the Manifesto of the Democratic Alliance Party and I 

strongly believe that it is wrong.  However, since this is dealing with the Environment 

Act of Rarotonga, I rest here and leave it to the Members of Rarotonga to deal with 

this Bill.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I call on the Honourable Member 

for Matavera, Vaevaepare. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. VAEVAEPARE:</span><span> Greetings Mr Speaker.  Greetings in the Love of our God.  

Greetings  to  your  Staff.    Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister,  our  Prime  Minister.  

Greetings to the Deputy Prime Minister and Members of the Caucus.  Greetings to the 

Leader of the Opposition and Members on the Opposition Side.  Mr Speaker I would 

</span><span>like to extend my greetings to the people of the Cook Islands listening in to the ‘waste 

of time’ messages from the Members of the Opposition.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my full support to the Motion before the House.  We carried 

</span><span>out  the debate over this  in  our Caucus without fear, not  like what  the  Leader of the 

Opposition has said that we were afraid of our Deputy Prime Minister.  And I would 

like  to  assure  everybody  that  I  am  not  afraid  of  the  views  of  the  Deputy  Prime

</span></div><div><span>Minister because Mr Speaker I thought we would get through this Bill quickly but it 

has become a very big issue.  The Members of the Opposition are taking the spirit and 

merits of this Bill to say that we are sacking people.  The Government is not sacking 

people,  we  are  looking  at  the  people  who  are  able  to  carry  out  the  desires  of  the 

Government and the desires of the Ministry concerned.  Mr Speaker I would not have 

anyone  working  for  me  if  he  did  not  do  what  I  want  done.    We  are  talking  about 

sacking  people  in  Government  and  I  would  like  to  say  in  the  Department  of 

Conservation  there  is  a  person  who  has  suffered  the  consequences  from  the  former 

Government. This young man has worked in this Department for a very long time and 

has  the  experience  in  the  Department  and  I  feel  he  should  be  the  Director  of  this 

Department. I think he is a strong supporter of the CIP.  

</span></div><div><span> I  understand  Mr  Speaker,  there  were  two  other  people  brought  in  and  appointed  as 

Directors.  There  is  a  girl  currently  appointed  as  a  Director  and  these  employees  are 

Cook  Islands  Party  supporters.    This  young  man  thought  he  should  have  been  the 

Director at the time.  Mr Speaker I brought this matter up to give my support to this 

Bill before the House.  In addition, I would like to say Mr Speaker and emphasise the 

fact that I do not fear the Deputy Prime Minister or the Prime Minister or anybody. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I call on the Honourable Member 

Pupuke Robati, the Member for Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  Honourable  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House 

greetings.    Mr  Speaker  the  day  this  Environment  Act  was  brought  into  the  House  I 

believed  it  was  something  that  will  improve  our  environment.    Mr  Speaker,  right 

opposite where I live the place has worsened compared to the past because there are 

many empty bottles and cans all over the place.  These places are strewn with rubbish. 

I did not see anyone from the Environment Service come around to warn the people 

that they should not litter.  I saw only the Honourable Member Ngamau Munokoa and 

her workers who cleared up this rubbish.  In the Act that was established, it gives the 

right to the Department to appoint wardens to see that no one litters. If they do, they 

can take these people to Court or that person can be fined on the spot. The money will 

be distributed half to the Department and half to the Wardens.  Since the day the Act 

was passed, I have not seen anyone fined for these empty cans and rubbish.  Where 

was the Chairman of the Board at the time?  What did he do?  Did he do something 

about  it?    All  I  know  is  that  the  Honourable  Member  Ngamau  Munokoa  and  her 

workers are the ones who tidied things up.  This is what I see from my home. Other 

people litter the area and someone else clears it up.  When the Minister brought this 

issue, I supported it. Maybe it will bring some benefit to the Department as a whole.  I 

will  ask  the  Members  on  the  Opposition  to  please  have  patience  with  us,  your  time 

has expired, give us time to do what we think is best.  What I will say is that maybe 

we  will  be  able  to  see  some  improvements  in  the  future.    There  are  other  people 

cleaning the place up including our school children that I feel sorry. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I have to interrupt you Honourable Member.  We will now take our 

</span><span>break.  The Sitting is suspended until 3 o’clock.</span></div><div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED AT 2.30pm</span></div>
