</span></div><div><span>I would like to tell you Mr Speaker about the Department of Environment.  I would 

like to  say that  this  is  one of the  Departments  that  I hate the most because they  are 

always interfering with me.  I really wanted to come to Parliament and just do away 

with this Department.
