<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Rarotonga Environment Amendment Bill. Interrupted debate on the Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>Our last speaker  was  the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister Norman  George.  You 

have the Floor Sir and you have 18 minutes to go on your speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  May I begin by saying my Greetings 

from yesterday, continuing today. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  I would like to  say  that the simple reason for this Amendment is  to allow the 

new  Government  to  put  their  choice  of  people  on  the  Environment  Board.    The 

original Act gives power of removal only when there are faults of one kind or another 

with council members.  Understandably, no provisions were made for the change of 

Government, you do not see that kind of thing and it was never done. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, what all Governments in the past have done was, to rely on the protocol 

or  convention  of  the  practice  that  when  one  Government  leaves  the  office,  those  on 

Government  appointed  Boards  will  automatically  offer  their  resignations  to  the  new 

Government.  This practice or convention as we call it is unwritten.  Normally those 

with  the  right  attitude,  those  with  a  concern  for  their  standing,  would  automatically 

submit their resignation to the new Government.  It is up to the incoming Government 

whether to accept the resignation or to decline it.   

</span></div><div><span>In this instance, we struck a slight problem where the Chairman of the Environment 

</span><span>Council  decided  he  did  not  wish  to  resign.    Maybe  the  former  Prime  Minister  Dr 

</span><span>Joseph  Williams  set  an  unsavoury  precedent  where  you  go  to  the  wire.    So  this 

gentleman,  the  Chairman  of  the  Environment  Council  decided  he  would  follow  a 

similar course.  I will not mention any names at all to save the good reputation of the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>339 

</span></div><div><span>individual concerned.  This particular person wrote a letter to me saying that under the 

Act,  he  had  no  obligation  to  step  down.  Then  he  also  made  a  counter  allegation 

containing a lot of political and racially biased statements towards the new appointees.  

It  was  a  very  sad  situation  where  a  highly  educated  gentleman  writes  a  letter 

embarking  upon  the  racial  origins  of  number  of  members  of  the  council,  which  the 

new Government has appointed.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Government’s standard for equality before</span><span> the law, God, and every 

citizen  of  this  country  regardless  of  your  race  and  background  is  very  sound.  If 

Government  chooses  that  individual because of  his  ability, education  and interest  to 

protect the environment of the country you will be appointed by this Government.  I 

expect the Chairman to go with grace, to accept our wishes.  I have indicated that was 

not only my wish but also that of Cabinet.  He took the extreme interpretation to buck 

the system whereby we are compelled to amend the law giving the Minister the right 

to remove any member of the council.  This gives the Minister the right to remove any 

member  of  the  council  without  any  particular  fault.    But  our  legal  system  protects 

those who feel wrongly removed to remedy or to repair any injury that is likely to be 

received if an action like this is to be taken. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there is  no injustice here.   If there is  a victim in  this situation, it is the 

Government of the day. Somebody has decided because there is no provision to allow 

Government  to  replace  him  that  he  would  victimise  Government  by  forcing  this 

amendment to be made. 

</span></div><div><span>If there is any fear, Mr Speaker, that the current and future members of the Board will 

live  under  a  regime  of  threats  and  fear,  I  want  to  assure  them  that  that  is  utter 

nonsense.    Mr  Speaker,  we  are  dealing  with  the  Environmental  Council,  not  some 

highflying  confrontational  body.    These  are  earth  loving  people  who  love  their 

environment,  who  love  to  preserve  the  environment  for  the  future  generations  and 

there is no likelihood whatsoever of confrontational administration. 

</span></div><div><span>The people that this Government selected to serve on the Environmental Council were 

appointed due to their expertise, good reputation and devotion to the protection of the 

environment.  These are people who have shown willingness in the past to help secure 

a good environment in this country. 

</span></div><div><span>Some of these people on the Environment Council are people that we have seen time 

and time again. Actually, they were the ones going out to the beaches, to the parks to 

get their hands dirty, to collect rubbish, to pick up tin cans, empty bottles.  These are 

the people that we have identified and put on the new Council. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  spent  my  professional  life  fighting  for  people’s  rights  as  a  trial 

</span><span>lawyer.    No  one  needs  to  fear  having  their  rights  threatened  under  my  stewardship.  

Therefore, I urge those who wish to enter the debate to stay away from personalities, 

not to mention names, and not to crucify the reputations of people who are not here to 

defend themselves.  I undertake to be a gentleman and not bring up unsavoury matters 

</span><span>that are likely to embarrass the personalities concerned. 

</span></div><div><span>I urge Honourable Members to please respect the privacy of the individuals involved 

in these discussions.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I look forward to hearing 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>340 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>your views,  your opinions and your attacks and let us hope there is not too much of 

that. When there are questions, I will be happy to answer them at the conclusion of the 

principle and merits debate and discussions on this amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Akaoa Mr Tapi Taio 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  I call on the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.B: </span><span>Greetings to you Mr Speaker and greetings to everybody 

listening  in  to  this  broadcast  and  to  attend  to  this  most  sad  occasion,  very  sad 

occasion.  It is sad because, Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister is about to sack a 

Cook Islander from doing a good job.  He has just admitted that in Parliament today.  

The  only  reason  behind  this  Bill  is  to  give  him  power  to  sack  Puai  Wichman.  Mr 

Speaker, he would not have been able to bring this Bill before this House if each one 

</span><span>of  these  people  in  Cabinet  did  not  support  it.    The  Honourable  Tangata  Vavia,  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Ngamau  Wichman,  the  Honourable  Member  from  Mangaia,  the  Deputy 

Prime Minister, the Prime Minister and the Honourable Dr Woonton.  Each of them 

could have stopped this nonsense from coming to this House but they agreed for the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister  to  bring  the  Bill  to  give  him  the  sole  power  to  sack  a  Cook 

Islander. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> A Point of Order has been called.  The Honourable Prime Minister, 

what is your Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  bring  to  your 

attention  to  the  remark  made  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  in  reference  to  the 

Honourable  Minister  as  Ngamau  Wichman.  This  has  been  mentioned  twice  so  I 

thought I would bring it to your attention, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  Honourable Leader of the 

</span><span>Opposition, I suppose you were using the Honourable Member’s maiden name but she 

</span><span>is now known as the Honourable Ngamau Munokoa.  Thank you.  Please refer to her 

as the Honourable Member, Ngamau Munokoa.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> I accept your ruling Mr Speaker but I want to know under 

what  Standing  Order  has  my  time  been  taken,  my  speaking  time.    So  long  as  my 

speaking time is restored, I will have no problem with the Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Well  your speaking time is not affected Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition  because  it  is  a  Point  of  Order  even  though  the  number  was  not  quoted.  

</span><span>Will you please tell me the number of the Point of Order when you rise to a Point of 

</span><span>Order, Honourable Members? Thank you.
