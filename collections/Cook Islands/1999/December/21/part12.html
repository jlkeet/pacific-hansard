<div><span>BILL READ THE THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  That  completes  the  Second  and  Third  Readings  of  the  Electoral 

Amendment No.2 Bill. Now, Honourab</span><span>le Members….  Yes the Honourable Leader of 

</span><span>the House? 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Sitting be extended until the third Reading of the 

International Shipping Bill is completed and that it be no later than 6 p.m.

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>382 

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tapi Taio Member of Parliament for Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Honourable Dr.Woonton, Minister of Foreign Affairs 

and Shipping. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the International Shipping Bill be Read theSecond Time 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Excuse  me,  Honourable  Minister,  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

House has moved a Motion for the Extension of the Sitting.  Are you speaking to that 

Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  stand  to  explain  that  the 

reason  for  the  extension  of  the  Sitting  to  6:00pm  is  because  of  the  urgency  of  the 

Shipping Bill before the House.  We have discussed some of the issues raised in this 

Bill  in-camera.    There  are  areas  of  urgent  consideration  to  us  to  see  that  this  Bill 

passes  through  the  House  today.    We  have  taken  note  of  the  concerns  raised  by  the 

</span><span>Members of the Opposition and some of the Shipping people in this country.  Right 

</span><span>now there are amendments already drafted to be added to the Bill to discriminate any 

arrangements that have been made in the past and certain contracts that are not to be 

affected  by  the  enactment  of  this  Shipping  Bill.    Especially  where  there  is  some 

reference  to  the  Act  being  retrospective  to  certain  areas.    The  areas  of  concern  are 

those  with  the  suggestion  that  the  Act  is  retrospective  and  effective  to  previous 

Agreements. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  shipping  operators  and  members  of  the  Opposition  convince  me  that  the 

amendment will cover the areas of concern.  The amendment will prevent any act with 

regard to international shipping in the past that it will not be an offence until this Act 

is  enacted.    I  also  believe  that  there  will  be  an  amendment  to  give  a  period  of 

transition before the Act is enforced.  I am sure Members of the House will support 

those amendments when presented before the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Minister.  Are there any further speakers to the Motion 

by the Leader of the House?  There appears to be none. I will put the question. The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Just to refresh your memories, the Motion is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Sitting will continue until 6.00 p.m. when the Third Reading of the 

International Shipping Bill will need to be completed. 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I seek clarification as to whether you intend to return to an  in camera discussion or to 

</span><span>continue  with  the  Second  Reading  of  the  Bill.    I  await  an  indication  from  on  this 

question.  The Minister of Transport. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>383 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Mr Speaker we intend to proceed with the International 

Shipping Bill forthwith rather than go in camera again. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Is that a Motion?  An indication means that if I ask if there is any 

objection to that indication then it will not stand.  The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker  I  think  we  have  had  one  session  in  camera.  

The people have been waiting for us to debate in this Parliament, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That we should stay and debate in Parliament until the Bill is  

</span><span>passed by 6 o’clock.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Prime Minister.</span><span>Is there a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Peri Vaevae Pare. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  I will put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Minister in charge of the Bill for the Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the International Shipping Bill be Read a Second Time 

</span></div><div><span>The  purpose  of  this  Bill  is  to  make  specific  statutory  provision  to  preserve  and 

enhance  national  control  of  Cook  Islands  International  Shipping  services.  To  ensure 

that control and regulation of Cook Islands Shipping remains in the hands of the Cook 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Three  licences  are  currently  issued  to  allow  the  holders  to  carry  on  international 

shipping services to and from the Cook Islands.  The purpose of allowing a number of 

ships  to  carry  on  this  service  is  to  enhance  the  service  and  to  promote  competition.  

This  Bill  addresses  the  need  to  ensure  that  those  enjoying  a  dominant  position  in 

regional  shipping  do  not  take  competitive  forces.    The  Bill  aims  to  prevent  the 

establishment of a monopoly or cartel of Cook Islands international shipping services. 

</span></div><div><span>The Bill addresses the activities of foreign interests who do not have a direct presence 

within  the  country  by  giving  statutory  recognition  and  encouragement  to  the  use  of 

ships which are genuinely owned and controlled by persons present in the jurisdiction 

</span><span>true national control of the country’s shipping requires ships and ship</span><span>-owners who are 

Cook  Islands  based.    The  Bill  outlaws  unfair  and  anti-competitive  practices  in  a 

n</span><span>umber  of  provisions,  which  are  modelled  on  similar  provisions  in  New  Zealand’s 

</span><span>Commerce Act 1986 and Shipping Act 1987. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Bill  recognises  that  while  foreign  interests  may  attempt  to  manipulate  Cook 

Islands international shipping services without reference to such actions taken will be 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>384 

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>for the benefit of carriers which are amenable to control accordingly. The Bill makes 

provision for such carriers to enter into agreements with the Minister to negate anti-

competitive  or  unfair  practices  entered  into  by  associated  persons  where  those 

practices affect Cook Islands ships or Cook Islands international shipping service. 

</span></div><div><span>While the Bill provides some protection for shipping licence holders to conduct their 

businesses  in  the  normal  business  manner,  it  does  not  in  any  way  disadvantage  or 

prevent  any  licence  holder  from  operating  their  line  by  bringing  into  force  some 

control  on  the  fair  trade  as  far  as  shipping  is  concerned  in  this  country.    We  would 

prevent  in  future  the  possibility  of  monopolies  as  far  as  international  shipping  is 

concerned in this country. 

</span></div><div><span>For a number of years we have been very protective of our shipping licence holders 

until  two or three  years ago when there has been a move to  deregulate international 

shipping  in  the  country.    That  is  the  deregulation  done  by  the  former  Cook  Islands 

Party .  We support that view also to bring in legislation to enshrine the principles of 

what a shipping line should be. 

</span></div><div><span>While it seems to some that this legislation is favouring one particular shipping line, 

</span><span>let me assure you I do not see any reason to suggest that.  What I see this legislation 

protecting  is  the  people  of  this  country  who  have  invested  in  shipping,  especially 

those who are committed and are still committed to this country by providing reliable 

fair trade to our people. Who also went through the difficulties, the suffering, of the 

good  times  and  the  bad  times  as  well  as  enjoyed  the  good  times.    There  is  no 

provision in this Act to preclude or to stop any of our people owning an international 

shipping licence and to operate international services.  If anything, it will provide for 

a  level  playing  field  for  any  of  our  people  who  want  to  invest  or  enter  the  game  of 

international shipping. 

</span></div><div><span>We all agree that competition is healthy for the nation but at the same time we do not 

want to see monopolies take a stranglehold of our country. 

</span></div><div><span>It also goes along with our policy, of the Democratic Alliance and the New Alliance 

that we serve our people first. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Hear, hear.  Not foreign interests. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Which brings me to the point that we must serve those 

people who brought us to this House and to act responsibly for the nation.  If any of 

the  international  shipping  operators  are  unhappy  about  this  legislation  I  would  be 

quite happy to sit down with them and discuss any areas that are of concern to them 

and  bring  in  any  amendment  to  allay  their  fears.    My  principal  concern  with  this 

enactment is that the interest of this country is looked after. 

Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Minister.  I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tapi Taio Member for Akaoa 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>385 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  I call on the Honourable Member, Tupou Faireka, Member 

for Tupapa-Maraerenga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  Mr  Speaker,  I  stand  to  give  some 

thoughts and probably some opposition to some of the clauses of this Bill.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, Mr Speaker, I would like to give thanks to the Minister for the opportunity to 

have had discussions with the drafters of this Bill in-camera in Parliament.  Although 

there were explanations given to us, I still feel that there are some grey areas that we 

needed to debate.  I also feel, Mr Speaker, that such debates should also be entertained 

in this House in order for the public and especially those parties interested in this Bill 

to have an opportunity to hear and understand what this Bill is about. 

</span></div><div><span>I can see the spirit and the way the Bill is being drafted and I don’t have any problem 

</span><span>with  that  Mr  Speaker,  but  within  what  has  been  prepared  and  what  has  been 

legislated, Mr Speaker, that is where the concern is. 

</span></div><div><span>Recently, Mr Speaker, in 1998 we have passed  the latest  Shipping Act  and that Act 

</span><span>was a complete overhaul of the existing previous Act of the Cook Islands based on the 

</span><span>New  Zealand  Shipping  Act.  That  Act,  Mr  Speaker,  also  was  one  of  the 

recommendations  of  the  reform  process  and  such  was  to  open  competition, 

encouraging development on any sort of developments in the Cook Islands.  You see 

under  that  Shipping  Act,  Mr  Speaker,  it  gives  the  power  to  the  Minister  to  issue  a 

licence with conditions stipulated under that Act. 

</span></div><div><span>When the reform took place in the year 1996 one of the cries of the reform was open 

up on monopolies in this country.  You know, Mr Speaker, it was very hurtful for the 

Cook  Islands  Party  at  the  time  to  take  measures  regarding  shipping  services  in  the 

Cook  Islands.   It  was hurtful  for the Cook Islands Party because the grievances that 

this reform would bring upon the company that is very supportive of the Cook Islands 

Party  at  the  time.    Mr  Speaker,  it  was  more  hurtful  for  me  because  one  of  the 

operators  of  a  company  was  a  cousin  of  mine  from  Manihiki  and  he  is  a  very 

successful businessman in my constituency of Tupapa-Maraerenga.  But, Mr Speaker, 

I took the objective, I took the spirit of the reform and went ahead and opened up the 

monopoly of shipping in regards to the reform that we went through since 1996.  As a 

result  of  that  opening  up  we  had  two  new  companies  operating  in  the  Cook  Islands 

under the name of EXCIL and the Tokelau </span><span>–</span><span> Nautilus Shipping Services.  Both these 

two companies are locally managed and locally owned. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Not EXCIL. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA:</span><span> I am hearing from the opposition that EXCIL is excluded. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  EXCIL is a Shell company. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA: </span><span>I want to assure Honourable Members that at the time of granting 

</span><span>the licence there were no other foreigners.  It was 100 per cent local. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>You’ve been lied to.</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>386 

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>  You  see,  Mr  Speaker,  at  the  time  in  order  for  the  Minister  to 

grant  a  licence  that  licensee  needs  to  fulfil  some  conditions  of  the  shipping 

requirements.  They have to register their company locally and the shareholding and 

capital holding of that company needs to be declared on that application.  As far as I 

could understand at that time when I granted the licence of EXCIL, Mr Speaker, the 

three shareholders of that company were Trevor Clarke, Mr Brett Porter and Mr John 

Wichman. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:  </span><span>It’s shell owned.</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA:</span><span> There could be a development now that I am not aware of but I 

am talking at the time when the licence was granted, Mr Speaker, and that complied 

with the requirement of the Shipping Act. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>We don’t have any problem with their licence at all.</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  You see  I was  also  given  some propositions  that this  group are 

just  facing  up  to  the  licence  and  there  will  be  operators  at  the  back  and  one  of  the 

</span><span>overseas companies mentioned was the Reef Company.  There were innuendoes that 

</span><span>the operators of the Reef were criminals  and they  were people that were a  group or 

part of a cartel that operated other businesses throughout the South Pacific.  But you 

know,  to  my  delight,  Mr  Speaker,  I  found  out  that  a  half  shareholder  of  the  Reef 

named Nikki is the niece of the previous Member of Parliament, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>I was very happy, Mr Speaker, to learn that this Company was run by our own people 

and  it  appeared  to  be  that  50%  of  it  belonged  to  a  Cook  Islander.    We  gave  to  the 

people  licences.  We  all  understand  that  the  Nautilus  Shipping  Company  is  owned 

partly  by  Chris  Manu  &amp;  Company  and  partly  by  the  Captain  of  the  Ship 

</span><span>“TOKELAU”.  Mr Speaker, we see that we have here two locally owned and partly 

</span><span>owned  shipping  companies.    The  problem  that  I  have  is  that  under  the  Act  under 

Clause 3, where the Minister can decline the local company and that company is to be 

totally owned and funded locally and registered locally as well.   

</span></div><div><span>My  concern,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  this  tells  us  or  indicate  to  us  who  or  which  Cook 

Islanders  would  be  well  equipped  to  own  a  shipping  company  as  these  people  are?  

We all know for some of this development  they  have to  have  a partnership  to  kick-

start  their  development.    Our  people  need  large  amounts  of  money  to  kick-start  a 

shipping  venture  like  this.    They  need  to  have  overseas  funding  to  support  their 

projects.  The Triad Maritime did not just come up with that large amount of money 

and start. It went through a lot of hassles and disadvantages and was supporting that 

company at some time.  It took trial and error to get where they are today.  Likewise, 

Mr Speaker, is the development of the Chris Manu Shipping Services.  He had to go 

into partnership with the Captain of the Ship to get that project going.   

</span></div><div><span>Time is running out for me and I have to sum up what I am trying to point out here.  

Firstly, Mr Speaker,  I  would  like to urge to  look  at  the requirement process  that we 

</span><span>initiated in the past two years.  Protecting our own business people and our own local 

</span><span>companies.    I  have  no  problem  with  that,  Mr  Speaker.    But  we  should  not  be,  Mr 

Speaker,  giving  specific  protection  for  people  within  the  industry,  we  should  be 

giving general protection for everybody.  I would urge to encourage competition and I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>387 

</span></div><div><span>feel  that  competition  is  good  for  the  country.    There  is  a  saying:  “Let  the  market 

</span><span>affairs  determine  the  prices  and  let  competition  dictate  the  best  operators  in  the 

</span><span>business market.”  Mr Speaker, I think there is total power under the shipping Act that 

</span><span>gives  total  control  to  the  Minister  of  Shipping  to  determine  who  gets  a  licence  and 

who does not.  We do not need this sort of legislation like this to be brought into force 

of which  are locally owned and which are not.    Because, Mr Speaker, in doing that 

like I mentioned before I cannot see business people locally that can meet the criteria 

stipulated under this Act.  That is my contribution to the Shipping Act.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you very much.  Are there any further speakers?  The Leader 

of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.  HENRY  K.B.E:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  again  this 

afternoon.    I  was  actually  hoping,  Mr  Speaker,  that  the  Minister  would  do,  as  I 

understood  he  was  going  to,  refer  this  Bill  to  a  Select  Committee  of  Parliament.  

However,  I notice Mr Speaker, that the  Deputy  Prime Minister beat  him around the 

head  for  thinking  such  good  thoughts.    Because  you  see,  Mr  Speaker,  I  believe  this 

Bill is quite complicated and I think it has not achieved the objective that all the talk is 

</span><span>making it look like.  It hit the Ministers’ tables this morning.  The Opposition got to 

</span><span>see  </span><span>it  just  after  One  o’clock  this  afternoon  and  we  are  going  to  complete  it  by  Six 

o’clock tonight.  And the Bill in essence, Mr Speaker, reverses the requirement policy 

</span><span>of deregulation in shipping services. It reverses that policy.  It does not promote it but 

I suppose that now that it is in power, it has to do what is necessary to meet the wishes 

of those who particularly funded their campaign.  I can recall Mr Speaker, the Deputy 

Prime Minister and I think he was standing just a couple of tables from  where  I am 

standing now, he was saying he was concerned by the fact that the campaign in this 

country, the electioneering was being bought and dominated by business people.  And 

Mr  Speaker,  this  Bill  before  us  is  the  absolute  proof  of  it.    We  have  heard  the 

explanation by Mr Arnold who drafted this Bill as to how he had sort of covered the 

policies sought by my. 

</span></div><div><span>He  went  further  to  make  reference  to  the  New  Zealand  Shipping  Act.    He  openly 

confessed a conflict of interest in the situation since his law company acts for Triad.  

Despite all of that if you have a close look at the Bill you will see one being protected 

and  the  other  being  victimised  in  this  Bill.    Parts  IV  and  V  of  the  Bill  I  have  no 

problem with because it does address a shipping issue but hidden in the Interpretation 

and  Parts  I,  II  and  III  are  areas  where  the  draftsman  has  actually  hidden  the 

victimisation of Excil shipping service and the protection of Ngamaru II  and Clause 

10 is particularly vicious because it is aimed at Excil Shipping service.   That clause 

plus others preceding it are carefully designed to put Excil out of existence.  Hidden 

amongst other clauses of the Interpretation and Parts I, II and III are phrases designed 

specifically to protect a monopoly situation for the National Shipping Line. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  had  before  this  House  Mr  Speaker  two  minutes  of  a  Bill  designed 

specifically  to  give  a  Minister  the  power  to  sack  the  Chairman  of  the  Environment 

Council. 

</span></div><div><span>We have just dealt with the Electoral Amendment Bill and I believe it is an important 

step  we  are  taking.    The  Environment  Service  Amendment  Bill  was  designed  to 

victimise a Cook Islander. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>388 

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Point of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>A point of order has been raised; what is your point of order. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Alluding to previous debate.  We are dealing with a separate 

Bill  not  with  the  Conservation  Bill.    If  you  have  difficulty  actually  accessing  the 

Standing  Order,  then  Irrelevancy  Standing  Order  No.  193  would  probably  suffice.  

Irrelevancy because he is making reference to a Bill we have completed, debated and 

concluded  in  this  House.    Therefore,  I  plead  with  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to 

temper his emotions.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. I will make a ruling.  

I  will  accept  your  point  of  order  for  Irrelevancy  but  in  my  view  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition  is  talking  about  the  nature  of  the  Bill  before  us  and  associating  it  with 

other Bills has brought in.  I think he is being relevant provided he does not dwell on 

that  point.    I  overrule  the  point  of  order  and  ask  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition to carry on and not to dwell on other Bills. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY  K.B.E.    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  am  sure  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister would agree with your ruling, he knows you are right. 

</span></div><div><span>In this instance and the instance of the Bill what we are now again finding is making 

provision  specifically  to  protect  certain  Cook  Islanders  and  specifically  victimising 

other  Cook  Islanders.    I  make  a  plea  to  the  Minister  responsible  for  the  Bill  not  to 

listen to the Deputy Prime Minister in this instance but listen to his conscience.  There 

is not enough time for those affected adversely by the Bill to bring to the Minister an 

amendment.    There  will  not  be  enough  time  for  consultation  seeing  the  House  has 

ruled t</span><span>his Bill must be dealt with by six o’clock and we all know as Mr Arnold has 

</span><span>admitted  in  this  House  those  who  are  adversely  affected  by  this  Bill  have  not  been 

consulted  or  given  the  opportunity  to  present  their  case.    A  division  within  the 

Chamber  of  Commerce  is  the  Importers  Council.    They  are  fairly  or  very  active 

division  of  the  Chamber  of  Commerce.    If  I  were  the  Minister  in  charge,  I  would 

ensure  that  those  people  had  an  opportunity  to  make  an  input  to  this  Bill.    Most 

certainly,  I  would  require  that  other  shippers,  other  people  involved  in  shipping 

business have an opportunity to read, be consulted and make an input into this Bill.  I 

would recommend to the Minister in charge that he does that.  He will avoid whatever 

criticism might fly around when the Bill is passed if he consults with those who are 

affected.    There  is  an  odour  of  racism  in  the  Bill  that  I  believe  the  Minister  surely 

cannot  be happy about.   While we might  expect that kind  of odour to  appear in  our 

Immigration Act, it is hardly proper that it appears in legislation such as this where we 

are  deliberately  creating  an  unlevel  playing  field  between  our  people  and  foreign 

investors.  I know this particular odour does not bother the Deputy Prime Minister but 

I  am  certain  the  Minister  in  charge  has  a  conscience  and  so  I  make  a  plea  to  that 

conscience and invite the Minister to reconsider and allow the Bill to be referred to a 

Select  Committee  in  order  that  those  who  are  affected  may  be  able  to  make

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Before I call for 

the  next  speaker  would  you  please  resume  your  seat  and  I  will  call  you  when  I  am 

finished.  I wish to inform the House that I will terminate the debate on the Bill at half 

past five so that we can meet the deadline as ordered.  Thank you Honourable Deputy 

Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker,  I stand in  total  and absolute support for this Bill 

before us.  Mr Speaker, perhaps we are privileged to be given information which the 

average member of the public does not have.  I am sure also that we are in possession 

of  information  that  the  majority  of  members  of  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  do  not 

have. 

</span></div><div><span>What we are doing to day is in the interests of this country.  Not the interests of one or 

two or three business people but in the interests of the total population of this country.  

We have received information of a major shipping company with interest in making 

moves  into  this  country  to  take  over  the  shipping  services.    We  are  also  aware  of  a 

collusion  from  certain  shipping  interests  supposedly  serving  in  our  interests  in  this 

country  with  these  sharks.    If  we  do  not  introduce  this  Bill  which  is  simply  in 

</span><span>summary  a  fair  trading  bill  in  the  shipping  area,  when  pieces  of  legislation  are 

</span><span>borrowed  from  the  New  Zealand  shipping  services  and  from  the  New  Zealand 

Commerce Act, there is only one label you can put to it and that is you are going to 

expect fair trading in the international shipping services. 

</span></div><div><span>I am very proud to be associated, Mr Speaker, with the setting up of the Cook Islands 

National  Shipping  Line.    I  was  a  member  of  the  second  Democratic  Party  in  1988 

when a licence was granted to Triad Maritime to bring in the Ngamaru, Ngamaru II.  

You  will  recall  that  around  about  the  same  period  the  New  Zealand  Shipping 

Corporation  was  in  the  act  of  withdrawing  a  shipping  service,  the  Fetu  Moana  and 

other shipping services around about that period and around about that time when this 

particular  foreign  shipping  interests  were  trying  to  gatecrash  the  shipping  services 

here.    Before  the  Triad  Ship  Ngamaru  came  in,  immediately  they  came  into  our 

shipping services. The freight rates went up 35 per cent.  As soon as the Ngamaru II 

came into that service the freight rates went down again.  Although in my view later 

on in their services maybe Triad Maritime may have got  careless and were sluggish 

and  perhaps  naughty  in  their  freight  rates,  nevertheless  they  are  loyal  and  offered  a 

faithful  service  to  their  country  of  origin  and  they  have  now  been  in  service  for  12 

</span><span>years.  You’ve got to give respect when it’s due.  These people have given loyalty and 

</span><span>service to our country for 12 years.  We have got to salute Triad Maritime Company. 

</span></div><div><span>We  welcome  the  EXCIL  Group  but  unfortunately,  their  motives  are  very  highly 

suspicious. The information that we have is that these people will eventually unload 

their interests on to these foreign owners who will then have already given evidence 

that  they  intend  to  swallow  up  Triad  Maritime  if  they  are  permitted  to  do  so.    The 

simplistic  approach  I  guess,  Mr  Speaker,  is  to  turn  around  and  cancel  their  licences 

</span><span>but  that’s  a  simplistic  approach.    We  are  not  stupid.    Like  that  commercial  on  TV, 

which  says,  don’t  be  stupid  and  of  the  day  is  not  stupid  to  just  simply  rely  on 

</span><span>cancellin</span><span>g licences.  That’s a cut throat approach.  That’s piracy.  What we are doing 

</span><span>is to open up a fair and even playing field.

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I  don’t know why the former Prime Minister is  complaining about  it not  going to  a 

</span><span>Select  Committee.    I  can  tell  you  this  is  a  very  </span><span>positive.    We  don’t  govern  by 

</span><span>delegation  by  creating  committees  after  committes  after  committees.  We  govern 

positively  by  doing  things  ourselves  and  this  is  a  clear  signal  to  our  people,  to  our 

business  sector.    We  will  protect  you.    We  will  protect  our  own  against  foreign 

invasion,  against  foreign  threats.    This  is  a  clear  warning  to  foreign  business  sharks 

that  this  will  protect  Cook  Islands  business,  Cook  Islands  interests  against  your 

threats.    You  are  not  dealing  with  a  weakling  like  the  previous  Cook  Islands  Party.  

And a weak  Leader who will delegate  all the decisions to  committees, to  boards, to 

groups. And goodness knows who else. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  we  are  putting  this  amendment  through  and  should  we  need  to  make 

changes later, I am quite sure the Minister of Shipping would be very happy and so 

would our team. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON:</span><span> Yes. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  And my final message to the Chamber of Commerce is we are 

</span><span>with  you  fellas.    We’re  with  you.    Some  of  you  will  do  things  to  serve  their  own 

</span><span>interests  and  not  necessarily  the  majority  of  you  so  we  are  taking  care  of  you,  the 

majority of you members of the Chamber of Commerce. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  conclude  by  thanking  the  Minister  of  Transport,  the  Honourable  Dr  Woonton 

for having the courage and tenacity to put this Bill through.  Congratulations Minister.  

And when the attacks come in  the next  few days do what  I do.  Have a  good laugh 

about it.  No doubt Brett and his friends will be preparing the next Press Statement to 

come  under  the  name  of  poor  Don  Beer  Jnr.    Poor  fellow.    He  is  going  to  have  to 

release  another  statement  prepared  by  others.    So  Minister,  brace  yourself  for  some 

savagery in the next few days but I know these are just small matters that we all face 

as responsible politicians.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  It is now 5.30 p.m. I will now 

cease the debate on the Bill and we will proceed on the rest of the Bill without debate. 

I will put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be Read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK:  </span><span>A  Bill  Intituled:  An  Act  to  promote  fair  dealing  and  to  safeguard 

competition in Cook Islands international shipping services, and to maintain national 

control of Cook Islands international shipping service by encouraging the ownership 

and operation of Cook Islands owned and operated ships.
