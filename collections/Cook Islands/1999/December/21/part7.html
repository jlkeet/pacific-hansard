<div><span>GUILLOTINE MOTION 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Debate on the Third Reading of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill  

be completed by no later than 4.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Excuse  me  Honourable  Members,  the  Clerk  and  I  are  discussing 

something. Sorry Minister, can you just take your seat again. Leader of the House, I 

am  informed  that  you  were  not  going  to  move  the  Motion.    Would  you  like  to 

withdraw it? 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Yes. I never thought about it, but on looking at the way the Leader 

of  the  Opposition  was  talking,  this  is  going  to  drag  on  until  tomorrow  night.    He  is 

talking about Friday. So, maybe we go ahead with the Motion and then there will be 

another Motion for the other Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> All right.  Thank you Leader of the House.  The Motion has been 

moved.  I call for a Seconder,  

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>375 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tapi Taio, Member for Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span> Are there any speakers to the Motion?  I will read the Motion again: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Debate and the Third Readings of the Electoral Amendment Bill 

Be comple</span><span>ted by no later than 4.30 p.m.”</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  I call on the Honourable Tupou Faireka, Member for 

Tupapa-Maraerenga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Mr  Speaker,  I  just  rise  to  offer  some 

views on this Motion.  I understand Mr Speaker, that soon we will be going in-camera 

to  discuss  both  Bills.  I  wonder  whether  it  would  be  more  appropriate  to  wait  the 

outcome of the in-camera discussion and they can then decide what to do after that.  If 

we resolve that there will be unanimous support for both Bills then there may not be a 

need for the Guillotine Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  further  speakers?  

</span><span>Are you replying to the Motion?   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA:</span><span> No. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The  Deputy  Prime  Minister, 

Honourable Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I stand to support the Motion.  It is still possible 

after  the  Motion  is  quickly  passed  that  we  suspend  the  Sitting  to  allow  us  to  go  in-

camera to discuss the Bill.  Then it may well be that the result of that discussion could 

result  in  the  Bill  going  through  the  second  and  third  readings  before  half  past  four.  

And  we  would  also  hope  to  hold  discussions  of  the  International  Shipping 

Amendment  Bill  when  we  have  the  suspension.    The  Solicitor  General  is  in 

Parliament ready to explain these Bills in-camera to Members of the House.  So Mr 

Speaker, this Motion is just a precautionary measure by a very cautious side. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR. G. A HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  As the Leader of the Opposition 

Mr  Speaker,  I  am  willing  and  have  already  indicated  for  us  to  sit  down  and  work 

together  to  produce  a  piece  of  legislation  that  would  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the 

people  of  Pukapuka  and  the  candidates  involved  for  that  constituency.    I  would  be 

perfectly  happy  to  cooperate  towards  achieving  the  best  legislation  we  can  put 

together to govern the by-election of Pukapuka-Nassau.  In fact, Mr Speaker, for your 

information we have already prepared submissions and submitted these but I see there 

is  no  result.    The  suggestions  supplied  by  us  have  had  no  effect  whatsoever  on  the 

original draft, which leaves me to draw two conclusions.   

</span></div><div><span>The suggestions that were put up by the Cook Islands Party did not get to that at all.  

And the second conclusion is if it did get to, did not take any heed of our suggestions 

which makes me wonder whether there would be any good achieved by us going into 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>376 

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>an in-camera discussion.  But I have given my word that we, the Opposition, would be 

willing to go into an in-camera discussion to look at this legislation.  I am happy with 

the  fact  that  we  have  already  provided  our  comments  but  they  have  ignored  those 

comments.    It  is  interesting  that  this  has  not  been  in  for  two  minutes  and  they  are 

already rushing a Bill through without having it translated into Maori, and they have 

already  introduced  the  Guillotine  Motion.    I  do  not  know  just  how  far  the 

arrangements  have  gone  to  closing  our  activities  today  but  I  see  no  reason  why  we 

should finish today when there is an important business before the House.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  There appears to be none.  I will put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Electoral Amendment No.2 Bill </span><span>–</span><span> Second Reading 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Minister of Justice, the Honourable Tangata Vavia. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. VAVIA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I Move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Electoral Amendment Bill be Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before we proceed with the Amendment allow me to give my greetings 

to you and to all staff members.  Greetings also to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime 

Minister,  Cabinet  colleagues  and  Members  of  the  Government.    Greetings  to  the 

Leader of the Opposition and all your Members of Parliament in the House today.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Bill was brought into the House because of the conflicts experienced 

during  the  two  By-elections  on  Pukapuka  and  Nassau.  No  doubt,  Mr  Speaker,  that 

these  By-elections  in  Pukapuka  has  affected  the  people  on  the  islands  of  Pukapuka 

and Nassau.  Even the legal advisers of both Parties concerned in those By-elections 

brought  out  the  confusion  and  doubts  with  the  Law  in  our  Principal  Act.    And  this 

Amendment, Mr Speaker, was brought  into this  House only  after consultations with 

the  legal  advisers  of  both  Parties  and  the  consultations  continued  even  up  until 

yesterday.    As  such  both  legal  advisers  were  asked  to  be  present  in  the  in-camera 

discussions  that  we  will  have  soon.    I  would  just  like  to  remind  the  House,  Mr 

Speaker, that this Bill will only apply to the Constituency of Pukapuka- Nassau. 

</span></div><div><span>At some later stage we will have a look at the principal Act and tidy it up and at that 

time get rid of this.  Without going through the clauses. I  request the House that we 

go into in-camera to discuss the clauses of the Bill and hopefully all Members of the 

House will come to a better understanding.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Vaevae Pare. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>377 

</span></div><div><span>I heard you move for a Second Reading of the Bill whereas the Clerk was expecting a 

Motion to go in camera.  Can you clarify this for us please?  

</span></div><div><span>I am advised we have already dealt with that Motion.  By leave of the House we will 

now  go  in  camera  as  you  are  seeking.  And  we  will  post  pone  further  debate  on  the 

principle and merits until after the in-camera session.  Is that the wish of the House?  

Any objections?  Thank you Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>This Parliament is now suspended until further notice.
