<div><span>PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER took the Chair at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Please be seated Honourable Members, Parliament is now resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>First,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  Titikaveka  Hon.  Robert 

Wigmore for leading our devotions this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  welcome  all  to  the  sitting  this 

afternoon in the belief it will be the last sitting for this year. 

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, I have a letter from the Honourable Member for the Overseas Constituency 

Dr  Joseph  Williams.    Yesterday,  we  heard  verbally  about  his  condition  but  now  we 

have a letter to confirm his situation. 

</span></div><div><span>“</span><span>Dear Sir, As a result of a surgery to my eye, I have been rendered unfit to travel. I 

am therefore unable to  attend Parliament at this last meeting for 1999.  I seek your 

indulgence and that of all Members of Parliament for leave of absence. 

</span></div><div><span>May I take this opportunity to wish you and your staff and all Honourable Members 

of Parliament a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. As we enter the New 

Year,  I  extend  very  best  wishes  to  all  Cook  Islanders  for  a  happy,  prosperous 

millennium.    I  do  so  on  behalf  of  my  wife  and  all  Cook  Islanders  in  the  Overseas 

Constituency.    We  pray  for  unity,  peace  and  prosperity  of  our  small  nation.  God 

Bless.  Dr Joseph Williams</span><span>." 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you for your indulgence Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>Suspension of Standing Order 101.  I call on the Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>I move that Standing Order 101 be Suspended to allow the Translation Motion 

which is on notice to be dealt with now. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tapi Taio 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Are there any speakers?  There appears to be none.  The Question 

is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>371 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Translation  Motion  No.5.    I  call  on  the  Honourable  Minister  Dr 

Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Parliament resolves to proceed upon the International Shipping Bill  

in the English language only 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  May I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Maria Heather</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY,  K.B.E.    </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  you  Mr  Speaker.  Greetings  to  you  and 

every  one  of  us  at  Parliament.  The  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet 

Ministers, Honourable Members and to us on this side.  Greetings to our people who 

are listening in.  I send special greetings to all our people listening in to our discussion 

</span><span>this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>You see Mr Speaker, on this occasion unknown to them there is before this House a 

Bill that has been rushed through but which Bill will affect their cost of living.  The 

Bill is rushed because in fact is not sure what the Bill is about. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Point of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>A Point of Order has been called.  What is your point of order? 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Irrelevancy of debate. We are only asking that the Bill be debated in 

English because there is not sufficient time to translate the Bill in Maori. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.</span><span>I will make a ruling.  The point of 

order is denied.  It is my view that the point made by the Leader of the Opposition is 

relevant to the Motion.  Please carry on Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY, K.B.E.</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Speaker.  Why is  there a need to  move 

this  Motion  and  overlook  the  need  in  this  instance  for  this  Bill  to  be  translated  into 

Maori  so  that  we  can  all  read  it  in  English  and  Maori? People  might  want  to  buy  a 

copy and read it in both Maori and English?  You see this Bill is going to affect the 

lives  of  our  people  in  Rarotonga  and  elsewhere  in  the  Cook  Islands  because  Mr 

Speaker  we  buy  a  lot  of  foodstuffs  from  overseas.    Every  shop,  every  person  who 

orders  goods  from  overseas  is  going  to  be  affected  by  this  Bill.    Every  person  who 

eats  tinned  fish,  tinned  corn  beef,  tinned  peaches,  spaghetti,  a  whole  series  of  stuff 

you find on the shelves of every shop, every person who takes things off the shelf of 

any shop is going to be affected by t</span><span>his Bill.  Why can’t give this Bill be given a bit of 

</span><span>time  in  order  for  us  all  to  understand  exactly  what  it  is  about?  Why  is  it  not  being 

</span><span>translated into Maori, what is the rush? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>372 

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Is there some catastrophe that is going to hit the country?  Is there a hurricane that is 

going to come?  What is the rush?   

</span></div><div><span>I have a very good idea, Mr Speaker, that the Ministers did not  get to read this Bill 

until  this  morning.  I  doubt  that  they  have  read  it.  I  doubt  Mr  Speaker,  whether 

Members of the Caucus have even read the first page. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Yes, we spent a whole morning on it. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY K.B.E:</span><span> If they have, do they not care about the people that they 

represent? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>So much, that is why we’re doing it.</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY  K.B.E:</span><span>  Could  we  not  just  take  time  out  momentarily  to  think 

about  the  people  that  we  represent  and  say  to  them  we  recognise  that  this  is  an 

important issue.  It is important for you.  It is important for the country therefore this 

is going to take time out to think over this thing through carefully. 

</span></div><div><span>I have no doubt, Mr Speaker that later on the Honourable Dr Pupuke Robati is going 

</span><span>to get up and say “in your time you used to do this too”.  If it’s not him it’s likely to 

</span><span>be the Honourable Member, Norman George, maybe the Honourable Dr Maoate, the 

Prime Minister and maybe the Honourable Member, Dr Woonton.  They are going to 

</span><span>get up and say, “you used to do this so why can’t we do it?”.  </span></div><div><span>Over a period of ten years when we were in Mr Speaker, slightly more than ten, there 

may have been one or two Bills that we rushed through this House urgently.  But this 

</span><span>crowd hasn’t been in for two minutes.  They haven’t been in for two minutes and they 

are  already  rushing  the  Bill  through.    Mr  Speaker,  I  don’t  know  that  in  terms  of 

</span><span>accountability to our people, in terms of accountability to those in the private sector, 

to all who are buying things from the shops, and to all who import things from New 

Zealand and are reliant  upon international shipping, are we doing the right thing for  

them. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe, Mr Speaker, that it is appropriate that this Bill be translated into Maori.  I 

have heard no explanation from the Minister in Charge that gives me some sense of 

comfort to agree with having this Bill dealt with solely in the English language.  I am 

sure that we altogether sense our responsibility to those that voted us into this House, 

enough for us to want to do the right thing for them.  Is it right therefore that a Bill as 

important  as  this  be  proceeded  upon  not  in  the  Maori  language?    Is  it  right  that  we 

should  rush  it  through?    My  guess  is  that  maybe  the  Ministers  have  had  an 

opportunity to look through it just this morning.  I have no doubt that the Bill has been 

</span><span>in  action  in  terms  of  it’s  been  constructed  for  quite  some  time.  But  I  am  absolute</span><span>ly 

certain that it was only this morning that the Ministers, not to mention the Members of 

the Caucus, had their first opportunity, Mr Speaker, to read this document.  Because I 

got confirmation about it from the Prime Minister yesterday and from the Honourable 

</span><span>Dr Pupuke Robati.  As of yesterday at the time when we adjourned Parliament none 

</span><span>of them had seen this document.  So maybe they got it last night.  I doubt it.  I suspect 

they got it for the first time this morning. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>373 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I am not at all in support of the Motion.  In fact, Mr Speaker, the indecent 

rush with which this is pushing this Bill through concerns me.  I strongly oppose the 

Motion.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  There appears to be none.  I will put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Leader of the House for the suspension of Standing Order 220. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 220 be Suspended in order for the Bill on Notice  

</span><span>to be tabled forthwith 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Akaoa Mr Tapi Taio 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers?    There  appears  to  be  none.    I  will  put  the  question.  The 

Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
