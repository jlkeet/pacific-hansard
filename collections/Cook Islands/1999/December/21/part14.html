<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>That completes the Second and Third Readings of the International 

Shipping Bill. I call on the Leader of the House for the adjournment Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>DR. P ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House do now adjourn until 1:00pm Wednesday the 22</span><span>nd</span><span> March 2000  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>394 

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Tupapa/Maraerenga Tupou Faireka 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? May I say Honourable Members that this is the time for the 

traditional Christmas greetings before we adjourn but if you do not want  to take the 

opportunity to greet our people, then I will put the question. 

</span></div><div><span>We  are  taking  one  Member  from  the  Opposition  and  one</span><span>Member  from  the 

Government.   

</span></div><div><span>I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  Tupou  Faireka.    Before  I  give  the  Floor  to  the 

Honourable Member, do you have a time frame?  Five minutes? Alright you have five 

minutes Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Through you, let me say thank you very 

much  to  the  House  especially  for  the  session  we  have  just  gone  through.    We 

anticipated  a  whole  week  of  Parliament  sittings  but  today  we  have  come  to  the 

</span><span>conclusion  of  three  days’  debate.    That  shows  how  efficient  business  has  been 

</span><span>throughout  these  days  of  sitting.    I  also  urge  us  not  to  hold  a  session  this  close  to 

</span><span>Christmas.  A lot of us are related to Christmas work in our constituency so it is a bit 

</span><span>harsh  for  Members  to  attend  Parliament  as  well  as  Christmas  functions  in  their 

constituency.  I hope my time starts now. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker through  you  I  give  greetings to  the people of the Cook  Islands.  To the 

Ariki, the aronga mana of the Cook Islands and overseas as well as in Australia and 

New  Zealand.    I  also  give  greetings  to  all  the  religious  groups,  the  Pastors,  and  the 

religious members of all the religious denominations in the Cook Islands.  I also greet 

the  Government  of  the  day,  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet 

Ministers,  Caucus  members,  Kia  Orana.    I  give  greetings  to  two-thirds  of  Cook 

Islands people living in New Zealand and Australia.  Although they may not hear me, 

the point is that I should acknowledge them today as this is my last day to speak in 

this House this century. 

</span></div><div><span>HON DR T. MAOATE: </span><span>Mr Speaker may I seek leave of the House that the address 

and greetings not be interpreted and that each member shall have a big five minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Is there any objection?  There appears to be none.  Leave is granted.  

There will not be any interpretation so you have full use of your five minutes.  May I 

just say we will not be observing the quorum provision too strictly.  You may like to 

go  out  while  a  speaker  is  greeting  his  own  people.  Thank  you  please  continue 

Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. FAIREKA: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. Now I will speak in Maori and thank you 

for  granting  me  my  5  minutes  as  of  now.  I  extend  my  greetings  Mr  Speaker  to  my 

people in Tupapa/Maraerenga. To Vakatini Ariki, Ui Rangatira and Ui Mataiapo, the 

people  of  Tupapa,  all  the  Orometua  and  religions  and  all  the  workers  and  not 

forgetting  our  elderly  people  and  all  our  children 

the  district  of 

</span><span>Tupapa/Maraerenga, Kia Orana in  the name of our  Lord. On behalf of my  wife  and 

</span><span>our children I extend to you best wishes for Christmas and New Year. I wish to ask all 

the young people of Tupapa and the whole of the Cook Islands to take extra care as 

we go through this festive season. We only have a couple more days before we reach 

</span></div><div><span>in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>395 

</span></div><div><span>the end of 1999. We would all like to see the New Millennium so I urge us all to take 

precautions  of what  we  do. To our  young people, please do not  drink and drive. To 

those of us that do not drink, I ask that we help our young people and encourage them 

not to be influenced in doing wrong things that may be detrimental to their lives.  

</span></div><div><span>As Member of Parliament for the constituency of Tupapa/Maraerenga Mr Speaker, I 

would also like to extend my appreciation to all the people in our village. Thank you 

for working together with me in doing things that will benefit our two villages and our 

country  as  a  whole.  I  would  ask  you  all  to  continue  with  your  support  to  all  the 

projects  and  work  carried  out  in  our  village.  I  would  also  ask  that  in  the  New  Year 

that we are entering, we put all politics behind us because there are four more years 

before we enter that arena again. We should leave politics alone and work together for 

our benefit and that of the nation. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all the 

people of the Cook Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE: </span><span>Can we extend until all the greetings are completed?  Shall I 

</span><span>move the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Although the Bill was restricted to six o’clock, there has been no 

</span><span>restriction on the speaking time for the adjournment Motion. Thank you now I call on 

the Deputy Speaker to speak please.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE: </span><span>Are you applying for leave? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Yes, I need a break. 

</span></div><div><span>MR MAPU TAIA: </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker in the name of our Lord. To our Clerk Kia 

Orana also in the name of our Lord. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you 

and your staff for the cooperation that I have seen you provide in the recent past. I am 

also thankful for this opportunity to speak in this house. May the good Lord help you 

all in  the good work that  you are doing for our  people. Please accept  my  Christmas 

and New Year greeting to you all as I stand before you. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to the Government. To the Prime Minister of our country, the Deputy 

Prime  Minister,  to  all  the  Ministers  of  Cabinet  and  to  all  Government  Members  of

Opposition the Honourable Sir Geoffery Henry and all your Members </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana in 

the name of our Lord. I would also like to extend Christmas greetings from my wife 

our  family  and  myself  to  everybody  in  this  House  for  the  good  things  that  we  have 

done this year.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would like to  send my greetings to  my home island Akatokamanava  and the three 

sectors  on  the  island.  To  the  Ui  Ariki  on  the  island,  Ui  Kavana,  Ui  Mataiapo,  Ui 

Rangatira  and  to  the  three  tribes,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all  for  this  Christmas  and  New

</span></div><div><span>Friday to be with your family and your wife for the Christmas and New Year festive

the Northern groups. To all the respected leaders on these  islands, please accept my

Assistant and all the Parliamentary staff, to thank you for your outstanding services to 

this  House for the past  months.  Your able performance, Mr Speaker, in  this House 

has been an enjoyment to be subjected to after years and years of difficulties with the 

Chair.  I  thank  you  most  sincerely  Mr  Speaker,  for  the  standard  that  you  have 

maintained in the House from the time of your appointment.  I welcome to the Chair 

the Assistant Speaker who has now taken over from Mr Speaker just as ably I am sure 

you will be able to continue with our deliberations.

because in the future, you will see big improvements on our island and it will glimmer

since we have been looked after. I understand that some big projects are emerging on 

our  island.  I  would  like  to  send  my  best  wishes  to  our  Mayor  Roger  Malcolm,  our

so  pleased  at  this  time  that  all  Members  of  Parliament  from  Ngaputoru  are  on  the 

same side and in Government. How would it be then that Ngaputoru should not grow 

and  prosper  in  this  five  years  ahead  of  us  because  there  are  now  four  of  us  in  our 

Parliament finding ways to reestablish and strengthen our Forum. Therefore, to the Ui 

Ariki of Ngaputoru we are calling upon you all to unite with us.  

</span></div><div><span>I now come back to all the people of the Cook Islands. On behalf of myself, my wife

our friends who have arrived in our country in the last couple of days, my wife and I

</span></div><div><span>I extend a special greeting to all those that are serving under my portfolios and those 

of my Under-Secretary, the Honourable Vaevae Pare. To the Commissioner of Police

long time for me to familiarise myself with the work of this House and I am sure that 

we will benefit from it. I would like to thank all the Demo supporters, CIP supporters 

</span><span>and NAP supporters that are living  in  my  electorate from the  children to  the elders.

hard to resolve your ensuing problems relating to Bulk Funding. I know that each of 

the islands have been hoping to take on their respected Bulk Funding. For many years, 

you  have  been  misled  into  believing  that  the  Bulk  Funding  will  be  directly  your 

</span><span>responsibility  and  yet,  the  former  Government  didn’t  do  anything  to  realise  that 

</span><span>policy. Now I can assure you that next month your Bulk Funding will be tranfered to 

your  respective  cheque  accounts  so  that  you  will  be  totally  responsible  for  the 

dispersement and the accounting of your appropriation.   Such a move will be in line 

with the devolution process whereby greater responsibilities for the administration of 

the  outer  islands  will  be  devolved  to  you  in  the  forth  coming  years.  I  am  therefore 

requesting the Mayors and the Councillors to put  your efforts together and work for 

the benefit of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  aware  that  come  January,  we  will  have  a  lot  of  projects  to  undertake.  At  that 

time, the Ministry is planning to send some Officials from Rarotonga to  each of the 

islands in order to assist you in formulating your strategic plans. Certain funding has 

been earmarked for this project. 

</span></div><div><span>In  conclusion,  I  would  like  to  reiterate  my  festive  greetings  to  all  the  people  on  the 

outer  islands.  It  is  my  hope  that  at  the  beginning  of  next  year,  we  will  all  unite  in 

working together for the development of our respective islands. Please accept my wife 

and </span><span>my family’s greetings to you all. Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker.</span></div><div><span>HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank  you very  much Honourable Minister. I call on 

the Honourable Robert Wigmore.

and  the  destitutes  to  a  reception  hosted  by  me  and  my  wife  next  week.  I  apologise 

because  we  were  not  able  to  host  you  this  week  because  there  were  so  many 

involvements. Nonetheless, we will be sending out the invitations to all those that are 

involvements in Titikaveka. I hope you will not reject our request to come home and 

</span><span>share  with  us.  I  think  this  is  sufficient  for  now.  Merry  Christmas  and  a  prosperous

</span></div><div><span>DR.  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>  To  the  Deputy  Speaker,  Kia  Orana  to  you.  I  wish  to  extend  my 

greetings to the people of the Cook Islands. Greetings to each one of you from me, my 

wife  and  our  children.  To  those  beyond  our  shores,  Kia  Orana  to  you.  Merry 

Christmas and a Happy New Year. 

</span></div><div><span>To Papa Speaker, Deputy Speaker, the Clerk and all the staff of Parliamemt, I wish to 

thank you for all the good work that you have done in this Parliament from the time 

we commence up to this very moment. So a big thank you to each one of you. I also 

wish  to  comend  the  Members  of  Parliament  for  all  the  accomplishment  we  have 

</span><span>achieved during this short time we’ve been in this House. To the Prime Minister, the 

</span><span>Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  members  of  our  Caucus,  thank  you  very 

much  for  working  together  with  us.  I  would  also  like  to  pay  special  tribute  to  the 

</span><span>Opposition  because  the  are  not  used  yet  to  the  ropes  of  being  in  the  Opposition 

</span><span>because  from  my  observation,  they  are  objecting  to  a  number  of  isuues  we  brought 

into this  House but  their objections are fairly weak.  I believe they had been used to 

being  in  Government  for  too  long  or  maybe  they  are  in  a  very  supportive  spirit. 

Generally  speaking,  members  of  the  Opposition  have  been  very  cooperative  in 

assisting us to complete the Bills that need to be completed. So I would like to extend 

our special thank you to all of them.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Deputy Speaker I now take my attention to my people on the island of Rakahanga 

otherwise  known  as  Tapuahua.  Mainly  because  my  people  of  Rakahanga  confided 

their trust in me to be their representative in this House from the year 1965 up to this 

day. I owe you a big thank you particularly to the leaders of my island, to my family 

members,  all  the  Demo  Alliance  supporters  and  maybe  to  the  CIP  supporters  who 

could have voted for me in the last election. Thank you very muuch for electing me to 

this </span><span>House as your representative. Kia Orana also to those people who didn’t support 

me but it doesn’t matter because there’s only a few of them. Let me assure you that 

</span><span>this is a good Government to lead our nation and I have no doubt that we will prosper.  

Would like to ask the paeople of Rakahanga to remain united, to work together for the 

benefit of our island. I compliment you for enduring the trials of the past and maybe 

under  the  present  Government,  we  will  do  better  especially  when  we  encounter 

cyclones, floods and other natural disasters.  

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Ui  Ariki  of  the  Fuinga-o-Niva,  Tewhaka-heo,  Tewhaingahitu,  to  the  Mayor, 

Council members, Deputy Mayor, Ministers of the three denominations on the island 

and  to  all  the  public  servants,  Kia  Orana  to  each  and  everyone  of  you.  I  wish  to 

encourage  you  in  all  your  undertakings  and  I  am  hopeful  that  I  will  be  with  you 

during the New Year season. I look forward to an enjoyable time with  you if that is 

possible otherwise, I will remain in Rarotonga.  

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  Rarotonga,  I  wish  to  thank  the  members  of  the  New  Alliance  for 

electing  to  coalese  with  our  party  to  form  the  present  Government.  I  believe  our 

people are happy with the present set up and the work we have achieved. I have no 

</span></div><div><a>Page 38</a></div><div><span>21</span><span>st</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>407 

</span></div><div><span>doubt  that  in  the  near  future  we  will  be  able  to  prove  to  you  that  this  is  an  able 

Government through the work that your Members will do for you. All the Members of 

your Government are putting their backs against the wall and working hard for you. I 

believe  that  these  efforts  will  speed  up  the  process  to  involve  our  people  in  the 

development of our nation. Mr Speaker thank you very much to you as we enter the 

festive season. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member Dr. Pupuke Robati Leader of the 

House.  I  now  call  on  our  last  speaker  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  Dr.  Terepai 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T MAOATE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. Kia Orana to you and the Deputy 

Speaker.  I  would  like  to  compliment  the  Deputy  Speaker  for  the  work  he  has  done 

earlier on. To all of us in this honourable House, Kia Orana. To all our listeners, Kia 

Orana  in  the  name  of  our  Lord.  I  join  in  with  the  previous  speakers  in  greeting  our 

people  and  our  good  wives.  Because  I  have  the  opportunity  to  speak  over  the 

television, I feel it is only fitting to extend special greetings to our people in the outer 

islands  because  they  will  not  be  able  to  hear  me  over  the  television.  As  such,  on 

</span><span>behalf of my wife, I am honoured to greet the </span><span>aronga mana </span><span>on each of the respective 

</span><span>islands in the outer islands.  

</span></div><div><span>On my inorgaration as Prime Minister, I took a delegation to Aitutaki and so I would 

like to extend a special greeting to the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Council members and 

all the people of Aitutaki. To the four Ariki, the Ui Mataiapo, Rangatira Kia Orana to 

you all. To all your Honourable Members to Parliament, the Honourable Kete Ioane, 

Teina Bishop and our colleage Paora Teiti who have been absent these few days, Kia 

Orana in the name of our Lord. I am very happy to have visited Aitutaki because our 

journey over there enable us to assure the land owners of their right on the block of 

land  where  the  Rapae  hotel  is  located.  I  believe  that  was  a  great  achievement  and  I 

would like to thank each and everyone of you for looking after us and ensuring that 

our visit was an enjoyable and successful one.  

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to the people of Akatokamanava. To your Honourable Member in this 

House  the  Deputy  Speaker,  to  the  aronga  mana  on  the  island,  the  Mayor,  Deputy 

Mayor, Council members, thank you very much for looking after us. I shed my tears 

on  Mauke  because  of  the  honour  that  you  bestowed  on  me  by  carrying  me  and  my 

</span><span>wife on the liter.  It wasn’t my intention for such an occasion to happen nonetheless, I 

</span><span>would like to  say thank  you very much from  the bottom  of  our hearts for what  you 

have done. 

</span></div><div><span>To the rest of the outer islands outside Rarotonga whom we haven’t visited as of yet, I 

</span><span>would like to assure you that it my intentionto do so as I have done with Aitutaki and 

Mauke. At the beginning of next year, I will try my best to fullfil that. The Minister of 

the outer islands Tangata Vavia should be able to accompany me on such visit. Maybe 

we  will  have  to  visit  Nukuroa  first  because  the  Minister  of  the  outer  islands  comes 

from Nukuroa and I think it is only appropriate if we do that first. This is the planning 

</span><span>I have in place with the Honourable Tangata Vavia who is the Minister of the Outer 

</span><span>Islands Development. There are many things that we wish to inform you but we will 

leave them for the new year when we will have the opportunity to sit down and talk 

with you about the assistances which Government will be able to offer. To all those in

</span></div><div><span>21</span><span>ST</span><span> December 1999 

</span></div><div><span>the  Northern  group  if  you  can  hear  me,  I  would  also  like  you  to  know  that  we  are 

planning to pay you a visit in the near future.  

</span></div><div><span>To Rakahanga and Manihiki. Your Honourable Members are now in the House today. 

I am aware of the projects which they are interested in bringing to your islands and I 

have no doubt that when it comes to the time for us to visit you, we will be able to sit 

together at a round table to sort out how we can assist you.  To Tongareva, I believe 

you  are  the  anchor  for  the  Northern  group  in  terms  of  advancing  development  over 

there. I am also planning to pay a visit to you. Maybe we will not be able to achieve 

all  these  visits  next  year  but  rest  assured  that  we  have  all  these  plans  in  place.  To 

Teuru-o-te-watu,  your Electoral  Amendment  Bill  have been  enacted and the hope is 

that you will not go through the problems that we have encounted during the last by-

elections. Unfortunately, we are required by law to go through with the process of the 

election.  We  eill  have  to  go  back  to  the  poll  and  it  is  our  belief  as  we  have  been 

assured that this Amendment Act will be problem free which will cusion the flow of 

another  by-election  in  Pukapouka  and  Nasau.  So  to  our  Committee  members  in 

Pukapuka Nasau, give your backing to the Government so that we will be able to have 

a member on our side representing you in this House. To the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, 

</span><span>Councillors and the public servants on Pukapuka and Nasau, may the Lord bless each 

</span><span>and everyone of you. 

</span></div><div><span>To  our  people  in  Auaua  enua  and  Atiu-Nui-Maruarua,  may  you  have  a  successful 

Christmas  and  New  Year.  To  the  people  of  Rarotonga,  I  also  extend  to  you  our 

humble words of greetings which  I will reiterate through the television. Therefore, I 

will not spend too much time for you on this radio broadcast. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  that  is  all  I  wish  to  say.  I  extend  to  you  the  Clerk  and  all  the  staff 

members our heartfelt thank you for the excellent work you have done to date. May 

Gos bless us all. 

</span></div><div><span>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all. Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you very much Honourable Prime Minister. Before I put the 

question for our sitting to adjourn, I wish to say a few words. I wish to greet you all

of  leaving  behind  one  thousand  years  and  embarking  on  a  new  thousand  years.  We

you through each day we are involved in our respective work. I also wish to thank my

</span><span>visit, I wish you all the best. There is a wise saying that says “ </span><span>a uu from the long reef, 

the  uu  will  return  to  the  long  reef</span><span>”.  Kia  Orana  to  you  all  and  welcome  back  to  our</span><span>

shores. To all our english speaking friends, our visitors from overseas who are here to 

enjoy the tranquility of our nation, my wife and I wish you all a Merry Christmas and

your respective constituency Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>It is now my pleasure to put the question. The Question is:
