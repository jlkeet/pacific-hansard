<div><span>(MUCH APPLAUSE) 

</span></div><div><span>I just want to thank all the Honourable Members who have expressed their views on 

this Motion.  It is essential again for me to highlight the importance of following the 

rules in the Constitution.   

</span></div><div><span>This particular Motion came about as a result of Article 13 (2)(a) of our Constitution 

which re</span><span>ads: “</span><span>The Prime Minister shall be appointed as follows:  

</span></div><div><span> if  the  appointment  is  to  be  made  while  the  Parliament  is  in  session,  the 

</span><span>Queen’s  Representative  shall  appoint  as  Prime  Minister  a  Member  of 

</span><span>Parliament who commands the confidence of the majority of  the Members of 

</span><span>Parliament.”</span></div><div><span>Therefore in order to appoint a new Prime Minister, you have to express a Motion of 

No Confidence in the incumbent Cabinet of the sitting Prime Minister in order to get 

him moved aside and create a vacancy which then requires you to move this Motion 

to confirm the new Prime Minister.  The first action was under Article 14 (3) (b), this 

is  under  13  (2)  (a).    I  would  like  to  ask  the  next  Opposition  to  please  do  some 

homework before you come back into Government as you would have saved a lot of 

time  today  if  you  had  studied  the  Constitution.    Indeed  we  do  expect  a  quality 

Opposition from you gentlemen and we look forward to that. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and please put the question on this Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I will now put the question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House expresses Confidence in the 

Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate as Prime Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to declare that the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate is the Prime Minister 

Elect and I call upon him to address this Chamber 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. Firstly, I would like to give you a 

special thanks and appreciation for the way you have conducted this Session today.   

</span></div><div><span>To your Clerk and Staff members, Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>305 

</span></div><div><span>The  reason  I  said  that  Mr  Speaker  is,  that  before  I  came  here  I  had  heard  certain 

rumours with regards to how we may be able to deal with the businesses of this House 

in regards to the Standing Orders.  I am glad I was proven wrong and I thank you very 

much.   

</span></div><div><span>I guess His Excel</span><span>lency the Queen’s Representative, Sir Apenera Short and Lady Maui 

</span><span>have been waiting for us for the past two and three-quarter of an hour.  I would like to 

apologise to them on our behalf.  He has been under a lot of pressure ever since we 

held  the  majority  in  Parliament.    Even  then  Mr  Speaker,  I  was  angry  with  him. 

However,  over  the  days  and  weeks  that  we  came  through  I  found  out  that  it  was 

necessary for me, my Deputy, the Honourable Norman George and our colleagues to 

have time to look at what we can do as soon as we come into Government.  We are 

prepared  to  do  anything  that  this  country  requires  us  to  do.  Although  we  were  not 

satisfied in waiting out until the 17</span><span>th</span><span>, which is today, I say thank you for the Queen’s 

</span><span>Representative for being firm on his decision.  Thank you for not allowing anything 

else  to  happen  up  to  this  sitting  of  Parliament.  I  am  referring  Mr  Speaker,  to  the 

pressure on His Excellency to dissolve this Parliament and call a Snap Election.   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  glad  that  has  not  eventuated.  Our  people  are  already  awaiting  to  see  what  the 

</span><span>outcome will be of our political  struggles.  Many  are suffering. Pukapuka-Nassau is 

certainly a good example. 

</span></div><div><span>Nonetheless,  Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  say  thank  you  to  everybody.    Thank  you  to  the 

outgoing Cabinet Ministers, to the former Prime Ministers </span><span>–</span><span> we are privileged in this 

House  to  have  former  Prime  Ministers  as  well.    We  are  privilege  to  have  Papa 

Pupuke, the Honourable Dr Robati as a former Prime Minister.  Sir Geoffrey Henry 

and of course the latest, our former Prime Minister Dr Williams.  I would like to thank 

all of you who have spoken in my favour.  I thank you very much for that confidence.  

I would also like to thank my Deputy, the Honourable Norman George for moving the 

Motion and seconded by the Honourable Pupuke Robati, thank you to the two of you. 

Thank  you  Dr  Woonton  for  your  response  to  the  temptation  that  our  Honourable 

friend instigated in attempting to tear us apart.  Thank you very much.  I would like to 

give  a  special  thank  you  to  my  colleagues  in  the  Democratic-Alliance  Party,  in  the 

New  Alliance  Party  including  the  Honourable  Member  Peto.    I  am  sure  in  the  next 

few  days  he  will  re-consider.    Although  you  have  not  said  anything  to  that  effect,  I 

know what is in your heart. I would also like to thank our supporters, friends and our 

wives  in  the  Gallery,  thank  you  very  much  indeed.    A  special  thank  you  to  our 

Executive  and  Supporters  of  the  Democratic-Alliance  Party  and  the  New  Alliance 

Party. In the future, this will not be called DAP and NAP anymore, it will become one 

Party.  To the Ui Ariki, Thank you for inviting us to come and listen to you and your 

pledge to work together.  Thank you very much indeed.   

</span></div><div><span>I can see I am using most of the time.  I know the Prime Minister, Dr Williams, would 

like to say a few words.  Perhaps some extension of speaking time can be allowed.  I 

would like to support that and I would like to give the Prime Minister an opportunity 

to speak after me. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  would  like  to  invite  or  see  rather  whether  the  outgoing  Prime 

Minister, would you like to speak? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>306 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Mr Speaker, an extension of the Session is being asked 

for to allow me to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you very much.  I call on an Honourable Member to move 

for an extension because we are just about to wind up. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move:</span></div><div><span>That this Sitting be extended until all congratulatory speeches are  

completed and I hope that will be brief and no later than half past six</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Is there a Seconder to the Motion?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Ngamau Munokoa Member for Nikao/ Panama. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Please carry on Prime Minister Elect. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Thank you Honourable 

Members for the kind  gesture.   I thank some of the comments  made by  Honourable 

Members in giving me warnings, especially amongst our people who are now working 

for  Government.    Mr  Speaker,  I  can  assure  those  who  are  worried  that  the 

Democratic-Alliance and the Coalition with the New Alliance are people who do not 

posses that background.    I have made it clear on television that when we come into 

Government we will apply due prudence in our undertakings. If we see projects and 

things that the out-going Government has started or done and is a good project and a 

good policy we are certainly not going to throw it away. However, if you have started 

something that is  not worthwhile for this country and is  a drain  on the supply  I  and 

my colleagues will certainly reject it.   

</span></div><div><span>Allow me just to make one word of comment on the request to establish a three-way 

Coalition.  I have given it very serious consideration when my friend the Honourable 

Tom Marsters came to see me.  To me it is not as simple as we see it.  And the result 

is  not  always  like  what  we  are  hearing.    To  me  it  is  something  that  is  worth 

considering when we  go over the transition  of political  reform.   Because  I can only 

refer to what the former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Henry said.   Whilst he is all for 

this three-way Coalition there is still a binding contract with the Cook Islands Party. 

</span></div><div><span>One thing I want to tell you and this country. Sometimes my colleagues will say I am 

too soft.  I am soft because my heart is kind to my enemies or maybe I should say to 

my Opposition colleagues.  I have one thing in my heart when I am trying to solve a 

</span><span>problem.    I  will  always  want  to  apply  logic  and  reasons  to  every  decision  I  make.  

</span><span>Likewise, if we want to do something for our country.  In what I said on television, I 

</span><span>didn’t  say  that  for</span><span>  no  good  reason.  I  know  you  have  a  very  strong  team  in  the 

</span><span>Opposition and a good Opposition will make a good Government.  Don’t forget, if we 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>307 

</span></div><div><span>are  really  serious  about  political  reform,  while  you  are  in  Opposition,  some  Bills 

beneficial to the country may require consultations amongst all of us. It is our belief in 

our Coalition Government that such be referred to everyone for us to overhaul. Even 

to  bring  it  back  in  a  totally  new  form.    I  think  if  there  is  anything  we  want  to 

demonstrate to our people, it will be the need to be genuine in our commitments.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would like to  suggest  that  we time table our sittings throughout  the term.    I know 

this is something my Government will be looking at - Time Tabling our work.  

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to extend a special thank you to our people in the Outer Islands. To 

those  people  who  have  Members  in  this  Parliament  supporting  me,  Thank  you  very 

much.    I  have  already  made  a  pledge  that  when  I  become  the  Government  of  the 

country,  my  first  travel  will  be  to  the  Outer  Islands.    Even  if  I  have  to  go  by  boat 

again.  To  you all, to the Aronga Mana, and to the Local Governments in the Outer 

Islands,  Kia  Orana  and  thank  you  very  much.    To  my  people  here  in  Tumu  Te 

Varovaro  thank  you  very  much.    To  my  people  also  in  Ngatangiia  thank  you  very 

much.    To  our  people  overseas,  although  you  may  not  hear  us,  through  the  Prime 

Minister, please extend our Aroa to all our people.  To my colleagues in Government, 

</span><span>I  seek  your  support.  Help  me  to  help  you.  To  members  of  the  Opposition,  we  also 

</span><span>need your help. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  sit  down  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  give  a  special  thank  you  to  all  the 

denominations, and the various sectors in our society. The Chamber of Commerce, the 

Sports Organisations, the youth, the women and so forth. A special thank you to all of 

you for having the patience for 35 days to wait and see that we are able to prove that 

we can form a Government. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Mr Prime Minister Elect.  I call on the outgoing Prime 

Minister  the  Honourable  Dr  Joseph  Williams.    After  he  has  spoken,  I  will  ask  a 

Member to move an Adjournment Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>DR.  J  WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  Members  of  the  House,  especially  the  Prime 

Minister Elect, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to make these last 

remarks.  I am sure, I speak for all of us in this House in giving congratulations to you 

Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate Prime Minister Elect, for  your elevation to this high 

office.   

</span></div><div><span>In giving  you this congratulations let me quote the words of one politician.  It says, 

</span><span>“The waiting has been</span><span>long and painful but not in vain, the reward is bitter sweet”.  I 

</span><span>know that you have served this country for a very long time as a politician.  You have 

served  as  leader  of  the  Opposition  for  a  long  time.    Although  this  elevation  to  the 

highest office in the land has been long in coming, at last you have finally achieved it. 

I want to say to  you that it is not an easy job.  On many occasions, it can be a very 

lonely life.   

</span></div><div><span>Let  me  take  this  opportunity  Mr  Speaker,  of  paying  tribute  to  the  outgoing  Cabinet 

</span><span>and Caucus.  To the Deputy Prime Minister Tupou Faireka, the Minister of Justice the 

</span><span>former  Prime  Minister  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry,  the  Minister  of  Finance  Papamama 

Pokino,  the  Honourable  Tepure  Tapaitau  Attorney  General,  to  the  Minister  of 

Education  Teina,  together  with  the  members  of  caucus  that  are  here  today.    To  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>308 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Inatio  Akaruru,  the  Honourable  Tom  Marsters,  the  Honourable  Peto 

Nicholas, my gratitude to you and to the people of the Cook Islands for all the good 

things  that  you  have  done  for  this  country.    To  all  those  faithful  servants  who  have 

served  the  country  in  the  capacity  of  public  servants  as  support  staff  during  the 

duration  of  this  Cabinet  -  this  Government  when  it  began  with  the  Honourable  Sir 

Geoffrey Henry as Prime Minister in 1989 until now. My gratitude to them.  

</span></div><div><span>I  must  pay  tribute  to  the  Honourable  Member  for  Atiu,  Norman  George  and  the 

Honourable  Member  Jim  Marurai  former  Minister  of  Education.  As  I  said  before  I 

enjoyed  working  with  you  and  I  hope  that  enjoyment  will  continue  in  future  in  the 

spirit of cooperation.  I am glad Prime Minister Elect, that you have acknowledge that 

the 35 days waiting was worth it.  It gave you the time to prepare your team to take 

over the reins of the country. 

</span></div><div><span>You see it was not only the QR that stuck to his guns.  So did I as Prime Minister of 

this country.  I would not give in.  I stuck to the Constitution.  When it is your turn to 

move out and make way for the incoming Prime Minister in the future, my advice to 

you is you stick to your guns.  You uphold the Constitution of this country and never 

</span><span>let it down.  That is the supreme law of our country.  If you let it down, then you are 

</span><span>letting the people of this country down. 

</span></div><div><span>I must now turn to your incoming Cabinet.  To the Honourable Norman George. My 

advice  to  your  Prime  Minister-Elect  is  to  tie  a  rope  around  your  neck  and  hold  on 

</span><span>tightly.  Tell  him  not  to  use  the  Political  Frontline.    That’s  not  his  television 

programme.  It’s ours.</span></div><div><span>To  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party,  my  congratulations  to  you 

also.    For  your  forthcoming  appointments  as  Minister  of  the  Crown  -  to  the 

Honourable Tangata Vavia, the Honourable Jim Marurai </span><span>–</span><span> congratulations also.  The 

Honourable  Aunty  Mau,  I  have  left  you  to  the  last.    Not  because  you  are  the  least 

important.  No, rather I want to say a few more words about you. 

</span></div><div><span>Later  on  today,  you  will  be  the  second  woman  in  this  country  to  be  appointed  as  a 

</span><span>Minister of the Crown.  I’m proud of you.  We are all proud of you.  We know that 

</span><span>you will serve  your coun</span><span>try, not only the women folk but the men folk also.  Don’t 

</span><span>forget us, the men.  From this side of the House, our hearty congratulations to you. 

</span></div><div><span>To  Mr  Speaker,  with  your  leave  can  I  turn  and  address  the  women  instead  of 

addressing you?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  </span><span>women  folk  of  our  country.    There’s  a  saying  that  goes  something  like  this.  

“Behind every great man there is a woman”.  This is true in the Cook Islands as it is 

everywhere in the world.  To my sister, Marito, let’s have peace.  To my sister, Nane, 

</span><span>God bless you and God bless you both.  Make sure that you keep these two gentlemen 

on  the  narrow  path  in  governing  our  country  -  likewise  the  wives  of  the  Cabinet 

Ministers, together with the husband of our Mama Cabinet Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally Mr Speaker, let me say  this, particularly to the Prime Minister-Elect and his 

Cabinet.  Unity in this country is inevitable.  It is going to happen.  Whether we like it 

or not political unity will occur in this country.  It may not be in our lifetime as the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>309 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Sir Geoffrey Henry has said but it is inevitable, whether we like it or not.  

There  is  going  to  be  a  new  political  system  in  this  country  and  it  is  up  to  you,  the 

Prime Minister-Elect to make sure that inevitability is brought forward. 

</span></div><div><span>With that, my heartiest congratulations to you Sir.  God bless you all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable outgoing Prime Minister.
