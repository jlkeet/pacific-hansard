Expenditure Review Committee and Audit  for the  year  ended 30 June 1999.   I now

</span></div><div><span>Paper No.15 </span><span>–</span><span> The Report by the Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit 

</span><span>on the Damage to the “KUKUPA”, November, 1999.   I now lay it on the Table.</span></div><div><span>Paper No.16 </span><span>–</span><span> The Report by the Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit 

on an Application for Tere Party Loan Guarantee, November, 1999.  I now lay it on 

the Table. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 17. The Report by the Public Expenditure Review Commission and Audit 

into Tattslotto funds, November 1999.  I now lay it on the Table. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper  No.  18.    The  Second  Annual  Report  to  Parliament  by  the  Public  Expenditure

on  the  Civil  List  relating  to  the  entitlements  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Deputy 

Prime Minister, dated November 1999.  I now lay it on the Table. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call on the Leader of the New Alliance Party the Honourable Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. N. GEORGE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  To you, to the Clerk of the House and to 

all Honourable Members of this Parliament, Kia Orana.  To our visitors and friends in 

the  Public  Gallery  and  those  around  Parliament  today,  to  all  our  people  listening 

around the nation today, Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the relevant sections of the Standing Orders be suspended to allow this 

</span><span>House to take up the Motions that will lead up to moving the Motion to express 

</span><span>confidence in the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate as Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I call for a Seconder to the Motion.   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Rakahanga Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the relevant section of the Standing Orders be suspended in order for the 

Motion for the House to express confidence in the Honourable Dr Terepai 

Maoate as Prime Minister to be taken. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>280 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers to this Motion to suspend the Standing Orders?  There appears 

to be none.  I will now put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Honourable Member Norman George again. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House expresses No Confidence in the Cabinet 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to ask that the vote be taken by standing up.  Under Standing Order 

113, it is standard to express our votes verbally. That is standard practice according to 

the Standing Order 113.  I know the precedent has always been that following a voice 

vote which has been unclear, the Speaker required the Members in this kind of Motion 

</span><span>to  rise  in  their  seats.    While  I  can  categorically  advise  the  House  that  you  will  be 

</span><span>getting 14 affirmative votes in support of this Motion, in the unlikely event someone 

did not hear it properly you will require us inevitably to stand up.  I would humbly ask 

that instead of wasting time on a voice vote, that we go directly to a physical vote and 

ask the affirmatives to stand up when it is their turn and those of a negative opinion to 

stand up when it is their turn to vote.  I also want to express my total objection to a 

secret ballot.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I call for a Seconder.   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Rakahanga Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers  to  the  Motion?  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  Teina 

Bishop.  

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. BISHOP:  </span><span>If the Honourable Member Norman George strongly believes he 

has 14 people who support the Motion, then why not have a secret ballot? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  You people are speaking on the 

procedure to be taken.  I will handle that later.  I will now call for further speakers.  

The Honourable Member Sir Geoffrey Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY  K.B.E:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  Kia  Orana  to  you.  To  all  Honourable 

Members, to our people gathered in the Public Gallery and those outside, Kia Orana.  

Special Greetings to  our people who are  awaiting, possibly with  anxiety, as to  what 

would transpire in this House.   

</span></div><div><span>I  notice  you  have  made  a  firm  decision  in  respect  of  the  procedures  of  the  Motion 

</span><span>which you will handle later.  I support that stance and at the same time with respect I 

</span><span>draw your attention to Standing Order No.2 which places in your hands the authority 

to  handle  procedures  of  the  House  where  Standing  Orders  are  silent.    It  is  not 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>281 

</span></div><div><span>therefore  for  any  Member  of  the  House,  irrespective  of  who  it  may  be,  to  tell  you 

what procedure you ought to adopt.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to oppose the Motion of no confidence in Cabinet.  I take note of the comment 

made by the Leader of the New Alliance Party that he is certain of 14 votes in favour 

of this no confidence Motion.  It places me very much in the minority. But this man 

does  not  have  to  agree  with  what  those  14  thinks.    I  do  not  have  to  agree  to  this 

Motion and express no confidence in Cabinet. I do not have to agree because I do not 

agree  that  everything  undertaken  by  this  Cabinet  was  wrong.    Or  all  that  this 

Government has done is wrong and is not in the best interests of this country or that it 

</span><span>hasn’t done enough to be said to have been in the best interests of this country.  So 

</span><span>while  I  recognise  the  statement  made  by  the  Honourable  Member  Norman  George, 

</span><span>that I might be one of the minority, I don’t have to agree with the Motion that there</span><span> be 

no confidence in this House against Cabinet. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

</span><span>call  on  the  Honourable  Member  for  Tupapa-Maraerenga,  the  Honourable  Tupou 

</span><span>Faireka. You have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  the  staff 

members  of  this  House.   Kia  Orana  to  the  Honourable  Members.  Kia  Orana  also  to 

our friends who are gathered here today to witness what we are going to decide about 

our  Government  today.  Special  Greetings  to  our  people  listening  in  to  our 

deliberations  this  afternoon  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga  as  well  as  our  people  in  the 

Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am quite surprised to see this Motion brought before the House today.  

When  I  looked  at  our  situation,  this  is  what  I  found  out.    This  is  the  first  time  a 

Motion of this nature to such a degree as this has been brought into this House.  The 

Motion states that there  is  no confidence in  Cabinet.  I understand, Mr Speaker, that 

there  is  a  Motion  that  is  already  in  the  House,  a  no  confidence  Motion  against  the 

Leader or the Prime Minister.  There is also another Motion which provides that the 

Honourable  Member,  Dr  Terepai  Maoate  holds  the  support  of  the  majority  of  the 

Members of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I  wish  to  express  my  disappointment,  Mr  Speaker.    What  has  Cabinet  done  that  is 

wrong?  Hence  this  Motion?    Is  this  Motion  trying  to  take  away  some  of  the  good 

things that this Cabinet has done?  I know Cabinet has been in some difficulty in the 

past  and  I  trust  also,  Mr  Speaker,  that  there  are  some  good  things  that  Cabinet  has 

done in the past.  As a matter of fact, Mr Speaker, the bulk of the work that was done 

by  this  Cabinet  was  done  with  the  presence  of  the  Honourable  Member,  Norman 

George.    If  the  reference  of  this  Motion  is  for  the  present  Cabinet  Ministers,  Mr 

Speaker, they only had  a life of ten days or so.   Therefore  I plea to  the Honourable 

Members of this House to be rational in your election on what to support.  

</span></div><div><span>I  came  to  this  House  in  good  faith,  to  congratulate  Dr  Maoate  as  the  new  Prime 

Minister.    I  have  always  held  the  belief  and  understanding  that  we  should  initiate  a 

very good transition between the two Governments. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>282 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I rest here Mr Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  I  call  on  the  next  speaker,  the 

Honourable Member for Penrhyn, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Greetings to you and to the Clerk of Parliament 

and  all  staff  members  of  Parliament.    Greetings  to  the  Prime  Minister,  to  Cabinet 

Ministers  and  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  Government.    Greetings  also  to  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Maoate, Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the 

Opposition and all Honourable Members under your jurisdiction. To the Honourable 

Member,  Norman  George,  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  and  your  members  </span><span>–</span><span>

Greetings. A special greetings to our people who are listening in to our deliberations 

this afternoon </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to oppose the Motion before the House.  If I am correct in listening 

to the Motion as it was put by the Honourable Norman George, he is asking the House 

to agree with him that the Motion, if taken, if the question is put, be taken by standing 

</span><span>up. I do not share the view directed at the ability of Cabinet to run this country in the 

</span><span>past.  I think, Mr Speaker, the spirit of the Motion is that this House does not have the 

confidence  in  Government  or,  in  other  words,  it  expresses  no  confidence  in  the 

Government  of today.   I believe that this is the spirit  of the Motion in  which it was 

placed on this Order Paper before us. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Speaker, having said that, the Motion before the House and before us all is a 

very very important Motion.  It is my view, Mr Speaker, that if this Motion is taken 

and the question put  to this  House,  it should  not be treated quite lightly.  We should 

treat it seriously because of its essence and importance to the people of this country. It 

should comply in full with the procedures.  Standing Order No.2 gives you that right, 

Mr  Speaker,  to  conduct  the  business  of  this  House  as  you  deem  fit.  I  know  Mr 

Speaker,  that  the  Honourable  Members  of  this  House,  holding  it  in  an  honourable 

manner would accord you the respect for the course of action that you should take. 

</span></div><div><span>That is why, Mr Speaker, I rose to air my opposition and my view, and indeed I am 

certain that you would exercise your discretion as to how this very important matter 

should be treated by this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  now  call  on  the  Honourable 

Member for Murienua, the Honourable Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  Greetings  to  you  after  the  short 

break we had.  I also greet your staff and all Honourable Members of this House and I 

think it is also appropriate that I should congratulate all people in the Public Gallery, 

those  on  this  side  and  all  the  ladies  and  gentlemen  sitting  outside  there.    Obviously 

</span><span>our people are taking the events of the day very seriously. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to oppose the Motion.  Not too long ago, Mr Speaker, in addressing 

my  colleagues  in  the  Cook  Islands  Party,  I  spoke  highly  of  Members  of  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>283 

</span></div><div><span>Opposition,  namely  the  Members  of  the  Democratic  Party.    I  told  them  that  in  the 

short  sojourn,  I  had  with  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  Members  of  Parliament,  I 

found these people to be honourable gentlemen and ladies.  I told them that if I had to 

work  with  the  Democratic  Party  I  would  feel  very  comfortable.    This  Motion,  Mr 

Speaker, does not reflect the attitude that I got from the Democratic Party people.  It 

does not reflect the kind of people that I know.  In the short time I had with them I 

was very comfortable, they were good people. 

</span></div><div><span>Whilst  I  support  a  Motion  in  this  House  to  show  confidence  in  the  Honourable  Dr 

Maoate as Prime Minister of this country, because it is the normal procedure of this 

House,  this  one  is  not.    It  is  not  in  my  view  the  attitude  of  Cook  Islands  and 

</span><span>Democratic people.  How can  you say that  you don’t have confidence in a Cabinet?  

</span><span>Especially when this Honourable Member, Norman George stood up in this House not 

too  long  ago  and  said  how  proud  he  was  to  be  associated  with  a  fully  qualified 

</span><span>Cabinet Members. We heard that, didn’t we?  He was boasting about it right here. I 

</span><span>spoke with the people in the Opposition and I said, I did not agree.  I </span><span>don’t appreciate 

</span><span>what this Honourable Member is talking about. Effectively, what he is saying is that 

everybody else in this House is no good.  For him to come today and present a Motion 

</span><span>contradicting what he said in this House, I am asking what kind of person is he? I ask 

</span><span>the  Democratic  Party  people  that  question.    If  that  is  the  attitude  of  the Honourable 

Member,  I  ask  my  colleagues  in  the  Opposition  Bench,  how  comfortable  are  you 

going  to  be  with  him?    I  fear  that  this  Coalition  that  you  have  formed  with  the 

Honourable Member may not last because of his very attitude.  There I will rest my 

remarks Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER</span><span>: Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

call on the Prime Minister, Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS</span><span>: Mr Speaker, like the previous speakers before me, I stand 

to  oppose  this  Motion  strongly  and  to  express  my  mixed  amazement  and 

disappointment in the Honourable Member Norman George.  I want to ask him these 

questions. Which Cabinet are you talking about?  Are you talking about the Cabinet 

you were part of, or the Cabinet that has been in for 7 days?  Is it the Cabinet that he 

was part of the Cabinet he is moving a Motion of no confidence in?  Are you saying 

in  this  Motion  that  you  have  no  confidence  in  a  Cabinet  with  an  open  door  policy? 

That  is  what  you  introduced.    Are  you  saying  that  you  have  no  confidence  in  a 

Cabinet  that  supports  transparency?    Are  you  saying  you  have  no  confidence  in  a 

Cabinet that tells the people what is happening in Government?  With major decisions 

in Cabinet given to the people in Political Frontline every week? And you were part of 

it.  Are you saying you oppose the Cabinet who brought Television into the Cabinet 

room?  For the first time, Norman George, the people saw where decisions were made 

for the first time.  Are you opposing that?  Are you saying you oppose a Cabinet that 

gave the Heat Treatment plant to the growers? Are you opposing that? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Mr Speaker, Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Order.  A Point of Order has been raised.  I call on the Honourable 

</span><span>Leader of the Opposition.  What is your Point of Order please? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>284 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I would like to point out that if we 

are  going  to  continue  with  a  debate  like  this  there  will  be  no  end  to  it.    The  Prime 

Minister  is  embarking  on  a  trail  of  irrelevancy.  The  Motion  is  referring  to  the 

Constitution  of  this  country.  The  Honourable  Member  moved  a  Motion  of  no 

confidence in the present Cabinet, which is relevant to the constitution of this country.  

We know the practice has been that a Motion of no confidence has to be directed to 

the Prime Minister of the day but it does not mean that we have to follow that all the 

time, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Thank you I will make a ruling. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Bring the Honourable Prime Minister back to the Motion 

and stop him from raving on about something else. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  The  Point  of  Order  is  overruled.  In  my  view,  the  Honourable  Dr 

Williams  was  talking  about  the  performance  of  the  Cabinet  and  the  Honourable 

Norman  George  has  the  option  of  replying  to  the  Motion.    Honourable  Prime 

Minister, will you please carry on.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS: </span><span>Thank you for your ruling Mr Speaker.  I ask again, is the 

Honourable Norman George saying that he has no confidence in the Cabinet who has 

given back to the CICC the land in Tepuka that belongs to them?  All the houses built 

for  the  people  have  now  been  given  back  by  the  Government  to  the  Church.    Is  he 

saying  he  has  no  confidence  in  that?    Is  he  saying  that  he  has  no  confidence  in  the 

Cabinet of which he was a part of, who decided to make available money through the 

Cook Islands Development Bank so that people can build more houses and purchase 

more vehicles?  Is he saying that he has no confidence in that Cabinet? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  A  Point  of  Order  has  been  raised.    What  is  your  Point  of  Order 

Honourable Member?  

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Mr Speaker, there is no doubt about it that the Honourable 

Member Norman  George is  not  part of the Cabinet of today.   He is not  referring to 

that Cabinet.  We are not talking about the previous Cabinet.  The Motion is for the 

Cabinet  of  today.  What  the  Prime  Minister  is  saying  is  irrelevant.    Thank  you  Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  This is the second time you have 

raised the same Point of Order which I have overruled.  Please do not raise it again.  

Thank you.  Proceed please Honourable Dr Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Thank you again Mr Speaker.  Is he saying that he has 

no confidence in the Cabinet that saved the land, the vehicles and the businesses from 

a takeover by CIDB.  Is he saying that?   

</span></div><div><span>You see Mr Speaker and Honourable Members of this House, there are many people 

who  are  greatful  to  this  Cabinet.    A  Cabinet  which  is  giving  them  back  a  house,  a 

vehicle.  A  Cabinet  that  will  stop  a  takeover  by  the  Bank.    Is  he  saying  he  has  no 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>285 

</span></div><div><span>confidence in  Cabinet that  tries to  give our people cheaper vehicles? That  is  what  a 

Cabinet should be doing, serving the people of this country. That is what this Cabinet 

has done.  Is he saying he has no confidence in the Cabinet that gives this country a 

booming economy?  Look at the tourist figures.
