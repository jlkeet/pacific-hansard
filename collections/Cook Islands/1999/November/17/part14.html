<div><span>(MUCH APPLAUSE) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you.  I call for a next speaker, the Honourable Sir Geoffrey 

Henry, Member for Takuvaine. 

</span></div><div><span>SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  again.    To  all 

Honourable  Members,  to  our  people  who  are  gathered  here  to  witness  the  events  of 

today and indeed to our people who are listening in to our discussions.  

</span></div><div><span>In  recent  days,  Mr  Speaker,  an  effort  was  made,  particularly  by  Teina  Bishop,  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Member  and  others  to  seek  a  political  arrangement.    That  could  be 

described as a three-way coalition of national unity.  The object is to create some form 

of  political  stability  in  our  country.    To  create  some  kind  of  political  unity  while 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>300 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>recognising  the  differences  between  the  three  groupings.    The  object  is  stability, 

integrity, unity in diversity. The idea was to create that atmosphere as we all lead our 

country into the new century.  

</span></div><div><span>To a larger than lesser extent, only we the politicians can bring this change about.  It 

is  a  question  of  how  much  we  desire  that  objective  more  than  the  desire  of  those 

desiring  power.    I  was  asked  to  look  at  a  set  of  documentation  that  required  my 

signature,  which  could,  if  accepted  by  the  leading  politicians  of  this  country,  create 

the  foundation  for  establishing  this  form  of  unity  in  diversity.    I  signed  all  those 

documents, Mr Speaker, agreeing that the leadership be with the Democratic-Alliance 

Party and that they decide the leadership. Whoever comes into Cabinet while we work 

with NAP to decide what happens to our side.  I believe the idea has a great deal of 

merit.  It could create a political utopia and could be the forerunner of major changes 

in  the  political  lives  of  this  nation  and  the  political  schemes  and  structure  of  this 

country. But the idea was rejected by the leadership of the Democratic-Alliance Party 

and the New Alliance Party.  So perhaps it is an idea Mr Speaker whose time has not 

yet  come.    Maybe  there  is  a  time  somewhere  ahead  of  our  lives,  somewhere  in  the 

future when the circumstances will be such that the idea will find roots in the political 

</span><span>grounds  of  this  country.    Maybe  it  is  us  politicians  of  today  who  will  be  sprinkling 

</span><span>water on this new thing that is growing.  And maybe it is the generation after us.  But 

sometimes tomorrow it maybe that the time will come when this utopian political idea 

that  we  are  talking  about  will  come  about.    In  the  meantime  Mr  Speaker,  given  the 

current political situation,  there being no real changes in the political structure of this 

nation,  I oppose the Motion of Confidence in the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate.   

</span></div><div><span>I do so Mr Speaker, conscious of the very real fact that I am the Leader of the Cook 

Islands Party today and can not be part of the Motion that puts someone else outside 

of  my  party  to  be  the  leader  of  Government.  There  are  several  Cook  Islands  Party 

supporters out there who voted certain people into this House to stay with the Party 

and to vote for the leadership of the party that that group of people put together.  And 

I as a Member of that Cook Islands party elected into this House has one contract and 

my one and only contract is to those people who elected me into this House.  It is my 

duty even at this moment Mr Speaker, knowing that the changes are about to happen, 

it  is  still  my  duty  to  remember  that  contract  to  those  people.    My  respect  for  Dr 

Terepai Maoate has nothing to do with the issue.  It is the trust I hold for the people of 

the Cook Islands Party and the trust that they hold for me and all the members of the 

Cook  Islands  Party  elected  into  this  House  by  them  is  more  important  to  me.  

Therefore, from the beginning to the end of the Motion that is before us, I will stand 

by that trust.  

</span></div><div><span>I  will remind the House  I  am  a Cook  Islands Party person.  I will remind the House 

that  I  am  the  Leader  of  the  Cook  Islands  Party  and  I  will  not  support  the  Motion.  

Were the arrangements different, I would have been prepared to honour the signature 

I  put  on  the  documentation  that  was  presented  to  Dr  Maoate  on  Sunday.    We,  Mr 

Speaker,  will  go  into  the  Opposition  and  as  Dr  Terepai  Maoate  himself  said,  the 

current Leader of the Opposition, we will make a good Opposition.  That is what he 

</span><span>told Radio New Zealand when he was interviewed.  We will do our job by the people 

</span><span>who voted us in by the people of this country. We will provide assurances to that time 

we are in the Opposition our loyalty to  Her Majesty the Queen, Her Successors and 

Her Heirs.  And while in Opposition  we will demonstrate our support  for all that is 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>301 

</span></div><div><span>good for this country and for the traditional leaders of this country.  In fact, we will be 

such a good Opposition, that the Government of tomorrow will have a lot of difficulty 

to get anything through this House.  

</span></div><div><span>For the time being, knowing that very shortly the Motion will be taken, and that we on 

our  side  do  not  have  the  numbers  to  counter  the  numbers  that  will  be  moving  the 

Motion,  I  recognise,  Mr  Speaker,  that  in  a  few  minutes  time,  the  Honourable  Dr 

Maoate will become Prime Minister Elect.  I wish him as the incoming Prime Minister 

- the very best wishes from the Cook Islands Party. And also the one very firm man of 

integrity from Avatiu-Ruatonga, in our midst and all those who support him. We are 

not  saying  we  like  you  Honourable  Dr  Maoate,  but  seeing  you  are  going  to  be  the 

Prime Minister of our country we wish you the very best.  The same goes as well to 

all those you choose to be your Cabinet Ministers and the one that you choose to be 

your Deputy. To all their spouses, wives and husbands, we wish you all the very best 

as  you  hold  and  manage  the  helm  of  our  little  nation.    May  God  Bless  us  all,  Kia 

Orana and good luck. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  on  the  next  speaker.  The 

</span><span>Member for Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span> Greetings to you Mr Speaker and also to the Clerk who is doing the 

work at the Table.  To all Honourable Members on that side of the House, Greetings 

to you all.  Greetings to our leader who is about to become the Prime Minister. To the 

Deputy  Leader  and  to  all  Honourable  Members  on  this  side,  greetings  to  you  all.    I 

trust I will be the last speaker of the day before we close our meeting.  The word of 

</span><span>God says, “The leg is the trap for the animal but the tongue is man’s trap”.  We have 

</span><span>to  debate  over  this  very  crucial  matter  and  Mr  Speaker,  you  who  have  been  in  this 

House for a very long time and I trust you will be our guide.  Maybe you have been 

used  to  this  kind  of  deliberations.  As  we  move  on  into  the  new  millennium  this 

Parliament is  garnered  with  new members. This  is  a new era for us.  So  I appeal  to 

this House to rise up to the challenges, make a wise decision.  I trust all of us in this 

House  are  not  under  forty  years.    We  are  grown  ups  so  let  us  not  go  back  to  our 

</span><span>childish ways.  As St Paul said, “</span><span>when I was a child I acted like a child, but when I 

became a man, I acted like a man</span><span>”. Likewise, we should follow the teachings of Paul. </span></div><div><span>I am hoping that when I finish my speech, we will put the question.  I strongly support 

the Motion that the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate becomes the Prime Minister now.  

The  Members  on  our  side  strongly  support  the  Motion.    I  would  like  to  show  my 

respect to all the Government Members for what you have done in the past.  Let us 

not  allow  our  politics  to  separate  our  blood  ties.    Today,  I  know  that  our  political 

involvement are affecting us, but I hope it will not severe our blood relationships.  A 

lot of problems we see today were not caused by the leaders but by their subordinates 

and  the  persons  administering.  A  lot  of  them  create  all  kinds  of  chaos  but  short  of 

informing the leaders.  I know this is true because it happened on my island.  I would 

like to appeal for us to arrest all these problems in the best way that we can deal with 

these matters. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  now  sit  down  and  let  this  House  decide  on  this  Motion  affecting  the  Prime 

Ministership of the Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>302 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  call  upon  the  Honourable 

Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>I would like to ascertain my firm support for our leader to become 

the Prime Minister of the country.  I would like to give my appreciation Mr Speaker to 

the Honourable Tom Marsters, the Honourable Tupou Faireka, and the Prime Minister 

Dr Joseph Williams.  I do not support the views raised by the Honourable Member for 

Takuvaine concerning his objection to this very important Motion today. He is the one 

who created this problem, he gave the Prime Ministership to Dr Joseph Williams for 

the reason that he wanted the Cook Islands Party to become Government. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  What is your Point of Order 

Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Thank you Mr speaker. Irrelevancy in Debate. The Honourable 

Member  Dr Pupuke Robati is  true to  form continually irrelevancies in  debate.   You 

see Mr Speaker, there is nowhere in the Motion before the House where you find the 

name  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry  Member  for  Takuvaine.    If  there  had  been  a  name  Dr 

</span><span>Pupuke  Robati  in  the  Motion  before  it  was  Tabled,  before  it  was  taken  over  by  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member Norman George I would have had a lot to say about him.  My 

request Mr Speaker, is for you to ask the Honourable Member to take his seat as he is 

introducing  a  contentious  subject.    We  are  about  to  make  a  vote  that  will  settle  an 

</span><span>issue, so let’s get on with it.</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>The  point  of  order  is  upheld  Honourable  Member.    I  don’t  know, 

</span><span>maybe  you  have  an  old  quarrel  with  one  another.    I  would  have  thought  that  the 

coming together of your children would have brought peace. But do carry on and be 

relevant. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>I was saying I support all the views expressed in the House except 

of  course  the  one  view  that  was  his.  I  did  not  support  that.    I  also  think  people  are 

trying to plan a Government that will bring peace to our people.  I can see this House 

giving  its  support  to  the  Motion  of  the  Honourable  Dr  Terepai  Maoate  to  become 

Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Well the point of order is unnecessary.  I call on the next speaker, so 

will you please resume your seat. 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Honourable Member Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>MR I. AKARURU: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to us all this afternoon.  I rise 

to  give my opinion on the Motion.   I would like to  express  my  views but  not  to  be 

misinterpreted.  I am not despising or belittling the election of Dr Terepai Maoate. I 

would like to air my honesty. I know we will have a new Government in an hour or 

so.  I know Mr Speaker the nation is waiting for a new Government. 

</span></div><div><span>But there are a few things I would like to put to the House today.  Since the elections 

</span><span>in  June  and  the  by-election  of  Pukapuka  at  the  end  of  September  there  has  been 

speculations of a hit list by the Democratic Alliance Party that has been discussed.  I 

also know, Mr Speaker, that there are some people in the Democratic Alliance Party 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>303 

</span></div><div><span>who have their own hit list.  I would like to ask that we not do this anymore because 

you would want a good start for the new Government. You would want our people to 

be happy.  I would also like to ask the new Government that with your old habits of 

creating  an  atmosphere  of  secrecy,  especially  the  travel  by  Members  and  Ministers, 

</span><span>please don’t do this again.  I am certain that there are some good things in the policies 

</span><span>of the Democratic Alliance Party. We need to have a spirit of co-operation in seeking 

ways to move our country onto new horizons. Mr Speaker, my name was signed on 

the document that was  seeking a Government  of national  unity to  accommodate our 

diversity.    I  believe  that  this  was  one  way  we  might  be  able  to  get  a  stable 

Government. It could have been the way to get our people together to work as a united 

force. So, I decided to put my name to that document. I also want to support the move 

then for the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate to be Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  this  Motion  intends  to  get  rid  of  politics.    We  have  supporters  in  our  parties.  

We  have  policies  which  stipulate  what  we  stand  for.  We  have  our  own  aims  to 

provide us with a guide line. So, how can I support this Motion? In making that stand,  

allow me to state that I  do support the new Government and the new Prime Minister.  

I wish him and the new Government all the best.  Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. 

</span><span>Maybe the Cook Islands Party needs this time to recollect and regroup. Who knows, 

</span><span>maybe  in  the  next  three  months  we  may  reclaim  the  Government.  Honourable  Dr 

Maoate, should you have a problem, know that it will come from within your group 

and not from us. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like you to remember that. I am looking forward to the days when we will sit 

on  the  Opposition  Bench.    I  know,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  will  be  a  good  Opposition 

team.  We will be there to watch Government, to ensure that the activities they do are 

</span><span>done  for  the  benefit  of  the  people,  to  ensure  that  Government  doesn’t  waste  public 

</span><span>funds.    That  the  policies  of  the  new  Government  does  not  trounce  our  country  into 

another hole. People say that the Opposition is only a force in name. I differ in that the 

Opposition  is  there  to  ensure  that  Government  administer  the  affairs  of  the  country  

properly. 

</span></div><div><span>At this point, Mr Speaker, I would like to take this time to thank the two people who 

have been Prime Ministers of our country since our General Election on the 16</span><span>th</span><span> June.  

First  of  all  to  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry,  the  out-going  Prime  Minister  who  was  then 

replaced by the Honourable Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you  very  much  to  you  gentlemen  for  what  you  have  done  for  our  country. 

Today we have a new Captain, a new skipper to steer our ship.  He is coming aboard 

with his own officers and his sailors to sail our ship into the future.  Congratulations 

to you Dr Terepai Maoate and congratulations also to all of the Democratic Alliance 

Party.  Well done.  You have done what  has  been expected of  you and  may  you do 

well until the day when there is a further change in Government. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Are you going to reply? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Yes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call on the Honourable mover of the Motion, Norman George to 

reply. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>304 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  sure  those  who  have  been  patiently  listening 

will be happy to hear that I am using the final two minutes before we put this Motion 

to a vote.  Then we can all go home afterwards. 

</span></div><div><span>It is also the last two minutes that Dr Joseph Williams will be Prime Minister.
