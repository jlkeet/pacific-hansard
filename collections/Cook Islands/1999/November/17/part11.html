<div><span>(MUCH APPLAUSE) 

</span></div><div><span>You know the caliber we have in our team. We have new and old guns.  I have been 

</span><span>in  this  House  for  a  short  while  but  we  will  learn.    So,  when  I  finish  speaking,  let’s 

</span><span>wrap  up  everything  and  finish  this  Motion  so  that  we  will  be  able  to  journey  to  the 

</span><span>Queen’s Representative’s residence for the swearing in. This is my request to you all.  

</span><span>Enough talking, do not confuse our people listening in to our debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I call on the Mover to reply. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  We are running out of time and we want 

to  be  Government  as  soon  as  possible,  so  I  shall  be  very  brief.    I  am  very,  very 

disappointed  with  the  comments  by  all  of  the  about  to  disappear  Government 

Members.  Mr Speaker, I can accept the Honourable Member Albert Nicholas for not 

understanding  the  Motion  before  us.    I  forgive  him  for  that,  but  the  rest  I  cannot 

forgive their total ignorance of the Motion.  This Motion has to be tabled.  I direct you 

</span><span>to  </span><span>Article  14  3(b)  of  the  Constitution  which  says:  “The  appointment  of  the  Prime 

</span><span>Minister shall also be terminated by the Queen’s Representative if Parliament passes a 

Motion  to  express  words  of  no  confidence  in  the  Cabinet.”    The  Constitution  says 

</span><span>Parliament </span><span>must express the no confidence in the Cabinet. That’s what we are doing. 

It’s not because I don’t like you.  It is not because of our sour relationship.  No.  It is 

</span><span>because a man has got to do what a man has to do.  Therefore, in order for the new 

Government  to  be  formed,  in  order  for  the  new Prime  Minister  to  be  appointed,  we 

have to go through with this. That is why we tabled this Motion.  This is not a trial of 

the Cabinet. We do not have to find fault, but if you look at your numbers for example 

today  there  are  only  10  members  on  your  side  in  Parliament,  10  against  our  14.  

</span><span>That’s a major ground, in fact that is the major ground why the no confidence Motion 

</span><span>is tabled because you cannot govern any more.  You know that. You knew it 35 days 

ago but you are ignorant and stupid. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> A Point of Order has been called. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  I want him to withdraw his unparliamentary comment. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Will you withdraw those words, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> The words stupid and ignorant,  I reluctantly withdraw. The fact  

that for example they ran out of numbers is a clear indication why such a Motion is 

inevitable  and  if  there  were  any  senses  of  honour  in  the  Prime  Minister  Dr  Joe 

Williams he should have resigned 35 days ago.  The problem he and his team created 

is that we have suffered under the cloud of dishonour, disrespect and instability of our 

political  life  in  the  last  35  days.    This  country  has  never  experienced  such  a 

</span><span>Government  as  this.  The</span><span>y  are  worse  than  a  mule.    You  can’t  drag  it  out,  you  can’t 

</span><span>push it out. We have to do the inevitable and this is to move this Motion in the House 

today.  This is brought about because of your stubbornness.  You have taken away a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>295 

</span></div><div><span>lot of honour and respect between ourselves.  Each time we come to an agreement you 

break it.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, that is the reason.  I want to assure our people listening in that we will be 

the Government  in  the next  hour or so because  we have the majority in  this House. 

We will be the Government by the time the House adjourns tonight. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Before I put the question, let me 

say a few words of explanation.  I would like to apologise if  I have misled some of 

you during this Sitting concerning voting on the question of confidence.   

</span></div><div><span>In the Standing Orders, there is only one provision requiring the election and that is of 

the Speaker which is by secret ballot. There is no mention of how the Prime Minister 

is to be elected.  I wanted to lift the election of the Prime Minister to the same level as 

that of the election of the Speaker.  However, I am advised by my legal advisers that 

the question on how the confidence Motion is to be decided is in Part 25. That is from 

Standing Orders 111 to 114.   Therefore, I regret to inform you that I am required to 

follow the Standing Orders as required in  our Standing Orders.   I will therefore put 

</span><span>the Question and there are two answers, “Ayes” or “No”.</span></div><div><span>The Question is:  

</span></div><div><span>That this House expresses No Confidence in the Cabinet? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Now we move to Motion No.4. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House expresses Confidence in the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate 

as Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>And may our Almighty God support and Bless him, his wife and family. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call for a Seconder.   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Rakahanga, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  speakers?    I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  for  Arutanga-Reureu-

Nikaupara. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I wish to Move an amendment to the Motion.  It is not 

with  disrespect  to  Dr  Maoate,  I  have  every  confidence  that  Dr  Maoate  can  be  the 

Prime Minister of this country and lead this country with dignity. If this Amendment 

</span><span>to the Motion does not survive by all means let’s just take that as the indi</span><span>cation that 

</span><span>Dr Maoate will be the Prime Minister of this country.  I wish, the person that I name 

</span><span>with regards to the Amendment of this Motion, would wait until I finish talking and 

maybe wait until the Seconder to the amendment of the Motion would finish talking,  

then he can decide whether to agree to it or not. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>296 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>I wish to express and tell the people of this country that the merit of this Motion is to 

stop this political nonsense that is going on.  It is not to keep the Cook Island Party in 

Government. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Excuse me Honourable Member, would you please take your seat. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  BISHOP:  </span><span>Mr</span><span>Speaker,</span><span>the  amendment  is  that  the  name  of  Dr  Maoate  be 

replaced by Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>I  was  going  to  ask  you  for  your  amendment  first  before  you 

continue speaking.  Honourable Member I must inform you that I have not received a 

notice from  you of your intention to amend this Motion.  Therefore, I cannot accept 

your amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the next speaker, the Honourable Dr Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  am  surprised  this  afternoon  that  without  my 

</span><span>permission my name is brought into this House and nominated as Prime Minister.  As 

a show of respect and courtesy, I think you should ask me first before you bring my 

name in this House.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand here Mr Speaker to support my Leader the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate as 

Prime  Minister  of  this  country.    I  have  every  confidence  in  him  and  that  is  final. 

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Are  there  any  further  speakers.    I  call  on  the  Honourable  Tupou 

Faireka member for Tupapa Maraerenga. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:    </span><span>Kia  Orana.  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  rise  to  say  a  little  bit 

about this Motion.  Mr Speaker I think there is merit in this Motion.  We have gone 

through  the  turmoil  of  politics  in  the  past  weeks  and  months.    We  have  seen  the 

hatred,  the  dislike  and  trouble  that  has  been  caused  by  this  anomaly  in  our  political 

system.    Today  we  are  coming  to  the  conclusion  by  this  Parliament  in  deciding  the 

future  Leaders  of  this  country.    I  do  have  the  confidence  in  the  Honourable  Dr 

Maoate. That is not disregarding my confidence in my Honourable Prime Minister at 

the moment. But Mr speaker, I am trying to put out a message here that, whoever is 

going to  govern in the next few minutes, to look carefully as to how we can fix the 

anomalies of a system that is hurting our people.  It is inevitable that this Motion will 

survive.  They have 14 and we have ten so Mr Speaker, there are also other leaders in 

the Coalition Government that can lead this country.  They have also the experience.  

They  are  the  grass  roots,  the  anchor  of  Parliament  who  can  assist  Cabinet  to  make 

wise and good policies for the running of our country.  We have also the supporters of 

the Opposition here to see the new leaders take over the office of Government.  We 

have heard and discussed some of the things that the Coalition Government would do 

</span><span>for our country and I do support most of them.  I am pleading to the new Government 

</span><span>to please continue the reform that we this Government has initiated in 1996.  You do 

not have to carry out all the reforms that we have done but look at the good ones, look 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>297 

</span></div><div><span>at  the  ones  that  are  applicable  and  please  carry  them  forward  for  the  sake  of  our 

people. 

</span></div><div><span>If there are policies and reforms that does not support the development then change it 

and bring in new reforms.  I ask you to be open regarding your policies.  I would ask 

you to look at the suffering some of our people are going through and if we have not 

tended to that then please tend to it.  You have said that this Government has run this 

country  for  ten  years  and  it  looks  like  you  are  going  to  take  it  over  from  now  on.  

Beware of the evil that exists in us.  There are some good advisors, there are some evil 

advisors,  I  tell  you  that.    When  we  took  the  reform,  we  put  some  of  our  people  in 

misery. Over 2,000 Public Servants.  There are only just over 1000 of them working 

for Government today to earn their bread to feed their families.  I am pleading with 

you, do not make them suffer more.  Do not make them suffer more because they are 

CIP supporters or New Alliance Party supporters.  If they sin at their work, yes bring 

in your supporters or whatever person can do a better job.  

</span></div><div><span>Today let me say that our prayers have been answered.  We in the Government have 

prayed to God the same God that you have prayed to give a decision today and you on 

</span><span>the other side and your supporters have prayed to the same God for the same decision.  

</span><span>In two or three minutes time, that decision will be given and I believe that is God’s 

</span><span>decision.  Let me just finish  by saying these wise words of a former Prime Minister 

</span><span>Harold  MacMillan  of  Great  Britain.    “The  wind  of  change  is  blowing  through  this 

</span><span>country, whether we like it or not this growth of national consciousness is a political 

</span><span>fact.”</span></div><div><span>Let just hope that this change is for the betterment of our people in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I call on the Honourable Member 

Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:  </span><span>Greetings  again  Mr  Speaker  and  to  Honourable  Members  of 

this  House.    Mr  Speaker  I  rise  this  time,  to  speak  on  the  new  Motion  before  the 

House.  The Motion is expressing confidence in the Honourable Dr Maoate as Prime 

Minister of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>Unlike  the  last  Motion,  Mr  Speaker,  where  I  strongly  opposed  the  merits  of  that 

Motion,  this  one  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  express  my  support  as  stated  by  the 

Honourable Tupou Faireka. I also show confidence in the Honourable Dr Maoate.
