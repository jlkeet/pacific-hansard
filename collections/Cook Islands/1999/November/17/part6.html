</span></div><div><span>You opened a “Pandora Box”. So sit there and take it.</span></div><div><span>Is he saying that because our hotels are full and our motels are full, is he saying that 

he has no confidence in the Cabinet that has done this?  You see I enjoyed working 

with you in Cabinet.  I would have taken my hat off for you but you spoiled it all. You 

were  naughty.  You  went  to  the  other  side.  You  spoiled  the  whole  thing.    If  only  I 

knew before hand that you were going to do that, I would have asked my friend on the 

other  side  of  the  House,  my  friend  in  the  far  corner,  to  join  with  me  and  he  would 

have.  I support the words of the Hon. Tom Masters for Murienua.  If you had brought 

a Motion of no confidence in me rather than Cabinet and allowed the process to take 

</span><span>over, I wouldn’t have minded. </span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  May  I  interrupt  please  Prime  Minister?    Can  you  take  your  seat?  

Thank you very much.  Now it is time to take a break.  This House is now adjourned 

until  3.00  p.m.    And  we  would  like  to  invite  all  our  visitors  to  afternoon  tea  in  our 

dining room.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING SUSPENDED AT 2.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span> SITTING RESUMED AT 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Parliament is resumed.  The last speaker before we adjourned was 

the Honourable Dr Joseph Williams.  You have two more minutes, Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  J.  WILLIAMS:  </span><span>I  am  surprised  at  your  ruling  Mr  Spe</span><span>aker  but  I  won’t 

</span><span>question your decision. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me ask the Honourable Norman George this question.  Does his Motion include 

the Honourable Member Jim Marurai who was part of that Cabinet?  He was part of 

that Cabinet with the Honourable Member Norman George.  Are you saying that you 

have no confidence in the Honourable Member for Mangaia? Are you saying that?  If 

</span><span>you have no confidence let me put it to you, why don’t you give it to the country and 

</span><span>let them decide?  If you have the guts to test the validity of your Motion put it to the 

country.  Let the people decide.  I can tell you what the outcome is because you have 

been a naughty boy and you are going to be out and Peto will take control. He will be 

the  new  Leader  who  has  always  had  confidence  in  Cabinet,  in  this  Cabinet,  in  the 

Cabinet which you and the Honourable Jim Marurai have been part of and that was a 

good Cabinet.  You see this one has only been in for seven days.  History has been 

made by this Cabinet.   

</span></div><div><span>The Deputy Prime Minister has been in office for the shortest time in the history of 

politics.  The Minister of Education has been in that position for seven days.  I have 

every confidence in Cabinet including these two.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Before I call for the next speaker, 

please  Dr  Woonton,  may  I  just  remind  Honourable  Members  that  when  you  are 

talking  about  a  Member  of  this  House,  address  that  person  by  the  title  Honourable 

Peto Nicholas, please.   

</span></div><div><span>Secondly you talk to the Chair, do not talk directly to an Honourable Member.  You 

</span><span>say  Honourable Norman George and so  forth.    Do not  say, “you”.  Thank  you very 

</span><span>much. 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Honourable Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  a  very  special  Kia  Orana  to  all 

Honourable Members of this House, not forgetting our people in the outer islands.  Mr 

Speaker,  before  us  is  a  Motion  moved  by  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Coalition 

Norman George.   

</span></div><div><span>Before I make my views on this Motion, I would like to express my support for this 

</span><span>Motion.  You see Mr Speaker, it is not the Honourable Norman George who invented 

</span><span>the  Motion  before  the  House  today.    It  was  the  result  of  many  specialists  and  legal 

minds who advised the Motion to be placed before the House today.  The sole purpose 

of that Motion is to follow the constitution of this country.  It is not a reflection on the 

current composition of Cabinet.  It is however with consideration to the Honourable 

Prime  Minister  of  the  country  that  we  thought  it  will  soften  the  blow  to  him  if  we 

moved a Motion that it is a no confidence Motion against the Cabinet.  It will go in 

history  that  it  is  not  a  lack  of  confidence  in  the  Prime  Minister,  it  is  a  lack  of 

confidence in the Cabinet.   

</span></div><div><span>However,  after  listening  to  the  Government  Members  tearing  down  the  Deputy 

Leader  of  the  Coalition,  I  could  not  help  but  feel  they  are  personally  attacking  the 

Honourable Norman George as the sole perpetrator of this Motion before the House </span><span>–</span><span>

this unsavoury Motion.  I tell you what Mr Speaker, we did have some confidence in 

the current  Cabinet. Th</span><span>e whole 14 of us.  It  wasn’t until  Monday of last  week  when 

</span><span>our confidence started waning.  As a gesture of good will the Prime Minister invited 

the shadow Cabinet to meet with them to discuss a smooth transition of Government 

from  his  Government  to  our  Government.    We  were  secretly  hoping  that  he  would 

resign  that  day  but  he  did  not.    Anyway  Mr  Speaker,  when  our  shadow  Cabinet 

presented  ourselves  to  the  Prime  Minister  we  were  disappointed  that  it  was  not  his 

Cabinet  waiting  for  us,  it  was  his  caucus.    I  admit  there  were  only  two  Ministers 

present at that meeting, only two.  The other Ministers were absent from the meeting.  

We always had the feeling of good will, showing a good will to our fellow politicians. 

But, when we presented ourselves we were faced with the Cook Islands Party caucus 

rather than the Cook  Island Party Cabinet.   Again  this afternoon we  gave the Prime 

Minister the benefit of the doubt.  But at the eleventh hour this morning he asked our 

Prime  Minister  designate  and  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  to  meet  with  him.    Again, 

</span><span>our intention was for a smooth transition and for him to resign by 11 o’clock today. It 

</span><span>is now quarter past three in the afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I don’t need to tell you that he again has changed his mind.  That is why we have lost 

</span><span>our confidence in the current Cabinet.  Thank you Mr  Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

recognise  the  Honourable  Member  for  Pukapuka-Nassau,  the  Honourable  Member, 

Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>MR I. AKARURU:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you, Greetings to all staff 

Members  of  Parliament  and  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.  To  the  Leader  of 

Government  and  to  all  our  people  who  are  listening  in  to  our  debate  this  afternoon, 

Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I suppose, Mr Speaker, I am making my maiden speech.
