<div><span>(PRAYER) 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much Honourable Members and our friends in the Gallery and those 

outside.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>We  now  have  a  Ministerial  Statement  and  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Dr  Joseph 

Williams, the Prime Minister, to make his Ministerial Statement. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Thank  you Mr Speaker.   Let  me now say  Kia Orana to 

you and your staff members. To the Deputy Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, Kia 

Orana.  The Ministers of the Crown and the Members of this side of the House, Kia 

Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>I see we have an over-abundance of Members on this side of the House Mr Speaker.  I  

hope that this is not an ominous sign to come later. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Leader of the Opposition and your good wife, Kia Orana.  To the Leader of the 

NAP on one side of the House and your good lady, Kia Orana.  To the Members of 

the  Opposition,  God  Bless  you  all.    I  must  make  a  special  greeting  to  the  NAP 

Member on this side of the House, Kia Orana to you Peto.  To our lovely ladies in the 

Gallery  </span><span>–</span><span>  I  see  there  are  no  men  in  the  Gallery  </span><span>–</span><span>  Mr  Speaker  our  House  has  been 

blessed by beauty and it is right that men do not come and sit there. They will spoil 

the beautiful women of our country.  To the womenfolk sitting behind me and to the 

right,  and  I see the men are outside,  Kia Orana  to  you all.   To  all the people of the 

</span><span>Cook Islands listening in, our Traditional Leaders, the religious sector and Leaders in 

</span><span>Government, Kia Orana to you all.  To all the parents in the Cook Islands and to the 

young people, Kia Orana to you all in the name of our Lord.

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  make  this  Ministerial 

Statement.   

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  I  had  a  meeting  with  the  Honourable  Dr 

Maoate  and  the  Honourable  Member  Norman  George.    The  purpose  of  the  meeting 

was to forge a smooth transition in case there is a change of Government today.  We 

did talk about the possibility of my resigning.  The discussion was very good.  I was 

very  happy  with  the  outcome  of  the  discussion  and  it  was  done  in  the  spirit  of 

consultation and cooperation and that is how it should be.  We parted in the spirit of 

friendship and camaraderie, with the understanding that I may be stepping down.   

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday Mr Speaker, I played golf with the Honourable Tom Marsters and he knew 

very well how terribly  I played.  You see, when  I looked  at  the  golf ball,  I saw the 

</span><span>Honourable Norman George’s face on that golf ball and I duffed shot after shot after 

</span><span>shot  because  I  was  worried.    I  was  concerned.  There  was  something  bothering  me.  

Last night, I could not sleep for the same reason.  I was worried and I was bothered. 

This morning, I asked the Leader of the Opposition if he would be good enough for us 

to  have  a  last  discussion  before  the  Sitting  of  this  Parliament  today.  Knowing  fully 

</span><span>well, Mr Speaker and Members of this House what was on this Order Paper, right at 

</span><span>the back, I thought we should have another talk.  This is the basis of my Ministerial 

Statement today.   

</span></div><div><span>I  informed  the  Honourable  Dr  Maoate  that  I  have  changed  my  mind  that  I  will  not 

resign.  I informed him that if I did, I would be breaking my word to the people of this 

country.  I have repeated time and time again on Frontline and in the News that I will 

not  resign  and  that,  I  will  take  it  right  to  the  17</span><span>th</span><span>  November,  to  this  sitting  of 

Parliament.  We talked about it in the spirit of co-operation.  He understood.  Thank 

you for your understanding.   

</span></div><div><span>You  see,  Mr  Speaker,  Members  of  this  House,  if  I  resigned  I  would  be  letting  the 

people of this country down.  The people who believed my word that I would take it 

to today.  If I broke that promise, it would be injustice and I do not support injustice.  

If I broke that promise, my integrity will hit rock bottom.  If I broke that promise, I 

would not be able to look at myself in the mirror each morning and feel proud of what 

I had done.  I am making this statement Mr Speaker, with the full knowledge that the 

outcome today would be inevitable. Nevertheless, I must make this statement. I hope 

that  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is  still  of  the  same  understanding  following  our 

</span><span>discussions this morning.  Somebody once said Mr speaker, “If one is prepared to take 

</span><span>high office then that person must face the good and the bad with the full knowledge 

</span><span>that  no  one  individual  will  hang  on  to  high  office  forever.”  </span><span>  Should  the outcome  of 

</span><span>today’s deliberation see a change in Government, I want to wish the Honourable Dr 

</span><span>Maoate  well  together  with  the  Members  of  your  incoming  Cabinet.  If  there  is  an 

</span><span>incoming  Cabinet,  I  wish  you  all  God’s  blessings.  I  would  ask  that  you  u</span><span>phold  the 

spirit  of  consultation  and  uphold  the  principles  of  justice.  That  justice  I  have  been 

mentioning time and time again on Political Frontline.  I am sorry Mr Speaker that I 

have not a prepared speech, but I will take it that you will have a prepared text of what 

</span><span>I have said for distribution to the Members of this House.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Prime Minister.
