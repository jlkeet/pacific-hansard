</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Excuse  me  please  Honourable  Members.    I  want  to  hear  the 

Honourable Member who has the  Floor to  speak. And if anyone speaks louder than 

the person who has the Floor I may have to send you out.   Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR I. AKARURU:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.   I feel sorry because I understand, Mr 

Speaker,  that  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  had  an  arrangement  with 

</span><span>the Queen’s Representative. I think if you had not allowed the Honourable Member, 

</span><span>Norman  George  to  bring  this  Motion  before  this  House  then  we  would  have 

</span><span>completed  what  we  came  here  to  do.    I  want  you  all  to  understand  that  this  type  of 

Motion is not a good Motion.  But if your intention was for us to debate this, then this 

is what  you are getting because if  you had allowed for us to  go on to  Motion No.4, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>289 

</span></div><div><span>then we would have completed that by now.  I would like you to understand that it is 

all your fault. That is not what we wanted or needed. I would also like to warn  you 

</span><span>that you should not start throwing rocks if you’re living in a glass house because we 

</span><span>will break your house.  This is what this Motion is doing.  It is throwing rocks.  When 

I throw my rock, steel will not be able to stop it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Batman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR I. AKARURU:</span><span> Be careful.  I will ask you to be careful and if you are successful 

in what you are trying to achieve as a Government, then that will be of benefit for all 

of  us.  I  would  just  like  to  ask  you  to  be  careful  and  hope  that  you  achieve  your 

policies for the sake of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I will give you up to 15</span><span>th</span><span> of January next year, and then we will be talking. These are 

my views Mr Speaker I would like again to ask my colleague Mr Norman George to 

withdraw  this  Motion  because  this  is  not  a  good  Motion.    These  are  my  views,  Mr 

Speaker.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

</span><span>call on the Honourable Paora Teiti of Amuri-Ureia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you in the name of Our Lord.  

Kia Orana also to the Clerk and  your staff members.  Kia Orana in the name of the 

Lord.  Sorry I have to address everybody because this is the day that one group comes 

in and one group goes out.  I know that our people would like our election of Prime 

Minister  today  to  be  completed,  but  I  do  not  want  to  go  away  without  saying  my 

views.  Kia Orana to the Prime Minister, to the Deputy Prime Minister, your Cabinet 

Ministers.  This  is  the first time  I have  given my  greetings to  you in  this session of 

Parliament and this will be the last.  Kia Orana in the name of Lord.  To the Members 

of Government, the Members of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition, Kia 

Orana in the name of the Lord.  Kia Orana also to our Mama in the Public Gallery. To 

the Mama and Papa outside, to our people listening in this afternoon, Kia Orana.  If 

you are angry because it is taking too long, bear with us. I was not going to speak on 

the Motion but because it was moved by the Honourable Norman George, everything 

went wrong.   

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Papa Pupuke has already submitted his Motion and this Honourable 

Member jumped in afterwards and introduced his own.  If he had left it to the wisdom 

</span><span>of the Honourable Papa Pupuke…..</span></div><div><span>(IN AUDIBLE </span><span>–</span><span> Sound System malfunction) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Could the Honourable Member please take your seat until we check 

this problem.  I will suspend the Sitting for five minutes so that we can check what the 

problem is.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>SIITNG SUSPENDED AT 3.37p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>SITTING RESUMED AT 3.42 p.m. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>290 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I apologise for the hiccup.  Thank you for your patience and I call 

upon the Honourable Member to continue with your speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  When  the  Honourable  Member  Dr  Robert 

Woonton  said  that  this  Motion  was  not  put  in  place  by  the  Honourable  Member 

Norman  George  alone,  I  did  not  believe  him.    The  reason  being,  I  know  this 

gentleman since I came to this House.  I know his ways.  I was never afraid of him, he 

was afraid of me.  He was the one that who walked out of our coalition.  I hope the 

members of the Democratic Alliance Party know him well.  I know that they took him 

in  just  to  form  a  Government.  My  warning  to  the  Honourable  Members  in  the 

Democratic Alliance Party is for them not to be complacent. He is a very dangerous 

man. Like wise our Caucus. If I get mad then my colleague and the Honourable Teina 

Bishop  will  move  into  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  to  force  him  to  be  sacked.  I 

know his legs are dangling in the air and as soon as we move there he will be gone.  

The  Honourable  Member  Dr  Robert  Woonton  said  that  the  Honourable  Norman 

</span><span>George was not the only one who put this Motion in place. I don’t believe t</span><span>hat. I think 

</span><span>it is a lie. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON: </span><span>Point of order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  What is your Point of Order 

Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:  </span><span>A  point  of  correction.    The  Honourable  Member  for  Ureia 

Paora Teiti is saying that I am lying. If he really want me to prove what I said, all he 

has to say is to ask the Honourable Members in the Opposition to stand up and show 

</span><span>whether  I  lied  or  not.  I  don’t  think  that  is  a  nice  thing  to  say.    What  I  said  in  my 

</span><span>speech  was  the  truth  and  to  prove  that  point  it  can  easily  be  taken  by  asking  the 

Opposition members to stand up. If they all agree to that Motion, what better proof is 

there? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Yes,  I  would  like  to  ask  the 

Honourable Member Paora Teiti to withdraw that remark. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>I am sorry Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member,  you  may  carry  on  with  your 

speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  this  is  one  reason  that  the  Honourable  Member  Albert 

Nicholas  did  not  want  to  go  with  his  Leader.      The  way  the  Honourable  Norman 

George does things is not right. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE: </span><span>Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  What is your Point of Order 

Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>291 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  Irrelevancy,  Standing  Order  No.  193.    We  are 

debating an important Motion in the House and this man keeps wandering off into all 

sorts of direction without directing his speech to the Motion before us.  The Motion is 

not about expressing no confidence in me, Norman George, it is about expressing no 

confidence in the Cabinet.  He should be directing his speech at the Cabinet and not at 

me. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  will  make  a  ruling.    Please 

resume your seat. 

</span></div><div><span>The  point  of  order  is  upheld.    For  too  long  you  have  been  talking  about  the 

Honourable Norman George who is  the mover of the Motion.  Please come back to 

the Motion and talk about the Cabinet. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  The reason I am speaking about it is because 

this is his Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Will  you  two  please  sit  down.    I  do  not  expect  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member  Paora  Teiti  to  continue  talking  about  the  Honourable  Member  Norman 

</span><span>George.    I  did  not  stop  you  from  talking  about  the  mover  but  you  have  gone 

overboard.    So  will  you  please  come  back  to  the  motion?  Otherwise,  if  you  have 

nothing more to say then sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  The Honourable Norman George is saying he 

has no confidence whatsoever in the Cabinet of today.  The question was posed to him 

earlier on whether the Cabinet that he has no confidence in  was the Cabinet he was 

part of or whether it is the Cabinet of today.  He was just calling that it is the Cabinet 

of today, the one he is not part of.  How can he speak about a Cabinet that he has not 

been a part of?  I think he should be speaking about a Cabinet he was part of.  How 

can he have no confidence in our Cabinet that has only been around for seven days?  I 

think the reason is because he always objected to anything discussed in the Cabinet he 

was  part  of.    My  colleague  the  Honourable  Minister  Teina  Bishop  told  me  that  the 

Cabinet  he  has  been  part  of  over  the  last  seven  days  has  given  some  funds  to  the 

disabled of this country.  Why does the Honourable Member have no confidence in a 

Cabinet that does this for our country.  I do not believe he can have any reason to have 

no  confidence  in  the  Cabinet  of  today.    What  I  do  believe  is  he  does  not  have 

confidence  in  the  Cabinet  he  was  a  part  of  because  he  knew  what  happened  in  that 

Cabinet.  

</span></div><div><span>I have been advised by my colleague the Honourable Minister Teina Bishop that one 

of the good things this Cabinet has done was to put in place a Committee to review 

the  Report  by  the  Commission  for  Political  Review.  Part  of  this  committee  is  Papa 

Tom Davis. So, why has he no confidence in this Cabinet? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member, your time is up. 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  further  speakers?    I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  for  Oneroa 

</span><span>Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>292 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and to the staff of this 

House.  Kia Orana to Honourable Members on both sides of the House. To our people 

listening in to our deliberations this afternoon. Greetings.  

</span></div><div><span>I rise Mr Speaker, to express my surprise in finding that the order of the notices of the  

Motion has been changed.  We have all been aware that since the 27</span><span>th</span><span> of August this 

year,  there  has  been  a  Motion  on  the  Order  Paper  by  the  Honourable  Dr  Pupuke 

Robati, Member for Rakahanga, to express no confidence in the Prime Minister.  We 

have all been aware of this Motion on the Order Paper. All these Mama are here today 

to find out this change of heart.  We see the Police and the Democratic Alliance Party 

supporters are here.  They are just waiting to see what will happen, so that they can 

move into all the Government offices. 

</span></div><div><span>So I was quite surprised to see two new Motions on this Order Paper.  So, I ask, what 

are these other two Motions?  The only reason I think that these have been included is 

that, these Motions were perpetrated by the Honourable Member, Norman George.  If 

we  had  gone  with  the  Motion  put  forward  by  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke 

Robati  then  the  result  would  have  proven  the  intent  of  the  present  Motions  by  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Member,  Norman  George.  Mr  Speaker,  if  we  had  debated  the  original 

</span><span>Motion  brought  in  by  the  Honourable  Pupuke  Robati,  that  would  have  determined 

whether  the  House  has  confidence  in  the  Prime  Minister,  and  therefore,  in  Cabinet.  

</span><span>There wouldn’t have been any need for us to debate any other motion.   </span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  studied  the  Order  Paper  carefully  and  I  realised  that  the  Honourable 

Member  Norman  George  is  really  demonstrating  who  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic 

Alliance  Party  is.    This  Motion  is  demonstrating  that  he,  the  Honourable  Member 

Norman  George  is  the  boss  and  therefore,  the  Prime  Minister  Elect  rather  than  the 

Honourable Member, Terepai Maoate.  Well, that is what this Motion is saying. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>You still can’t read, Pa.</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:</span><span>    The  No.2  Motion  on  the  Order  Paper  is  by  the  Honourable 

Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati.  Why  are  we  debating  that  Motion?  It  has  been  on  the 

Order  Paper  since  the  27</span><span>th</span><span>  August  and  everybody  is  aware  of  it.    It  has  been  in  the 

newspapers.  I  assumed  that  after  Motion  No.2  the  Members  of  the  Democratic 

</span><span>Alliance  Party  would  have  gone  to  the  Queen’s  Repre</span><span>sentative  to  be  sworn  in  as 

Government  and  come  back  here.    Then  the  Honourable  Member  Norman  George 

would move a further motion of no confidence in themselves.  I suspect that is one of 

the reasons that the Motion was moved because it would have been a no confidence in 

</span><span>themselves.  By right they should have been sworn in at 3 o’clock had we moved the 

debate on Dr. Robati’s Motion at 1 o’clock.  We wouldn’t have had much debate on 

</span><span>our side.  Now, we will have to go on and on with this debate. Everybody will want to 

determine  what  no  confidence  we  are  talking  about.    I  know  it  has  been  said  and 

repeated that the only way he could have judged whether the Cabinet has done its job 

was for him to be there. If that is the case and he is talking about the Cabinet he was 

in,  then  he  is  expressing  no  confidence  in  himself  as  well  as  his  colleague,  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Jim Marurai.  And if he is referring to the latest Cabinet, how 

</span><span>can  he  know  what  was  deliberated  because  he  wasn’t  there.    His  comprehension  of 

</span><span>Cabine</span><span>t’s activities is restricted to what was decided while he was a Cabinet Minister.</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>293 

</span></div><div><span> The main thing Mr Speaker he is really demonstrating is to show who is the boss in 

the Coalition.  By virtue of this Motion, it is confirming and demonstrating that he is 

the leader.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

call on the Honourable Member, Albert Nicholas, the Member for Ruatonga. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you and Greetings to all 

staff  members  this  afternoon.  To  the  Leaders  of  the  Opposition,  the  Deputy  Leader 

and to our people here, the Mama in the Public Gallery and outside </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you 

all.  To the Government side, the Cook Islands Party-New Alliance Party and to our 

leader, Joe Williams </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise,  Mr  Speaker,  to  give  my  objection  to  the  Motion  made  by  the  Honourable 

Member  Norman  George.    The  reason  being,  I  formed  part  of  the  Cabinet  as  an 

observer.  The Prime Minister of today asked me to be in there to observe in order to 

learn.  In  my  observations  while  the  Honourable  Member  Norman  George  and  the 

Honourable Member Jim Marurai were there, I saw nothing wrong.  They were part of 

</span><span>the Cabinet Ministers who tried to lift the standard of this country.  From the day they 

</span><span>went  out  and  the  seven  days  these  new  Cabinet  Ministers  have  been  appointed,  I 

</span><span>haven’t seen anything wrong.  This is what I want to say Mr Speaker, I rise to say that 

</span><span>we are really wasting our time on this Motion No.3. 

</span></div><div><span>When  the  Honourable  Member  Norman  George  and  Jim  Marurai  were  there,  I  was 

proud of the Caucus of the CIP-NAP I understand, Mr Speaker, why do have to talk 

about Cabinet but what is there to complain about? I rise to give my objection to the 

Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>This is what I wish to say.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

call on the Honourable Member, Ngamau Munokoa, Member for Nikao-Panama. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you and greetings to all 

staff members.  Greetings to all Honourable Members on both sides of the House. To 

our people in the Public Gallery, to our people outside the Chamber, to those listening 

in to this broadcast </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my support to the Motion that we have brought before the 

House this afternoon.  Today, the Prime Minister invited us to meet with him. When 

</span><span>we got there, he didn’t have his full Caucus.  I would like to encourage the people not 

</span><span>to be misled by what you hear.  We were invited there for the new Cabinet Ministers 

to observe, to learn, and to make the transition easy and peaceful.  When we got there 

we found that there was another move to bring two other Members from their Party to 

form the Cabinet.  

</span></div><div><span>Our Leader has expressed the political developments between us over the last couple 

</span><span>of weeks. Allow me to point out to them that there are only 11 of them. Please hand 

</span><span>over the running of our country to us who has the majority.  Don’t think that we will 

</span><span>not be able to run this country.
