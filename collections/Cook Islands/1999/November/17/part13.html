<div><span>(MUCH APPLAUSE) 

</span></div><div><span>That is all Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Honourable Prime Minister, Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR J. WILLIAMS:</span><span> Mr Speaker, Kia Orana again to you, to Members of the 

House and to our visitors.  

</span></div><div><span>I want to speak on this Motion.  In life, Mr Speaker, change is inevitable.  This is a 

fundamental fact of life.  Change is inevitable.  It is true in politics, on the legislative 

side as well as on the Executive side. And it is true in  every facet of life. With that 

change, Mr Speaker,  you create a chain reaction of further changes.  This Motion is 

creating a change.  The chain reaction of further changes causes some good things and 

some bad things. 

</span></div><div><span>If we are in control of our destiny we must control the direction of change. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I must interrupt now Honourable Prime Minister.  It is time to stop 

but I call on the Honourable Member, Norman George. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>299 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Sitting be extended to 6.00 p.m. or sooner in order for  

Motion No.4 to be completed 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call for a Seconder. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Ngamau Munokoa 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  Seems to be none. I will put the question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Please carry on Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  J.  WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  am  sorry  that  we  are 

prolonging the debate but the inevitability of Dr Maoate becoming Prime Minister is 

</span><span>already there.  We canâ€™t stop it.  The reason why I am talking about the inevitability of 

</span><span>change is that this change will create effects on our people. The decisions that will be 

made, I hope will be controlled decisions for the betterment of the life and well being 

of the people of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>You know I have been preaching for unity in our country.  Like the Honourable Tom 

Marsters we have been  preaching for  a three-way  Coalition.  Preaching for political 

peace  and  unity  in  this  country.    Unity  and  understanding,  unity  and  thought,  unity 

and deeds and unity among all the people of our country.  At this time more than any 

other  time  in  our  life  it  must  begin  with  unity  in  politics,  unity  of  all  the  parties 

concerned.  I would like to think that our voices are not being neglected, that you will 

hear our voices and I am sure that it will come with desired peace and prosperity for 

the people of our country and with those few words I wish you luck.  I wish you the 

very best for the future and God bless you.  Thank you.
