<div><span>(MUCH APPLAUSE) 

</span></div><div><span>But allow me, Mr Speaker, to say one or two more words.  Because I rise, Mr Speaker 

as a final expression of goodwill and support to the Honourable Member, Dr Joseph 

Williams.    This  is  speaking  in  the  light  of  what  has  transpired  over  the  last  few 

months  and  no  one  is  ignorant  of  what  happened  politically,  involving  myself.  My 

wish  at  the  outset  is  that  the  two  major  political  parties  should  coalesce  in  order  to 

</span><span>seek  stability  for  this  country.    Whilst  the  rest  of  my  colleagues  had  elected  to 

</span><span>coalesce with the New Alliance Party and the Honourable Norman George, I honestly 

saw  the  opportunity  through  my  association  with  the  Democratic  Party  as  a  way 

forward for all of us. Especially now, a way forward into the new Christmas, the new 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>298 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Millennium as one people.  So I rise, Mr Speaker, to say that I don’t dispute any of the 

</span><span>arrangements made because I think the intention was for the good interests of all our 

people in the Cook Islands.  Whilst one Coalition had failed and the other have picked 

up,  I honestly believed,  Mr Speaker, that all is  not  lost. We can still get  together as 

one happy family going into the new Millennium.   

</span></div><div><span>I call on the three Leaders of the three different groups to please look at this one very 

</span><span>carefully.  After all, the Democratic Party’s logo was “People first”.  I would like to 

</span><span>believe that that logo, that objective will come to the fore now.  After all, when you 

said that I believed you did not mean it to be the Democratic Alliance Party supporters 

alone.  You meant it to be every single person in this country.  That is why I called on 

the leaders of the three groups to please consider our situation properly.  Never in the 

history  of  the  Cook  Islands  can  you  give  a  better  Christmas  present  or  a  new 

Millennium  celebrations present  to  our people but  now.  We are going into  the new 

Millennium.    We  would  like  to  see  all  our  people  in  this  country  happy.  To  go  and 

celebrate and not be deceived again in our political differences. I thank Dr Maoate and 

my colleagues in the Democratic Party camp for accommodating me for the time that 

we were together, due to my strong belief that that was one way of getting our people 

</span><span>together.    I  also  thank  you  for  seeing  the  way  clear  to  release  me  from  the 

</span><span>commitment to the Democratic Alliance Party.  In order that I could now go back and 

honour my promise to my Party that I will come back and help rebuild.  After all I do 

believe  in  my  heart  that  I  have  fully  completed  my  commitment  to  you  and  I  once 

again plead on the three leaders to get together over the next three days </span><span>–</span><span>it’s still not 

</span><span>too late and look at the possibility of going together into the new Millennium. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  meantime,  Dr  Maoate,  you  have  my  full  support  and  confidence  and  wish 

Marito and Nane all the best.  And I believe you both deserve it.
