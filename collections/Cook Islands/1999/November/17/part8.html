<div><span>(MUCH LAUGHTER) 

</span></div><div><span>I suppose I have another chance of being sworn in again some time early next  year.   

</span><span>So I am making history and I enjoy that. 

</span></div><div><span>In  regards  to  the  Motion  before  the  House,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member Norman George to please, don’t play naughty games. You see, the principle 

</span><span>of the Motion that we have before the House is the same as the principle of Motion 

No.4.  After I finish my speech, I would like the Honourable Member Norman George 

to get up and withdraw this Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Not even the Pope can make me do it! 

</span></div><div><span>MR  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>  Because  what  we  are  doing,  Mr  Speaker  is  wasting  the  tax 

payers  money  by  prolonging  this  Parliament.  It  is  costing  this  nation  two  to  three 

dollars per minute.  I would like to ask the Honourable Member to make sure that we 

look at all aspects of the Motion that we have before the House in order that we will 

not debate a pending Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  ask  the Honourable  Member,  Norman  George  to  clarify  the  purpose 

</span><span>behind  this  Motion?  I  don’t  see  a  nice  aim  behind  this  Motion.    It  is  not  nice.  It  is 

</span><span>trying to embarrass Cabinet. It will only belittle the position of Cabinet. It will affect 

all Ministers of the Crown including those of today, yesterday and of the past years.  

A  Motion  of  Confidence  should  acknowledgment  the  good  things  that  Cabinet 

Ministers have done, unlike this Motion.  The Motion that we have before the House 

was presented to us in a very negating way and for the wrong purpose. Further I sense 

</span><span>a spirit of jealousy.  I’m not surprised, Mr Speaker. It is an all out effort to wipe the 

</span><span>good  things  that  this  Cabinet  has  done.    These  were  effectively  argued  by  the 

Members from the Government. 

</span></div><div><span>I  take  pride  in  what  this  Cabinet  has  done.  The  policies  carved  and  adopted,  the 

</span><span>transparency  and  accountability  of  Government  and  all  kinds  of  development 

activities  are  tantamount  to  the  reputation  and  the  rise  in  our  economy  today.  For 

instance,  we  </span><span>don’t  have  enough  accommodations  to  accommodate  visitors  to  our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>288 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>country  nowadays.    We  can  also  appreciate  the  fact  that  there  are  various 

organisations  internally  who  are  contributing  in  their  own  ways  to  this  boom.  I 

believe, these growth are due to the proactive policies of Government.  Of course, that 

is  the  work  of  Government.  I  am  hoping  that  in  due  course,  the  new  Government 

should be maintaining that trend. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  heard  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Robert  Woonton  saying  that  this  Motion 

derived from consultations between legal-minded people who are well versed with the 

Constitution of this country. If this was the aim of my Honourable colleague who is 

now sitting next to me, I will be very cautious. I know my friend so well.  I know the 

ins and outs of my friend. And you better watch out. Watch out!  My experience of 

this  Honourable  Member  is  that,  if  he  says  something  to  you,  you  have  to  be  very 

careful.  Ask  yourselves  what  he  is  saying  and  how  will  he  benefit?  You  see 

Honourable Members, if you want to get something, you spread ice cream and honey 

over your remarks before you offer it to someone. In the same way, ask yourself what 

this  Honourable  Member  is  trying  to  do.    I  am  trying  to  warn  you  Honourable 

Members.  Be  careful  about  this  gentleman  becaus</span><span>e  I  know  you’ve  had  some  bad 

</span><span>experiences with him. 

</span></div><div><span>I am glad because this problem is now in your hands. I want to warn the Leader of the 

Opposition. One day you will find that there is no seat behind to support you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Order.
