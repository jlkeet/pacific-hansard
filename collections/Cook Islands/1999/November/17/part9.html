</span></div><div><span>MR I. AKARURU:</span><span> I am concerned Mr Speaker. I am worried about the destruction 

this Motion will create. Now there are a lot of tourists coming into our country and a 

atmosphere of uncertainty will easily be created by this kind of Motion. It will usurp a 

negativ</span><span>e impact  on our tourist  industry.  People  will not  want  to  come here.  I donâ€™t 

</span><span>want our economy to be spoilt by such a silly move.  There is no other place in the 

Pacific  Island  countries  like  the  Cook  Islands.    So  I  am  sad  to  see  that  this  Cabinet 

have  had  a  very  brief  lifespan.  If  only  a  little  more  time  was  given  to  this  present 

Cabinet I am sure they will do a lot more for this country.
