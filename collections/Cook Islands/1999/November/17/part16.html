</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Norman  George,  are  you  moving  the  Motion?    Before  you  do  I 

would like to say a few words.  So please excuse me.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>As  the  President  of  our  CPA  Branch,  I  want  to  say  that  I  am  very  proud  of  you 

Parliamentarians  in  the  way  that  Government  has  changed  so  peacefully.    Other 

Members of the Commonwealth </span><span>–</span><span> indeed other countries of this world can well take 

the Cook Islands as an example in peaceful transition of Governments, of power.  

</span></div><div><span>To  you,  the  incoming  Prime  Minister  and  your  incoming  Cabinet  </span><span>–</span><span>  God  bless  you, 

and your spouses as well as your team.  

</span></div><div><span>To the outgoing Prime Minister and your outgoing Cabinet and your team, thank you 

very much for your services of love. 

</span></div><div><span>I  didn’t  want  to  close  this  meeting  without  me  saying  this  but  I  have  one  request.  

</span><span>When  we  sit  again,  can  I  please  have  a  Deputy  Speaker?  I  am  only  human.    I  have 

urges like the rest of you. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you  very  much.    I  now  call  on  the  Honourable  Member,  Norman  George  to 

move the Motion for adjournment. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House do now adjourn until Thursday, 

16</span><span>th</span><span> December 1999 at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>May I also, Mr Speaker, take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to you for 

</span><span>the  exemplary  conduct  of  the  Chair  in  today’s  Session.    I  also  want  to  express  my 

</span><span>congratulations  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  also  to  thank  the  new  guns  of  the 

Democratic  Alliance  Party  and  the  New  Alliance  Party  for  your  loyalty,  hard  work, 

dedication  and  support  to  crown  our  efforts  today  with  the  success  that  we  are  now 

about  to  enjoy.    To  my  colleague  next  to  me,  the  future  Leader  of  the  House,  the 

Honourable  Dr  Pupuke  Robati,  thank  you  very  much  for  your  able  guidance  and 

assistance. 

</span></div><div><span>To the former Prime Minister, the Honourable Dr Joseph Williams.  Thank you for a 

</span><span>job well done.  It’s a pity that the country did not discover your talents earlier but you 

</span><span>displayed  during  the  brief  time  that  you  were  Prime  Minister,  especially  with  me 

holding the rope around your neck.  You were outstanding.
