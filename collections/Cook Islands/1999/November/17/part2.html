<div><span>PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN took the Chair at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>   Please be seated Honourable Members. Greetings to all of us in the 

grace of God.  I would like to extend a warm welcome to all Honourable Members for 

yet another session of Parliament.  As stated by the Pastor, I believe the short break 

has been beneficial to all of you and that we will be honourable in our deliberations.  I 

would like to  extend a warm welcome to  our people in  the public  gallery  and those 

outside,  who  are  here  to  observe  our  debate  this  afternoon.    Kia  Orana  also  to  our 

people listening in to our Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, the next Order on our Order Paper is the Swearing in of our new Member 

of  Parliament.    I  would  therefore  request  the  Honourable  Member  for  Pukapuka 

Nassau to come forward. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Member Inatio Akaruru sworn in. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  On  behalf  of  your  colleagues  in  Parliament,  we  would  like  to 

congratulate you Honourable Member for being returned to Parliament.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Obituary. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a prepared statement here which I have elected to read to you. I would like the 

Member  of  Parliament  for  Overseas,  who  is  also  a  resident  of  Aitutaki,  where  this 

former Honourable Member came  from  - the Prime Minister Dr Joseph Williams to 

make  a  statement  after  this  statement.  We  will  be  observing  two  minutes  silence 

thereafter  and  I  am  asking  the  Honourable  Member  for  Amuri  Ureia  Paora  Teiti  to 

close our remembrance of this former Honourable Member with a prayer. 

</span></div><div><span>“A former Member of Parliament of the Cook</span><span> Islands, from 1968 to 1972, Mr Ngaa 

Upu passed away in Melbourne on the 16</span><span>th</span><span> of October this year just 27 days before 

his 75</span><span>th</span><span> birthday.  Papa Ngaa Upu was born in Aitutaki on the 12</span><span>th</span><span> November 1924 

and  educated  there.    He  is  survived  by  his  wife  Nellie  and  their  12  children.    He 

married Nellie Teaukura in 1943. 

</span></div><div><span>Ngaa  had  a  long  and  varied  career  in  the  Public  Service.    He  trained  as  a 

schoolteacher and taught for many years before becoming a Community Development 

Officer for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  He also served as an Island Councillor.  

He  was  elected  to  Parliament,  on  the  Cook  Islands  Party  ticket,  as  a  Member  for 

Aitutaki (one of three MPs for Aitutaki at the time, along with Dr Joe Williams and 

the  late  Mr  William  Estall)  and  he  served  for  one  term,  from  1968  to  1972.  

Throughout his life, Ngaa had many interests and talents.  After leaving  Parliament 

he retired to his home island where he played a prominent part in local affairs.  He 

</span><span>was  a  superb  sportsman  </span><span>–</span><span>  being  a  master  at  the  traditional  sport  of  pua,  cricket, 

</span><span>rugby and represented Aitutaki in cricket and rugby on numerous occasions. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>276 

</span></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Ngaa was also a strong and faithful member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church  </span><span>–</span><span>

achieving  the  position  of  Head  Elder  </span><span>–</span><span>  the  equivalent  of  Tauturu  Orometua  in  the 

CICC church, a position for which he was greatly respected by Church Members.  In 

addition to all of the above he was also a baker and a planter.  For many years, he 

</span><span>was Chairman of the Aitutaki Growers Association”.</span></div><div><span>Papa  Ngaa,  who  lived  in  Melbourne,  Australia  for  the  last  seven  years  of  his  life, 

passed away while attending a service at his beloved church.  He was a kind, patient 

and tolerant man who earned the respect and affection of all who knew him.  His body 

was returned for burial on the island of his birth, Aitutaki.  He will be greatly missed. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call on the Honourable Dr Joseph Williams, the Prime Minister and Member for 

the Overseas seat. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  J.  WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  for  giving  me  the 

opportunity to pay a last tribute to Papa Nga Upu. 

</span></div><div><span>With  your  leave,  Mr  Speaker,  I  will  reserve  the  traditional  Parliamentary  greetings 

</span><span>until a later time in this sitting. 

</span></div><div><span>As you stated in the Obituary, Papa Ngaa Upu and I entered politics together in 1968.  

We  stood  together  in  the  1968  General  Election  with  the  late  William  Estall.    We 

worked together for the benefit of our constituency and I cannot forget the teachings 

that he gave me while I was a young gun at that time. 

</span></div><div><span>When he shifted to Melbourne, Australia he became part of my constituency.  He was 

a constituent of the Overseas Constituency and I am happy to speak on behalf of all 

those from the Overseas Constituency in paying tribute to the late Papa Nga Upu. 

</span></div><div><span>Two  weeks  before  he  died  he  came  and  saw  me  to  discuss  a  certain  matter  for 

presentation  to  Government.  This  matter  concerned  the  possibility  of  offering 

recognition  for  his  services  in  the  church,  in  the  sports,  in  the  community  and  in 

politics.  We did not complete that discussion.  Two weeks later he died.  I told him at 

that time that when I come over to Australia we would continue the discussion. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, Members of the House, it is my honour and my privilege to say these few 

words in remembrance of the late Papa Ngaa Upu.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I call on the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Member, Dr 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I know you have already indicated 

the two speakers for the occasion but I seek your permission to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Yes, please carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Greetings to you Mr Speaker.  Greetings also to the Prime 

</span><span>Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to  Cabinet  Ministers  and  to  all  Honourable 

Members, both on our side and on the Government side. To our people in the Public 

Gallery, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> November 1999 

</span></div><div><span>277 

</span></div><div><span>I will make my greetings very brief.  As stated by the Prime Minister earlier we will 

defer our Greetings until later.  I will be brief myself. 

</span></div><div><span>As Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party and on behalf of the Leader of the New 

Alliance Party and all our Members of the Opposition, I would like to speak about Mr 

Ngaa Upu. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to extend our tribute to Mrs Nellie Upu and the children as well as the 

grandchildren who are here in the Cook Islands and overseas.  I compliment you Mr 

Speaker  for  what  you  have  said  in  your  tribute  to  Mr  Ngaa  Upu.    I  know  all  those 

things  that  you  have  said  and  there  are  other  achievements  that  you  have  not 

expressed.  This man is one of the most hardworking island folks from Aitutaki.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to extend to Mama Nellie Upu, on behalf of our families, our wives and 

our supporters, our sympathy. May God comfort you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I will now ask all Honourable Members to please stand and observe 

</span><span>two minutes silence.  I include our visitors.
