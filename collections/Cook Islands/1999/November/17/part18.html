</span><span>don’t ever take the Motion against you perso</span><span>nally.  That was a procedure that has to 

be put through despite the painful nature of it.  Forgive us for it.

General. Janet Maki </span><span>–</span><span> congratulations and I believe John McFadzien and also to our 

own  Michael  Crawford  Mitchell.    By  God  you  deserve  a  lot  of  drinks  after  this.  

Thank you very much.  To Dr Robati also who assisted with all the procedures we had 

and also as a former Prime Minister of this country, we are very lucky that when we 

come  back  in  December,  there  will  be  three  former  Prime  Ministers  in  this  House.  

We are highly honoured with the depth and wealth of experience that we have in this 

Parliament, plus two former Deputy Prime Ministers  </span><span>–</span><span> one serving one.  Thank you 

all.  We have had a difficult day.  Thanks to all the patient people out there who has 

witnessed what is quite a robot sitting of Parliament today.  Thank you one and all and

</span><span>the next few minutes.
