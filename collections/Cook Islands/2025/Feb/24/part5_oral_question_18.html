<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  I do not think I got an answer from the Prime Minister.  The 

question was whether there are plans to nationalise shipping in the Cook Islands.  The reason why 

I asked this question is because that term was used in the article and that word means the process 

of taking privately controlled companies, industries or assets and placing them under government 

control.  And what that means to me is that you will be buying the Cook Islands General Transport 

and Taio Shipping.
