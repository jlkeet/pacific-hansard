<h3>Oral Question 16</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Thank you for the question from the Leader of the 

Opposition.  Our Ministry of Finance has a comprehensive amount of work on a shipping roadmap.  

And this is in light of the substandard shipping service that we currently have, Mr Speaker, that 

we are all aware of.  And despite the government subsidy of up to half a million dollars a year to 

support  our  private  sector  shipping  operators.    Itâ€™s  apparent  that  this  has  been  insufficient  Mr 

Speaker to provide a service that our people particularly in the Pa Enua deserves.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The type of vessel required to operate in the Pa Enua to a certain standard comes with a significant 

price  tag.    How  we  will  manage  the  operation  of  these  vessels  remains  to  be  determined,  Mr 

Speaker.  We have several options to consider, we could establish a National Shipping Service,

<div><span>contract the operation out, outsource it, or provide a vessel to an existing company.  Those are the 

options available to us Mr Speaker and how it operates will remain to be seen but we will make 

sure that when we do acquire an asset that is in the value of millions of dollars.  We want to be 

sure that it will be operated properly. And we are under no illusions Mr Speaker that to start off an 

operation to run a service to our Pa Enua it will require a considerable amount of input.  But these 

are the essential critical steps we need Mr Speaker to be able to bring our Pa Enua into the wider 

Cook Islands economy.</span></div>
