</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  in  the  Budget  of  the  Cook  Islands  Investment 

Corporation, there was an amount of $120,000 stated to be for the Cyclone Centre in Rakahanga.  

And of course, the cyclone centre in Rakahanga has been in the program for many years and in 

fact, it is the only island that does not have a cyclone centre.  I mistakenly understood that in the 

last  budget  that  our  Cyclone  Centre  was  going  to  be  moved  forward  and  be  constructed.  

Particularly  given  the  situation  with  climate  change  and  should  there  be  a  cyclone,  a  severe 

cyclone, the whole island will be wiped out. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I met with Investment Corporation to see what this $120,000 is for.  The Budget Committee 

was under the impression that that was the amount of money to be paid for the land that centre was 

to be constructed on.  I thought that was odd because there hadn’t been any discussions at all about 

paying for the land.  But the Investment Corporation corrected me and the Budget Committee.  

They said that the $120,000 was to do more consultations and more scoping.  They were planning 

a trip to go up north so they can go and identify where Rakahanga’s problem was.  I said to them, 

you have been scoping for the last 10 years, you do not need to scope any more, I will scope it for 

you next time I am in Rakahanga and then I will report to you. 

</span></div><div><span>So, this money was not for the landowners.  It was going to be for another scoping exercise to pay 

the cost of a scoping exercise.  In the meantime, of course the land that has been made available 

has the site for the Cyclone Centre has been there for the last five or six years.  Now we all know 

having heard the comments on the Manihiki airport that the delay is going to cost more money 

because  of  material  prices.    And  the  last  time  there  was  some  discussions  on  the  cost  of  the 

Rakahanga cyclone centre the figure that was quoted at that time, and that was about a year and a 

half ago was $3 million dollars. And we can imagine that probably in another year’s time that price 

will have increased.  But I am hopeful Minister, that you will have it in your next budget for 2025-

26 and perhaps take the consultation fee out and insert the cost of the building.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $4,986,000 for the  

Cook Islands Investment Corporation stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
