Orana to you all.  Kia Orana to all our people listening on the radio and watching the live stream.

<div><span>I have a question for the Honourable Prime Minister.  In the Cook Islands newspaper, on Friday 

the  21</span><span>st</span><span>  you  were  recorded  saying  that,  government  has  been  working  to  strengthen  domestic 

shipping through international partnership as the Cook Islands may be the only Pacific nation that 

does not have a nationalise shipping service.  My question, Mr Prime Minister is are you moving 

to nationalise shipping in our country?
