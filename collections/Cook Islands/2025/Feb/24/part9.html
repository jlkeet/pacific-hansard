</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I see that no Members wish to speak.  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I rise to make some comments on the Audit Office.  

This is one of the most important offices in the public service and should be entirely independent 

in the same way as Parliament should be entirely independent and the Ombudsmanâ€™s office.  I am 

aware that last year they had the assistance of the Audit Office in Wellington and the assistance 

was to assist our Audit office draft its legislation so that it can brought to Parliament so that it also 

becomes completely independent of government. 

</span></div><div><span>I am aware that some consultations took place.  I am also aware that when the Public Accounts 

Committee travelled to Wellington the year before last, they joined the discussion with the Audit 

office in Wellington about the importance of the Audit office being independent.  I am hoping that 

some of these funds that is shown here will assist this office in pushing its legislation so that it will 

be tabled in Parliament in a timely manner.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Leader of the Opposition.  Thank you, Honourable Members.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,348,842 for Audit (PERCA)  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
