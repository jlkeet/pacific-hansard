<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  One area of concern I want to address 

is the condition of our roads, particularly in the Vaka Puaikura constituency.  While we have heard 

the Minister outline the government's plans, I still feel it is important to express my thoughts on 

the state of our roads in Vaka Puaikura. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In response to what has been previously mentioned regarding the Appropriation for the airport in 

</span><span>Manihiki, I want to highlight the importance of the revenues generated for our economy.  In Vaka 

</span><span>Puaikura,  it  is  estimated  that  70  percent  of  visiting  tourists  choose  to  stay  in  holiday 

accommodations there, yet we face some of the worst road conditions, Mr Speaker.  As the three 

Members of Parliament representing Puaikura, we cannot ignore this issue, as our constituents are 

voicing their concerns, and we are committed to bringing those concerns to this House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr Speaker, I want to point out that the boulders along the waterfront in Avarua, 

which serve as wave breakers coming from Trader Jacks toward the township, originate from Vaka 

Puaikura.    The  landowners  in  Puaikura  allowed  the  government  to  transport  these  boulders  to 

</span><span>Avarua to help protect our CBD area.  Just last year, the government prioritised road rehabilitation 

</span><span>efforts.    Therefore,  I  must  ask,  what  is  the  priority  for  Nikao,  where  the  road  conditions  are 

relatively better, compared to the significantly worse roads in Puaikura?   I ask the Member for 

Nikao to bear with me on this situation.

<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, our constituency is facing significant issues  with waste disposal.  Human waste and 

solid waste from across the island are being dumped in Arorangi.  Additionally, our children who 

have fallen afoul of the law are also imprisoned there.  Mr Speaker, I am highlighting the urgent 

need  for  better  priorities,  especially  when  we  consider  the  substantial  revenue  generated  from 

Puaikura for our economy over the years, yet our roads remain unsealed.  I am speaking on behalf 

of the ordinary people of Rarotonga and those in the Pa Enua, emphasising that our government is 

not  adequately  supporting  our  communities  or  directing  funds  to  the  areas  that  truly  need 

development. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Let us consider the current condition of our hospital.  We are witnessing a significant number of 

our  nurses  and  healthcare  staff  leaving  the  country,  and  in  their  place,  we  are  seeing  foreign 

workers brought in to fill those gaps.  There are many other issues I could address, but I will pause 

here to avoid provoking a strong reaction from the other side.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank You, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable George Angene; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, your staff, and fellow Members of this House.  Kia 

Orana to everyone present.  Kia Orana to our people tuning in over the radio and watching the live 

broadcast.  To my constituents in Tupapa, Kia Orana to all of you.  I would also like to welcome 

our friend Jackie Tuara, who is seated in the Public Gallery. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  do  not  have  much  to  add,  Mr  Speaker.    I  rise  today  to  give  my  strong  support  for  this 

Supplementary  Budget.    On  behalf  of  myself,  my  family,  and  all  my  supporters  from 

Tupapa/Maraerenga, I give my support to this Supplementary Budget. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Sonny Williams; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you Honourable Speaker and your 

staff working for this Parliamentary House.  Kia Orana to the Members of the House as well.  Kia 

Orana to all our people listening in from Rarotonga, the Pa Enua, New Zealand, Australia, and 

beyond.  Mr Speaker, before I offer my full support for this Bill, I would like to make a few remarks 

</span><span>on certain points. 

</span></div>
<div><span>First,  I  would  like  to  discuss  the  government's  shipping  vessel  program.    I  acknowledge  the 

explanation provided by the Secretary of Finance regarding this initiative, tracing its history back 

to the days of Silk &amp; Boyd and various shipping owners, including Taio Shipping and the barge 

operations.  It is worth noting that during the Silk &amp; Boyd era, the government was also subsidising 

their services.  In recent years, the government has continued to provide subsidies for shipping, 

amounting to half a million dollars annually.  Despite the best efforts of Taio Shipping and other 

operators, many of whom have ceased operations, we cannot overlook the unfortunate incidents 

</span><span>that have plagued shipping in our country, specifically, ships running aground on reefs and the 

</span><span>tragic loss of lives associated with these events.

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to speak as a former Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Development, 

particularly  regarding  the  necessity  of  hiring  and  chartering  ships  to  transport  our  people  to 

Rarotonga for Te Maeva Nui and back.  In the early 2000s to 2010, our only option was to charter 

local  shipping.    It  is fair to  say that waiting  on the wharf for those ships to  arrive was often a 

difficult experience.  As the individual responsible for chartering these vessels, I felt a significant 

responsibility toward the well-being, safety, and health of the passengers. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Many times, ships coming from the Northern Group Islands would arrive with a quarter of the 

passengers needing urgent medical attention for pneumonia.  We all know how passengers often 

ended up staying in makeshift tents on the deck for three or four days, enduring harsh weather, 

high seas, and relentless sea spray.  As a result, many would fall ill, necessitating ambulances to 

take them straight to the hospital upon arrival.  Often, they had been wet at sea for two or three 

days, leading to their vulnerable state. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Having witnessed these conditions firsthand, it became apparent that we needed to seek better, 

safer shipping options for our people.  This need led us to explore alternatives like the Lady Naomi 

from Samoa and Tahiti Nui from French Polynesia.  Continuing to rely on local shipping under 

those harsh conditions was simply unreasonable.  It was unfair to expect our people to endure such 

hardships, struggle to recover, and then perform at Te Maeva Nui. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  understand  that  there  are  many  comments  regarding  the  shipping  situation,  particularly 

concerning the Chinese vessel.  While there are also Japanese ships in the mix, the current focus 

seems to be on the Chinese ship.  It is important to note that those making these complaints have 

likely  never  experienced  travel  on  the  interisland  vessels.    They  have  not  faced  the  difficult 

conditions that passengers endure, nor have they suffered illness while aboard these ships. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  completely  and  wholeheartedly  support  this  Vote  Item  that  our  government  has 

undertaken to enhance the safety of shipping for our Pa Enua. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I recall the tragic incident when a ferry sank in Tonga, resulting in the loss of nearly 100 lives, as 

well as the Rabaul Queen in Papua New Guinea, which caught fire while docked, leading to further 

fatalities.  In the aftermath of these disasters, regulations and shipping laws within the Pacific were 

strengthened to prevent similar tragedies across the region and within our own country.  Therefore, 

</span><span>we have no option but to enhance and progress the conditions of our Pa Enua shipping.  For this 

</span><span>reason, I support this Item in the amendment Budget. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I would also like to address public safety governance, specifically the police initiative 

related to the $145,000 allocated for Community Policing.  In Takitumu, particularly in Titikaveka, 

Ngatangiia,  and  Puaikura,  we,  along  with  Rob  and  his  team,  initiated  the  Community  Policing 

program before Christmas last year in response to public complaints about road safety and petty 

thefts affecting our villages. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We gathered volunteers from our villages to launch the Community Policing initiative, with strong 

</span><span>support and coordination from our Police Department.  While I support this Item, I would like to 

take a moment, on behalf of my fellow Members of Parliament, Rob, Kaka, and myself, to thank 

the volunteers who responded to our call to help kickstart our community policing efforts.

<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our volunteers sacrificed their Christmas Eve, Christmas night, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s 

night to join us on the roads, ensuring the safety of our communities.  Therefore, thank you to all 

the volunteers who took the challenge of keeping our communities safe on behalf of everyone in 

this House.  Thank you to the Minister of Police, our Prime Minister, and the Minister of Finance 

for providing this appropriation; I believe we are confident to achieve great things moving forward.  

I would like to invite the Member for Matavera to join this program so that all of Takitumu can 

benefit from community policing.  Thank you, Prime Minister, for your support. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I would like to  address the topic of debt servicing and fiscal management, particularly 

regarding the accelerated payments on pandemic-related loans aimed at reducing long-term debt 

servicing  costs.    I  fully  support  this  initiative,  as  it  highlights  the  importance  of  accelerated 

repayment, which will ultimately help us decrease our debt over time.  This is a significant concern 

among our people, who worry that these loans may burden our grandchildren.  However, because 

we have effectively managed our finances during this period, we are in a position to accelerate the 

repayment of these loans.  This reflects our strong financial status.  Those are my thoughts, Mr 

Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Sonny Williams.  I see the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Kia Orana to all you this afternoon.  I just wanted to say a few 

words on the merits of this Bill because later we will have the opportunity to go through each Vote 

Item. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The purpose of a Supplementary Appropriation should be to cater for unforeseen revenue receipts 

or expenditure not identified from the original appropriation.  You would not expect there to be 

any  significant  changes  unless  there  has  been  a  disaster  or  unforeseen  circumstances.    This 

Appropriation Amendment is not that.  It is not merely a routine financial adjustment; it is much 

more than that. 

</span></div>
<div><span>With the 2025/26 Budget set to be presented in a few months’ time, the scale of this Supplementary 

Budget is therefore quite alarming.  The Bill increases total government expenditure from $328.3 

million to $396.3 million, an extraordinary $68 million increase.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Now, government claims that this is due to increased revenue.  Its spending decisions however, 

indicate a prioritisation of political self-interest over public interest.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In  the  presentation  that  the  Opposition  received  from  MFEM,  and  we  are  grateful,  I  have  to 

acknowledge we are grateful for the presentation because we are a little bit more educated than we 

were yesterday.   

</span></div>
<div><span>One of the key things that they were pushing is that the increased budget was to address critical 

</span><span>priorities and it is this very definition of “critical priorities” that I want to comment on.  Of course, 

</span><span>previous speakers have spoken about the increased amount for Members of Parliament travel and 

the amount of the increase is about $450,000, and when you look at that amount and then you look 

at the amount that is allocated for the Police, it makes absolutely no sense. 

</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, if you examine the spending on welfare, there has been no increase in that area.  This 

raises questions about the definition of “critical priorities” outlined in the budget statement.  We 

were informed that $42 million was allocated to pay off an old debt, which was deemed expensive.  

While repaying debt is typically a positive move, I question the timing and scale of that repayment.  

Given that we are facing inflation and a high cost of living, it seems reasonable to expect more 

consideration for increasing welfare payments during this challenging period. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It also concerns me that the debt repayment appears to be the ‘knee jerk’ reaction as supposed to 

have a better strategic plan over a few years.  I also notice that there was a decline in foreign aid 

for $90 million to $83.2 million and the concern there is, which critical infrastructure and public 

services are going to be affected by that decrease. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When we look at the overall budget, we cannot with any justification say that the increase revenue 

has been applied to priority areas because from this side of the chamber, the priority areas for us 

are health, education, police and the vulnerable.  We do not see that in this budget.  Thank you, 

Mr Speaker.
