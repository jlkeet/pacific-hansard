<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the United Party for 

this question.  Now, I would like to take you back to the year 2020.  During that period of COVID 

and a quarantine was imposed on all businesses in New Zealand.  In those two years of the lock 

down  period  in  New  Zealand,  Mr  Speaker  our  office  was  not  used.    The  workers,  our  Consul 

General, the staff all operated remotely from home. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In fact, when the lease came due for renewal, Mr Speaker we paid significant amounts of money 

in  rental  for  a  building  that  nobody  was  inside.    So,  when  the  lease  came  up  for  renewal  the 

Government decided to wait until we see how the situation is going to pan out and since that time, 

Mr Speaker as our economy has been looking to recover, we have been very careful in where we 

put our money into these areas that need additional financing such as renewal of leases especially 

when our staff in Auckland have been so effective in being able to work remotely. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I understand the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is looking at a review of our International Offices and 

our High Commissions and the Minister of Foreign Affairs would be better prepared to answer 

this question in full.  From what I understand the outcome of the review will determine what type 

of office we will need in Auckland and we will also look at the role of our High Commission in 

Wellington and our High Commission in Fiji and with our growing international engagements, 

whether it is worthwhile for us to also look at considering a High Commission in Australia.  But 

these, Mr Speaker will be the outcomes of the review that is currently being undertaken by the 

Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
