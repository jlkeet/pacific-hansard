<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Amendment Bill 2024-25. 

</span></div><div><span>Members are reminded to focus their speeches on the Budget Items that have been changed. 

</span></div><div><span>I  now  open  the  Floor  to  Honourable  Members  to  speak  on  the  principles  and  merits  of  the 

Appropriation Amendment Bill 2024/25. 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR.  V.  T.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you.    Regarding  the  Appropriation  Amendment  Bill  2024-25,  Mr 

Speaker, we are discussing a significant sum of money, totalling $63 million.  I would like to draw 

your  attention  specifically  to  the  allocation  for  the  Police.    We  see  that  $245,000  has  been 

</span><span>appropriated for their budget.  Out of this amount, $145,000 is designated for the operation of the 

</span><span>Police office, while $100,000 has been allocated to a committee that will assess the work being 

done by the Police. 

</span></div><div><span>While I support this appropriation by the committee, I must express to this House that the allocated 

amount is insufficient, even with the funding extended to the end of June this year. 

</span></div><div><span>I would suggest that if the government could provide an additional sum of around $500,000, it 

would be sufficient to support the Police's work.  I believe that the $145,000 currently allocated is 

</span><span>inadequate to cover the various areas of responsibility within the Police.  This is an important issue 

</span><span>I wanted to bring up before this House, and I hope that when we discuss the new Budget, we will 

see an increase in the allocation for the Police.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>However,  I  have  concerns  regarding  the  current  appropriation,  Mr  Speaker,  as  there  is  no 

designated allocation for Parliament.    I am  hopeful  that we  will see  an increase in  funding for 

Parliament Services to help support the essential work that Parliament does for our staff here.  My 

focus is not on the needs of the Members of Parliament but rather on the necessary resources for 

Parliament Services. 

</span></div><div><span>I observe that there is currently no allocation for Parliament Services in this appropriation. I believe 

that as we approach the new financial year, we should consider allocating funds to support our 

Parliament Services. 

</span></div><div><span>Another matter I wish to address with this House is the allocation for the ICI.  An appropriation of 

$5  million  has  been  designated  for  ICI  to  facilitate  the  upgrading  of  our  roads.    In  total,  the 

allocation for ICI road maintenance amounts to $13 million.  This figure includes savings from the 

previous appropriation that were carried forward, along with the new allocation, bringing the total 

for ICI to $13 million. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that this appropriation is sufficient for ICI to complete the necessary work before the end 

of  June.    I  hope  that  the  allocated  funds  will  be  utilised  during  this  period  without  any  carry-

forward.  Furthermore, I am optimistic that in the next budget, ICI will receive new appropriations 

and an increase with their budget for further development. 

</span></div><div><span>While I have been involved in the Committee in reviewing the allocation for ICI, I feel that the 

current appropriation is insufficient.  However, I am optimistic that by the new year, we will be 

able to allocate additional funds to support the development of our roads through ICI. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  The Floor is still open.  I see the Honourable 

Robert Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  R.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable  Members  this  afternoon.    I  have  a 

Supplementary Question related to the issue raised by the Member for Rangiatea regarding the 

allocation for the Police.  I would like to commend the government for increasing the appropriation 

to  the  Police,  enabling  them  to  carry  out  their  responsibilities  effectively  until  the  end  of  the 

financial year.  However, as noted by the Member, this amount may still not be sufficient. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you to the staff of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management for their guidance 

to the PAC committee on how we can enhance this aspect of our budget.  They have assured us 

that there will be improvements to the Police budget in the upcoming main budget.  As a member 

of the PAC committee, I support this appropriation and would like to share some of my thoughts 

regarding this supplementary matter. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding  government  spending,  I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  appropriation  allocated  to 

Members of Parliament for overseas travel allowances.  It is worth noting that there has been a 

</span><span>significant increase in the budget for these travel allowances over the years.  In our meeting with 

</span><span>MFEM, they described this budget category as a "critical priority area." 

</span></div><div><span>835 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I find myself questioning which is truly the most critical priority area, the funding for our Police 

or  the  travel  allowances  for  Members  of  Parliament.    In  our  budget,  there  is  an  allocation  of 

$400,000 for travel allowances, and I cannot help but wonder which of these two areas is more 

important.  Given the pressing needs of our Police in our country, this is a matter that deserves 

careful consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>We have also heard previous comments regarding shipping in the Cook Islands, emphasising the 

need for better connectivity with our Outer Islands.  I feel sorry for the two shipping companies 

operating in our country.  My thoughts are with the families running these companies, as well as 

the dedicated individuals working for them. 

</span></div><div><span>We know that one of the shipping companies has been serving our country for over 30 years, and 

today we heard about the challenges both companies are facing in the Cook Islands.  If these issues 

persist,  why  haven’t  we  taken  any  steps  to  address  the  difficulties  these  two  companies  are 

encountering? 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding  the  airport  mentioned  by  the  Honourable  Member  for  Mangaia,  we  heard  about  the 

government's  plans  for  the  airport  in  Manihiki,  including  contributions  from  our  development 

partners and support from our government.  A year has already passed, and we are still waiting for 

progress on the Manihiki airport project.  I do not wish to undermine the people of Manihiki, as 

they are also my family.  I simply want to share my thoughts with the House. 

</span></div><div><span>In 1971, the population  of Manihiki was around 200 people.   Considering that the government 

plans to spend over $23 million on the airport, this amounts to approximately $102,000 per person 

when  distributed  among  the  population.    This  raises  the  question  on  what  will  the  return  on 

investment be for the entire nation?  We are all aware that only one plane flies to Manihiki every 

fortnight.  In contrast, for the island of Aitutaki, we have invested about $3.4 million to improve 

their airstrip, which sees more than 30 flights a week from Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Through this, we can clearly see the benefits we are reaping from the tourists visiting Aitutaki, as 

well as the foods that are transported there.  The question I want to raise today draws from what 

the  Member  from  Mangaia  mentioned,  highlighting  a  significant  problem  and  concern  on  the 

island of Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe this  is also  a significant  issue on the island of Atiu,  underscoring the urgent  need for 

improvements to their airports.  Those are the thoughts I wish to present before this House.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather, you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone here, as well as to 

</span><span>our people listening on the radio and watching the live stream from abroad.  Mr Speaker, we are 

</span><span>presented with the Supplementary Budget necessary to carry us through to the end of the financial 

year.  The total amount required is $396 million, which will sustain us until 30</span><span>th</span><span> June.  

</span></div><div><span>836 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My question is this, given that there are insufficient funds to meet all our needs, particularly in the 

crucial area of agriculture, how do we plan to address this significant requirement for our country? 

</span></div><div><span>Over  170,000  tourists  have  visited  our  country,  highlighting  the  urgent  need  for  support  in 

agriculture.  I speak from a place of understanding that our planters are unable to supply enough 

produce to meet the demands of our hotels and accommodations for tourists.  I believe this is a 

crucial area where the economic benefits will not merely go to business owners but will instead 

directly support our own people. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding  the  island  of  Mangaia,  we  recognise  the  efforts  of  one  of  our  young  men,  Arama 

Wigmore,  who  has  been  cultivating  produce  on  Mangaia  and  bringing  it  to  Rarotonga.    My 

question is, what  is  the  government  doing  to  support the transportation  of agricultural  produce 

from the Outer Islands to facilitate sales in Rarotonga? 

</span></div><div><span>There are other regions in our country that are eager to support Rarotonga, but I have observed 

that the government is not providing the necessary assistance for them to offer services in this area.  

We recognise that Air Rarotonga needs to generate profit to sustain its operations, and similarly, 

our two local shipping companies also require support.  It is essential that the government actively 

supports these services. 

</span></div><div><span>There is another important area I would like us to consider.  Many of our people are constructing 

small  huts  to  provide  accommodations  for  visiting  tourists,  both  in  Rarotonga  and  the  Outer 

Islands.    I  empathise  with  those  who  have  invested  significant  amounts  of  their  money  in  this 

endeavour, yet there is a noticeable lack of support from our government to assist them.  I believe 

that government employees who travel to the Outer Islands should consider staying in these small 

business accommodations, as it would benefit both our local economy and the community. 

</span></div><div><span>Each  year,  we  allocate  a  significant  portion  of  our  national  budget  to  tourism,  seemingly 

prioritising investments to attract tourists to our country.  However, we must consider our own 

people who have invested in their holiday homes and other local developments.  I strongly support 

the Member for Akaoa in highlighting the amount of money being directed towards the airport 

development in Manihiki.  While that is important, we must also acknowledge that there are other 

areas and islands in our country that similarly require government support. 

</span></div><div><span>When examining this situation, it seems that the government is not prioritising financial support 

for our own people, who could benefit from it, but rather focusing on external interests.   I also 

want to point out, Mr Speaker, that our people in Rarotonga appear to be penalised by the current 

tax structure.  For those in the Outer Islands, once they reach an income threshold of $60,000, they 

begin  to  pay  taxes,  while  Rarotonga  contributes  significantly  more  yet  faces  disadvantages.  

Although the government offers incentives to the people of the Pa Enua, many continue to leave 

their islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I am currently awaiting the report from the Statistics Office regarding the number of foreigners 

</span><span>currently  in  our  country.    I  believe  there  are  now  over  2,000  foreigners  here  to  assist  us.    Mr 

Speaker, this is concerning; the increasing number of foreigners indicates that more of our own 

</span></div><div><span>837 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>people are leaving the country.  What is the government doing to support our local business owners 

and hardworking people who are not receiving any assistance?   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  recommend  our  government  to  review  our  immigration  laws.    One  notable  way  that 

foreigners are entering our country is through sports, and many of them remain here even after 

their designated stay.  This raises the question of what has happened to their immigration status, 

as they were initially allowed to stay for only a limited time.  I do not place blame on them; rather, 

I  want  to  highlight  that  we  are  seeing  an  influx  of  people  from  the  Philippines  and  Indonesia 

coming to our shores.  I commend those who are supporting our Cook Islands community during 

this time. 

</span></div><div><span>The sad thing, Mr Speaker, is that the arrival of these individuals from abroad is leading to the 

establishment of various religious denominations in our community.  I empathise with employers 

who are bringing these foreigners here, but I also notice that many are taking on additional part-

time jobs.  If only our own people demonstrated the same work ethic, we could handle much of 

this work ourselves.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  Honourable Members, it is time for recess 

and we will continue when we return.  I will suspend the Sitting until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.14 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Honourable Members, before we suspended, the Honourable Teariki Heather 

was on the Floor.  Honourable Member, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  One area of concern I want to address 

is the condition of our roads, particularly in the Vaka Puaikura constituency.  While we have heard 

the Minister outline the government's plans, I still feel it is important to express my thoughts on 

the state of our roads in Vaka Puaikura. 

</span></div><div><span>In response to what has been previously mentioned regarding the Appropriation for the airport in 

</span><span>Manihiki, I want to highlight the importance of the revenues generated for our economy.  In Vaka 

</span><span>Puaikura,  it  is  estimated  that  70  percent  of  visiting  tourists  choose  to  stay  in  holiday 

accommodations there, yet we face some of the worst road conditions, Mr Speaker.  As the three 

Members of Parliament representing Puaikura, we cannot ignore this issue, as our constituents are 

voicing their concerns, and we are committed to bringing those concerns to this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Additionally, Mr Speaker, I want to point out that the boulders along the waterfront in Avarua, 

which serve as wave breakers coming from Trader Jacks toward the township, originate from Vaka 

Puaikura.    The  landowners  in  Puaikura  allowed  the  government  to  transport  these  boulders  to 

</span><span>Avarua to help protect our CBD area.  Just last year, the government prioritised road rehabilitation 

</span><span>efforts.    Therefore,  I  must  ask,  what  is  the  priority  for  Nikao,  where  the  road  conditions  are 

relatively better, compared to the significantly worse roads in Puaikura?   I ask the Member for 

Nikao to bear with me on this situation. 

</span></div><div><span>838 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Moreover, our constituency is facing significant issues  with waste disposal.  Human waste and 

solid waste from across the island are being dumped in Arorangi.  Additionally, our children who 

have fallen afoul of the law are also imprisoned there.  Mr Speaker, I am highlighting the urgent 

need  for  better  priorities,  especially  when  we  consider  the  substantial  revenue  generated  from 

Puaikura for our economy over the years, yet our roads remain unsealed.  I am speaking on behalf 

of the ordinary people of Rarotonga and those in the Pa Enua, emphasising that our government is 

not  adequately  supporting  our  communities  or  directing  funds  to  the  areas  that  truly  need 

development. 

</span></div><div><span>Let us consider the current condition of our hospital.  We are witnessing a significant number of 

our  nurses  and  healthcare  staff  leaving  the  country,  and  in  their  place,  we  are  seeing  foreign 

workers brought in to fill those gaps.  There are many other issues I could address, but I will pause 

here to avoid provoking a strong reaction from the other side.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank You, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable George Angene; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, your staff, and fellow Members of this House.  Kia 

Orana to everyone present.  Kia Orana to our people tuning in over the radio and watching the live 

broadcast.  To my constituents in Tupapa, Kia Orana to all of you.  I would also like to welcome 

our friend Jackie Tuara, who is seated in the Public Gallery. 

</span></div><div><span>I  do  not  have  much  to  add,  Mr  Speaker.    I  rise  today  to  give  my  strong  support  for  this 

Supplementary  Budget.    On  behalf  of  myself,  my  family,  and  all  my  supporters  from 

Tupapa/Maraerenga, I give my support to this Supplementary Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Sonny Williams; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you Honourable Speaker and your 

staff working for this Parliamentary House.  Kia Orana to the Members of the House as well.  Kia 

Orana to all our people listening in from Rarotonga, the Pa Enua, New Zealand, Australia, and 

beyond.  Mr Speaker, before I offer my full support for this Bill, I would like to make a few remarks 

</span><span>on certain points. 

</span></div><div><span>First,  I  would  like  to  discuss  the  government's  shipping  vessel  program.    I  acknowledge  the 

explanation provided by the Secretary of Finance regarding this initiative, tracing its history back 

to the days of Silk &amp; Boyd and various shipping owners, including Taio Shipping and the barge 

operations.  It is worth noting that during the Silk &amp; Boyd era, the government was also subsidising 

their services.  In recent years, the government has continued to provide subsidies for shipping, 

amounting to half a million dollars annually.  Despite the best efforts of Taio Shipping and other 

operators, many of whom have ceased operations, we cannot overlook the unfortunate incidents 

</span><span>that have plagued shipping in our country, specifically, ships running aground on reefs and the 

</span><span>tragic loss of lives associated with these events. 

</span></div><div><span>839 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to speak as a former Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Development, 

particularly  regarding  the  necessity  of  hiring  and  chartering  ships  to  transport  our  people  to 

Rarotonga for Te Maeva Nui and back.  In the early 2000s to 2010, our only option was to charter 

local  shipping.    It  is fair to  say that waiting  on the wharf for those ships to  arrive was often a 

difficult experience.  As the individual responsible for chartering these vessels, I felt a significant 

responsibility toward the well-being, safety, and health of the passengers. 

</span></div><div><span>Many times, ships coming from the Northern Group Islands would arrive with a quarter of the 

passengers needing urgent medical attention for pneumonia.  We all know how passengers often 

ended up staying in makeshift tents on the deck for three or four days, enduring harsh weather, 

high seas, and relentless sea spray.  As a result, many would fall ill, necessitating ambulances to 

take them straight to the hospital upon arrival.  Often, they had been wet at sea for two or three 

days, leading to their vulnerable state. 

</span></div><div><span>Having witnessed these conditions firsthand, it became apparent that we needed to seek better, 

safer shipping options for our people.  This need led us to explore alternatives like the Lady Naomi 

from Samoa and Tahiti Nui from French Polynesia.  Continuing to rely on local shipping under 

those harsh conditions was simply unreasonable.  It was unfair to expect our people to endure such 

hardships, struggle to recover, and then perform at Te Maeva Nui. 

</span></div><div><span>I  understand  that  there  are  many  comments  regarding  the  shipping  situation,  particularly 

concerning the Chinese vessel.  While there are also Japanese ships in the mix, the current focus 

seems to be on the Chinese ship.  It is important to note that those making these complaints have 

likely  never  experienced  travel  on  the  interisland  vessels.    They  have  not  faced  the  difficult 

conditions that passengers endure, nor have they suffered illness while aboard these ships. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  completely  and  wholeheartedly  support  this  Vote  Item  that  our  government  has 

undertaken to enhance the safety of shipping for our Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>I recall the tragic incident when a ferry sank in Tonga, resulting in the loss of nearly 100 lives, as 

well as the Rabaul Queen in Papua New Guinea, which caught fire while docked, leading to further 

fatalities.  In the aftermath of these disasters, regulations and shipping laws within the Pacific were 

strengthened to prevent similar tragedies across the region and within our own country.  Therefore, 

</span><span>we have no option but to enhance and progress the conditions of our Pa Enua shipping.  For this 

</span><span>reason, I support this Item in the amendment Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would also like to address public safety governance, specifically the police initiative 

related to the $145,000 allocated for Community Policing.  In Takitumu, particularly in Titikaveka, 

Ngatangiia,  and  Puaikura,  we,  along  with  Rob  and  his  team,  initiated  the  Community  Policing 

program before Christmas last year in response to public complaints about road safety and petty 

thefts affecting our villages. 

</span></div><div><span>We gathered volunteers from our villages to launch the Community Policing initiative, with strong 

</span><span>support and coordination from our Police Department.  While I support this Item, I would like to 

take a moment, on behalf of my fellow Members of Parliament, Rob, Kaka, and myself, to thank 

the volunteers who responded to our call to help kickstart our community policing efforts.   

</span></div><div><span>840 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our volunteers sacrificed their Christmas Eve, Christmas night, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s 

night to join us on the roads, ensuring the safety of our communities.  Therefore, thank you to all 

the volunteers who took the challenge of keeping our communities safe on behalf of everyone in 

this House.  Thank you to the Minister of Police, our Prime Minister, and the Minister of Finance 

for providing this appropriation; I believe we are confident to achieve great things moving forward.  

I would like to invite the Member for Matavera to join this program so that all of Takitumu can 

benefit from community policing.  Thank you, Prime Minister, for your support. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally,  I would like to  address the topic of debt servicing and fiscal management, particularly 

regarding the accelerated payments on pandemic-related loans aimed at reducing long-term debt 

servicing  costs.    I  fully  support  this  initiative,  as  it  highlights  the  importance  of  accelerated 

repayment, which will ultimately help us decrease our debt over time.  This is a significant concern 

among our people, who worry that these loans may burden our grandchildren.  However, because 

we have effectively managed our finances during this period, we are in a position to accelerate the 

repayment of these loans.  This reflects our strong financial status.  Those are my thoughts, Mr 

Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Sonny Williams.  I see the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Kia Orana to all you this afternoon.  I just wanted to say a few 

words on the merits of this Bill because later we will have the opportunity to go through each Vote 

Item. 

</span></div><div><span>The purpose of a Supplementary Appropriation should be to cater for unforeseen revenue receipts 

or expenditure not identified from the original appropriation.  You would not expect there to be 

any  significant  changes  unless  there  has  been  a  disaster  or  unforeseen  circumstances.    This 

Appropriation Amendment is not that.  It is not merely a routine financial adjustment; it is much 

more than that. 

</span></div><div><span>With the 2025/26 Budget set to be presented in a few months’ time, the scale of this Supplementary 

Budget is therefore quite alarming.  The Bill increases total government expenditure from $328.3 

million to $396.3 million, an extraordinary $68 million increase.  

</span></div><div><span>Now, government claims that this is due to increased revenue.  Its spending decisions however, 

indicate a prioritisation of political self-interest over public interest.  

</span></div><div><span>In  the  presentation  that  the  Opposition  received  from  MFEM,  and  we  are  grateful,  I  have  to 

acknowledge we are grateful for the presentation because we are a little bit more educated than we 

were yesterday.   

</span></div><div><span>One of the key things that they were pushing is that the increased budget was to address critical 

</span><span>priorities and it is this very definition of “critical priorities” that I want to comment on.  Of course, 

</span><span>previous speakers have spoken about the increased amount for Members of Parliament travel and 

the amount of the increase is about $450,000, and when you look at that amount and then you look 

at the amount that is allocated for the Police, it makes absolutely no sense. 

</span></div><div><span>841 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Moreover, if you examine the spending on welfare, there has been no increase in that area.  This 

raises questions about the definition of “critical priorities” outlined in the budget statement.  We 

were informed that $42 million was allocated to pay off an old debt, which was deemed expensive.  

While repaying debt is typically a positive move, I question the timing and scale of that repayment.  

Given that we are facing inflation and a high cost of living, it seems reasonable to expect more 

consideration for increasing welfare payments during this challenging period. 

</span></div><div><span>It also concerns me that the debt repayment appears to be the ‘knee jerk’ reaction as supposed to 

have a better strategic plan over a few years.  I also notice that there was a decline in foreign aid 

for $90 million to $83.2 million and the concern there is, which critical infrastructure and public 

services are going to be affected by that decrease. 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at the overall budget, we cannot with any justification say that the increase revenue 

has been applied to priority areas because from this side of the chamber, the priority areas for us 

are health, education, police and the vulnerable.  We do not see that in this budget.  Thank you, 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Tim 

Varu; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker and all Members in this House.  The two members of our 

United Party, my colleagues from Puaikura, have already shared their perspectives on the budget.  

However,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  express  my  own  thoughts  regarding  my 

constituency of Ruaau. 

</span></div><div><span>In our area of Ruaau, one of the essential needs for our electorate is water.  I recall that last year, 

there  was  a  public  consultation  focused  on  water  for  the  island  of  Rarotonga.    I  attended  the 

meeting held in Puaikura, where the Deputy Prime Minister explained the government's objectives 

for  our  water  system.    However,  before  he  could  share  the  government's  explanation,  several 

individuals had already voiced their opinions and thoughts.  When it was the Minister's turn to 

speak,  he  provided  some  insights.    I  understand  that  public  consultations  were  also  held  in 

Titikaveka and Te-Au-O-Tonga.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, regarding our village of Arorangi and my constituency of Ruaau, we are significantly 

</span><span>affected when water levels are low.  I deeply sympathise with my constituents, especially since 

this problem often arises on Sundays.  Unfortunately, that is often the day when they choose to 

contact me, and it coincides with the closure of the To Tatou Vai office. 

</span></div><div><span>We understand that when people lack access to water, they will seek alternative solutions.  I have 

been cautioned that once water is being transported on a Sunday, people will start approaching you 

for assistance.  Most of the time, when individuals come asking for help, you can't help but feel 

sorry for them.  I want to reference the statement from this Supplementary Budget, which mentions 

</span><span>a provision of $500,000 for "water allowances to support household water allocation." 

</span></div><div><span>A few weeks ago, I saw some employees from To Tatou Vai repairing the pipeline along our main 

road.  I inquired about the primary water issues affecting our area of Ruaau, and they informed me 

</span></div><div><span>842 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>that the old water pipes are still in use in Ruaau.  With the allocation of $500,000, I believe this 

funding will be directed toward repairing and improving the water supply for Ruaau.  

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to ask the Members from Titikaveka and Ngatangiia not to cut the water supply 

to the rest of the island, as this may be contributing to the low water availability in my area. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, I give my support to this Appropriation Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, your parliamentary staff, and all the Honourable 

Members of this House.  I appreciate the valuable insights shared by the speakers who have come 

before me.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to express some of my own concerns 

that I believe are important to address in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>It may seem small, but I want to emphasise that it is both critical and important.  First and foremost, 

I would like to convey my thoughts regarding the appropriation for Education.  While I stand in 

support  of  this  funding,  I  feel  it  is  insufficient;  nonetheless,  I  will  continue  to  support  it.  

Additionally, I want to highlight the allocation for Internal Affairs, particularly concerning our 

scholarship students from the Outer Islands who are studying here in Rarotonga.  This is especially 

pertinent for our children who have reached the age of 16 but are still attending school. 

</span></div><div><span>Let us consider the situation regarding education in Mangaia.  I want to involve the Ministry of 

Internal Affairs and Education in this discussion, as it pertains to them.  Currently, when a child 

turns 16 years old, they no longer receive the Child Welfare pension.  However, in Mangaia, many 

students continue their education beyond this age, attending Year 12 and Year 13.  There may be 

similar scenarios in other locations, such as Aitutaki and Atiu. The essence of my point is that the 

government should extend financial support to these students who are still in school, to help them 

further their education and expand their knowledge. 

</span></div><div><span>For  those  who  travel  to  Rarotonga  on  scholarships,  they  receive  financial  support  from  the 

government.  However, there are many children who remain on the island because their parents 

</span><span>prefer them to stay, often due to housing issues in Rarotonga.  These are my thoughts, Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>regarding the need for ongoing support for our children in Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge the allocation made to Infrastructure Cook Islands, as we have been 

asked to support this appropriation. Therefore, I stand in support of it. However, I must address a 

concern  that  was  raised  earlier  in  this  Sitting  regarding  where  most  of  the  spending  for  road 

improvements is taking place, which is primarily in Rarotonga. For Mangaia, the island closest to 

Rarotonga, this situation is not feasible.  

</span></div><div><span>Last year, there was supposed to be an improvement on a particular road; we supplied the metal 

</span><span>and tar, yet I am unsure what happened to that appropriation, especially since the 200th anniversary 

celebrations have already passed.  I have not seen any allocation designated for the enhancement 

of our roads, apart from a small area in Oneroa.  Furthermore, there has been a request made to the

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Minister, but he claims to be unaware of the situation.  Mr Speaker, I have already communicated 

to the Minister that this issue is a matter of life and death, because… 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Speaker! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order Honourable Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I highlighted earlier that I would come back to this House 

once I have gathered the information concerning her request but if she wants to preempt my answer 

into her own words that I will refrain from returning information requested at Question Time.  So, 

it is up to her Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.   Honourable Member, I believe we should 

conclude our discussion about the airport in Mangaia for now, as I anticipate a response will be 

provided tomorrow concerning this matter. Please feel free to continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS. T. MATAPO: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  We'll set that matter aside and await the response.  

I would like to address the appropriation of $2 million for the Ministry of Cultural Development, 

as many people are inquiring about any funding allocated for our celebrations.  For the island of 

Mangaia, our celebrations take place in April.  While our understanding of this appropriation may 

be limited, I genuinely believe that the funds allocated for culture are adequate for our needs.  

</span></div><div><span>So,  Mr  Speaker,  that  is  all  I  have  to  say  on  the  matter,  and  I  hereby  give  my  support  for  this 

Supplementary Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister. You 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Members and mostly to 

the  Members  from  the  Opposition  for  giving  their  support  to  the  Supplementary  Budget.  Mr 

Speaker,  I  am  amazed  to  hear  the  Member  from  Akaoa  saying  that  we  have  a  lot  of  money 

appropriated to the Pa Enua and the Member from Tamarua is saying that a lot of money is being 

appropriated on Rarotonga.  So, I leave it to the Members to come to an agreement so I can approve 

</span><span>their requests. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to revisit the topic of our vessel, Mr Speaker.  We acknowledge that $3 million has 

been allocated for this purpose.  It is important to note that we have been working on securing this 

vessel for over four years, ensuring that it is appropriate and suitable for transporting cargo and a 

limited number of passengers to the Pa Enua.  

</span></div><div><span>We were very firm, Mr Speaker, with both the Government of Japan and the Government of China 

regarding the specifications we required for our interisland vessel.  I am pleased that our team took 

</span><span>the necessary time to ensure we did not simply accept any vessel that was offered to us.  Instead, 

</span><span>we  insisted  on  a  vessel  that  would  fulfill  our  requirements  for  long-term  operation  and  low 

maintenance.    We  prioritised  a  design  that  would  keep  operating  costs  manageable  and,  most 

</span></div><div><span>844 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>importantly,  ensured  that  safety  and  compliance  standards  for  these  vessels  are  of  utmost 

importance to us. 

</span></div><div><span>The challenge, Mr Speaker, is that there are not many ocean-going vessels of this size available.  

When  we  look  at  our  neighboring  countries  like  Tonga  and  Samoa,  their  populations  exceed 

150,000 to 250,000 people, 10 times our own population.  Consequently, their shipping needs are 

tenfold, requiring significantly more freight and cargo capacity, as well as the ability to transport 

many more passengers to their Pa Enua.  This explains why we see larger ships, such as the Lady 

Naomi and others, navigating our waters. 

</span></div><div><span>However, we simply cannot sustain vessels of that size, which is why we must explore smaller 

vessels that can effectively accommodate our cargo volumes and the number of passengers we 

need to transport. 

</span></div><div><span>I  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  the  people  in  the  Pa  Enua,  along  with  the  Members  of  Parliament 

representing them, are eagerly looking forward to a high-quality shipping service that adequately 

meets their needs. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is one of the key requirements for us to try and grow our economy by ensuring 

that each of our islands can contribute to the Cook Islands economy.  It is not just about shipping, 

Mr  Speaker;  we  also  need  to  focus  on  our  airports,  specifically  the  necessity  of  sealing  our 

runways. 

</span></div><div><span>The Member from Akaoa raised a crucial point regarding Aitutaki, which now handles up to 30 

flights a week.  This success is a result of the infrastructure we have put in place to facilitate such 

growth.  Without the runway sealing we completed 20 years ago, we would still be relying on 

Bandit aircraft to reach Aitutaki.  Mr Speaker, the vision of this government is clear, by investing 

in infrastructure, when we do this infrastructure work, because we have seen it happen – the growth 

that happened in Aitutaki we will give the opportunity now for other islands to be able to seize on 

that opportunity and grow their abilities and their opportunities. 

</span></div><div><span>What are we doing to encourage the outer islands to participate in our economy, Mr Speaker?  We 

are implementing the very same initiatives that the Opposition Members are critical of, such as the 

</span><span>$60,000  tax-free  threshold.    These  incentives,  Mr  Speaker,  are  designed  to  attract  motivated 

</span><span>individuals to work and produce in the outer islands, as they can retain all their income until they 

exceed  $60,000.    For  hardworking  couples,  this  means  a  combined  income  of  up  to  $120,000 

before any taxes become applicable.  Those who are driven and see the opportunity, Mr Speaker, 

will certainly take advantage of this. 

</span></div><div><span>Members have highlighted the potential for planting and exporting crops here in Rarotonga, noting 

that individuals can do so up to a value of $160,000 without incurring income tax, Mr Speaker.  

This government is actively seeking ways to empower people to improve their own circumstances. 

</span><span>However, we must also consider the situation in Rarotonga.  A visit to any of our Pa Enua makes 

</span><span>it clear just how challenging  life can be there.    The further you go, the  tougher it gets.   In the 

Northern Group, you do not know if you are going to get a boat in the next three, four, five months. 

</span></div><div><span>845 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Looking back 60 years, Mr Speaker, attending functions such as bereavements or weddings meant 

that if you wanted to bring food, you had to catch a homegrown chicken.  Nowadays, the price of 

chicken in Rarotonga is quite affordable, about $30 a carton.  People can easily buy one, two, or 

even 10 cartons to take along.  However, in the Outer Islands, the situation is very different.  A 

carton of chicken can cost $80, and at times, there may not even be any available because the boat 

did not deliver the goods. 

</span></div><div><span>So, when we complain about our life here in Rarotonga, we must remember the life of our people 

in the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  a  good  water  system  over  here  but  maybe  not  so  good  in  Ruaau  but  in  the  Pa  Enua, 

especially in the north again, one of our islands in the south, water is a struggle.  I know that our 

Pa Enua people wish that they had a water system like our one here in Rarotonga.  So, let’s not 

forget that the policy of this government is that no one in the tribe will be left behind – no one left 

out. 

</span></div><div><span>The Appropriation, Mr Speaker, dedicated to road improvements, is a long-awaited initiative.  I 

understand that these funds will be utilised for the back road in Nikao.  However, we also have 

outstanding projects in Titikaveka and Puaikura that need to be addressed.  This Supplementary 

Budget aims to expedite the construction of key roads, allowing us to seal all our roads as quickly 

as possible.  This will help ensure that the roads meet the high standards that our people have come 

to expect here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the comments that our budget is unusual, Mr Speaker, as I mentioned in my Budget 

Speech, the additional $68 million may initially appear to be a significant and excessive amount.  

Let me again put that into perspective, Mr Speaker.  Of the $68 million, $19 million is being carried 

forward  from  the  previous  year’s  appropriation.  A  substantial  portion  of  this  amount  is  due  to 

timing of infrastructure projects.  This is not new money, as you would say; rather, it is unspent 

money that needs to be carried forward to this year and utilised this year. 

</span></div><div><span>Another significant amount, Mr Speaker, is the $40 million allocated for debt servicing.  During 

the COVID years, particularly in 2020, the government tapped into its entire economic stabilisation 

fund of $78 million and also accessed over $150 million in New Zealand grant funding.  However, 

</span><span>we  still  needed  to  incur  debt,  Mr  Speaker,  through  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  which  was 

</span><span>essential for keeping our businesses afloat.  Furthermore, since we graduated to high-income status 

in 2020, the debt we acquired from the ADB was at commercial rates, which means we are no 

longer eligible for concessional financing typically available to a country like us. 

</span></div><div><span>What we have done, Mr Speaker, is that as these debts have now become due, four years after their 

inception, we have successfully repaid a considerable amount, totaling approximately $40 million.  

This achievement has allowed us to reduce the anticipated debt servicing costs for the next four to 

five years to a more manageable level.  Consequently, we can now allocate funds to critical areas 

</span><span>such as welfare and addressing cost of living increases.  This exemplifies good, sound financial 

</span><span>management.  By adhering to the principles of effective financial management and the medium-

term budgeting outlined in our Supplementary Budget, we anticipate that our country will return

</span></div><div><span>to  significant  surpluses in  the coming years while also bringing down our debt  to  very modest 

levels. 

</span></div><div><span>We have come through 2022 when we opened our borders to 2024 the recovering of our economy 

is complete.  We now look to the growth, Mr Speaker, and new opportunities that our country will 

be able to provide for our people because of the sound financial footings that we stand on. 

</span></div><div><span>With those words, Mr Speaker, I commend this Supplementary Budget to the House and thank the 

Members for their support.  Thank you.
