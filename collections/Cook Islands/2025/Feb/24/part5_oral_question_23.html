<h3>Oral Question 23</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>She is getting ahead of herself.  As I pointed out, there is a shipping roadmap 

that outlines our path forward.  As I pointed out,  our focus is on acquiring one or two ships to 

</span><span>eventually provide service to our Pa Enua.  Whether that will be run by the government under a 

</span><span>national service or contracted out service remains to be seen therefore is we choose to contracted 

out the service of our ship.  How can we nationalise that service?  If we choose to give the ship to 

a company to run, how can you nationalise the service?  As Iâ€™ve said Mr Speaker, in due course 

we  will  determine  what  is  the  best  way  to  operate  a  shipping  service  that  our  Pa  Enua  people 

deserve, especially at a price that they can afford and a service that is regular and complies to the 

highest safety standards so that we do not have a continuation of tragedies that have occurred in 

our domestic shipping service.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
