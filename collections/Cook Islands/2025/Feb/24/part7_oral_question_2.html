<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR  R.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable  Members  this  afternoon.    I  have  a 

Supplementary Question related to the issue raised by the Member for Rangiatea regarding the 

allocation for the Police.  I would like to commend the government for increasing the appropriation 

to  the  Police,  enabling  them  to  carry  out  their  responsibilities  effectively  until  the  end  of  the 

financial year.  However, as noted by the Member, this amount may still not be sufficient. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you to the staff of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management for their guidance 

to the PAC committee on how we can enhance this aspect of our budget.  They have assured us 

that there will be improvements to the Police budget in the upcoming main budget.  As a member 

of the PAC committee, I support this appropriation and would like to share some of my thoughts 

regarding this supplementary matter. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  government  spending,  I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  appropriation  allocated  to 

Members of Parliament for overseas travel allowances.  It is worth noting that there has been a 

</span><span>significant increase in the budget for these travel allowances over the years.  In our meeting with 

</span><span>MFEM, they described this budget category as a "critical priority area."

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I find myself questioning which is truly the most critical priority area, the funding for our Police 

or  the  travel  allowances  for  Members  of  Parliament.    In  our  budget,  there  is  an  allocation  of 

$400,000 for travel allowances, and I cannot help but wonder which of these two areas is more 

important.  Given the pressing needs of our Police in our country, this is a matter that deserves 

careful consideration. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We have also heard previous comments regarding shipping in the Cook Islands, emphasising the 

need for better connectivity with our Outer Islands.  I feel sorry for the two shipping companies 

operating in our country.  My thoughts are with the families running these companies, as well as 

the dedicated individuals working for them. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We know that one of the shipping companies has been serving our country for over 30 years, and 

today we heard about the challenges both companies are facing in the Cook Islands.  If these issues 

persist,  why  havenâ€™t  we  taken  any  steps  to  address  the  difficulties  these  two  companies  are 

encountering? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  the  airport  mentioned  by  the  Honourable  Member  for  Mangaia,  we  heard  about  the 

government's  plans  for  the  airport  in  Manihiki,  including  contributions  from  our  development 

partners and support from our government.  A year has already passed, and we are still waiting for 

progress on the Manihiki airport project.  I do not wish to undermine the people of Manihiki, as 

they are also my family.  I simply want to share my thoughts with the House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In 1971, the population  of Manihiki was around 200 people.   Considering that the government 

plans to spend over $23 million on the airport, this amounts to approximately $102,000 per person 

when  distributed  among  the  population.    This  raises  the  question  on  what  will  the  return  on 

investment be for the entire nation?  We are all aware that only one plane flies to Manihiki every 

fortnight.  In contrast, for the island of Aitutaki, we have invested about $3.4 million to improve 

their airstrip, which sees more than 30 flights a week from Rarotonga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Through this, we can clearly see the benefits we are reaping from the tourists visiting Aitutaki, as 

well as the foods that are transported there.  The question I want to raise today draws from what 

the  Member  from  Mangaia  mentioned,  highlighting  a  significant  problem  and  concern  on  the 

island of Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I believe this  is also  a significant  issue on the island of Atiu,  underscoring the urgent  need for 

improvements to their airports.  Those are the thoughts I wish to present before this House.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather, you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone here, as well as to 

</span><span>our people listening on the radio and watching the live stream from abroad.  Mr Speaker, we are 

</span><span>presented with the Supplementary Budget necessary to carry us through to the end of the financial 

year.  The total amount required is $396 million, which will sustain us until 30</span><span>th</span><span> June.

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is this, given that there are insufficient funds to meet all our needs, particularly in the 

crucial area of agriculture, how do we plan to address this significant requirement for our country? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Over  170,000  tourists  have  visited  our  country,  highlighting  the  urgent  need  for  support  in 

agriculture.  I speak from a place of understanding that our planters are unable to supply enough 

produce to meet the demands of our hotels and accommodations for tourists.  I believe this is a 

crucial area where the economic benefits will not merely go to business owners but will instead 

directly support our own people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  the  island  of  Mangaia,  we  recognise  the  efforts  of  one  of  our  young  men,  Arama 

Wigmore,  who  has  been  cultivating  produce  on  Mangaia  and  bringing  it  to  Rarotonga.    My 

question is, what  is  the  government  doing  to  support the transportation  of agricultural  produce 

from the Outer Islands to facilitate sales in Rarotonga? 

</span></div>
<div><span>There are other regions in our country that are eager to support Rarotonga, but I have observed 

that the government is not providing the necessary assistance for them to offer services in this area.  

We recognise that Air Rarotonga needs to generate profit to sustain its operations, and similarly, 

our two local shipping companies also require support.  It is essential that the government actively 

supports these services. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There is another important area I would like us to consider.  Many of our people are constructing 

small  huts  to  provide  accommodations  for  visiting  tourists,  both  in  Rarotonga  and  the  Outer 

Islands.    I  empathise  with  those  who  have  invested  significant  amounts  of  their  money  in  this 

endeavour, yet there is a noticeable lack of support from our government to assist them.  I believe 

that government employees who travel to the Outer Islands should consider staying in these small 

business accommodations, as it would benefit both our local economy and the community. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Each  year,  we  allocate  a  significant  portion  of  our  national  budget  to  tourism,  seemingly 

prioritising investments to attract tourists to our country.  However, we must consider our own 

people who have invested in their holiday homes and other local developments.  I strongly support 

the Member for Akaoa in highlighting the amount of money being directed towards the airport 

development in Manihiki.  While that is important, we must also acknowledge that there are other 

areas and islands in our country that similarly require government support. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When examining this situation, it seems that the government is not prioritising financial support 

for our own people, who could benefit from it, but rather focusing on external interests.   I also 

want to point out, Mr Speaker, that our people in Rarotonga appear to be penalised by the current 

tax structure.  For those in the Outer Islands, once they reach an income threshold of $60,000, they 

begin  to  pay  taxes,  while  Rarotonga  contributes  significantly  more  yet  faces  disadvantages.  

Although the government offers incentives to the people of the Pa Enua, many continue to leave 

their islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I am currently awaiting the report from the Statistics Office regarding the number of foreigners 

</span><span>currently  in  our  country.    I  believe  there  are  now  over  2,000  foreigners  here  to  assist  us.    Mr 

Speaker, this is concerning; the increasing number of foreigners indicates that more of our own

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>people are leaving the country.  What is the government doing to support our local business owners 

and hardworking people who are not receiving any assistance?   

</span></div>
<div><span>I  would  recommend  our  government  to  review  our  immigration  laws.    One  notable  way  that 

foreigners are entering our country is through sports, and many of them remain here even after 

their designated stay.  This raises the question of what has happened to their immigration status, 

as they were initially allowed to stay for only a limited time.  I do not place blame on them; rather, 

I  want  to  highlight  that  we  are  seeing  an  influx  of  people  from  the  Philippines  and  Indonesia 

coming to our shores.  I commend those who are supporting our Cook Islands community during 

this time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The sad thing, Mr Speaker, is that the arrival of these individuals from abroad is leading to the 

establishment of various religious denominations in our community.  I empathise with employers 

who are bringing these foreigners here, but I also notice that many are taking on additional part-

time jobs.  If only our own people demonstrated the same work ethic, we could handle much of 

this work ourselves.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  Honourable Members, it is time for recess 

and we will continue when we return.  I will suspend the Sitting until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.30 p.m. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.14 p.m.
