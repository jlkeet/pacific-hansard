</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>We have come to Oral Questions and that will be for 30 minutes.  I now open 

the Floor to Honourable Members.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Members of this House 

</span><span>and those who are listening and also those who are present in the Public Gallery, greetings to you 

</span><span>all.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  a  question  for  the  Prime  Minister,  Honourable  Mark  Brown,  concerning  the  Consulate 

Office of the Cook Islands in Auckland.  Is this office still operational?  I have heard it may no 

longer be in operation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Hon. Prime Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the United Party for 

this question.  Now, I would like to take you back to the year 2020.  During that period of COVID 

and a quarantine was imposed on all businesses in New Zealand.  In those two years of the lock 

down  period  in  New  Zealand,  Mr  Speaker  our  office  was  not  used.    The  workers,  our  Consul 

General, the staff all operated remotely from home. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact, when the lease came due for renewal, Mr Speaker we paid significant amounts of money 

in  rental  for  a  building  that  nobody  was  inside.    So,  when  the  lease  came  up  for  renewal  the 

Government decided to wait until we see how the situation is going to pan out and since that time, 

Mr Speaker as our economy has been looking to recover, we have been very careful in where we 

put our money into these areas that need additional financing such as renewal of leases especially 

when our staff in Auckland have been so effective in being able to work remotely. 

</span></div><div><span>I understand the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is looking at a review of our International Offices and 

our High Commissions and the Minister of Foreign Affairs would be better prepared to answer 

this question in full.  From what I understand the outcome of the review will determine what type 

of office we will need in Auckland and we will also look at the role of our High Commission in 

Wellington and our High Commission in Fiji and with our growing international engagements, 

whether it is worthwhile for us to also look at considering a High Commission in Australia.  But 

these, Mr Speaker will be the outcomes of the review that is currently being undertaken by the 

Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister for providing an honest response, 

which  helps  us  understand  the  situation  regarding  our  offices,  especially  with  so  many  stories 

</span><span>circulating. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo; you have the Floor.   

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Kia Orana Honourable Speaker and Kia Orana to us all.  I would like to ask 

a question to the Minister of Infrastructure Cook Islands (ICI).  As we are all aware, the condition 

of the airport on the island of Mangaia has been a concern.  Last Friday the flight to Mangaia was 

cancelled and people both in Mangaia and Rarotonga was waiting for the flight to Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>The situation concerning our airport in Mangaia is quite concerning.  When heavy rain falls on the 

</span><span>island, the airport conditions deteriorate, leading to water pooling on the airstrip, which prevents 

planes from landing.  Therefore, I would like to ask the Honourable Minister of ICI what plans are 

in place to address the issues at the Mangaia airport?

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker, to the 

Clerk of this House, to all you staff and to everyone in this House this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Speaker,  I  request  that  this  House  allow  me  some  time  to  investigate  this  matter 

further.  I will be reaching out to Mangaia to seek clarification on the situation.  Specifically, I will 

contact the new EO, Mia Teaurima, to inquire about the condition of the airport in Mangaia, as its 

management falls under the administration of the island government. 

</span></div><div><span>ICI only becomes involved when there is a request for assistance from Rarotonga.  I believe the 

airport in Mangaia is in need of a roller to stabilise the runway.  I have heard that the roller machine 

on the island was set on fire by locals.  However, Mia Teaurima confirmed to me a couple of weeks 

ago that he has reached out to a contractor here in Rarotonga to request a roller to help complete 

the necessary work on the airstrip in Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>In relation to the question about the airport, please bear with me, I will contact Mia in Mangaia 

and will consult with the ICI office here in Rarotonga to determine what support we can provide 

for the airport in Mangaia.  Thank you, Honourable Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Minister,  I  will  grant  you  the  time  to  communicate  with  the 

necessary individuals to address the question.  Once you've gathered the information, please return 

to provide your response. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Speaker.    My  question  is  to  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister of our country.  I would like to inquire about our Sovereign Wealth Fund.  This matter 

has previously been presented to the people of Rarotonga during a public consultation.  I am asking 

this question because I strongly support the Fund. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is, since the public consultation, where do we stand with this Fund? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, to the Member from Rangiatea for this question on the Sovereign 

Wealth Fund.  I can report, Honourable Member, that this week, two of our microeconomists from 

the Ministry of Finance  are in  New Zealand engaging with the Reserve  Bank of New Zealand 

regarding the establishment of our Sovereign Wealth Fund. 

</span></div><div><span>The Sovereign Wealth Fund is something we have been discussing for over 10 years, Mr Speaker.  

</span><span>As part of our journey with Seabed Minerals, we need to consider how we would safeguard any 

</span><span>income  generated  from  these  resources,  especially  after  all  our  exploration,  studies,  and 

environmental  assessments  have  indicated  commercial  viability.    How  do  we  ensure  that  the 

revenue we earn from Seabed Minerals is protected?

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We examined how other countries manage their mineral wealth, including oil and gas resources, 

Mr Speaker.  Countries like Australia, Nauru, and Norway served as key examples in this regard.  

It is clear, Mr Speaker, that in terms of long-term investment and safeguarding national income 

derived from mineral resources, the model provided by Norway stands out as one of the best in the 

world. 

</span></div><div><span>So, after a series of public consultations with no doubt, that the Member has been a part of, the 

team has now progressed their consultations and discussions now into looking at, how others in 

particular the expertise of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand would be able to assist us.  In fact, it 

was just last year, Honourable Member that I met with the governor of the Reserve Bank when he 

was here in Rarotonga, that is the governor, Edwin Oar.  And he expressed his willingness to help 

the Cook Islands in the establishment of our Sovereign Wealth Fund. 

</span></div><div><span>I look forward, Mr Speaker, to the updates from our team regarding the progress being made on 

the establishment of our Sovereign Wealth Fund and potential collaboration with New Zealand.  

Contrary to reports in the media suggesting a breakdown in our relationship with New Zealand, 

Mr Speaker, the reality is that it is business as usual.  This extends beyond finance, Mr Speaker, 

encompassing other areas under the Office of the Prime Minister, including national security and 

specifically Cyber Security.  My team at the Office of the Prime Minister is in ongoing discussions 

with the New Zealand government on this important matter.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Tina Browne; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T.  PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>   Thank you, Mr Speaker, and to  everyone in  this House, Kia 

Orana to you all.  Kia Orana to all our people listening on the radio and watching the live stream. 

Additionally, Kia Orana to those seated in the Public Gallery. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a question for the Honourable Prime Minister.  In the Cook Islands newspaper, on Friday 

the  21</span><span>st</span><span>  you  were  recorded  saying  that,  government  has  been  working  to  strengthen  domestic 

shipping through international partnership as the Cook Islands may be the only Pacific nation that 

does not have a nationalise shipping service.  My question, Mr Prime Minister is are you moving 

to nationalise shipping in our country? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Thank you for the question from the Leader of the 

Opposition.  Our Ministry of Finance has a comprehensive amount of work on a shipping roadmap.  

And this is in light of the substandard shipping service that we currently have, Mr Speaker, that 

we are all aware of.  And despite the government subsidy of up to half a million dollars a year to 

support  our  private  sector  shipping  operators.    It’s  apparent  that  this  has  been  insufficient  Mr 

Speaker to provide a service that our people particularly in the Pa Enua deserves.  

</span></div><div><span>The type of vessel required to operate in the Pa Enua to a certain standard comes with a significant 

price  tag.    How  we  will  manage  the  operation  of  these  vessels  remains  to  be  determined,  Mr 

Speaker.  We have several options to consider, we could establish a National Shipping Service, 

</span></div><div><span>832 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 24 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>contract the operation out, outsource it, or provide a vessel to an existing company.  Those are the 

options available to us Mr Speaker and how it operates will remain to be seen but we will make 

sure that when we do acquire an asset that is in the value of millions of dollars.  We want to be 

sure that it will be operated properly. And we are under no illusions Mr Speaker that to start off an 

operation to run a service to our Pa Enua it will require a considerable amount of input.  But these 

are the essential critical steps we need Mr Speaker to be able to bring our Pa Enua into the wider 

Cook Islands economy.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I can the see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  I do not think I got an answer from the Prime Minister.  The 

question was whether there are plans to nationalise shipping in the Cook Islands.  The reason why 

I asked this question is because that term was used in the article and that word means the process 

of taking privately controlled companies, industries or assets and placing them under government 

control.  And what that means to me is that you will be buying the Cook Islands General Transport 

and Taio Shipping. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I can clarify with the Leader of the Opposition that 

there has been no proposal put forward to the government for  the purchase of private shipping 

companies General Transport or Taio Shipping.  I hope that satisfies the Honourable Leader. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime, yes…</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span> With respect,  Prime Minister, no, you have not  answered the 

question.  The term “nationalise” was used in the article of your interview last Friday, which raised 

immediately red flag</span><span>because my  understanding  of “nationalising” is  that you not  only  run the 

business  of  shipping  but  you  also  acquire  the  Private  Sector.    If  that  is  what  you  said  in  the 

newspaper is that what you are planning to do? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>She is getting ahead of herself.  As I pointed out, there is a shipping roadmap 

that outlines our path forward.  As I pointed out,  our focus is on acquiring one or two ships to 

</span><span>eventually provide service to our Pa Enua.  Whether that will be run by the government under a 

</span><span>national service or contracted out service remains to be seen therefore is we choose to contracted 

out the service of our ship.  How can we nationalise that service?  If we choose to give the ship to 

a company to run, how can you nationalise the service?  As I’ve said Mr Speaker, in due course 

we  will  determine  what  is  the  best  way  to  operate  a  shipping  service  that  our  Pa  Enua  people 

deserve, especially at a price that they can afford and a service that is regular and complies to the 

highest safety standards so that we do not have a continuation of tragedies that have occurred in 

our domestic shipping service.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, we have come to the end of Oral Question time.  Thank 

</span><span>you, Honourable Members, for your questions and answers.
