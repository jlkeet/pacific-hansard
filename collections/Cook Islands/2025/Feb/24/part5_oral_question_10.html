<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Speaker.    My  question  is  to  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister of our country.  I would like to inquire about our Sovereign Wealth Fund.  This matter 

has previously been presented to the people of Rarotonga during a public consultation.  I am asking 

this question because I strongly support the Fund. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question is, since the public consultation, where do we stand with this Fund? 

</span></div>
