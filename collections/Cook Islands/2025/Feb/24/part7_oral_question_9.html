<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I highlighted earlier that I would come back to this House 

once I have gathered the information concerning her request but if she wants to preempt my answer 

into her own words that I will refrain from returning information requested at Question Time.  So, 

it is up to her Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.   Honourable Member, I believe we should 

conclude our discussion about the airport in Mangaia for now, as I anticipate a response will be 

provided tomorrow concerning this matter. Please feel free to continue. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MRS. T. MATAPO: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  We'll set that matter aside and await the response.  

I would like to address the appropriation of $2 million for the Ministry of Cultural Development, 

as many people are inquiring about any funding allocated for our celebrations.  For the island of 

Mangaia, our celebrations take place in April.  While our understanding of this appropriation may 

be limited, I genuinely believe that the funds allocated for culture are adequate for our needs.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr  Speaker,  that  is  all  I  have  to  say  on  the  matter,  and  I  hereby  give  my  support  for  this 

Supplementary Budget. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister. You 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Members and mostly to 

the  Members  from  the  Opposition  for  giving  their  support  to  the  Supplementary  Budget.  Mr 

Speaker,  I  am  amazed  to  hear  the  Member  from  Akaoa  saying  that  we  have  a  lot  of  money 

appropriated to the Pa Enua and the Member from Tamarua is saying that a lot of money is being 

appropriated on Rarotonga.  So, I leave it to the Members to come to an agreement so I can approve 

</span><span>their requests. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to revisit the topic of our vessel, Mr Speaker.  We acknowledge that $3 million has 

been allocated for this purpose.  It is important to note that we have been working on securing this 

vessel for over four years, ensuring that it is appropriate and suitable for transporting cargo and a 

limited number of passengers to the Pa Enua.  

</span></div>
<div><span>We were very firm, Mr Speaker, with both the Government of Japan and the Government of China 

regarding the specifications we required for our interisland vessel.  I am pleased that our team took 

</span><span>the necessary time to ensure we did not simply accept any vessel that was offered to us.  Instead, 

</span><span>we  insisted  on  a  vessel  that  would  fulfill  our  requirements  for  long-term  operation  and  low 

maintenance.    We  prioritised  a  design  that  would  keep  operating  costs  manageable  and,  most

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>importantly,  ensured  that  safety  and  compliance  standards  for  these  vessels  are  of  utmost 

importance to us. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The challenge, Mr Speaker, is that there are not many ocean-going vessels of this size available.  

When  we  look  at  our  neighboring  countries  like  Tonga  and  Samoa,  their  populations  exceed 

150,000 to 250,000 people, 10 times our own population.  Consequently, their shipping needs are 

tenfold, requiring significantly more freight and cargo capacity, as well as the ability to transport 

many more passengers to their Pa Enua.  This explains why we see larger ships, such as the Lady 

Naomi and others, navigating our waters. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, we simply cannot sustain vessels of that size, which is why we must explore smaller 

vessels that can effectively accommodate our cargo volumes and the number of passengers we 

need to transport. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  the  people  in  the  Pa  Enua,  along  with  the  Members  of  Parliament 

representing them, are eagerly looking forward to a high-quality shipping service that adequately 

meets their needs. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, this is one of the key requirements for us to try and grow our economy by ensuring 

that each of our islands can contribute to the Cook Islands economy.  It is not just about shipping, 

Mr  Speaker;  we  also  need  to  focus  on  our  airports,  specifically  the  necessity  of  sealing  our 

runways. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Member from Akaoa raised a crucial point regarding Aitutaki, which now handles up to 30 

flights a week.  This success is a result of the infrastructure we have put in place to facilitate such 

growth.  Without the runway sealing we completed 20 years ago, we would still be relying on 

Bandit aircraft to reach Aitutaki.  Mr Speaker, the vision of this government is clear, by investing 

in infrastructure, when we do this infrastructure work, because we have seen it happen – the growth 

that happened in Aitutaki we will give the opportunity now for other islands to be able to seize on 

that opportunity and grow their abilities and their opportunities. 

</span></div>
<div><span>What are we doing to encourage the outer islands to participate in our economy, Mr Speaker?  We 

are implementing the very same initiatives that the Opposition Members are critical of, such as the 

</span><span>$60,000  tax-free  threshold.    These  incentives,  Mr  Speaker,  are  designed  to  attract  motivated 

</span><span>individuals to work and produce in the outer islands, as they can retain all their income until they 

exceed  $60,000.    For  hardworking  couples,  this  means  a  combined  income  of  up  to  $120,000 

before any taxes become applicable.  Those who are driven and see the opportunity, Mr Speaker, 

will certainly take advantage of this. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Members have highlighted the potential for planting and exporting crops here in Rarotonga, noting 

that individuals can do so up to a value of $160,000 without incurring income tax, Mr Speaker.  

This government is actively seeking ways to empower people to improve their own circumstances. 

</span><span>However, we must also consider the situation in Rarotonga.  A visit to any of our Pa Enua makes 

</span><span>it clear just how challenging  life can be there.    The further you go, the  tougher it gets.   In the 

Northern Group, you do not know if you are going to get a boat in the next three, four, five months.

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Looking back 60 years, Mr Speaker, attending functions such as bereavements or weddings meant 

that if you wanted to bring food, you had to catch a homegrown chicken.  Nowadays, the price of 

chicken in Rarotonga is quite affordable, about $30 a carton.  People can easily buy one, two, or 

even 10 cartons to take along.  However, in the Outer Islands, the situation is very different.  A 

carton of chicken can cost $80, and at times, there may not even be any available because the boat 

did not deliver the goods. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, when we complain about our life here in Rarotonga, we must remember the life of our people 

in the Pa Enua. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We  have  a  good  water  system  over  here  but  maybe  not  so  good  in  Ruaau  but  in  the  Pa  Enua, 

especially in the north again, one of our islands in the south, water is a struggle.  I know that our 

Pa Enua people wish that they had a water system like our one here in Rarotonga.  So, let’s not 

forget that the policy of this government is that no one in the tribe will be left behind – no one left 

out. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Appropriation, Mr Speaker, dedicated to road improvements, is a long-awaited initiative.  I 

understand that these funds will be utilised for the back road in Nikao.  However, we also have 

outstanding projects in Titikaveka and Puaikura that need to be addressed.  This Supplementary 

Budget aims to expedite the construction of key roads, allowing us to seal all our roads as quickly 

as possible.  This will help ensure that the roads meet the high standards that our people have come 

to expect here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the comments that our budget is unusual, Mr Speaker, as I mentioned in my Budget 

Speech, the additional $68 million may initially appear to be a significant and excessive amount.  

Let me again put that into perspective, Mr Speaker.  Of the $68 million, $19 million is being carried 

forward  from  the  previous  year’s  appropriation.  A  substantial  portion  of  this  amount  is  due  to 

timing of infrastructure projects.  This is not new money, as you would say; rather, it is unspent 

money that needs to be carried forward to this year and utilised this year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Another significant amount, Mr Speaker, is the $40 million allocated for debt servicing.  During 

the COVID years, particularly in 2020, the government tapped into its entire economic stabilisation 

fund of $78 million and also accessed over $150 million in New Zealand grant funding.  However, 

</span><span>we  still  needed  to  incur  debt,  Mr  Speaker,  through  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  which  was 

</span><span>essential for keeping our businesses afloat.  Furthermore, since we graduated to high-income status 

in 2020, the debt we acquired from the ADB was at commercial rates, which means we are no 

longer eligible for concessional financing typically available to a country like us. 

</span></div>
<div><span>What we have done, Mr Speaker, is that as these debts have now become due, four years after their 

inception, we have successfully repaid a considerable amount, totaling approximately $40 million.  

This achievement has allowed us to reduce the anticipated debt servicing costs for the next four to 

five years to a more manageable level.  Consequently, we can now allocate funds to critical areas 

</span><span>such as welfare and addressing cost of living increases.  This exemplifies good, sound financial 

</span><span>management.  By adhering to the principles of effective financial management and the medium-

term budgeting outlined in our Supplementary Budget, we anticipate that our country will return

<div><span>to  significant  surpluses in  the coming years while also bringing down our debt  to  very modest 

levels. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We have come through 2022 when we opened our borders to 2024 the recovering of our economy 

is complete.  We now look to the growth, Mr Speaker, and new opportunities that our country will 

be able to provide for our people because of the sound financial footings that we stand on. 

</span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr Speaker, I commend this Supplementary Budget to the House and thank the 

Members for their support.  Thank you.
