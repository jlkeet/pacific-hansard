<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker, to the 

Clerk of this House, to all you staff and to everyone in this House this afternoon. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Speaker,  I  request  that  this  House  allow  me  some  time  to  investigate  this  matter 

further.  I will be reaching out to Mangaia to seek clarification on the situation.  Specifically, I will 

contact the new EO, Mia Teaurima, to inquire about the condition of the airport in Mangaia, as its 

management falls under the administration of the island government. 

</span></div>
<div><span>ICI only becomes involved when there is a request for assistance from Rarotonga.  I believe the 

airport in Mangaia is in need of a roller to stabilise the runway.  I have heard that the roller machine 

on the island was set on fire by locals.  However, Mia Teaurima confirmed to me a couple of weeks 

ago that he has reached out to a contractor here in Rarotonga to request a roller to help complete 

the necessary work on the airstrip in Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In relation to the question about the airport, please bear with me, I will contact Mia in Mangaia 

and will consult with the ICI office here in Rarotonga to determine what support we can provide 

for the airport in Mangaia.  Thank you, Honourable Speaker. 

</span></div>
