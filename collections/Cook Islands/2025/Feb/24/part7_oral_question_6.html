<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>MR T. VARU:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker and all Members in this House.  The two members of our 

United Party, my colleagues from Puaikura, have already shared their perspectives on the budget.  

However,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  express  my  own  thoughts  regarding  my 

constituency of Ruaau. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In our area of Ruaau, one of the essential needs for our electorate is water.  I recall that last year, 

there  was  a  public  consultation  focused  on  water  for  the  island  of  Rarotonga.    I  attended  the 

meeting held in Puaikura, where the Deputy Prime Minister explained the government's objectives 

for  our  water  system.    However,  before  he  could  share  the  government's  explanation,  several 

individuals had already voiced their opinions and thoughts.  When it was the Minister's turn to 

speak,  he  provided  some  insights.    I  understand  that  public  consultations  were  also  held  in 

Titikaveka and Te-Au-O-Tonga.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, regarding our village of Arorangi and my constituency of Ruaau, we are significantly 

</span><span>affected when water levels are low.  I deeply sympathise with my constituents, especially since 

this problem often arises on Sundays.  Unfortunately, that is often the day when they choose to 

contact me, and it coincides with the closure of the To Tatou Vai office. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We understand that when people lack access to water, they will seek alternative solutions.  I have 

been cautioned that once water is being transported on a Sunday, people will start approaching you 

for assistance.  Most of the time, when individuals come asking for help, you can't help but feel 

sorry for them.  I want to reference the statement from this Supplementary Budget, which mentions 

</span><span>a provision of $500,000 for "water allowances to support household water allocation." 

</span></div>
<div><span>A few weeks ago, I saw some employees from To Tatou Vai repairing the pipeline along our main 

road.  I inquired about the primary water issues affecting our area of Ruaau, and they informed me

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>that the old water pipes are still in use in Ruaau.  With the allocation of $500,000, I believe this 

funding will be directed toward repairing and improving the water supply for Ruaau.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to ask the Members from Titikaveka and Ngatangiia not to cut the water supply 

to the rest of the island, as this may be contributing to the low water availability in my area. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, I give my support to this Appropriation Budget. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, your parliamentary staff, and all the Honourable 

Members of this House.  I appreciate the valuable insights shared by the speakers who have come 

before me.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to express some of my own concerns 

that I believe are important to address in this House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It may seem small, but I want to emphasise that it is both critical and important.  First and foremost, 

I would like to convey my thoughts regarding the appropriation for Education.  While I stand in 

support  of  this  funding,  I  feel  it  is  insufficient;  nonetheless,  I  will  continue  to  support  it.  

Additionally, I want to highlight the allocation for Internal Affairs, particularly concerning our 

scholarship students from the Outer Islands who are studying here in Rarotonga.  This is especially 

pertinent for our children who have reached the age of 16 but are still attending school. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Let us consider the situation regarding education in Mangaia.  I want to involve the Ministry of 

Internal Affairs and Education in this discussion, as it pertains to them.  Currently, when a child 

turns 16 years old, they no longer receive the Child Welfare pension.  However, in Mangaia, many 

students continue their education beyond this age, attending Year 12 and Year 13.  There may be 

similar scenarios in other locations, such as Aitutaki and Atiu. The essence of my point is that the 

government should extend financial support to these students who are still in school, to help them 

further their education and expand their knowledge. 

</span></div>
<div><span>For  those  who  travel  to  Rarotonga  on  scholarships,  they  receive  financial  support  from  the 

government.  However, there are many children who remain on the island because their parents 

</span><span>prefer them to stay, often due to housing issues in Rarotonga.  These are my thoughts, Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>regarding the need for ongoing support for our children in Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to acknowledge the allocation made to Infrastructure Cook Islands, as we have been 

asked to support this appropriation. Therefore, I stand in support of it. However, I must address a 

concern  that  was  raised  earlier  in  this  Sitting  regarding  where  most  of  the  spending  for  road 

improvements is taking place, which is primarily in Rarotonga. For Mangaia, the island closest to 

Rarotonga, this situation is not feasible.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Last year, there was supposed to be an improvement on a particular road; we supplied the metal 

</span><span>and tar, yet I am unsure what happened to that appropriation, especially since the 200th anniversary 

celebrations have already passed.  I have not seen any allocation designated for the enhancement 

of our roads, apart from a small area in Oneroa.  Furthermore, there has been a request made to the
