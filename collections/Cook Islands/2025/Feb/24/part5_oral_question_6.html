<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Kia Orana Honourable Speaker and Kia Orana to us all.  I would like to ask 

a question to the Minister of Infrastructure Cook Islands (ICI).  As we are all aware, the condition 

of the airport on the island of Mangaia has been a concern.  Last Friday the flight to Mangaia was 

cancelled and people both in Mangaia and Rarotonga was waiting for the flight to Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The situation concerning our airport in Mangaia is quite concerning.  When heavy rain falls on the 

</span><span>island, the airport conditions deteriorate, leading to water pooling on the airstrip, which prevents 

planes from landing.  Therefore, I would like to ask the Honourable Minister of ICI what plans are 

in place to address the issues at the Mangaia airport?
