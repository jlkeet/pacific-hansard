<div><span>CROWN LAW OFFICE</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,838,628 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  We all know that part of the reasons 

why we have only 12 days of the year Sitting in Parliament because there is no business.  The 

Business Committee decides on a yearly calendar and so far, the average has been about 42 to 45 

days of the year.  And at the last day of the last Sitting of each year, that calendar is brought to 

Parliament to be confirmed for the following year.  We also all know that even sometimes when 

the calendar says we will Sit for 10 days, by the end of the second day or sometimes the first day, 

we do not have any business in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>The  explanation  given  and  I  think  we  all  know  and  aware  is  that  our  Crown  Law  is  so  under 

resourced.  When the Solicitor General was asked as to how much money would he think himself 

should have to better resource his office. He gave a figure of $1.5 million, he said that he needed 

to employ six more lawyers and we can understand that.  And I am not criticising Crown Law 

Office because Crown Law Office has  multi roles.   And one of those roles include drafting of 

legislation for Parliament and that is part of their role they are unable to perform which then affects 

us.  So, when we come to our Parliamentary Sittings if we have no business, we have no choice 

but to have Parliament adjourned.  

</span></div><div><span>So, the amount of increase of $587,837, is that going to address part of the problem that we have 

with Crown Law?  Because unless we address the problem of Crown Law being under resourced, 

we are not going to be able to create business for this Parliament.  Many of us are also on Select 

Committees and we rely on Crown Law Office to be the legal advisor and because they are so 

</span><span>under resourced it delays our reporting to Parliament.  So, this is one office that I think that we 

</span><span>really should look at very carefully if we are going to address the problems that we have had in 

the past about no business for Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>  Mr  Speaker,  I  reserve  my  comments  for  when  we  resume  Parliament 

tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,838,628 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule
