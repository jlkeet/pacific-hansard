<h3>Oral Question 22</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span> With respect,  Prime Minister, no, you have not  answered the 

question.  The term “nationalise” was used in the article of your interview last Friday, which raised 

immediately red flag</span><span>because my  understanding  of “nationalising” is  that you not  only  run the 

business  of  shipping  but  you  also  acquire  the  Private  Sector.    If  that  is  what  you  said  in  the 

newspaper is that what you are planning to do?
