<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, to the Member from Rangiatea for this question on the Sovereign 

Wealth Fund.  I can report, Honourable Member, that this week, two of our microeconomists from 

the Ministry of Finance  are in  New Zealand engaging with the Reserve  Bank of New Zealand 

regarding the establishment of our Sovereign Wealth Fund. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Sovereign Wealth Fund is something we have been discussing for over 10 years, Mr Speaker.  

</span><span>As part of our journey with Seabed Minerals, we need to consider how we would safeguard any 

</span><span>income  generated  from  these  resources,  especially  after  all  our  exploration,  studies,  and 

environmental  assessments  have  indicated  commercial  viability.    How  do  we  ensure  that  the 

revenue we earn from Seabed Minerals is protected?

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>We examined how other countries manage their mineral wealth, including oil and gas resources, 

Mr Speaker.  Countries like Australia, Nauru, and Norway served as key examples in this regard.  

It is clear, Mr Speaker, that in terms of long-term investment and safeguarding national income 

derived from mineral resources, the model provided by Norway stands out as one of the best in the 

world. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, after a series of public consultations with no doubt, that the Member has been a part of, the 

team has now progressed their consultations and discussions now into looking at, how others in 

particular the expertise of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand would be able to assist us.  In fact, it 

was just last year, Honourable Member that I met with the governor of the Reserve Bank when he 

was here in Rarotonga, that is the governor, Edwin Oar.  And he expressed his willingness to help 

the Cook Islands in the establishment of our Sovereign Wealth Fund. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I look forward, Mr Speaker, to the updates from our team regarding the progress being made on 

the establishment of our Sovereign Wealth Fund and potential collaboration with New Zealand.  

Contrary to reports in the media suggesting a breakdown in our relationship with New Zealand, 

Mr Speaker, the reality is that it is business as usual.  This extends beyond finance, Mr Speaker, 

encompassing other areas under the Office of the Prime Minister, including national security and 

specifically Cyber Security.  My team at the Office of the Prime Minister is in ongoing discussions 

with the New Zealand government on this important matter.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.
