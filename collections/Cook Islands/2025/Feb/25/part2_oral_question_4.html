<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  In-accurate statement!  The basis of the opinion was to consider 

whether  proxy  votes  were  going  to  be  allowed  and  the  discussion  went  on  to  proxy  votes  and 

virtual participation.  And it was because of that opinion that resulted in the current Constitutional 

Amendment to allow proxy votes.
