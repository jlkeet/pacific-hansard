<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  I would like to request that the Deputy 

Prime Minister refrain from lecturing us, as we are well aware of our laws and responsibilities as 

</span><span>Members of Parliament. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  have  a  question  for  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  regarding  shipping,  which  combines  two 

inquiries.  First, it has been confirmed that we are to contribute $3 million, matched by $3 million 

</span><span>from China.  How long can we expect to wait before receiving this ship?  Secondly, regarding the 

</span><span>ship from Japan, can you clarify whether this is a gift or another arrangement?  Can you provide 

an explanation?
