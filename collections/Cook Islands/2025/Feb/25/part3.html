<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>I  now  open  the  Floor  to  Honourable  Members.    I  acknowledge  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition;  however,  I  would  like  to  offer  the  Floor  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  as  the 

Honourable Minister needs to respond to Honourable Tetangi Matapo.  Thank you, Honourable 

Member, and I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  First and foremost, Kia Orana to you, 

the Clerk, the Deputy Clerk, and all the staff of this House, including every Member of this House 

and our people listening to our parliamentary proceedings. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Speaker, yesterday the Member for Tamarua posed a question to me, and I am not 

quite sure why she directed it my way when she is already aware of the answer.  I believe the new 

Executive Officer of Mangaia, Mr Mia Teaurima, has already provided the necessary information, 

outlining the situation regarding the plans for the airport in Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps Parliament is indeed the best place for asking questions so that everyone is informed about 

the situation.   However, Mr Speaker, it is  not about  being  heard; it is about  being  proactive in 

addressing the issues within our respective constituencies.  Sometimes, Mr Speaker, you would 

</span><span>say “no”, by actually saying noth</span><span>ing.  In this instance, I had a discussion with Mia this morning, 

and he informed me that he is collaborating with Lash, the mechanic working for the Pa Enua.  

Currently, Lash is in the process of sourcing a roller machine for the island of Mangaia to replace 

the one that was unfortunately burnt by the people of Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  I want to correct the Deputy Prime Minister for saying that the people of 

Mangaia burnt this roller machine down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, can you refrain your speech earlier. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Yes, my statement can be corrected, but that is the information I received.  

In any case, Mr Speaker, Lash has been contracted by the island government of Mangaia to find a 

replacement roller machine to support their airport runway maintenance program.  The Executive 

Officer of Mangaia has confirmed to me that they made every effort to repair the old machine that 

was burnt.  He also mentioned that the cost of repairing the old roller machine would be nearly 

</span><span>equivalent to purchasing a new one. 

</span></div><div><span>The EO is collaborating closely with the MPPS, MFEM, and ICI to secure funding for the work 

needed  in  Mangaia.    He  also  confirmed  that  the  issues  with  the  airport  runway  typically  arise 

</span><span>during heavy rain, but when the weather is clear, there are no problems with the runway.  The EO, 

</span><span>in partnership with ICI, is dedicated to fully addressing the concerns regarding the Mangaia airport 

runway.  The aim is to ensure that the airstrip can effectively handle rain during adverse weather 

conditions.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I want to bring a point to this House today to encourage all Members of Parliament.  Each of you 

holds  responsibilities  for  your  respective  islands  and  must  address  the  issues  within  your 

communities.  It is crucial that you actively engage with your island's development.  My concern 

here, Mr Speaker, is that this important information is readily available through the EO. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:  </span><span>Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  A.  ARMSTRONG:    </span><span>Just  ask  the  question  thank  you.    We  are  aware  of  what  our 

responsibilities are. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Under the Standing Orders, Mr Speaker, every Member of Parliament in 

the Cook Islands is entitled to inquire and request information that is readily available at Ministries 

and Agencies.  I assure you, Mr Speaker, that if the Honourable Member had reached out to ICI 

last  week  or  spoken  with  Mia,  Mia  would  have  provided  her  with  the  same  information  I  am 

sharing today.  Therefore, I want to encourage all Members of Parliament, it is not necessary to 

come to Parliament to ask these questions, because if we had not sat today, you would not have 

received an answer. 

</span></div><div><span>In closing, Mr Speaker, we have agencies dedicated to serving the welfare of our people and our 

country.  As elected Members of Parliament, you have the right to request any relevant information 

pertaining to your inquiries. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  A brief note from the Speaker on this matter, for airport construction 

and maintenance, there are three primary considerations, first is drainage, second is drainage, and 

third is drainage.  You may proceed, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question, but first, I would 

like  to  thank  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  addressing  the  question  I  raised  yesterday  and  to 

remind us of our responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>The reason for this question is that it has been brought to my attention by our Island Council. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Are you asking a question or attempting to provide an explanation? 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>I am going to ask a question, specifically regarding an issue that frequently 

occurs  during  heavy  rain.    My  question  to  the  Minister  is,  when  do  they  plan  to  address  this 

</span><span>problem? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>That’s a very good question.  Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; you have the 

</span><span>Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  shared  that  information  just  briefly  earlier.    Mia  has 

confirmed that currently he has made a submission with the assistance of ICI to MPPS at MFEM 

</span></div><div><span>855

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>for funding to fix this problem.  Until that fund is available, then we can all have an answer to that 

question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>My question is to the Minister of Transport.  We are aware that 

18 of the Cook Islands flagged ships have been arrested overseas.  The allegation is that they are 

participating in the transporting of arms to Russia.  It is also claimed that these boats are uninsured 

and  the  risk  there  is  the  release  of  crude  oil  from  those  boats  if  some  disaster  occurred.    The 

</span><span>question is, how are you addressing the problem of these boats that’s</span><span> carrying Cook Islands flags 

and giving us a very bad name out there? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Deputy Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, those are serious allegations being raised from across the 

Floor.  If these allegations are found to be true, then it is essential that a thorough investigation is 

conducted regarding these issues.  I want to be cautious in making any further comments beyond 

what I have already stated.  However, I kindly request the Honourable Member to allow me some 

time  to  conduct  my  own  investigation  with  our  team  at  the  Ministry  of  Transport  to  gather 

information to verify what the Honourable Member has suggested.  I assure you that if there is any 

indication of corruption related to the claims shared by the Honourable Member, whether in this 

House or with the public at large, it constitutes a significant breach of the conditions for being 

classified as a Cook Islands registered vessel, in my view, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>If  the  Honourable  Member  just  give  me  a  day  or  so,  then  I  will  return  with  some  accurate 

information.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister of Education.  A 

news  article  published  in  the  Cook  Islands  News  on  14  January  2025,  stated,  </span><span>“Cook  Islands 

grabbles with the declining education value.”  </span><span>This was a statement made by the Secretary of the 

Ministry of Education.  In this article, the Secretary of Education also stated that the condition of 

</span><span>our schools is  deteriorating and noted a decline in the passing rates of students  taking external 

examinations. 

</span></div><div><span>The article also mentioned that there are currently fewer teachers in our schools.  The Secretary of 

the  Ministry  of  Education  indicated  that  one  of  the  reasons  for  this  decline  in  the  number  of 

</span><span>teachers is that some have travelled to New Zealand for further studies. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:   </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and  Kia Orana to  you and your staff in  the 

House of Parliament.    In response to  the question posed by the Member  from  Matavera,  I can 

</span></div><div><span>856 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>confirm that we have received the examination results.  For Level 1, only 46 percent achieved a 

passing grade, while Levels 2 and 3 saw passing rates of 76 percent and 78 percent, respectively. 

</span></div><div><span>The explanation provided to me was that we are currently using the New Zealand syllabus, which 

has undergone changes for Level 1 over the past two years.  Additionally, the syllabus for Levels 

2 and 3 is set to be changed in 2027.  In my opinion, I believe that the reason for these changes is 

related to the modifications made at Level 1.  I believe that in the near future we will see the effect 

of this to Level 2 and also Level 3. This is one of the aims Education is striving for and that is to 

integrate our teachers or staff from the Education into the New Zealand Education system to teach 

them and learn on the changes that are being introduced. And it is believed that by sending them 

to  learn  all  the  changes  that  is  taking  place  for  them  adopt  here  and  maybe  through  that  will 

improve our standard here in the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Touching on the reason of decrease of our teachers here.  I would like to thank the Prime Minister 

</span><span>for  his  support  to  reopen  the  Teacher’s  Training  College.  In  fact,  Cabinet  and  government 

</span><span>Members  supported  this  because  these  Members  are  seeing  the  downside  on  their  individual 

islands.  A few weeks ago, there was an introduction for our young people who are pursuing a 

career in teaching.  I am happy because these are 12 of our own youths and some of them has just 

completed Form 7/Year 13 and they wanted to be trained as teachers and to teach in our country.  

I would also like to thank the University of Waikato for the support and assistance they have given 

to improve our teachers.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we do not have enough teachers because last year, we had 29 teachers left, retired or 

relocated somewhere else.  Despite the declining number of teachers, this government is striving 

to  look  for  avenues  to  improve  the  standard  of  our  children,  our  teachers  and  also  to  train  our 

teachers to teach our children.  

</span></div><div><span>Our children had made many requests to us. Last night one of the trainee teachers came to me and 

ask me if I can sponsor a uniform for them before they start their training next week.  I worked out 

that there are 12 of them.  In hearing the question asked by the Member from Matavera I then 

believe that he will sponsor one set  of uniform  and I will sponsor one set  to  coincide with  his 

question.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  United  Party,  the 

Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  I would like to request that the Deputy 

Prime Minister refrain from lecturing us, as we are well aware of our laws and responsibilities as 

</span><span>Members of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  a  question  for  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  regarding  shipping,  which  combines  two 

inquiries.  First, it has been confirmed that we are to contribute $3 million, matched by $3 million 

</span><span>from China.  How long can we expect to wait before receiving this ship?  Secondly, regarding the 

</span><span>ship from Japan, can you clarify whether this is a gift or another arrangement?  Can you provide 

an explanation?

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  to  the  Member  for  the  questions.  

Firstly, on the ship from China, I am not sure when this vessel will arrive.  I will however ask the 

Ministry of Finance and Economic Management on the arrangements.  Secondly, on the ship from 

Japan, what I know about this boat is that it is less than 10 years old, it is double propelled and it 

is ideal to service the needs of the Pa Enua.  Right now, the boat is undergoing modifications to 

expand  the  cargo  holds.    The  cost  of  these  modifications  has  been  generously  covered  by  the 

Government of Japan.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  We have come to the end of our Oral Question Time.  Thank you, Honourable 

Members.
