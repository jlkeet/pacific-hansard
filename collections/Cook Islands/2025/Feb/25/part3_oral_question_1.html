<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  First and foremost, Kia Orana to you, 

the Clerk, the Deputy Clerk, and all the staff of this House, including every Member of this House 

and our people listening to our parliamentary proceedings. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Speaker, yesterday the Member for Tamarua posed a question to me, and I am not 

quite sure why she directed it my way when she is already aware of the answer.  I believe the new 

Executive Officer of Mangaia, Mr Mia Teaurima, has already provided the necessary information, 

outlining the situation regarding the plans for the airport in Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps Parliament is indeed the best place for asking questions so that everyone is informed about 

the situation.   However, Mr Speaker, it is  not about  being  heard; it is about  being  proactive in 

addressing the issues within our respective constituencies.  Sometimes, Mr Speaker, you would 

</span><span>say “no”, by actually saying noth</span><span>ing.  In this instance, I had a discussion with Mia this morning, 

and he informed me that he is collaborating with Lash, the mechanic working for the Pa Enua.  

Currently, Lash is in the process of sourcing a roller machine for the island of Mangaia to replace 

the one that was unfortunately burnt by the people of Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Point of Order! 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  I want to correct the Deputy Prime Minister for saying that the people of 

Mangaia burnt this roller machine down. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, can you refrain your speech earlier. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Yes, my statement can be corrected, but that is the information I received.  

In any case, Mr Speaker, Lash has been contracted by the island government of Mangaia to find a 

replacement roller machine to support their airport runway maintenance program.  The Executive 

Officer of Mangaia has confirmed to me that they made every effort to repair the old machine that 

was burnt.  He also mentioned that the cost of repairing the old roller machine would be nearly 

</span><span>equivalent to purchasing a new one. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The EO is collaborating closely with the MPPS, MFEM, and ICI to secure funding for the work 

needed  in  Mangaia.    He  also  confirmed  that  the  issues  with  the  airport  runway  typically  arise 

</span><span>during heavy rain, but when the weather is clear, there are no problems with the runway.  The EO, 

</span><span>in partnership with ICI, is dedicated to fully addressing the concerns regarding the Mangaia airport 

runway.  The aim is to ensure that the airstrip can effectively handle rain during adverse weather 

conditions.

<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I want to bring a point to this House today to encourage all Members of Parliament.  Each of you 

holds  responsibilities  for  your  respective  islands  and  must  address  the  issues  within  your 

communities.  It is crucial that you actively engage with your island's development.  My concern 

here, Mr Speaker, is that this important information is readily available through the EO.
