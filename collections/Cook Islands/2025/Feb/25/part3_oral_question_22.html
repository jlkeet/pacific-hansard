<h3>Oral Question 22</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  to  the  Member  for  the  questions.  

Firstly, on the ship from China, I am not sure when this vessel will arrive.  I will however ask the 

Ministry of Finance and Economic Management on the arrangements.  Secondly, on the ship from 

Japan, what I know about this boat is that it is less than 10 years old, it is double propelled and it 

is ideal to service the needs of the Pa Enua.  Right now, the boat is undergoing modifications to 

expand  the  cargo  holds.    The  cost  of  these  modifications  has  been  generously  covered  by  the 

Government of Japan.
