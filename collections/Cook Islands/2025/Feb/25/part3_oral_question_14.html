<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, those are serious allegations being raised from across the 

Floor.  If these allegations are found to be true, then it is essential that a thorough investigation is 

conducted regarding these issues.  I want to be cautious in making any further comments beyond 

what I have already stated.  However, I kindly request the Honourable Member to allow me some 

time  to  conduct  my  own  investigation  with  our  team  at  the  Ministry  of  Transport  to  gather 

information to verify what the Honourable Member has suggested.  I assure you that if there is any 

indication of corruption related to the claims shared by the Honourable Member, whether in this 

House or with the public at large, it constitutes a significant breach of the conditions for being 

classified as a Cook Islands registered vessel, in my view, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>If  the  Honourable  Member  just  give  me  a  day  or  so,  then  I  will  return  with  some  accurate 

information.   

</span></div>
