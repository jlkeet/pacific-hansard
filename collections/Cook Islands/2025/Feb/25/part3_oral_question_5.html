<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Under the Standing Orders, Mr Speaker, every Member of Parliament in 

the Cook Islands is entitled to inquire and request information that is readily available at Ministries 

and Agencies.  I assure you, Mr Speaker, that if the Honourable Member had reached out to ICI 

last  week  or  spoken  with  Mia,  Mia  would  have  provided  her  with  the  same  information  I  am 

sharing today.  Therefore, I want to encourage all Members of Parliament, it is not necessary to 

come to Parliament to ask these questions, because if we had not sat today, you would not have 

received an answer. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr Speaker, we have agencies dedicated to serving the welfare of our people and our 

country.  As elected Members of Parliament, you have the right to request any relevant information 

pertaining to your inquiries. 

</span></div>
