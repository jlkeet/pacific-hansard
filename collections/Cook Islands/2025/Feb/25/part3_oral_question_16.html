<h3>Oral Question 16</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister of Education.  A 

news  article  published  in  the  Cook  Islands  News  on  14  January  2025,  stated,  </span><span>“Cook  Islands 

grabbles with the declining education value.”  </span><span>This was a statement made by the Secretary of the 

Ministry of Education.  In this article, the Secretary of Education also stated that the condition of 

</span><span>our schools is  deteriorating and noted a decline in the passing rates of students  taking external 

examinations. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The article also mentioned that there are currently fewer teachers in our schools.  The Secretary of 

the  Ministry  of  Education  indicated  that  one  of  the  reasons  for  this  decline  in  the  number  of 

</span><span>teachers is that some have travelled to New Zealand for further studies.
