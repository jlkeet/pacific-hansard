<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Prime Minister, Honourable Mark Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, pursuant to Standing Orders 49 (1) 

and  50  (1),  I  seek  leave  of  the  House  to  postpone  the  interrupted  debate  on  the  Appropriation 

</span><span>Amendment Bill 2024/25, to allow for the ‘No Confidence Motion’ to be dealt with.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, if we look at Standing Order 50 (1), it says that 

</span><span>“the Orders of the Day are disposed in the order in which they stand in the Order Pa</span><span>per, provided 

that government decide the order in which Government Orders and Government Notices of Motion 

are  arranged  on  the  Order  Paper  subject  to  any  requirements  in  the  Standing  Orders  that  are 

particular debate be taken ahead of other Government Orde</span><span>rs of the day”. </span></div><div><span>Standing Order 219 deals  with  Appropriate Bill  takes precedence.  So, government’s ability to 

</span><span>amend  the  Order  is  subject  to  219.    And  we  have  no  reason  to  depart  from  what  the  Standing 

Orders say.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  May I ask the Clerk? 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you.  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  In response to the Leader of the Opposition, I draw 

</span><span>her attention to Standing Order 75 (3), “a motion of no confidence takes precedence over other 

business.”</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, this was the argument that Parliament had put to us 

</span><span>that Standing Order 219 took precedence over the “no confidence.”  There appears to be two parts 

</span><span>of the same Standing Order that talks about, precedence, taking precedence.  What the issue here 

is  that  an  Order  Paper  has  been  adopted  yesterday  and  the  Prime  Minister  is  suggesting  that 

</span></div><div><span>858 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Standing  Orders  will  allow  him  to  amend  that  Order  Paper  and  I  am  simply  saying  that  same 

Standing Order you are using tells you, that the Appropriation must take precedence. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Members.  The Government has the right to adjust their 

Order of the Day, and the next item will be addressed accordingly.  As we are focusing on the no-

confidence  vote  today,  I  will  not  permit  any  further  discussion  on  this matter.    I  seek  leave  to 

proceed. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, please allow me to explain our position.  I am very 

aware of Standing Order No. 2 and very aware that the ruling of the Speaker whatever it is, stands.  

But  I  will  invite  you  to  have  a  look  at  Standing  Order  No.  2,  sub-section  2,  there  are  certain 

conditions impose on you when making a decision and the conditions are, you must be guided by 

previous decisions and you must also be looking at rules and usages of welcome positions in the 

Commonwealth. 

</span></div><div><span>Ordinarily, government will have its Solicitor, the Crown Law Office and the Opposition will have 

me and Parliament should have a lawyer.  And Parliament should have a lawyer so, we can all 

interpret the Standing Orders as it is written. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you.    I  would  like  to  remind  all  Honourable  Members  that  we  are 

operating  under  the  new  Standing  Orders  established  in  2022,  and  anything  prior  to  that  is  no 

longer applicable.  I ask all Honourable Members to proceed in accordance with the proposals put 

forth by the government. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I would like to call upon the Honourable Teariki Heather to take the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members, both from 

the  government  side  and  our  side  of  the  Chamber,  including  the  Independents  and  One  Cook 

Islands.  Kia Orana to our people in the Northern Group, the Southern Group, and Tumutevarovaro, 

blessings to you in the Name of the Lord.  Kia Orana to the Clerk and all the staff of the House of 

Parliament, as well as those who are actively contributing to the welfare of our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I proceed with my speech, I would like to thank you, Mr Speaker.  Before moving the No 

</span><span>Confidence  Motion  in  Cabinet,  I  wish  to  discuss  the  principles  and  merits  of  the  Motion  in 

accordance with Standing Order 77 (2). 

</span></div><div><span>I thank God for the opportunity to stand before this House and present the merits of the Motion I 

have introduced. 

</span></div><div><span>The Word of God reminds us in Psalm 34:14 to </span><span>"depart from evil and do good; seek peace and 

pursue  it."  </span><span>  This  sentiment  resonates  with  the  words  of  Abraham  Lincoln,  who  stated, 

"Government of the people, by the people, for the people."  A 14-year-old girl named Terai Puia 

</span><span>echoed this powerful statement with her own words, "Government for the people, by the people, 

</span><span>of the people."  Similarly, President John F. Kennedy urged us not to ask what our country can do 

for us, but rather what we can do for our country.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Today, we remember Sir Albert Royle Henry, a leader of our nation, who faced a critical decision, 

to choose between total independence for the Cook Islands or a free association with New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>The question was posed to our great leader for the Cook Islands, Papa Arapati Enere, what choice 

would he make?  He opted for free association with New Zealand.  Since 1965, we have celebrated 

60  years  of  that  free  association.    In  relation  to  what  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  has 

accomplished for us, I am neither complaining nor disputing any of it, but I feel it is important to 

raise these matters before this House. 

</span></div><div><span>We have witnessed a great deal of coverage on television, in newspapers, and on the radio.  My 

focus is not solely on the actions of the Honourable Prime Minister; rather, I am concerned about 

our people living in New Zealand and the issues they are facing in their struggles with the New 

Zealand government.  We have seen our people march before this House of Parliament, not for 

any other reason but to voice their objections to what is occurring in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>In our recent devotional reflections drawn from the Book of Joshua in the Bible, we have been 

reminded to continue trusting in God.  Today, our Parliament Chaplain has shared insights from 

these  Scriptures.    The  emphasis  from  the  prophet  Joshua  is  particularly  relevant  for  us,  as  the 

instructions contained in his writings resonate deeply with the discussions we are having in today's 

meeting. 

</span></div><div><span>Today,  our  people  are  demonstrating  what  is  required  for  this  government  to  establish  the 

foundations  necessary  for  building  our  country.    While  it  is  true  that  you  have  a  majority  of 

Members present today, I urge each individual Member, elected by your constituents, to consider 

the  Motion  currently  before  this  House,  which  addresses  the  pressing  issues  facing  our  nation.  

This is a unique opportunity, our second chance, but the choice lies with you on the government 

side.  </span><span>The decisions we are making today are not for us Members; I completely agree with today’s 

</span><span>Bible reading that emphasises the importance of placing our trust in our people.  Each and every 

one of us, Members of this House and our people. 

</span></div><div><span>If we, as Members of Parliament, truly identify as Christians and commit to following the teachings 

of the Lord, then we must demonstrate it through our actions.  This is the essence of my message 

to this House, we must clearly show who we stand behind today. 

</span></div><div><span>The recent march held outside this House was not just attended by our own people; it also saw 

participation from individuals beyond our borders who have expressed their support for us. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, I would like to reference what the Prime Minister of New Zealand stated, "Our problem is 

</span><span>not with the people of the Cook Islands; it’s with the government of today." </span><span> Mr Speaker, these 

are the points I am bringing before this House.  We have the support of our people, and I challenge 

each Member to consider where you stand on this issue.  Please bear with me, Mr Speaker; this is 

not  a  minor  matter,  especially  for  those  among  our  people  who  may  not  fully  grasp  the 

</span><span>implications. 

</span></div><div><span>Yes, we aspire to stand on our own two feet and make our own decisions.  However, Mr Speaker, 

there is an important caveat to consider, those who have supported us in the past, especially during 

</span></div><div><span>860 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>this crucial time in our relationship with New Zealand. Regarding our Budget, although they are 

currently providing us with less funding, they have consistently cared for us in times of need.  I 

have concerns about the repercussions we may face here in the Cook Islands, as the Prime Minister 

has already indicated that our relationship will remain strong.  Yet, we also harbor some doubts.  

Therefore, Mr Speaker, those are my  thoughts that  I wish to  present  for discussion among  any 

Members of this House who wish to contribute. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, you have to move the Motion please. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House has no confidence in the Cabinet 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion.   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition Tina Pupuke Browne 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to voice my own statement from our side.  I believe 

other speakers will speak after me.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Yes, the Floor is open. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I stand to explain why I am not supporting the 

vote of no confidence against our Prime Minister Mark Brown.  I have looked at and have listened 

properly to what has transpired over the past couple of weeks and as our Nikao Orometua wisely 

</span><span>reminded us this morning, “he who has ears let them listen.”  Now this message resonates deeply 

</span><span>with  me, especially  in  the context of the current  situation.  This is  looking at  what  the Deputy 

</span><span>Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Winston Peters have done.  In this instance I think he did not 

take heed of this advice.  Instead of listening and engaging in an open dialogue, he chose to use 

the Official Information Act to access private communication between our Prime Minister and the 

New Zealand Prime Minister, Christopher Luxton. 

</span></div><div><span>Instead  of  ringing  and  talking  to  his  peer  colleague  with  our  own  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs, 

Honourable Tingika Elikana, he chose to go on media, Facebook and the news.  Mr Speaker, I 

think the best avenue is to pick up the phone and ring the Honourable Minister Tingika Elikana 

and raise his concerns. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, this action in my view undermines the trust and the integrity that should be the foundation 

of our leadership.

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there is also a well-</span><span>known verse in that “ask and</span><span> it shall be given, knock and it shall 

</span><span>be open and seek you shall find.”  I think this is what the Prime Minister is doing for us.  He is 

simply, one he is seeking with Prime Minister Luxton, he is knocking on Mr Luxton’s door and he 

</span><span>is asking the Prime Minister that we should keep our own New Zealand passport and considering 

that this is the 60</span><span>th</span><span> year of self-governing and in solidifying our standing in free association with 

New Zealand our determination, our endeavour to build and progress our Nation and to celebrate 

our 60</span><span>th</span><span> year of self-governing we should have our own Cook Islands passport and without getting 

a formal response from Mr Luxton, the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand chose to go on 

media and publicise his view. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Chaplain also talked about opening our hearts.  The question we should ask ourselves today, 

</span><span>is the Prime Minister’s heart for himself or for the nation of our country.  How many other country 

</span><span>nations have dual passport?  I think that is where the Prime Minister wanted us to make our way. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, I have to interrupt you.  It is now time for recess and you 

will continue when we return from our break.  I will suspend the Sitting until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.13 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  This Parliament Sitting is now resumed.  Before we took the adjournment the, 

Minister Vaine Mokoroa was talking to us.  So, I will give him the opportunity to continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Before we broke for lunch, Mr Speaker, I want 

to bring up an incident from a couple of weeks ago when Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters 

visited Kiribati.  It was reported that, due to the President of Kiribati not meeting with him, he 

threatened to withdraw the $110 million in aid that New Zealand provides to Kiribati.  This raises 

the question, is it possible that he is trying to apply similar pressure on us here in the Cook Islands 

because our Prime Minister did not meet with him?  While I may not have the answers, I want to 

emphasise that we remain open-hearted and willing to resolve any differences.  Our Prime Minister 

has indicated that we are happy to sit down, talk, and discuss these matters. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  back  in  the  early  nineties,  Mr  Winston  Peters  was  the  Minister  responsible  for 

effectively  dismantling  our  offshore  banking  industry  through  the  investigations  known  as  the 

Wine Box Inquiry.  Today, as we celebrate 60 years of self-governance, Mr Peters appears to be 

attacking  our  identity,  undermining  our  celebrations  and  compromising  our  economic 

independence.  Is this really his gift to the people of the Cook Islands for this anniversary?  

</span></div><div><span>This reminds me of a parent who refuses to let their child grow and reach their potential, instead 

they keep them on a tight leash.  Our forefathers, like Papa Arapati, recognised the importance of 

the unique relationship between New Zealand and the Cook Islands, an arrangement that other 

</span><span>regions, such as Tahiti and New Caledonia, aspire to replicate.  Why is Winston Peters choosing 

</span><span>to act this way toward us?  By sowing seeds of division and destruction, we cannot hope to reap 

the rewards of unity and progress.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  believe  that  our  Prime  Minister  has  shown  a  strong  commitment  to  transparency  and 

collaboration.  It is through these values that we can truly achieve the best outcomes for our nation.  

I  urge  my  fellow  Members  to  listen  with  open  hearts  and  minds  and  to  consider  the  wider 

implications of this vote.  Let us not be influenced by actions that aim to divide us from outside; 

instead, let us unite in support of a leadership that prioritises the well-being of our people and the 

future of our country.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, developments since December 2024 have revealed 

the extent to  which this government  has damaged our relationship  with  our closest  and trusted 

partner, New Zealand.  All of this was done behind closed doors and with no mandate from our 

people.  Governments attempt to establish a Cook Islands passport was revealed in December on 

One Network News.  That was the first that we knew that government has been negotiating with 

New Zealand for months prior to establish our own passport.  When this news broke, it was only 

then that government explained the reasons why, and that was to establish our cultural identity so 

</span><span>that we know who we are and it was also to assist with our athlete’s eli</span><span>gibility to represent the 

Cook Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>What weak excuses or justifications for what then later unfolded as a very serious issue for us.  

New Zealand did not react kindly to this and ultimatum was issued.  You choose whether you stay 

with a New Zealand passport or a Cook Islands passport?  If a Cook Islands passport, New Zealand 

said then New Zealand was open to discussion with us as to us wanting to be independent.  Our 

people were up in arms about this.  No one could believe that government would negotiate passport 

of our own without us knowing about it.  The Prime Minister reacted and stated that the passport 

issue was off the table for now.  People showed their disapproval through a peaceful march.  The 

Prime Minister then issued another statement saying the passport issue was dead.  The damage 

was done. 

</span></div><div><span>The  second  blow  for  our  people  was  again  revealed  through  the  media.    We  learnt  that  the 

government  and  its  delegation  was  travelling  to  China  to  sign  a  partnership  agreement.    New 

Zealand had asked to view the agreement that the Cook Islands was to sign with China.  And that 

</span><span>request was based on our Constitutional relationship with New Zealand.  The 2001 Declaration 

between us and New Zealand clearly require both sides to consult on foreign policies which may 

affect  security for the  countries.  This  government  declined to  allow New Zealand to  view the 

agreement.  This government also declined to show the agreement before they went to China.  The 

delegation travelled to China and the agreement was signed.  It is unclear to me exactly how many 

</span><span>agreements but so far, my understanding is one Overarching Agreement and three Memorandum 

of Understanding.   The  question many of us asked is  what  do we do with  agreements  that has 

already been signed.  The issue here is no transparency and no consultation.  

</span></div><div><span>In the last two weeks, I have seen events that I have not seen before.  There was a peaceful protest 

</span><span>march last Monday.  It was an excellent turn out and it comprised of all parties including Cook 

Islands Party members and these people joined the march to show their concerns over the last two 

months.  It is quite revealing that the government's response was to send only three Members of 

</span></div><div><span>863 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament from their side to meet with the petitioners.  Despite this, the individuals who marched 

expressed their satisfaction in voicing their disapproval of the current situation.  Moreover, this 

morning, I noticed in the Cook Islands newspaper that we had some brave and courageous women 

demonstrating outside Parliament yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>The photo on the front page of the newspaper showed these women holding signs in support of the 

No  Confidence  Motion.    I  want  to  commend  these  remarkable  women,  as  well  as  women  in 

general.  One of the incredible gifts that God bestowed upon women is the ability to be decisive 

and fearless.  I am so proud of these women.  Today, we are witnessing a test to see if those in this 

Chamber will embrace the same gift from God. 

</span></div><div><span>Today’s  Cook  Islands  newspaper  also  features  accusations  directed  at  the  New  Zealand  media 

</span><span>regarding the current situation.  The Prime Minister is quoted as saying that the media "obviously 

</span><span>don’t have an understanding of our situation here," emphasi</span><span>sing that each of our islands is owned 

by the people, not  the government.   It  is  our people who have the authority to  determine what 

happens on their islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Whoa, is that really what is happening?  No, it is not the people that is making these decisions.  

We have also heard the Minister that spoke before me, his gun is directed at Winston Peters, and 

in my mind, my understanding we are missing the point here.  We should not be pointing our gun 

at  anyone  else  but  ourselves.    Also,  in  this  morning  newspaper,  the  Prime  Minister  blame  the 

media, suggesting that they conflate the issues.  The PM suggest that the media thinks that they 

are quote, </span><span>“</span><span>too dumb to know what we are doing</span><span>.”</span><span>  W</span><span>ith respect Prime Minister, I don’t think the 

</span><span>New Zealand Prime Minister or the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the New Zealand media think 

that the people of the Cook Islands are dumb. 

</span></div><div><span>They are directing those comments to you and those that are part of the decision.  And today in 

this Chamber we will know whether that statement is correct when we vote on the motion.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  First and foremost, Kia Orana to all the Members of this 

</span><span>House today.  I want everyone here to understand that I am speaking on behalf of the people of 

Rangiatea.   Additionally, I am grateful for the Bible reference shared by our Chaplain.  It serves 

as a reminder of the saying: "Those who have ears will hear; they will listen." 

</span></div><div><span>I believe this text is relevant to all of us, and I want to emphasise that the most important aspect is 

</span><span>that our trust must be placed in God.  I have just received messages regarding the No Confidence 

vote.  However, I will refrain from commenting on matters that have already been covered by the 

House.  What I want to convey on behalf of the people of Rangiatea is their support for this No 

Confidence motion.  Nonetheless, it is important to note that some individuals are uncertain about 

</span><span>their position on this issue. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe I have the support of over 80 percent of my Constituency and the community I live in.  

That is why I stand before this House today, to affirm that the people of Rangiatea wish to express

</span></div><div><span>their  support  for  this  No  Confidence  motion.    Those  who  attended  the  meeting  praised  the 

government's  ongoing  activities.    They  indicated  that  if  the  government  continues  to  do  good 

things, they will continue to support it.  However, this is not the only concern we face; there is also 

the issue of water payment that we need to address. 

</span></div><div><span>However, I stand before this House today to voice what my Constituency has asked me to convey, 

their support for the No Confidence motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  George 

Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker, for the opportunity to share my views on 

the  matters  currently  before  the  House.    Before  I  begin,  I  would  like  to  take  a  moment  to 

acknowledge the people of the Cook Islands and my Constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to our people in the Northern Group and the Southern Group.  I understand that many 

of you may not be able to hear this, as the radio is not broadcasting, but it is an honour for me to 

greet you all.  As I begin to share my thoughts, I am reminded of the Word of God, which says, 

"Teach me to number my days that I may gain a heart of wisdom.  Your Word is a lamp to my feet 

and a light to my path." 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, during our opening prayer, the Chaplain reflected on the Word of God, and I would 

like to quote: "Faith without works is dead, but faith that works is a living faith."  I believe that 

this is the conviction of our government side, we possess a living faith.  Since the beginning of our 

Sitting, I have observed that we seem quite weary, and because of this, I would like to convey a 

message through a song. 

</span></div><div><span>[Honourable Member sang a Cook Island Maori song] 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Speaker, concerning this Motion of No Confidence, which reflects a lack of belief and 

trust in the government, I find it unconvincing, and I believe many others listening may feel the 

same.    I  want  everyone  to  listen  carefully.    As  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Tupapa  and 

Maraerenga, I am someone who openly expresses my objections when I dislike what I see or hear. 

</span></div><div><span>In the past, I have shared my thoughts in this Parliament.  I support this process, yet I must express 

my disagreement.  Today, we are facing a Motion that calls for this House to express no confidence 

in Cabinet, a vote of no confidence in the Ministers, not in the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I want the Members of the Opposition to understand that there has never been a request from you 

to the government regarding your Constituency Fund, and we have never objected to it; in fact, we 

have willingly provided it to you.  I have reviewed some of the requests you have made closely, 

and I believe that, in certain cases, they should not have been granted.  However, recognising that 

</span><span>these requests come from our people, I chose to agree to them. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as one of the longest-serving Members in this House, I am not here to boast, but rather 

to share the truth of my experiences.  Throughout my time as a Minister, I have not encountered 

</span></div><div><span>865

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>any significant difficulties from this government.  The work I am doing today reflects the support 

I receive from the government.   However, this support is not based solely on my position as a 

Minister; it comes from the resources allocated for each constituency, which I utilise effectively 

in my electorate.  I do not solely depend on government funds; I also contribute from my own 

pocket to assist my constituency. 

So, Mr Speaker and Members of this House, I want you to closely examine what this government 

has accomplished and provided for our people.  I have seen the numerous complaints expressed 

by individuals on Facebook, and it brings to mind the Words from Genesis 1:26, where God tells 

</span><span>us, “Let us make man in our image.” </span><span> Therefore, when you criticise the Prime Minister, the Deputy 

Prime Minister, or George Maggie, you are not just targeting them; you are, in effect, criticising 

God, who created us in His image. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  been  informed  by  some  individuals  that  there  are  complaints  being  made  about  me.  

However, the Word of God has strengthened my faith during this time.  So, Mr Speaker, I have 

</span><span>noticed in yesterday’s and today’s sessions that we are often quick to point fingers but slow to take 

</span><span>a moment to reflect on the positive contributions made by this government. 

</span></div><div><span>I am very pleased with the support this government has extended to our pensioners, and I have 

personally benefited from the increased assistance.  There are many blessings that I can see this 

government providing to our people.  While many individuals are aware of these blessings, they 

often choose not to discuss them. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the Motion of No Confidence in the Cabinet, I would like to express my position clearly.  

While I am not speaking solely on behalf of my constituency, as the representative for Tupapa, I 

want to convey my support for the current Cabinet, led by the Honourable Prime Minister Mark 

Brown.  That is all I wish to say in support of the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and the government 

at this time.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister and I see the Honourable Toa Isamaela; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker and staff of this House, Kia Orana to you all.  Kia 

Orana to the government side, including the Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, fellow Members 

</span><span>of Parliament, and to the Opposition as well, in the Name of our God.  Mr Speaker, I stand before 

you as the Leader of the One Cook Islands Party in this Honourable House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise today to share my thoughts on the Vote of No Confidence.  This issue began 

last year and quickly became a significant topic of discussion throughout our country, as previous 

</span><span>speakers have noted regarding the events that unfolded.   When this matter was made public, it 

became clear that some of our islands were not pleased with the situation.  I would like to speak 

specifically on behalf of my island of Araura. 

</span></div><div><span>Several individuals have approached me, many of whom are not from my constituency and are not 

</span><span>members of the One Cook Islands Party.  I have spoken with members from other parties who 

represent Araura, and they asked me about the current situation in our nation and the actions of the 

Prime Minister.  I am relaying their questions to you.  I considered suggesting that they reach out

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>to the other two Members, as they are part of the government; however, I felt I could not do that 

because I am the Member for Amuri/Ureia. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  they  expressed  their  dissatisfaction  with  what  is  happening  and  the  actions  of  the 

government.    They  conveyed  to  me  that,  as  their  representative,  they  want  me  to  bring  their 

concerns into this House.  That is why I stand before you today, to voice the sentiments of my 

people. 

</span></div><div><span>We have also seen numerous complaints from our people on social media and Facebook.   It is 

disheartening  to  witness  this,  as  it  may  not  be  the  ideal  way  for  us  to  express  our  differences.  

Nevertheless, we find ourselves in this situation, airing our complaints openly. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when a conference for Pastors is organised, perhaps our Members should consider 

attending.  I hear many quoting from the Bible.  One Minister mentioned that our meetings are 

boring, and I cannot help but wonder why that is.  I believe it may stem from a fear of voicing their 

own thoughts.  We must ask ourselves, who should we fear, man or God?  Therefore, let us hold 

our ground and stand strong, like the sturdy breadfruit tree. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I support the Vote of No Confidence. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Robert Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Greetings to all of us this afternoon. To 

the Leader of the country, the two Opposition Leaders, all Members of Parliament greetings. To 

our people listening in over the radio as well as watching live, may the blessings of God be upon 

you.  

</span></div><div><span>Seeing that most of the merits has been aired before the House I will differ from what I am going 

to say this afternoon. In the recent General Election, I was elected as a Member of Parliament for 

my  electorate  Akaoa/Vaiakura.  I  was  elected  by  the  constituents  to  bring  their  voices  into  this 

</span><span>House. I took an oath in this House, that I do what is right for my constituency. I won’t quote a 

</span><span>verse from the Bible but I will recite a traditional chant that I delivered when I was sworn into this 

</span><span>House.</span></div><div><span>(Recites traditional chant) 

</span></div><div><span>Here is the translation: Our people are moaning and complaining about what is happening in our 

</span><span>country today. 

</span></div><div><span>I apologise to the Prime Minister and to the Cabinet because we are hearing complains and gossips 

which  are  uncalled  for.    I  believe  that  if  we  have  Christian  spirits,  we  will  treat  people  like 

</span><span>ourselves, they have houses and families.  This what an elder said to me, </span><span>‘Robert, it</span><span> is people, it is 

</span><span>people, it is </span><span>people.”  </span><span>And because of that statement, it is a guiding principle for me every time I 

step into this House.  I am not standing here for myself only but for the people in my Vaka.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned about the protest march last week, we could see the different diversity of people that 

attended.  We saw our school students, our youths, the workers, the elders in our districts, and even 

the disabled.  They have run out of patience therefore took the stance to stand up in protest.  Also 

included in that march was the support of our traditional leaders. 

</span></div><div><span>Three weeks ago, we visited the households in the Akaoa district conducting a survey.  This is to 

gather  information  from  the  people  in  the  constituency.    They  have  minor  issues  and  thoughts 

however agreeing to what my plans are for Akaoa.  However, in this survey, there are three main 

topics which are the Seabed Minerals, Cook Islands passport and To Tatou Vai.  If they agree to 

it, to put an X on the YES or if they do not agree, to a NO.  In acknowledging the survey, they 

have  to  sign  their  name.    Out  of  the  120  people  surveyed,  100  percent  objected  the  Seabed 

Minerals, 100 percent objected the Cook Islands passport and 100 percent objected to paying the 

water rates. 

</span></div><div><span>These confirmed to me of the support from Akaoa because these are their thoughts.  So, therefore 

we have heard of what the Chaplain has shared before with us.  Today, I am not talking about the 

ears, the eyes and the mouth but for us to look deep into our hearts.  Listen to our people and not 

to yourselves.  

</span></div><div><span>Earlier, we had some discussions regarding our passports, particularly in connection with sports, 

as one of the athletes in question is my son.  After their rugby contract in Spain concluded, they 

were  invited  to  play  in  France.    However,  they  encountered  issues  concerning  their  passports.  

Upon  their  return,  my  son  asked  for  my  thoughts  on  New  Zealand  passports.    It  was  a 

straightforward question, and he already anticipated my response.  I told him it ultimately comes 

down  to  whether  that  sport  is  more  important  than  our  people.    He  accepted  that  perspective 

without further argument. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, we find ourselves expressing mixed feelings, and it is clear that there is a lack of unity 

within  the  House.    While  I  cannot  claim  that  this  division  is  absolute,  I  recognise  that  we  are 

exercising our democratic rights.  These are my thoughts in support of the motion of no confidence.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I call the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members and to our 

people.  Since others have quoted texts today, I would like to do the same.  Mr Speaker, you are 

familiar with the verse that I have referenced on several occasions, "God did not give us a spirit of 

fear, but of power, of love, and of sound mind."  These are the three qualities I believe have been 

</span><span>swirling  in  our  nation  over  the  past  few  weeks.    We  have  witnessed  a  spirit  of  fear,  a  distinct 

absence of love, and unfortunately, not much of sound mind. 

</span></div><div><span>Since 1965 Mr Speaker, we have been told as a nation that we need to build ourselves up.  We 

</span><span>must be more resourceful, more productive, make a stand on our own two feet.  Even Papa Arapati 

</span><span>said in 1965 on his way to the United Nations when he stopped over in Samoa and was interviewed.  

</span><span>He  said  that  “at  the  moment  we  depend  too  much  on  New  Zealand  and  economically  and 

financially, we are still dependent.”</span></div><div><span>868 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Well, we did build ourselves up Mr Speaker, especially over the last 15 years.  We built ourselves 

up so much that we graduated to a high-income status under the OECD in 2020.  We no longer 

eligible for a concessional financing or grant funding.  We need to stand on our own two feet and 

we need to engage with our partners on equal footing.  And we have done this Mr Speaker, we 

have  numerous  agreements  with  New  Zealand,  with  Australia  and  also  as  part  of  our  regional 

agreements we have signed with Japan, India and Korea. 

</span></div><div><span>Most  recently,  Mr  Speaker,  our  formal  diplomatic  relations  with  the  USA  have  been  a  huge 

recognition  of  our  sovereignty.    When  the  largest  superpower  in  the  world  recognises  us  as  a 

sovereign state so that we can engage directly with them this is a huge statement of our identity or 

as our </span><span>Tangata Whenua</span><span> call it our </span><span>Mana Motu Hake</span><span> or our </span><span>Tino Rangatira Tanga</span><span> or as we call it, 

</span><span>To Tatou T</span><span>ū</span><span>ranga Maori</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>Fifty nine years ago, Mr Speaker, our nation was standing at the crossroad and Papa Arapati as 

mentioned earlier made a bold declaration that set the course for our future.  In that interview, I 

mentioned,  Mr  Speaker,  Papa  Arapati  made  it  clear  that  economic  and  financial  independence 

must come first before political independence and that was what I discussed and made clear with 

both the New Zealand Prime Minister and the New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister when we met 

in Wellington in November. 

</span></div><div><span>In that meeting I discussed again the matter of a second passport.  It was always, Mr Speaker, in 

the  context  of  something  to  celebrate  our  60</span><span>th</span><span>  Anniversary  of  self-governance.    A  symbolic 

passport of identity that would not be used for travel but it would be used to identify ourselves as 

Cook Islanders.  This was an idea that I thought, Mr Speaker, at the time for our coming of age but 

always within the realm of New Zealand.  This was a matter that was in discussion with a small 

working  group  of  officials  and  it  was  also  something  that  I  floated  with  our  Ui  Ariki  and  our 

Religious Advisory Council. 

</span></div><div><span>Along with this, Mr Speaker, was another idea which was the establishment of our Cook Islands 

honours to recognise and compliment Cook Islanders for worthy achievements.  Something that 

we can do for ourselves.  However, as we saw this idea was seize upon by the New Zealand state-

owned media before we  even had a chance to  take out  to  our people and this was twisted into 

something totally different. 

</span></div><div><span>It is apparent, Mr Speaker, that these issues we face today are not just about passports for about 

China but they are about our increasing sovereignty as a country and about our self-determination 

to be recognised as Cook Islanders.  New Zealand had expressed its total opposition to the idea.  

Despite our assurances that the passport issue was off the table and a dead matter.  New Zealand 

</span><span>has continuously and assertively through its New Zealand media stated that it is not happy about 

how we are expressing our self-determination. 

</span></div><div><span>The rational mind will see and it will become very clear that this is not about consultation, this is 

</span><span>about control.  New Zealand has been very vocal in telling us that they have the power and that 

</span><span>they have the media and that they will drown us out when we try to express ourself to our various 

media  forum.    We  cannot  compete  with  New  Zealand  when  their  one-sided  messaging  is  so 

compelling that even our Opposition Members will be swayed.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 25 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We never once talked about, talked to the New Zealand government about cutting our ties with 

New Zealand.  But the message that our people received is that we are cutting our ties with New 

Zealand.  We have been discussing the comprehensive strategic partnership with New Zealand for 

months, the messaging that goes out is that we never consulted.  This constant media be rough, Mr 

Speaker, has led to destabilisation within our country.  I now hear that the Foreign Minister of New 

Zealand saying, that he wants a reset of our relationship. 

</span></div><div><span>I am concern, Mr Speaker, that he has made this announcement without talking to me or any of 

our officials at all.  We are being spoken to rather than spoken with on a matter as important and 

fundamental as our free-association relationship.  We should all be concerned because this is the 

government is looking to reset the Treaty of Waitangi.  A reset that will dilute the sovereignty of 

New Zealand Maori.  A reset that is cause upheaval in New Zealand.  So, we should all be concern 

when an announcement of a reset is made without consultation with us. 

</span></div><div><span>We are a partner in the realm of New Zealand, Mr Speaker, we are not a child.  This motion of No 

Confidence  has  been  built  on  misinformation  to  the  extent  that  the  Mover  of  the  Motion,  our 

Member of Parliament for Muri-Enua has stated publicly that he is moving this motion in support 

of  New  Zealand.    The  influence  of  New  Zealand  in  this  motion  of  no  confidence  should  be 

concerning  to  all  Cook  Islanders  who  value  their  identity,  who  value  our  commitment  to  our 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>My job is not to fly the New Zealand flag Mr Speaker, my job is to fly my own country’s flag.  I 

</span><span>know my Cook Island Maori identity.  I have sworn in this Parliament that I will do the work of 

the  Cook  Islands  Parliament.    We  have  been  building  this  country  for  years  to  increase  the 

prosperity of our people.  It is about having the financial strength to make our own decisions to 

forge our own partnerships and to invest in our own future. 

</span></div><div><span>That is why I stand before you today, Mr Speaker, not just to defend my government against a 

motion of no confidence, but to reaffirm our commitment to the same vision that guided our first 

leaders.  A Cook Islands that is strong sovereign and self-sufficient.  Four of the partnership that 

we have signed with many countries Mr Speaker is not about dependency, it is about opportunities.  

These partnerships ensure that we continue to diversify our economy and build the foundation for 

long term financial security.  Some including experts have mischaracterise our agreements as a 

</span><span>shift in our alliances.  That is not the case, Mr Speaker, as a government our responsibility is to 

seek out every opportunity that benefits our people.  Just as New Zealand and Australia and other 

nations pursue economic partnerships that serve their national interest, we too must act in our own 

national interest.  

</span></div><div><span>For a long time, Mr Speaker, we have framed our relationship with New Zealand as one of reliance 

rather than partnership.  Mr Speaker, this government does not fear accountability, we embrace it.  

I  welcome  scrutiny,  I  welcome  debate,  I  even  welcome  our  democratic  process  of  leadership 

challenge but I will not stand by while false narratives seek to destabilise our progress.  I will not 

</span><span>agree to stop the progress that we have made in our self-determination and I will continue to stand 

</span><span>by my country even as others call for us to go back under the control of New Zealand.
