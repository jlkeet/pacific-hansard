<div><span>SITTING DAY 37: TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2025 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER took the Chair at 1 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>OPENING PRAYER 

by Rev. Teava Nanai 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER (T. TURA):</span><span>  Please be seated.  I call the House in order.  Honourable Members, 

</span><span>pursuant to Standing Orders 53 and 54, I have received and approved applications for the remote 

</span><span>participation in today’s sitting of the Honourable Tingika Elikana (zooming in from the Sol</span><span>omon 

Islands) and the Honourable Vainetutai Rose Toki-Brown zooming in from Fiji. 

</span></div><div><span>Their participation is governed by Standing Orders 33 and 34. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to advise all Honourable Members that I have also received a hard copy of this. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>Mr Speaker, and all of us in  this House, Kia Orana.   I have 

difficulty  with  the  ruling  that  you  just  have  made.    The  reason  for  that  is  Article  29  of  the 

Constitution  places  t</span><span>he  obligation  on  the  King’s  Representative  to  summon  Parliament  at  such 

</span><span>places and at such time as he shall appoint.  The Summons that we have received to call this Sitting 

did not make any reference to a virtual participation.  In the opinion by the Crown Law that was 

provided to the Standing Orders Review Committee in 2021, that opinion expressed a view as to 

if a Virtual Sittings are to happen, this should be reflected in the wording of the Summons.  Of 

course, it made sense the reason for that is so that everyone, all Members of Parliament that are 

</span><span>not able to participate physically can make arrangement to participate virtually.  It was only last 

Friday when I enquired whether there was going to be any virtual arrangements or appearance by 

virtual, and I </span><span>was advised “No!”</span></div><div><span>The reason why I enquired was because I have a Member on this side of the Chamber that was 

</span><span>going to be in Hawaii for a wedding of her god-daughter.  She therefore cancelled her trip, only to 

find yesterday morning of a suggestion that we can have virtual participation. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like you Mr Speaker to have the benefit of the opinion that was provided to the Standing 

Orders Review Committee, I am sure that the Crown Law will be able to provide a copy for you 

and to pull a fast one like this is unfair on every other Member of Parliament, even if it was going 

to be allowed during this Session.

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister, Honourable Mark Brown; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, the opinion piece that the Leader of 

the Opposition refers to, provided the basis for the Standing Orders that we now operate under.  

</span><span>The Standing Orders, quite clearly, allow for the participation, the remote participation…</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  In-accurate statement!  The basis of the opinion was to consider 

whether  proxy  votes  were  going  to  be  allowed  and  the  discussion  went  on  to  proxy  votes  and 

virtual participation.  And it was because of that opinion that resulted in the current Constitutional 

Amendment to allow proxy votes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member for your Point of Order.  I will ask the Prime 

Minister to continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  As I was saying, Mr Speaker, the new Standing Orders approved by this 

House permit remote participation, subject to the approval of the Speaker.  I would like to point 

out, Mr Speaker, that the two Ministers on this side of the House were not absent due to attending 

weddings or social events; rather, they were engaged in official duties, representing our country at 

international meetings. 

</span></div><div><span>With the leave of the Speaker sought and approved, today's request is for those Members to be 

allowed  to  participate  remotely,  as  outlined  in  the  Standing  Orders.    The  two  Ministers 

acknowledge, Mr Speaker, the significance of the Motion being proposed.  Given this, every effort 

should be made to ensure that their voices and representation in this House are preserved, rather 

than excluded. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, this side of the House requests approval for the remote participation that 

has been communicated from the Chair, specifically for the Honourable Minister Tingika Elikana 

</span><span>and the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Subject to the Standing Orders we have referenced, I approve the absence of 

the two Ministers for government business and their ability to communicate virtually back to the 

Cook Islands.  I stand by this approval and will now ask the Honourable Members to continue with 

</span><span>our meeting. 

</span></div><div><span>I call upon the Honourable Teariki Heather to present the Motion.  There will be no further debate 

on  this  matter;  we  will  proceed  directly  to  a  closure.    I  have  no  other  communications  or 

</span><span>announcements to make.  We will move straight to Oral Questions for the next 30 minutes.
