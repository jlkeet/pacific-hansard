<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:   </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and  Kia Orana to  you and your staff in  the 

House of Parliament.    In response to  the question posed by the Member  from  Matavera,  I can

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>confirm that we have received the examination results.  For Level 1, only 46 percent achieved a 

passing grade, while Levels 2 and 3 saw passing rates of 76 percent and 78 percent, respectively. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The explanation provided to me was that we are currently using the New Zealand syllabus, which 

has undergone changes for Level 1 over the past two years.  Additionally, the syllabus for Levels 

2 and 3 is set to be changed in 2027.  In my opinion, I believe that the reason for these changes is 

related to the modifications made at Level 1.  I believe that in the near future we will see the effect 

of this to Level 2 and also Level 3. This is one of the aims Education is striving for and that is to 

integrate our teachers or staff from the Education into the New Zealand Education system to teach 

them and learn on the changes that are being introduced. And it is believed that by sending them 

to  learn  all  the  changes  that  is  taking  place  for  them  adopt  here  and  maybe  through  that  will 

improve our standard here in the Cook Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Touching on the reason of decrease of our teachers here.  I would like to thank the Prime Minister 

</span><span>for  his  support  to  reopen  the  Teacherâ€™s  Training  College.  In  fact,  Cabinet  and  government 

</span><span>Members  supported  this  because  these  Members  are  seeing  the  downside  on  their  individual 

islands.  A few weeks ago, there was an introduction for our young people who are pursuing a 

career in teaching.  I am happy because these are 12 of our own youths and some of them has just 

completed Form 7/Year 13 and they wanted to be trained as teachers and to teach in our country.  

I would also like to thank the University of Waikato for the support and assistance they have given 

to improve our teachers.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, we do not have enough teachers because last year, we had 29 teachers left, retired or 

relocated somewhere else.  Despite the declining number of teachers, this government is striving 

to  look  for  avenues  to  improve  the  standard  of  our  children,  our  teachers  and  also  to  train  our 

teachers to teach our children.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Our children had made many requests to us. Last night one of the trainee teachers came to me and 

ask me if I can sponsor a uniform for them before they start their training next week.  I worked out 

that there are 12 of them.  In hearing the question asked by the Member from Matavera I then 

believe that he will sponsor one set  of uniform  and I will sponsor one set  to  coincide with  his 

question.  Thank you.
