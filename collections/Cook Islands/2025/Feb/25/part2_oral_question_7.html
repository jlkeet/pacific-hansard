<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Subject to the Standing Orders we have referenced, I approve the absence of 

the two Ministers for government business and their ability to communicate virtually back to the 

Cook Islands.  I stand by this approval and will now ask the Honourable Members to continue with 

</span><span>our meeting. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I call upon the Honourable Teariki Heather to present the Motion.  There will be no further debate 

on  this  matter;  we  will  proceed  directly  to  a  closure.    I  have  no  other  communications  or 

</span><span>announcements to make.  We will move straight to Oral Questions for the next 30 minutes.
