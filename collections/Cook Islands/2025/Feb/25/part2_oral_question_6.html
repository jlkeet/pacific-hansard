<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  As I was saying, Mr Speaker, the new Standing Orders approved by this 

House permit remote participation, subject to the approval of the Speaker.  I would like to point 

out, Mr Speaker, that the two Ministers on this side of the House were not absent due to attending 

weddings or social events; rather, they were engaged in official duties, representing our country at 

international meetings. 

</span></div>
<div><span>With the leave of the Speaker sought and approved, today's request is for those Members to be 

allowed  to  participate  remotely,  as  outlined  in  the  Standing  Orders.    The  two  Ministers 

acknowledge, Mr Speaker, the significance of the Motion being proposed.  Given this, every effort 

should be made to ensure that their voices and representation in this House are preserved, rather 

than excluded. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, this side of the House requests approval for the remote participation that 

has been communicated from the Chair, specifically for the Honourable Minister Tingika Elikana 

</span><span>and the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
