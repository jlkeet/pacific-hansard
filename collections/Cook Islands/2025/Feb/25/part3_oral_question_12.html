<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>My question is to the Minister of Transport.  We are aware that 

18 of the Cook Islands flagged ships have been arrested overseas.  The allegation is that they are 

participating in the transporting of arms to Russia.  It is also claimed that these boats are uninsured 

and  the  risk  there  is  the  release  of  crude  oil  from  those  boats  if  some  disaster  occurred.    The 

</span><span>question is, how are you addressing the problem of these boats thatâ€™s</span><span> carrying Cook Islands flags 

and giving us a very bad name out there?
