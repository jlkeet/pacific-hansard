<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  probably  more  appropriate  that  I  answer  the 

Honourable Members question because it is really related to finance.  Not to disrespect the Deputy 

Prime  Minister  to  suggest  that  he  has  no  idea  of  finance.    Our  initial  estimates  for  the  cost  of 

Manihiki  airport  as  provided  to  us  by  our  consultant  firm  ACOM  and  others  in  New  Zealand 

indicated that if private company was to conduct this work, Mr Speaker, the cost will be prohibited. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  the  cost  will  be two  to  three  times more  than  if  the  government  took  on  this  job  itself 

because there is cost associated with private contractors, Mr Speaker, that are not associated with 

government contract.  What we have done, Mr Speaker, is turn back the clock to a model that suits 

small island economies like ours to be able to carry out large infrastructure cost projects.  As I 

</span><span>have said before, Mr Speaker, it doesnâ€™t matter if you are sealing an airport for a hundred people 

</span><span>or a hundred thousand people, the cost is still the same. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But that cost when you divide it over a smaller population means that we pay disproportionally 

high cost for our infrastructure projects as small island states.  And we found that if the government 

were to take on this project using what we call the public works model.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Our airport built back in the day use this public works model where we had engineers like George 

Cowan  and  others  and  the  government  public  works  carrying  out  the  work.    Our  Ministry  of 

Finance and the procurement team has found that utilising this model again, would give significant 

savings to the project. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The first point to consider is that a private company not only needs to cover the project's costs but 

also must include a margin for profit.  For a large, one-time project that involves significant capital 

investment in machinery and equipment, this profit margin can be quite substantial. Therefore, we 

have determined that by adopting a public works model, we can execute the necessary work to the 

</span><span>required  standards  while  staying  within  the  budget  allocations  we  have  available  to  us,  Mr. 

</span><span>Speaker.

</span></div>
<div><span>And I have no doubt that when this particular model of project is complete on Manihiki, it will be 

replicated on our other islands as well as to improve their infrastructure.
