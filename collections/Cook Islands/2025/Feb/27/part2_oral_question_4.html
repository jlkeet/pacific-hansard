<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to the question 

raised by the Member for Murienua.  While he has shared a narrative, I appreciate the question.  

Mr Speaker, this is perhaps one of the saddest moments I have experienced in my political career.  

It is truly sad to witness a fellow Member of Parliament imply that the government should award 

every major contract to a single contractor, rather than allowing our own people, whether they are 

young or old, the chance to participate in these opportunities. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  do  not  mean  to  diminish  Mr  Doherty’s  contributions  in  any  way,  Mr  Speaker.  </span><span>  He  and  his 

company are indeed very capable, just like the Honorable M</span><span>ember’s company, T&amp;M.</span></div>
