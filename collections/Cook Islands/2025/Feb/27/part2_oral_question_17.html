<h3>Oral Question 17</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  The areas of cooperation that we are looking at in 

inviting not just China but other countries, is in the area of scientific research.  Members will be 

aware of the decision by Pacific Island Leaders at our Forum in Rarotonga for the establishment 

of a Centre of Excellence on Deep Ocean Science to be established here in Rarotonga and we have 

been in discussions with Research Institutions in New Zealand, in America and now with China 

in Shanghai University and the First Institution of Oceanography in China. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To answer the Honourable Member’s question or query, there are no other agreements that have 

</span><span>been signed.  There have been no other exploration licenses been granted, let alone been received.  

The conduct of companies is governed under the laws of this country in terms of their shareholding 

</span><span>and  as  a  partner  in  a  major  law  firm  that  has  no  doubt  been  involved  in  many  corporation’s 

</span><span>shareholding transactions.  The Honourable Member will be well aware of the laws that govern 

companies and their transaction of shares. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As for any further applications that may come through for exploration or otherwise, Mr Speaker, 

they will need to fully comply with the laws of the Cook Islands.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Albert Nicholas; 

</span><span>you have the Floor.
