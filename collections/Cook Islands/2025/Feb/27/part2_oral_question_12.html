<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana to everyone in the House this afternoon.  Kia Orana 

Mr Speaker, the staff of Parliament, the Clerk, the Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Members, 

and fellow Members of the government.  Kia Orana to my colleagues in the Democratic Party, the 

United Party, and everyone present here today.  Kia Orana to our people listening to our Sitting on 

the radio and those watching online. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I will not talk too long, as I have studied our Standing Orders regarding the process of asking and 

answering questions during Oral Question time.  My question to the Prime Minister pertains to the 

announcement  you  made  about  the  agreement  that  was  signed  between  your  delegation  and 

representatives from China, which is expected to be made available once the delegation returns.  I 

checked  the  MFAI  webpage,  and  I  found  only  two  agreements  listed.    One  is  the  overarching 

agreement, but I am uncertain if this is the correct document because there is no signature on it. 

The other is the memorandum of understanding on the blue economy, which also appears to be 

unsigned. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question to the Honourable Prime Minister is whether you can provide this House with copies 

of all the agreements signed between us and China.  As of now, I am uncertain about the total 

number of memorandums of understanding that have been established with China, whether there 

is one, two, three, or more.  Therefore, my question is straightforward.  Can you confirm, yes or 

no, if you are able to provide us with copies of these signed agreements with China?
