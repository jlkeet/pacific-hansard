<div><span>SITTING DAY 39: THURSDAY, 27 FEBRUARY 2025 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER took the Chair at 1 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>OPENING PRAYER 

by Rev. Teava Nanai 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER (T. TURA):</span><span>   Please be seated.   This  House is  now in  session.   Kia Orana to 

</span><span>everyone in the House today.  Kia Orana to the Honourable Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime 

</span><span>Minister, Cabinet Ministers, and all government members, along with your families.  Kia Orana 

to the Leader of the Opposition and all your members, as well as to the Leader of the United Party, 

your members, and your families, Kia Orana to each and every one of you. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge and make an announcement regarding the Member of the One Cook 

Islands, who sends his apologies for not being able to attend our Sitting today.  He has returned 

home to Aitutaki to address some family matters. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to our people in the Northern Group, Southern Group, and Rarotonga who are listening 

in  to  our  Sitting  today.    Additionally,  we  welcome  those  watching  our  livestream  from  New 

Zealand, Australia, and around the world. 

</span></div><div><span>We do not have any obituaries or announcements for today.  Therefore, we will proceed directly 

to  Oral  Question  time  for  questions  and  answers.    I  would  like  to  remind  everyone  that  Oral 

Question time today is set for one hour.   I trust we will make good use of this time, and if no 

questions are raised, I will remain here and wait for any questions from you, Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Leader of the United Party, Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for extending greetings to everyone in the House 

and to those of our people listening in to our Sitting.  I have a brief question, but please allow me 

some time to provide context for it.  This question, Mr Speaker, pertains to a gentleman who has 

</span><span>been in our country since 1970 and continues to be here today.  I believe we are all familiar with 

him,  he  is  Mr  Doherty,  a  gentleman  involved  in  various  construction  projects  throughout  our 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>Since 1970, he has consistently demonstrated his expertise and commitment through his work and 

that of his company.  His contributions include the construction of our Auditorium and numerous 

other projects, as well as the cyclone centres in the Outer Islands, extending even to Pukapuka.  He 

has also been involved in the harbour project in Manihiki, and more recently, in the last couple of 

years, he has worked on the two bridges in Avatiu and the Takuvaine Empire bridge. 

</span></div><div><span>904 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>He has also made significant investments in the fishing sector, benefiting our people in that area 

as well.  Mr Speaker, he has contributed immensely to our community and our country.  Therefore, 

my question is directed to the Minister of ICI or the Prime Minister, whichever one can address 

my inquiry.  </span><span>Recently, we have heard about a ‘new kid on the block’ entering the industry. </span><span> I have 

no objections to our people returning and getting involved, especially in construction. 

I am raising this question regarding the bridge in Avatiu specifically to the Minister of ICI.  Since 

</span><span>2019, we have been aware of the government’s procedures concerning the tendering processes. </span><span>

Notably, there has not been any tendering for the sealing of our roads since that time, and I would 

like to extend my congratulations to TRIAD company for their work in that area.  It is important 

to note that this is our own funding, Mr Speaker, not aid from overseas. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, my question to the government is, why are they not able to award larger projects, such 

as bridges, to this gentleman who has been a vital part of our community?  He has the necessary 

equipment and skilled workforce to carry out the work.  Furthermore, I believe there is enough 

construction activity on the island to engage our young people who have returned.  I applaud those 

young individuals for returning home and for joining the construction industry. 

</span></div><div><span>I recognise the quality of work he has delivered in our country, particularly in constructing bridges 

and buildings, and he is more than willing to undertake the types of projects that are needed.  We 

all acknowledge the excellent contributions this individual has made.  My question is, why is he 

not granted the same opportunities as TRIAD? Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you and I see the Deputy Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to the question 

raised by the Member for Murienua.  While he has shared a narrative, I appreciate the question.  

Mr Speaker, this is perhaps one of the saddest moments I have experienced in my political career.  

It is truly sad to witness a fellow Member of Parliament imply that the government should award 

every major contract to a single contractor, rather than allowing our own people, whether they are 

young or old, the chance to participate in these opportunities. 

</span></div><div><span>I  do  not  mean  to  diminish  Mr  Doherty’s  contributions  in  any  way,  Mr  Speaker.  </span><span>  He  and  his 

company are indeed very capable, just like the Honorable M</span><span>ember’s company, T&amp;M.</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Point of Order, Mr Speaker! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>We have a Point of Order; what is your Point of Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:    </span><span>The  question  at  hand  pertains  specifically  to  the  contract  related  to  Mr 

William Doherty and the construction of bridges, and it does not involve T&amp;M. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You may continue, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>I  apologise,  Honourable  Member;  I  was  providing  a  clarification.  

Moving  forward,  I  would  like  to  emphasise  that  the  government  has  deemed  it  appropriate  to 

recognise Mr Doherty's contributions to our country.  In fact, the Office of the Prime Minister, 

</span></div><div><span>905 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>along with the Prime Minister himself, has recommended that an honorary knighthood or award 

be conferred upon this gentleman in acknowledgment of his efforts. 

</span></div><div><span>As many of us know, he received the OBE title as a recognition from the government on behalf of 

our people, signaling our gratitude for his services.  However, we must not overlook the talented 

and young Cook Islanders who have gone overseas, honed their skills in their respective fields, 

and returned with a vision to contribute to their homeland. 

</span></div><div><span>It is our responsibility, Mr Speaker, to ensure that every individual providing a service is given a 

fair opportunity to secure contracts through the government.  This young man is a Cook Islander 

who participated in the same procurement process as Landholdings and other tenderers for that 

specific contract.  Furthermore, I want to emphasise that as soon as the Head of the Ministry of 

Infrastructure Cook Islands became aware of Mr Stan Wright's tender application, she promptly 

declared her conflict of interest and completely withdrew from the process.  Following a thorough 

vetting by the team at ICI, without the involvement of the Head of Ministry, the Minister of ICI, 

or any politicians, a recommendation was then made to procurement.  It is procurement at MFEM 

that holds the responsibility for making the final decision. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the process, Mr Speaker.  It has been in place long before my involvement in politics, and 

I  believe  that  the  current  framework  was  specifically  designed  to  prevent  any  influence  or 

interference  from  Ministers.    What  concerns  me,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  the  Honourable  Member 

seems to imply, based on Mr Doherty's history, which I do not contest, that we should overlook 

this  young  Cook  Islander.    This  young  man  is  quite  astute  in  his  field,  and  he  deserves  our 

consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, in comparison to TRIAD, which the Honourable Member brought up, I need to address this 

point.  After 2019, we did go to market through the procurement process, only to find that there 

was just one tender submitted.  This is not the first time we have encountered such a situation, Mr 

Speaker.  It is understandable, however, since TRIAD is currently the sole provider of this specific 

service.  Given this context, procurement determined that it would likely be a waste of resources 

to put this company through the entire process when it was clear that no other contenders would 

be submitting tenders. 

</span></div><div><span>To  expedite  the  roading  program,  Mr  Speaker,  the  procurement  team,  along  with  Crown  Law, 

recommended that we fast track the process.  This would allow us to award the contract, subject 

to  certain  conditions  and  criteria.    Once  a  local  company  expresses  interest  in  providing  this 

particular service, the entire procurement process will be restarted and reverted to its original form. 

</span></div><div><span>In comparison, Mr Speaker, while the service provided by Landholdings is of superior quality, 

they are not the only provider of that particular service. This positions us in a situation where we 

cannot comply with the request made by the Hon. Member from Murienua. It is only when there 

is  a  sole  service  provider  that  procurement,  let  me  be  clear,  procurement,  will  implement  any 

</span><span>necessary changes, not ICI.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Member Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>906 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you very much, Honourable Minister.  Supplementary Question, Mr 

Speaker.  I appreciate the response the Minister has provided to this Honourable House.  Regarding 

your  earlier  remarks,  Honourable  Minister  of  ICI,  you  were  correct  when  you  mentioned  the 

</span><span>government’s procedures.</span><span>  However, it is important to note that with each new financial year, the 

procedures surrounding the tendering process for new projects remain unchanged.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  Minister  had  correctly  pointed  out  the  government's  procedures  for  tendering, 

ensuring that capable and qualified tenderers have the opportunity to win contracts.  However, it 

has come to my attention that the Ministry of ICI plans to undertake the sealing of the Manihiki 

airport.  My question, Minister, is why ICI, which already has significant responsibilities here in 

Rarotonga, is taking on this project in Manihiki?  We must also consider the questions of capability 

and capacity, as the safety and well-being of our communities are of utmost importance.  Thank 

you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  probably  more  appropriate  that  I  answer  the 

Honourable Members question because it is really related to finance.  Not to disrespect the Deputy 

Prime  Minister  to  suggest  that  he  has  no  idea  of  finance.    Our  initial  estimates  for  the  cost  of 

Manihiki  airport  as  provided  to  us  by  our  consultant  firm  ACOM  and  others  in  New  Zealand 

indicated that if private company was to conduct this work, Mr Speaker, the cost will be prohibited. 

</span></div><div><span>In  fact,  the  cost  will  be two  to  three  times more  than  if  the  government  took  on  this  job  itself 

because there is cost associated with private contractors, Mr Speaker, that are not associated with 

government contract.  What we have done, Mr Speaker, is turn back the clock to a model that suits 

small island economies like ours to be able to carry out large infrastructure cost projects.  As I 

</span><span>have said before, Mr Speaker, it doesn’t matter if you are sealing an airport for a hundred people 

</span><span>or a hundred thousand people, the cost is still the same. 

</span></div><div><span>But that cost when you divide it over a smaller population means that we pay disproportionally 

high cost for our infrastructure projects as small island states.  And we found that if the government 

were to take on this project using what we call the public works model.   

</span></div><div><span>Our airport built back in the day use this public works model where we had engineers like George 

Cowan  and  others  and  the  government  public  works  carrying  out  the  work.    Our  Ministry  of 

Finance and the procurement team has found that utilising this model again, would give significant 

savings to the project. 

</span></div><div><span>The first point to consider is that a private company not only needs to cover the project's costs but 

also must include a margin for profit.  For a large, one-time project that involves significant capital 

investment in machinery and equipment, this profit margin can be quite substantial. Therefore, we 

have determined that by adopting a public works model, we can execute the necessary work to the 

</span><span>required  standards  while  staying  within  the  budget  allocations  we  have  available  to  us,  Mr. 

</span><span>Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>And I have no doubt that when this particular model of project is complete on Manihiki, it will be 

replicated on our other islands as well as to improve their infrastructure.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>   Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister, I see the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana to everyone in the House this afternoon.  Kia Orana 

Mr Speaker, the staff of Parliament, the Clerk, the Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Members, 

and fellow Members of the government.  Kia Orana to my colleagues in the Democratic Party, the 

United Party, and everyone present here today.  Kia Orana to our people listening to our Sitting on 

the radio and those watching online. 

</span></div><div><span>I will not talk too long, as I have studied our Standing Orders regarding the process of asking and 

answering questions during Oral Question time.  My question to the Prime Minister pertains to the 

announcement  you  made  about  the  agreement  that  was  signed  between  your  delegation  and 

representatives from China, which is expected to be made available once the delegation returns.  I 

checked  the  MFAI  webpage,  and  I  found  only  two  agreements  listed.    One  is  the  overarching 

agreement, but I am uncertain if this is the correct document because there is no signature on it. 

The other is the memorandum of understanding on the blue economy, which also appears to be 

unsigned. 

</span></div><div><span>My question to the Honourable Prime Minister is whether you can provide this House with copies 

of all the agreements signed between us and China.  As of now, I am uncertain about the total 

number of memorandums of understanding that have been established with China, whether there 

is one, two, three, or more.  Therefore, my question is straightforward.  Can you confirm, yes or 

no, if you are able to provide us with copies of these signed agreements with China? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Yes. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, very much.  Our Oral Question time is heading the 

right direction.  My second question, Honourable Prime Minister, I went on the Seabed Mining 

</span><span>website because after I read the Memorandum of Understanding on the Blue Economy, there are 

three companies that have been given exploration licenses; the CIC Limited, COBALT Seabed 

Resources Limited and the Moana Minerals Limited. 

</span></div><div><span>When I read the Memorandum of Understanding with the Seabed Mining, in my understanding, it 

</span><span>appears  the  government  is  pursuing  the  spirit  of  accepting  China  to  assist  us  with  our  Seabed 

Mining.    And  the  question  is,  whether  the  government  will  interfere  with  China  to  assist  and 

support us through buying shares in the company of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition is being deliberately 

misleading by continuing to refer to the Seabed Mining.  As a lawyer she should know better and 

</span></div><div><span>908 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>mindful  of  her  words.    There  is  no  Seabed  nodule  mining  anywhere  in  the  world.    The  three 

companies that she has mentioned have exploration licensees, we have a legislative and regulatory 

regime that governs all activities on our ocean and in the depths of our ocean.  And it is those laws 

that guide and govern our country in our journey of Seabed Minerals.  Can the Honourable Member 

please rephrase the question again? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member you may do so.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Perhaps I should put it in context.  In the action plan it states 

that </span><span>‘We will explore areas for further cooperation within the seabed minerals sector noting this 

is a national priority for the Cook Islands’ </span><span>but this over-arching agreement does not define the 

scope of that cooperation.  So, I am suspecting that there will be other agreements that will be 

signed  to  provide  exactly  what  the  details  are  and  we  know  that  there  are  several  ways  that 

countries can cooperate or assist. 

</span></div><div><span>In the explanation I made, I did specify that we have three companies with Exploration Licenses.  

We also know that China does not have an Exploration License so it is not being too creative to 

suggest that China could possibly come into by looking at shares in Moana Minerals Limited, why 

</span><span>Moana Minerals because that’s the company that </span><span>government has shares in.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Prime Minister, I do not intend to mislead but I should indicate to you that I have also done a 

company search on Moana Minerals Limited and CSR Cook Islands Limited. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  The areas of cooperation that we are looking at in 

inviting not just China but other countries, is in the area of scientific research.  Members will be 

aware of the decision by Pacific Island Leaders at our Forum in Rarotonga for the establishment 

of a Centre of Excellence on Deep Ocean Science to be established here in Rarotonga and we have 

been in discussions with Research Institutions in New Zealand, in America and now with China 

in Shanghai University and the First Institution of Oceanography in China. 

</span></div><div><span>To answer the Honourable Member’s question or query, there are no other agreements that have 

</span><span>been signed.  There have been no other exploration licenses been granted, let alone been received.  

The conduct of companies is governed under the laws of this country in terms of their shareholding 

</span><span>and  as  a  partner  in  a  major  law  firm  that  has  no  doubt  been  involved  in  many  corporation’s 

</span><span>shareholding transactions.  The Honourable Member will be well aware of the laws that govern 

companies and their transaction of shares. 

</span></div><div><span>As for any further applications that may come through for exploration or otherwise, Mr Speaker, 

they will need to fully comply with the laws of the Cook Islands.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Albert Nicholas; 

</span><span>you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:   </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.   </span><span>I rise to  address  the Honourable Member’s 

</span><span>queries from Oral Question time.  So, I would like to ask her, would you prefer a short answer or 

a long one? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, the short one. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the Honourable Member for 

Rakahanga.    To  summarise  the  response  from  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Maritime  Cook 

Islands:  

</span></div><div><span>1.</span><span>We are not aware of any Cook Islands-flagged vessels currently under arrest. 

2.</span><span>There are no Cook Islands-flagged vessels involved in the transportation of arms to Russia. 

3.</span><span>Additionally,  there  are  no  allegations  suggesting  that  Cook  Islands-flagged  vessels  are 

</span></div><div><span>uninsured or posing any environmental risks. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, we believe that there is currently nothing that requires our attention.  </span><span>That’s the short 

</span><span>answer. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  T. MATAPO:</span><span>   Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, and Members of this  House.   Kia Orana to  our 

interpreter and thank you for the excellent work that you are doing.  My question is directed to the 

Minister of Education.  

</span></div><div><span>Does the Ministry of Education have a plan in place to protect our Cook Islands language, and 

what measures are being considered to help preserve it?  I am asking this question because it was 

highlighted during a meeting on our island, where it was noted that today, our children are speaking 

English instead of Cook Island Maori. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Minister  for  the  Ministry  of 

Education; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to you and all Members. The 

question raised concerns whether the Ministry of Education has a plan to preserve our language.  

However, I believe this question would be better directed to the Ministry of Cultural Development, 

as they oversee a division focused on the Maori language under the leadership of Raemaki Karati. 

</span></div><div><span>Moreover, the Ministry of Education is actively encouraging students from Grade 1 to Grade 6 to 

continue speaking  the Maori language.    I want  to  emphasise that we have various dialects and 

languages,  and  when  children  from  Nga-Pu-Toru  come  to  Rarotonga,  their  dialect  may  be 

overshadowed,  as  teachers  in  Rarotonga  will  primarily  teach  the  Rarotonga  dialect  in  the 

</span><span>classroom. 

</span><span>I would like us to consider the example set by the island of Pukapuka, where they successfully 

translated the Maori Bible into their own language.  This serves as encouragement for us not to 

</span></div><div><span>910 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>rely solely on the Ministry of Education, but rather to challenge each individual island to undertake 

similar initiatives, such as translating books like the Bible into their own dialects and languages.  

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore,  each  household  should  be  motivated  to  teach  and  speak  the  Cook  Islands  Maori 

language at home.  We must acknowledge that in the 1970s and 80s, children faced punishment 

for speaking our Cook Islands Maori language in schools, often subjected to physical discipline 

for not adhering to language rules.  So, who can we truly blame today for our children not speaking 

our mother tongue?  Let us not allow this to become a significant issue for us.  As our Chaplain 

reminded us this afternoon, especially to us Honourable Members, we are the light of the nation. 

</span></div><div><span>It is our responsibility to develop policies and initiatives that encourage the use of our Cook Islands 

language, not just in classrooms but in all aspects of our daily lives so that you know who you are.  

Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  I stand because I am a bit concerned of the reply by the Minister 

of Transport. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>Are you going to ask a question or…?</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Yes, I will. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Okay, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  When I was listening to his response, I sensed an implication 

regarding the source of my information.    In the Cook Islands newspaper dated January 4</span><span>th</span><span>, the 

government stated, "The government takes allegations against Cook Islands flagged vessels very 

seriously."    I  assume  the  response  you  are  reading  to  us  is  from  the  Head  of  the  Ministry  of 

Transport. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  concerned  because,  meanwhile,  the  Cook  Islands  is  facing  criticism  globally  due  to  the 

</span><span>sanctioning of eight of its vessels.  Yesterday, I heard you, Mr Minister, advising the Member of 

Parliament for Mangaia on their responsibilities as MPs.  I would like to suggest that your role as 

Minister  of  Transport  includes  actively  investigating  these  allegations  to  determine  their 

seriousness, rather than just relying on your Head of Ministry for Transport. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am curious to know if that was a question, as 

I didn't realise, we were in an advisory period.  I did, Mr Speaker, offer her the option of a short 

answer or a long answer, and she clearly indicated that she preferred the short one. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  I  will  provide  you  with  the  long  answer.    According  to  the  report  from  the  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Transport, these are the agencies tasked with managing and addressing this specific issue.  I am 

not  an  investigator  and  I  do  not  have  a  background  in  shipping,  so  I  rely  on  the  expertise  and

</span></div><div><span>opinions  of  the  Heads  of  Ministries  and  Chief  Executive  Officers  who  are  involved  in  these 

matters. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, the  report  states that the Opposition's inquiries about  the 18 vessels are based on 

speculation stemming from misinformation.  This is crucial to note, as I forwarded a copy of the 

Hansard containing the Honourable Member's question to the Ministry of Transport. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Hansard  clearly  quotes  the  Honourable  Member  as  stating,  "We  are  aware  that  18  Cook 

Islands  flagged  ships  have  been  arrested  overseas  for  allegations  of  participating  in  the 

transportation of arms to Russia."  Following the receipt of this question from the Hansard, the 

Ministry  initiated  inquiries  to  investigate  the  claims  regarding  these  18  vessels.    However,  the 

Ministry of Transport and Marine Cook Islands were unable to locate any such vessels.  Therefore, 

I propose this matter needs to be addressed with transparency, as it involves serious allegations, 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member could have at least provided the names of the 18 Cook Islands flagged 

ships that are alleged to have participated in transporting arms to Russia and have been arrested 

overseas.  Unfortunately, the question appears to be open-ended and lacks specific details, which 

would have been useful for the Ministry of Transport to conduct a thorough investigation. 

</span></div><div><span>It could have been beneficial for the Ministry to locate these 18 ships, and if there were any merits 

to the allegations, appropriate actions would have been taken.  However, Mr Speaker, neither the 

Ministry of Transport nor Marine Cook Islands was able to find the 18 ships referenced by the 

Honourable Member, especially without specific names provided.  To clarify, Mr Speaker, there 

have been claims of 18 ships involved in transporting arms to Russia, which is the basis for the 

response and report delivered by the Ministry of Transport this morning.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Honourable  Members for your contribution to  our Oral  Question time and we will 

leave that as it is.
