<h3>Oral Question 28</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  When I was listening to his response, I sensed an implication 

regarding the source of my information.    In the Cook Islands newspaper dated January 4</span><span>th</span><span>, the 

government stated, "The government takes allegations against Cook Islands flagged vessels very 

seriously."    I  assume  the  response  you  are  reading  to  us  is  from  the  Head  of  the  Ministry  of 

Transport. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  am  concerned  because,  meanwhile,  the  Cook  Islands  is  facing  criticism  globally  due  to  the 

</span><span>sanctioning of eight of its vessels.  Yesterday, I heard you, Mr Minister, advising the Member of 

Parliament for Mangaia on their responsibilities as MPs.  I would like to suggest that your role as 

Minister  of  Transport  includes  actively  investigating  these  allegations  to  determine  their 

seriousness, rather than just relying on your Head of Ministry for Transport.
