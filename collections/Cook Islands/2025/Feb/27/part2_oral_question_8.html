<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you very much, Honourable Minister.  Supplementary Question, Mr 

Speaker.  I appreciate the response the Minister has provided to this Honourable House.  Regarding 

your  earlier  remarks,  Honourable  Minister  of  ICI,  you  were  correct  when  you  mentioned  the 

</span><span>governmentâ€™s procedures.</span><span>  However, it is important to note that with each new financial year, the 

procedures surrounding the tendering process for new projects remain unchanged.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  Minister  had  correctly  pointed  out  the  government's  procedures  for  tendering, 

ensuring that capable and qualified tenderers have the opportunity to win contracts.  However, it 

has come to my attention that the Ministry of ICI plans to undertake the sealing of the Manihiki 

airport.  My question, Minister, is why ICI, which already has significant responsibilities here in 

Rarotonga, is taking on this project in Manihiki?  We must also consider the questions of capability 

and capacity, as the safety and well-being of our communities are of utmost importance.  Thank 

you, Mr Speaker.
