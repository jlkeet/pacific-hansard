<h3>Oral Question 22</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA: </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to you and all Members. The 

question raised concerns whether the Ministry of Education has a plan to preserve our language.  

However, I believe this question would be better directed to the Ministry of Cultural Development, 

as they oversee a division focused on the Maori language under the leadership of Raemaki Karati. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, the Ministry of Education is actively encouraging students from Grade 1 to Grade 6 to 

continue speaking  the Maori language.    I want  to  emphasise that we have various dialects and 

languages,  and  when  children  from  Nga-Pu-Toru  come  to  Rarotonga,  their  dialect  may  be 

overshadowed,  as  teachers  in  Rarotonga  will  primarily  teach  the  Rarotonga  dialect  in  the 

</span><span>classroom. 

</span><span>I would like us to consider the example set by the island of Pukapuka, where they successfully 

translated the Maori Bible into their own language.  This serves as encouragement for us not to

</span></div>
<div><span>rely solely on the Ministry of Education, but rather to challenge each individual island to undertake 

similar initiatives, such as translating books like the Bible into their own dialects and languages.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  each  household  should  be  motivated  to  teach  and  speak  the  Cook  Islands  Maori 

language at home.  We must acknowledge that in the 1970s and 80s, children faced punishment 

for speaking our Cook Islands Maori language in schools, often subjected to physical discipline 

for not adhering to language rules.  So, who can we truly blame today for our children not speaking 

our mother tongue?  Let us not allow this to become a significant issue for us.  As our Chaplain 

reminded us this afternoon, especially to us Honourable Members, we are the light of the nation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is our responsibility to develop policies and initiatives that encourage the use of our Cook Islands 

language, not just in classrooms but in all aspects of our daily lives so that you know who you are.  

Thank you, Mr Speaker.
