<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, very much.  Our Oral Question time is heading the 

right direction.  My second question, Honourable Prime Minister, I went on the Seabed Mining 

</span><span>website because after I read the Memorandum of Understanding on the Blue Economy, there are 

three companies that have been given exploration licenses; the CIC Limited, COBALT Seabed 

Resources Limited and the Moana Minerals Limited. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When I read the Memorandum of Understanding with the Seabed Mining, in my understanding, it 

</span><span>appears  the  government  is  pursuing  the  spirit  of  accepting  China  to  assist  us  with  our  Seabed 

Mining.    And  the  question  is,  whether  the  government  will  interfere  with  China  to  assist  and 

support us through buying shares in the company of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition is being deliberately 

misleading by continuing to refer to the Seabed Mining.  As a lawyer she should know better and

<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>mindful  of  her  words.    There  is  no  Seabed  nodule  mining  anywhere  in  the  world.    The  three 

companies that she has mentioned have exploration licensees, we have a legislative and regulatory 

regime that governs all activities on our ocean and in the depths of our ocean.  And it is those laws 

that guide and govern our country in our journey of Seabed Minerals.  Can the Honourable Member 

please rephrase the question again? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member you may do so.  

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Perhaps I should put it in context.  In the action plan it states 

that </span><span>‘We will explore areas for further cooperation within the seabed minerals sector noting this 

is a national priority for the Cook Islands’ </span><span>but this over-arching agreement does not define the 

scope of that cooperation.  So, I am suspecting that there will be other agreements that will be 

signed  to  provide  exactly  what  the  details  are  and  we  know  that  there  are  several  ways  that 

countries can cooperate or assist. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In the explanation I made, I did specify that we have three companies with Exploration Licenses.  

We also know that China does not have an Exploration License so it is not being too creative to 

suggest that China could possibly come into by looking at shares in Moana Minerals Limited, why 

</span><span>Moana Minerals because that’s the company that </span><span>government has shares in.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Prime Minister, I do not intend to mislead but I should indicate to you that I have also done a 

company search on Moana Minerals Limited and CSR Cook Islands Limited.
