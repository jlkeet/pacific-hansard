<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:    </span><span>The  question  at  hand  pertains  specifically  to  the  contract  related  to  Mr 

William Doherty and the construction of bridges, and it does not involve T&amp;M. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You may continue, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>I  apologise,  Honourable  Member;  I  was  providing  a  clarification.  

Moving  forward,  I  would  like  to  emphasise  that  the  government  has  deemed  it  appropriate  to 

recognise Mr Doherty's contributions to our country.  In fact, the Office of the Prime Minister,

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>along with the Prime Minister himself, has recommended that an honorary knighthood or award 

be conferred upon this gentleman in acknowledgment of his efforts. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As many of us know, he received the OBE title as a recognition from the government on behalf of 

our people, signaling our gratitude for his services.  However, we must not overlook the talented 

and young Cook Islanders who have gone overseas, honed their skills in their respective fields, 

and returned with a vision to contribute to their homeland. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is our responsibility, Mr Speaker, to ensure that every individual providing a service is given a 

fair opportunity to secure contracts through the government.  This young man is a Cook Islander 

who participated in the same procurement process as Landholdings and other tenderers for that 

specific contract.  Furthermore, I want to emphasise that as soon as the Head of the Ministry of 

Infrastructure Cook Islands became aware of Mr Stan Wright's tender application, she promptly 

declared her conflict of interest and completely withdrew from the process.  Following a thorough 

vetting by the team at ICI, without the involvement of the Head of Ministry, the Minister of ICI, 

or any politicians, a recommendation was then made to procurement.  It is procurement at MFEM 

that holds the responsibility for making the final decision. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is the process, Mr Speaker.  It has been in place long before my involvement in politics, and 

I  believe  that  the  current  framework  was  specifically  designed  to  prevent  any  influence  or 

interference  from  Ministers.    What  concerns  me,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  the  Honourable  Member 

seems to imply, based on Mr Doherty's history, which I do not contest, that we should overlook 

this  young  Cook  Islander.    This  young  man  is  quite  astute  in  his  field,  and  he  deserves  our 

consideration. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now, in comparison to TRIAD, which the Honourable Member brought up, I need to address this 

point.  After 2019, we did go to market through the procurement process, only to find that there 

was just one tender submitted.  This is not the first time we have encountered such a situation, Mr 

Speaker.  It is understandable, however, since TRIAD is currently the sole provider of this specific 

service.  Given this context, procurement determined that it would likely be a waste of resources 

to put this company through the entire process when it was clear that no other contenders would 

be submitting tenders. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To  expedite  the  roading  program,  Mr  Speaker,  the  procurement  team,  along  with  Crown  Law, 

recommended that we fast track the process.  This would allow us to award the contract, subject 

to  certain  conditions  and  criteria.    Once  a  local  company  expresses  interest  in  providing  this 

particular service, the entire procurement process will be restarted and reverted to its original form. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In comparison, Mr Speaker, while the service provided by Landholdings is of superior quality, 

they are not the only provider of that particular service. This positions us in a situation where we 

cannot comply with the request made by the Hon. Member from Murienua. It is only when there 

is  a  sole  service  provider  that  procurement,  let  me  be  clear,  procurement,  will  implement  any 

</span><span>necessary changes, not ICI.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Member Teariki Heather; you have the Floor.
