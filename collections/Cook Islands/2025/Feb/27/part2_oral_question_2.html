<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for extending greetings to everyone in the House 

and to those of our people listening in to our Sitting.  I have a brief question, but please allow me 

some time to provide context for it.  This question, Mr Speaker, pertains to a gentleman who has 

</span><span>been in our country since 1970 and continues to be here today.  I believe we are all familiar with 

him,  he  is  Mr  Doherty,  a  gentleman  involved  in  various  construction  projects  throughout  our 

country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Since 1970, he has consistently demonstrated his expertise and commitment through his work and 

that of his company.  His contributions include the construction of our Auditorium and numerous 

other projects, as well as the cyclone centres in the Outer Islands, extending even to Pukapuka.  He 

has also been involved in the harbour project in Manihiki, and more recently, in the last couple of 

years, he has worked on the two bridges in Avatiu and the Takuvaine Empire bridge.

<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>He has also made significant investments in the fishing sector, benefiting our people in that area 

as well.  Mr Speaker, he has contributed immensely to our community and our country.  Therefore, 

my question is directed to the Minister of ICI or the Prime Minister, whichever one can address 

my inquiry.  </span><span>Recently, we have heard about a ‘new kid on the block’ entering the industry. </span><span> I have 

no objections to our people returning and getting involved, especially in construction. 

I am raising this question regarding the bridge in Avatiu specifically to the Minister of ICI.  Since 

</span><span>2019, we have been aware of the government’s procedures concerning the tendering processes. </span><span>

Notably, there has not been any tendering for the sealing of our roads since that time, and I would 

like to extend my congratulations to TRIAD company for their work in that area.  It is important 

to note that this is our own funding, Mr Speaker, not aid from overseas. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, my question to the government is, why are they not able to award larger projects, such 

as bridges, to this gentleman who has been a vital part of our community?  He has the necessary 

equipment and skilled workforce to carry out the work.  Furthermore, I believe there is enough 

construction activity on the island to engage our young people who have returned.  I applaud those 

young individuals for returning home and for joining the construction industry. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I recognise the quality of work he has delivered in our country, particularly in constructing bridges 

and buildings, and he is more than willing to undertake the types of projects that are needed.  We 

all acknowledge the excellent contributions this individual has made.  My question is, why is he 

not granted the same opportunities as TRIAD? Thank you.
