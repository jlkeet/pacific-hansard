<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>MRS  T. MATAPO:</span><span>   Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, and Members of this  House.   Kia Orana to  our 

interpreter and thank you for the excellent work that you are doing.  My question is directed to the 

Minister of Education.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Does the Ministry of Education have a plan in place to protect our Cook Islands language, and 

what measures are being considered to help preserve it?  I am asking this question because it was 

highlighted during a meeting on our island, where it was noted that today, our children are speaking 

English instead of Cook Island Maori.
