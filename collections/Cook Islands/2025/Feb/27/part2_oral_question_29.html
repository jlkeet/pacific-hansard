<h3>Oral Question 29</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am curious to know if that was a question, as 

I didn't realise, we were in an advisory period.  I did, Mr Speaker, offer her the option of a short 

answer or a long answer, and she clearly indicated that she preferred the short one. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now,  I  will  provide  you  with  the  long  answer.    According  to  the  report  from  the  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Transport, these are the agencies tasked with managing and addressing this specific issue.  I am 

not  an  investigator  and  I  do  not  have  a  background  in  shipping,  so  I  rely  on  the  expertise  and

</span></div>
<div><span>opinions  of  the  Heads  of  Ministries  and  Chief  Executive  Officers  who  are  involved  in  these 

matters. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the  report  states that the Opposition's inquiries about  the 18 vessels are based on 

speculation stemming from misinformation.  This is crucial to note, as I forwarded a copy of the 

Hansard containing the Honourable Member's question to the Ministry of Transport. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  Hansard  clearly  quotes  the  Honourable  Member  as  stating,  "We  are  aware  that  18  Cook 

Islands  flagged  ships  have  been  arrested  overseas  for  allegations  of  participating  in  the 

transportation of arms to Russia."  Following the receipt of this question from the Hansard, the 

Ministry  initiated  inquiries  to  investigate  the  claims  regarding  these  18  vessels.    However,  the 

Ministry of Transport and Marine Cook Islands were unable to locate any such vessels.  Therefore, 

I propose this matter needs to be addressed with transparency, as it involves serious allegations, 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Honourable Member could have at least provided the names of the 18 Cook Islands flagged 

ships that are alleged to have participated in transporting arms to Russia and have been arrested 

overseas.  Unfortunately, the question appears to be open-ended and lacks specific details, which 

would have been useful for the Ministry of Transport to conduct a thorough investigation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It could have been beneficial for the Ministry to locate these 18 ships, and if there were any merits 

to the allegations, appropriate actions would have been taken.  However, Mr Speaker, neither the 

Ministry of Transport nor Marine Cook Islands was able to find the 18 ships referenced by the 

Honourable Member, especially without specific names provided.  To clarify, Mr Speaker, there 

have been claims of 18 ships involved in transporting arms to Russia, which is the basis for the 

response and report delivered by the Ministry of Transport this morning.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Honourable  Members for your contribution to  our Oral  Question time and we will 

leave that as it is.
