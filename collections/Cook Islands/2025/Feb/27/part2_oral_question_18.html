<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:   </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.   </span><span>I rise to  address  the Honourable Member’s 

</span><span>queries from Oral Question time.  So, I would like to ask her, would you prefer a short answer or 

a long one? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, the short one. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the Honourable Member for 

Rakahanga.    To  summarise  the  response  from  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Maritime  Cook 

Islands:  

</span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>We are not aware of any Cook Islands-flagged vessels currently under arrest. 

2.</span><span>There are no Cook Islands-flagged vessels involved in the transportation of arms to Russia. 

3.</span><span>Additionally,  there  are  no  allegations  suggesting  that  Cook  Islands-flagged  vessels  are 

</span></div>
<div><span>uninsured or posing any environmental risks. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, we believe that there is currently nothing that requires our attention.  </span><span>That’s the short 

</span><span>answer. 

</span></div>
