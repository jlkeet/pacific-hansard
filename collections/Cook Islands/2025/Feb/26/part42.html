<div><span>CONTINGENCY FUNDS </span><span>–</span><span> OPERATING 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $446,800 for Contingency Funds </span><span>–</span><span> Operating  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  While I stand in support of this Contingency Fund, I 

would like to ask the Minister of Finance a question regarding this allocation, what is the specific 

purpose of this appropriation? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I think you need to advise the Honourable Member that Oral 

Question  time  was  at  the  start  of  our  Sitting.    This  is  the  time  for  Members  to  exercise  their 

understanding.  However, to help the Honourable Member out, the Contingency Fund is a standing 

fund that is  available to  Cabinet to  use for unanticipated contingencies and usually it is a very 

modest sum that is made available.  In past years not more than a $100 thousand.  It is intended 

for small unanticipated contingencies to give Cabinet some level of flexibility to address an urgent 

need.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $446,800 for Contingency Funds </span><span>–</span><span> Operating  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
