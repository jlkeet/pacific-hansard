</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,843,464 for the  

Ministry of Education stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>I  would  like  to  reiterate  the  question  I  previously  posed  to  the  Minister  of 

</span><span>Education regarding this spending.  Mr Speaker, I support this allocation for Education, but I would 

like to ask the Minister to take steps to strengthen our education system today.  When examining 

the results of Level 1, only 43 percent of students passed.  While Levels 2 and 3 had a pass rate of

</span></div><div><span>76 percent, I believe this is still below the levels achieved in previous years.  In 2022/23, students 

had a pass rate of 86-89 percent.  Nonetheless, we are thankful for the 76 percent pass rate achieved 

this year. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would like to recommend that the Minister allocate additional funds in the Budget for 

June.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Minister  for  the  Ministry  of 

Education. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, on November 19</span><span>th</span><span>, 2024 there was 

a Pacific News article which stated that education outcomes in the Pacific are faltering across much 

of  the  region;  participation  in  formal  education  is  declining  along  with  graduation  rates  and 

academic performance.   

</span></div><div><span>The 2021 Pacific literacy and numeracy assessment, the standard test program shows that over half 

of Year 4 and Year 6 students did not meet the minimum proficiency levels in reading and more 

than one third failed in the numeracy test. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, it shows that the trend is common right throughout the region and as our 

Chaplain have said this morning, we have to think, if we want to live differently, we have to think 

differently. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday,  I  spoke  about  the  re-introduction  of  our  Teachers  Training  College  and  we  have 

additional  funds  which  will  fund  two  students  to  attend  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  to 

further their education on becoming teachers.  Funding  has also  been allocated to  improve our 

science labs at Tereora College and more funding will be allocated to repair the bottom blocks at 

Tereora College.  We intend to implement these programs to invest in our teachers, support our 

aspiring  educators,  upgrade  our  facilities  and  ensure  that  every  student  has  the  opportunity  to 

achieve their full potential.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,843,464â€¦</span></div><div><span>Sorry, Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>I  rise  to  give  my  thoughts  regarding  this  Vote  Item.    We 

</span><span>understand the level of our education system in our country and we all know that our education 

system will direct our future.  I just want to show that in the Northern Group, we have a Northern 

Group Education Trust which has been established and this fund support students who come to 

Tereora for education. 

</span></div><div><span>This year, on Friday we will be giving certificates to the new students and there are 29 children 

altogether  who  will  be  attending  Tereora  College  and  most  of  them  are  from  Pukapuka.    The 

support that is given from this Trust, they are given some money at the beginning of the year, a

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>sum of $250 per student and then every month they will be paid some money to help them while 

they are studying at Tereora. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe the Minister can find some way to help the students from the Southern Group.  This is the 

help  that  the  Northern  Group  Education  Trust  give  our  children  who  come  from  the  Northern 

Group to study here.  Beside this, there is a lump sum of money given to schools in the Northern 

Group to help with some little projects every year.  The maximum amount of money given to each 

school is $2,000 a year.  I would like to mention that we have enough sufficient fund for this.  I 

would  like  to  report  to  the  House  that  this  year  we  have  increased  the  support  fund  to  these 

students.  It has been increased to help our students from the Northern Group.  The question is why 

did we do this?  It is because we believe that education is a priority. 

</span></div><div><span>We have extended our support to the students from the Northern Group due to the unsuitability of 

some of their living conditions.  This increase will contribute to improving their circumstances.  

Consequently,  I  strongly  support  this  allocation  for  our  students,  as  it  will  help  them  in  their 

studies,  enabling  them  to  enhance  their  academic  performance  and,  hopefully,  attain  a  higher 

passing rate at Tereora. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Honourable Members, may 

I ask you that when I present a Vote Item, you take the opportunity to raise your hand and speak 

on  that  item  before  the  Minister  Responsible  responds.    For  instance,  as  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition  has  done,  once  you  have  raised  your  points,  the  Minister  can  then  address  those 

concerns and consider an increase to our budget for that specific Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I will put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,843,464 for the  

Ministry of Education stands part of the Schedule
