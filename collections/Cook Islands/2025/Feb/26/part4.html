<div><span>OBITUARIES 

</span></div><div><span>We have now reached a very important part of our Sitting today, and I would like to open the Floor 

to any Members who wish to make any obituary announcement.  I see the Honourable Member 

</span><span>Sonny Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana Mr Speaker, Clerk and staff of this 

Honourable House, and all Members of Parliament of the Cook Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>I rise to express my condolences to a family in my constituency of Titikaveka.  One of our beloved 

community members, Papa Teariki Tuiakana Numanga, has sadly passed away in New Zealand.  

Just last Friday, his family celebrated his 93</span><span>rd</span><span> birthday.  Papa Teariki lived a remarkable life, and 

many of us may have crossed paths with him during his time working at Auckland International 

</span><span>Airport, where he served as an Ambassador for arriving passengers.  His birthday celebration was 

</span><span>held on Friday, and he passed away on Monday, 24 February 2025.  He will be brought back from 

New  Zealand  to  the  Cook  Islands  next  Monday,  and  funeral  arrangements  will  take  place  in 

Titikaveka.
