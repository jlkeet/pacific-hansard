<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister responsible for 

the Ministry of Cultural Development.  Mr Speaker, as I reviewed the rugby field in Tupapa, I 

observed that a new water station has been established there.  I believe this water station will serve 

the people of Tupapa and other villages visiting the field.  My question is, where did you secure 

the funding to construct this water station?
