</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Marine Resources is one that we must support and encourage for the 

work they do for our nation.  Our food security standards are concerning, as we rely heavily on 

imported seafood and vegetables from New Zealand.  If we were to face another pandemic that 

leads to closed borders, we would be in big trouble.  

</span></div><div><span>Even though the pearl farming industry in the Northern Group has faced challenges, we should not 

be discouraged.  We must continue to pursue marine development and work towards achieving 

seafood security for our country. 

</span></div><div><span>The Prime Minister recently informed us about his visit to China, where they toured a laboratory 

dedicated  to  spawning  and  culturing  various  types  of  marine  life,  particularly  seafood.    They 

discovered some species that can thrive in our ocean temperatures.  For instance, they culture all 

kinds  of  sea  cucumbers,  whether  slippery  or  spiny.    Additionally,  while  we  know  that  oysters 

cannot survive, they have developed adaptable oyster varieties that are suitable for our climate. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, I believe it is crucial for all of us to support this Ministry in order to secure 

and cultivate these seafood species here, enabling us to farm them for export to New Zealand.  As 

such, I strongly support this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $2,395,516 for Marine Resources stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
