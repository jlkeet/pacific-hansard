<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister responsible for 

the Ministry of Cultural Development.  Mr Speaker, as I reviewed the rugby field in Tupapa, I 

observed that a new water station has been established there.  I believe this water station will serve 

the people of Tupapa and other villages visiting the field.  My question is, where did you secure 

the funding to construct this water station? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Minister George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to the question from 

the Member for Matavera.  I want to assure you, Honourable Member, that your question does not 

unsettle  me.    Regarding  the  inquiry  about  who  funded  the  construction  of  this  water  station,  I 

believe the answer lies in the Word of God.  </span><span>The Bible states, “Seek, and you will find; knock, and 

</span><span>the door will be opened; </span><span>present your request, and it will be granted.”</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have been preparing for some time to construct a water station near the Ministry of 

Cultural Development.  Therefore, to answer your question about who funded this development, 

it  was  the  Tupapa  Sports  Association  and  the  Tupapa  Housie  team,  along  with  my  personal 

contribution of $50, which I believe is sufficient. 

</span></div><div><span>The second point is about who will cover the costs associated with the use of water, as we know 

that water rates will apply.  I urge those who are concerned about the payment for water to listen 

carefully.  Our Prime Minister has addressed this issue, affirming that there will be no charges for 

water usage.  Furthermore, I want to clarify that this water station in Tupapa is not only for the 

</span><span>people of Tupapa but for everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>The water station next to my home is accessible not only to the people of Tupapa but to everyone, 

including visitors to our island.  Additionally, I am planning to construct an ice-making facility 

beside this water station, so when we celebrate our 60</span><span>th</span><span> anniversary, people will have access to ice 

</span><span>and cold water to enjoy while at the Auditorium.  That is my response to the question posed by the 

Member for Matavera.  And please, do not ask me where the funding for the ice-making machine 

came from; I will tell you that it is from the Bible. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister and I see the Honourable Robert Heather; you 

</span><span>have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.   Before I ask my question to the Leader of the 

country, I would like to share a message with the government; there is a saying that you may have 

won the battle, but the war still lies ahead.   </span><span>Now, here’s my  question for you, Prime Minister, 

</span><span>regarding the recent events involving three Chinese warships firing live rounds in international 

waters off New Zealand and Australia.  </span><span>As of yesterday, they have entered Australia’s exclusive 

</span><span>economic  zone.    Mr  Prime  Minister,  how  has  our  government  engaged  with  Chinese  Embassy 

officials in New Zealand regarding this breach of Australian waters? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  thanks  to  the  Member  for  their  question.  

Regarding this exercise, I must report that I have not received any briefings from any government, 

be it Australia, New Zealand, or China, concerning the developments that have occurred in the 

international  waters  off  the  coast  of  Australia.    However,  I  want  to  note  that  our  Secretary  of 

Foreign Affairs is currently in Wellington, while our Minister of Foreign Affairs is attending a 

high-level fisheries forum in the Solomon Islands with other Pacific region ministers.  I will ask 

our  Foreign  Minister  to  make  inquiries  to  see  if  we  can  receive  updates  or  briefings  on  these 

specific events. 

</span></div><div><span>One  point  worth  mentioning,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  in  recent  weeks,  the  New  Zealand  Navy 

participated in a joint naval exercise with Australia and the United States in the South China Sea.  

</span><span>This  might  explain  China’s  decision  to  conduct  naval  exercises  in  the  international  water</span><span>s  off 

</span><span>Australia’s coast. </span><span> Additionally, I am aware that in the last two weeks, the Australian government 

and the Chinese government signed a Security Treaty between their countries.  These matters, Mr 

Speaker, are not within our purview; they are treaties and agreements between two or more nations. 

</span></div><div><span>However, in due course, we may receive further information regarding the naval exercises that 

these countries conduct in international waters off each other's coasts.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Prime Minister.  I see the Deputy Prime Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Yesterday the Member for Rakahanga asked a 

</span><span>question regarding the registration of ships in the Cook Islands and the problems occurring outside 

of our country regarding these ships registered in the Cook Islands.  I must extend my apology to 

the Honourable Member, Mr Speaker because as of two minutes ago I still have not received a full 

</span><span>complete report to answer the Honourable Member’s quest</span><span>ion. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Yesterday,  the  Member  for  Rakahanga  raised  a  question  about  the 

registration of ships in the Cook Islands and the challenges related to those ships operating outside 

our country.  I must apologise to the Honourable Member, Mr Speaker, because as of two minutes 

ago, as I have not yet received a complete report to adequately address the Honourable </span><span>Member’s 

</span><span>question. 

</span></div><div><span>876 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>However,  Mr  Speaker,  I  have  been  able  to  compile  a  small  amount  of  information  for  the 

Honourable  Member,  and  I  assure  them  that  as  soon  as  I  receive  the  complete  report  I  have 

requested, I will make that information available to them. 

</span></div><div><span>In any event, Mr Speaker, there are currently over 780 foreign vessels registered with Marine Cook 

Islands (MCI).  I must admit, I wa</span><span>s surprised by that number; I hadn’t expected it to be so high. </span><span>

This  information  is  readily  accessible  on  the  Marine  Cook  Islands  website.    According  to  the 

limited information I received prior to coming to Parliament this morning, Mr Speaker, there are 

no illegal operators or foreign-registered ships on our registry at this time. 

</span></div><div><span>The  reason  for  this,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  these  vessels  have  either  been  deregistered  or  have 

voluntarily removed themselves from the registry.  I have been assured that Marine Cook Islands 

is an open registration entity accessible to mariners from around the world.  To register, individuals 

must  apply  and  complete  an  application,  which  then  undergoes  a  due  diligence  process.    This 

application is subject to a vetting procedure that requires specific information, and I was informed, 

Mr Speaker, that even this process can be quite lengthy. 

</span></div><div><span>There are several screening mechanisms in place within the process, Mr Speaker, and these must 

be satisfied before any decision is made. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  I rise, Mr Speaker, to raise a Point of Order.  We are running 

</span><span>out of Oral Question time because the answers are not answering the question.  My question wasn’t 

</span><span>about how you register a boat; my question was that there are Cook Islands flagged ships that have 

been sanctioned because they were carrying illegal cargo and that was what the Minister was going 

to go and find out and get a report on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Okay, I will let the Deputy 

Prime Minister to respond. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Hence,  why  I  highlighted  earlier  in  my  opening  speech  that  the 

</span><span>information that I have requested hasn’t come to my attention yet and so I offered to share what 

</span><span>little  information  I  had  to  the  House.    If  it  is  taking  up  all  the  Question Time  then  my  plan  is 

working, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Members,  we  will  hold  off  on  that  matter  until  we  receive  the 

</span><span>answer, at which point you may share it.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>   Thank  you,  Honourable Speaker.   My question is  directed to  the Member for 

Nukuroa.  This is an important question, Honourable Speaker, as I believe some of the leaders in 

</span><span>Nukuroa have been contemplating their traditional governance. Here is my question</span><span>…</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I will have to decline the answer to your question because 

it must be referred to the people responsible.  I see the Honourable Minister Vaine Mokoroa.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  As I am the Minister responsible for Justice, 

the answer to your question is NO! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Robert Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, just a short question to the Honourable Minister 

for National Environment Service.  This is a follow up question regarding sometime last year when 

we queried about the coastal feasibility study for coastal protection of 400k, can you give us an 

update on that, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Speaker,  and  thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Akaao.  In my last meeting with Alatoa, the CEO of Environment Services, which took place about 

two weeks ago, they were in the process of awarding a contract for that program.  Unfortunately, 

this contract is not for the actual mitigation work or the construction of the necessary structures.  

Instead,  it  is  for  a  company  to  collect  data,  conduct  research,  and  prepare  a  proposal  for  the 

government. 

</span></div><div><span>Currently, Mr Speaker, I share the frustration that many people feel regarding the recent tidal issues 

in the Takitumu and Puaikura areas. During that time, I was literally on the ground, even though I 

wasn't a Minister then.  I empathised with the people in those areas and felt their anguish. There is 

a pressing need for this program to advance to the point of taking tangible, physical actions, and I 

completely understand their concerns. 

</span></div><div><span>I assure the Honourable Member that I will follow up with Alatoa to determine the current status 

of  the  program.    Mr  Speaker,  these  are  the  challenges  I  face  as  a  Minister,  particularly  when 

navigating through various processes.  </span><span>Unfortunately, this is how things are, and it’s disheartening 

</span><span>that our people must endure these delays. I will keep the Honourable Member informed and will 

share any updates accordingly. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

</span><span>Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  My question is to the Minister responsible for the Solar system.   

Because  we  are  aware  that  there  is  a  program  for  the  refurbishing  of  the  solar  system  in  the 

Northern Group.  I have asked the Ministry of OPM which is responsible as to when the program 

</span><span>is going to start.  The reply is that they are not definite and sure of the time. 

</span></div><div><span>The reason why I am asking this question because we are running out of funds and the money is 

being used by the Outer Islands to purchase diesels.  So, the sooner for us to get this going in fixing 

</span><span>our Solar system then it will alleviate the problem of us buying more diesel. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  I cannot claim to be the Minister of the Solar System, but I can address the 

Honourable  Member's  question.    However,  I  note,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  only  have  30  seconds 

remaining.  If you prefer, I can provide a more comprehensive answer to the Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the Northern Group supply, this project involves the replacement of the entire battery 

systems for the Northern Group, which have reached the end of their lifespan.  This is a project 

</span><span>that we are working closely with New Zealand.  Unfortunately, the length of time that it’s taking 

</span><span>to  finalised  this  particular  project  is  gone  beyond  than  what  I  expected.    We  will  however 

endeavour to speed up the process with the New Zealand government and we will stick with the 

New Zealand government funding because we have gone so far down the road that it would be 

pointless to now look at funding sources. 

</span></div><div><span>In the meantime, Mr Speaker, with the Southern Group battery system that are now also coming 

to their end of life, we are looking at advanced battery technology and something that we can work 

quickly with the Asian Development Bank and also the government of China.  And if things go 

according to plan with China, we may see both of these projects being conducted at the same time.  

As to the exact timeframe, I am afraid Mr Speaker I cannot provide an exact timeframe other than 

to say we are working quickly.  But in the meantime, we will have to supplement the power source 

on the outer islands with the diesel generators.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  And thank you Honourable Members 

for your contributions to the Oral Question time.
