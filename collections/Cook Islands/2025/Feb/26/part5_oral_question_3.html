<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to the question from 

the Member for Matavera.  I want to assure you, Honourable Member, that your question does not 

unsettle  me.    Regarding  the  inquiry  about  who  funded  the  construction  of  this  water  station,  I 

believe the answer lies in the Word of God.  </span><span>The Bible states, “Seek, and you will find; knock, and 

</span><span>the door will be opened; </span><span>present your request, and it will be granted.”</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I have been preparing for some time to construct a water station near the Ministry of 

Cultural Development.  Therefore, to answer your question about who funded this development, 

it  was  the  Tupapa  Sports  Association  and  the  Tupapa  Housie  team,  along  with  my  personal 

contribution of $50, which I believe is sufficient. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The second point is about who will cover the costs associated with the use of water, as we know 

that water rates will apply.  I urge those who are concerned about the payment for water to listen 

carefully.  Our Prime Minister has addressed this issue, affirming that there will be no charges for 

water usage.  Furthermore, I want to clarify that this water station in Tupapa is not only for the 

</span><span>people of Tupapa but for everyone. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The water station next to my home is accessible not only to the people of Tupapa but to everyone, 

including visitors to our island.  Additionally, I am planning to construct an ice-making facility 

beside this water station, so when we celebrate our 60</span><span>th</span><span> anniversary, people will have access to ice 

</span><span>and cold water to enjoy while at the Auditorium.  That is my response to the question posed by the 

Member for Matavera.  And please, do not ask me where the funding for the ice-making machine 

came from; I will tell you that it is from the Bible. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister and I see the Honourable Robert Heather; you 

</span><span>have the Floor.
