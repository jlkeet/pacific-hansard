<div><span>CONSIDERATION OF BILL IN DETAIL </span><span>–</span><span> DAY 2 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Prime Minister had the Floor.  I now call the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In terms of the Crown Law appropriation, we can 

see  in  this  Supplementary  Budget  totals  $587,000.    $368,000  Mr  Speaker  is  to  go  towards  the 

</span><span>critical staff retention and recruitment needs.  In addition, which is not in our Budget here, Mr 

Speaker, but which had already been approved in the previous budget is an additional $420,000 

through the Economic Recovery Roadmap funding.  That brings it to an additional $1 million over 

what was previously.  

</span></div><div><span>I note the concerns raised by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  In August last year, our 

Crown Law was in a pretty dire strait with only five lawyers engaged.  And the government has 

been working very hard to prioritise the needs of Crown Law to the extent that today Crown Law 

has 11 lawyers with two additional Senior Counsels that are currently going through interviews as 

</span><span>we speak.  By the end of this calendar year, the Crown Law Office is expected to have up to 16 

</span><span>lawyers, including which I would have to be very happy about five brand new Cook Islands law 

graduates.

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The  recruitment  and  retention  initiatives  that  we  have  put  in  place  will  see  a  staggering  of 

increasing amount over the next few years to bring remuneration levels up to appropriate amounts 

for our lawyers.  I am very happy with the Appropriation and the Supplementary for this particular 

Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,838,628 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
