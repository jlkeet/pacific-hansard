<div><span>PARLIAMENTARY  SERVICES  </span><span>–</span><span>  MP  TRAVEL  AND  ALLOWANCES  (LOCAL  AND 

OVERSEAS)</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $913,516 for MP Travel and Allowances (Local and Overseas)  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to express my support for this Vote Item, which 

aims to facilitate travel for MPs both domestically and internationally.  I have heard some concerns 

from Members of Parliament on both sides of the House regarding travel arrangements outside the 

country.    It  is  clear  that  when  a  Member  of  Parliament  travels  to  places  like  New  Zealand  or 

Australia, they typically fly in Economy Class.  However, Ministers are afforded Business Class 

</span><span>travel. 

</span></div><div><span>While I fully support this Vote Item, I would like to make a request to the government regarding 

travel accommodations.  I empathise with the Member for Are-Nikau, who had to travel a long 

</span><span>journey in Economy Class.  I just wanted to put this request through, understanding the existing 

</span><span>criteria for MP travel.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I am requesting that in this Appropriation, the government consider upgrading ordinary 

Members of the House to Premium Economy when they travel.  I want to thank the Minister of 

Education, Vaine Mokoroa, who, during our trip to New Zealand, was in Business Class while I 

was in Economy.  He upgraded me to Premium Economy out of compassion, and I truly appreciate 

his generosity during that trip.  

</span></div><div><span>As  such,  I  stand  before  you  to  support  this  request  and  to  seek  the  government’s  </span><span>support  for 

upgrading MPs to Premium Economy Class for their travels.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  I stand to talk on the Report from Parliament in response to the 

questions posed by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).  One of the primary inquiries made by 

the  PAC  pertains  to  Members  of  Parliament's  travel  arrangements,  and  Parliamentary  Services 

provided details on both internal and external travels.   It is anticipated that the PAC may issue 

recommendations based on the information provided regarding MP travel. 

</span></div><div><span>Upon reviewing the Report, I noticed an annexure detailing travel expenses from 2021 to 2023.  It 

appears  that  a  significant  portion  of  the  funds  allocated  was  spent  on  MPs  from  the  Northern 

Group, primarily for chartered flights to return them to their constituencies.  The figures outlined 

in the Report indicate that chartering a flight would cost between $26,000 and $35,000.  We look 

forward to the next report from the PAC, as they may have suggestions on how we can reduce 

these travel expenses.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Teokotai Herman; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  It is indeed the case that we have requested a travel 

report from Parliamentary Services, especially focusing on the travel of our MPs to the Northern 

Group islands.  In the case of Pukapuka, there are no scheduled flights available, which necessitates 

Parliament arranging for Members to travel there, often through chartered flights.  

</span></div><div><span>One of the key responsibilities of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is to thoroughly examine 

the expenses incurred in this area and to identify ways to minimise spending.  Unfortunately, we 

must  ensure  that  Members  of  Parliament  are  able  to  return  to  their  constituencies,  including 

Penrhyn, Rakahanga, Pukapuka, and Manihiki.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to mention that the PAC will soon return with recommendations aimed 

at  reducing  travel  costs,  such  as  exploring  flight-sharing  arrangements  with  other  ministries.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Members.  

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question.  The Question is:
