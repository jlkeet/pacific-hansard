<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  thanks  to  the  Member  for  their  question.  

Regarding this exercise, I must report that I have not received any briefings from any government, 

be it Australia, New Zealand, or China, concerning the developments that have occurred in the 

international  waters  off  the  coast  of  Australia.    However,  I  want  to  note  that  our  Secretary  of 

Foreign Affairs is currently in Wellington, while our Minister of Foreign Affairs is attending a 

high-level fisheries forum in the Solomon Islands with other Pacific region ministers.  I will ask 

our  Foreign  Minister  to  make  inquiries  to  see  if  we  can  receive  updates  or  briefings  on  these 

specific events. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One  point  worth  mentioning,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  in  recent  weeks,  the  New  Zealand  Navy 

participated in a joint naval exercise with Australia and the United States in the South China Sea.  

</span><span>This  might  explain  China’s  decision  to  conduct  naval  exercises  in  the  international  water</span><span>s  off 

</span><span>Australia’s coast. </span><span> Additionally, I am aware that in the last two weeks, the Australian government 

and the Chinese government signed a Security Treaty between their countries.  These matters, Mr 

Speaker, are not within our purview; they are treaties and agreements between two or more nations. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, in due course, we may receive further information regarding the naval exercises that 

these countries conduct in international waters off each other's coasts.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
