</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  I stand in support of this appropriation for Parliamentary Services, despite the fact 

that there will be no increase in their funds until the end of June.  I would like to request that the 

Minister responsible for Finance consider areas that need support for Parliamentary Services in the 

next financial year.  I have noticed that some staff are facing challenges, and additional support is 

necessary, including the potential creation of new positions within Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>This is particularly important to strengthen areas such as the Select Committees.   For instance, 

within the Public Accounts Committee, we are encountering difficulties with report writing and 

other tasks, as there is currently only one staff member handling this workload.  If we could secure 

an  additional  staff  member  or  even  a  contract  worker,  I  believe  that  the  Public  Accounts 

Committee, along with other Select Committees, would greatly benefit from this.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>In addition to this, I want to acknowledge the valuable work of Margaret Numanga to the Public 

Accounts Committee, chaired by Teokotai Herman, as well as to the other committees.  Lastly, Mr 

Speaker, I would like to commend all the staff working here.  They put in significant effort behind 

the  scenes  on  various  tasks  that  often  go  unnoticed.    Once  this  Sitting  concludes,  they  have 

additional responsibilities and continue to work diligently until everything is completed. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would like to give my support and call for the government to increase funding for 

Parliamentary Services in the upcoming financial year.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I stand to share my thoughts on this 

Vote  Item.    For  many  years  in  the  past,  we  have  been  saying  that  the  Parliament  should  be 

independent.  Next year will be the eighth year that we have been talking about this but I cannot 

see that steps are being taken for Parliament to be independent. 

</span></div><div><span>As I mentioned on the Audit Office, this is one office that needs strengthening  and for them to 

have sufficient staff to do the work of Parliament.  We need to look for a lawyer for Parliament 

only.  The government should have its own lawyer and Parliament have its own lawyer. 

</span></div><div><span>I notice that there is no suggestion for a legislation to make Parliament independent.  I know that 

the  Bill  for  the  Audit  Office  is  in  its  draft  form.    If  these  suggestions  are  not  included  in  the 

Supplementary Budget, then maybe it can be included in the Budget in June. 

</span></div><div><span>I am very happy to hear the Prime Minister say that there will be an increase number of lawyers 

</span><span>for the Crown Law Office.  This means that in the next few months, there should be more drafting 

legislation that will reach this House.  And this is one way that we can resource our Parliament so 

that we will receive good reports from our Select Committee.  I know that right now each Member 

is writing their own reports.  We do not have degrees for writing reports but because there is no 

</span><span>one else to write the report, each Chairperson write their own reports.  So, I am requesting that we 

</span><span>look at Parliament so that it is well resourced so it can have its own lawyer to advise our Speaker.  

So, when the Speaker makes ruling, it is based on the law.  Thank you very much.

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  would  like  to  inform  you,  Honourable 

Members, that I initially intended to mention the sum of $10 million for Parliamentary Services.  

However, upon putting on my glasses, I realised that it is actually $1 million. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,002,659 for Parliament Services stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
