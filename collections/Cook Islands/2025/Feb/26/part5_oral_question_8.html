<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Yesterday the Member for Rakahanga asked a 

</span><span>question regarding the registration of ships in the Cook Islands and the problems occurring outside 

of our country regarding these ships registered in the Cook Islands.  I must extend my apology to 

the Honourable Member, Mr Speaker because as of two minutes ago I still have not received a full 

</span><span>complete report to answer the Honourable Member’s quest</span><span>ion. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Yesterday,  the  Member  for  Rakahanga  raised  a  question  about  the 

registration of ships in the Cook Islands and the challenges related to those ships operating outside 

our country.  I must apologise to the Honourable Member, Mr Speaker, because as of two minutes 

ago, as I have not yet received a complete report to adequately address the Honourable </span><span>Member’s 

</span><span>question.

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr  Speaker,  I  have  been  able  to  compile  a  small  amount  of  information  for  the 

Honourable  Member,  and  I  assure  them  that  as  soon  as  I  receive  the  complete  report  I  have 

requested, I will make that information available to them. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In any event, Mr Speaker, there are currently over 780 foreign vessels registered with Marine Cook 

Islands (MCI).  I must admit, I wa</span><span>s surprised by that number; I hadn’t expected it to be so high. </span><span>

This  information  is  readily  accessible  on  the  Marine  Cook  Islands  website.    According  to  the 

limited information I received prior to coming to Parliament this morning, Mr Speaker, there are 

no illegal operators or foreign-registered ships on our registry at this time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  reason  for  this,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  these  vessels  have  either  been  deregistered  or  have 

voluntarily removed themselves from the registry.  I have been assured that Marine Cook Islands 

is an open registration entity accessible to mariners from around the world.  To register, individuals 

must  apply  and  complete  an  application,  which  then  undergoes  a  due  diligence  process.    This 

application is subject to a vetting procedure that requires specific information, and I was informed, 

Mr Speaker, that even this process can be quite lengthy. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There are several screening mechanisms in place within the process, Mr Speaker, and these must 

be satisfied before any decision is made.
