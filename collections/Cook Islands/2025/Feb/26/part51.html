</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  call  the  Honourable  Akaiti  Puna,  Chairperson  of  the  Bills,  Petition  and  Papers  Review 

Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In accordance with Standing Order 156 (1), I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament takes note of the Report by the Bills, Petitions and Papers Committee 

</span><span>Review of the ‘Keep Our Water Free’ Petition</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister Vaine Mokoroa 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Pursuant  to  recommendations of the Committees’ Report, I now open the Floor to  Honourable 

</span><span>Members for an open debate on the Report by the Bills, Petitions and Papers Committee Review 

</span><span>of the ‘Keep Our Water Free’ Petition.</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  </span><span>I would like to draw the House’s attention back to the 

</span><span>Report that has been tabled.  Additionally, I want to thank the Committee for conducting public 

consultations, allowing us to hear the voices of our people on this matter.  

</span></div><div><span>I notice that the Committee is composed of strong women, with both the Chairperson and Deputy 

Chairperson serving in those roles.  Their involvement ensures a thoughtful perspective, as their 

experiences in nurturing families and children will undoubtedly inform the report's preparation.  I 

would also like to thank all the members of this Committee for their contributions.  Lastly, I would 

like to acknowledge the Member from Ngatangiia, Tukaka Ama, for his valuable contribution as 

well.  This Petition has been presented to this House by this Member, who is well aware of the 

needs  of  the  people  regarding  this  matter.    By  examining  the  investigations  conducted  by  this 

</span><span>committee, we can gain insight into their findings.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to page 9 of the Report.  Specifically, if we look 

at Part 2 of the Report, I want to clarify that I have thoroughly read this document from cover to 

cover and back again to ensure I do not make any errors in my understanding. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to reference Part 2 of the Report, which states that "the Government will fund the 

TTV"  with  the intent  of maintaining  the status  quo, ensuring that the public does not  bear any 

costs.  Mr Speaker, during my remarks yesterday, I highlighted that this is a concern the people of 

</span><span>Matavera have considered seriously.  I would like to thank the two women on this committee for 

</span><span>their thoughtful consideration regarding the issue of water; thanks to their efforts, our water supply 

will remain free of charge.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Robert Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to express my support for the comments 

made by the Member for Rangiatea, as I am a member of the PPC committee.   You may have 

reviewed our Report, and I would like to highlight some of the issues addressed within it. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  island  of  Rarotonga  has  a  resident  population  of  9,000.    From  January  to 

December 2024, we welcomed 170,315 visitors to our shores.  This means that residents account 

for only 5.5 percent of the population at any given time, while the visitors make up a substantial 

94.5 percent.  

</span></div><div><span>The  question  we  must  address  is,  who  is  utilising  the  majority  of  our  water  resources  here  in 

Rarotonga?  This is our home; we pay taxes and strive to make a living on average incomes.  The 

increasing pressure from tariffs serves as a significant push factor, compelling many people in our 

country to migrate abroad in search of better opportunities, thereby leading to a rise in the number 

of foreign workers filling the gaps left behind. 

</span></div><div><span>The impact on our agriculture sector is significant.  Our growers and farmers utilise vacant land to 

cultivate fruits, vegetables, and root crops to meet consumer supply and demand.  They keep these 

arable lands functional and well-maintained, all while paying taxes to the government from the 

revenue they earn through their hard work, which unfortunately often leaves them struggling to 

make ends meet.  

</span></div><div><span>High inflation in the costs of goods such as seedlings, fertilisers, feed, and fuel are major factors 

that we must consider.  If we fail to support our growers and farmers, the only option left will be 

the  importation  of  goods,  which  will  gradually  undermine  the  sustainable  future  of  our 

hardworking agricultural community. 

</span></div><div><span>We believe that tariffs should be directed towards commercial use and aimed at addressing excess 

and wastage, rather than impacting our domestic and residential users.  Therefore, I support the 

Report from our BPPC committee, advocating that TTV should remain a public service.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is that: 

</span></div><div><span>The Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
