</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,647,810 for Police stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to express my support for this Vote Item.  I also support the 

views of the Member for Titikaveka concerning the allocation of $145,000 to Community Policing.  

As he mentioned earlier, Matavera is the only village yet to join, and once they do, the community 

policing service will cover the entire Takitumu area.  With the approval of this Appropriation, I 

anticipate that within three weeks, we will establish the community police in Matavera, which will 

benefit both the Members for Ngatangiia and Titikaveka, ensuring that Takitumu is well-served 

by the community police.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, it is clear that this is one of the Ministries facing 

numerous  challenges.  There  is  a  shortage  of  police  personnel,  and  we  currently  lack  a  Chief, 

relying  instead  on  interim  leadership.  We  need  to  explore  effective  solutions  to  address  these 

issues, especially considering that new recruits are being paid minimum wage.  It is no surprise 

that our youth may be reluctant to join the Police when the wages are so low. 

</span></div><div><span>Last week, I participated in a consultation on National Security involving Ben Ponia and Maara 

Tetava.  This is a new agency, and one of its responsibilities is to enhance our security, particularly 

in the area of electronics.  I believe that if our Police force were in a stronger position, this aspect 

of  security  would  fall  under  their  jurisdiction.    However,  given  the  challenges  the  Police  are 

</span><span>currently facing, I was pleased to hear about the initiatives being proposed to safeguard us against 

online attacks from external threats. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Minister of Police, I am concerned that the additional funds in the Supplementary Budget 

</span><span>may  not  be  sufficient  to  recruit  the  necessary  officers  between  now  and  June.    I  hope  that  the 

</span><span>upcoming Budget in June will allocate adequate funding, as we are witnessing an increase in youth 

crime, and our ability to protect homes from criminal activities is compromised.  Therefore, I trust,

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Minister, that in our next budget, we will see a significant appropriation aimed at strengthening 

the Police force. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    As  referred  to  by  our  Members,  this  is  just  a 

Supplementary Budget.  I expect our main Budget to be tabled before the House in May will have 

significantly more appropriations and just like we have done with the Crown Law Office. 

Mr Speaker, we are taking a very calculated methodical step by step process to address the issues 

around retention, recruitment, of our Police force. 

</span></div><div><span>So, this Appropriation adds extra in this Supplementary Budget of around $460 thousand is to go 

towards some of the work, the funding that is required for the </span><span>Kukupa</span><span>.  And also, for the standing 

up of our community policing.  We are looking, Mr Speaker, at precisely what we have done with 

other Ministries that each year we will be able to increase the allocations to these critical ministries 

and departments to ensure that they meet their needs. 

</span></div><div><span>This is no difference to previous Vote allocations for Parliament.  Again, we need to look very 

carefully at how we can afford all of these new demands that are being phased on us and being 

placed on our ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>I would just like to  correct one of the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition in our 

National Security Agency establishment office and that this is probably an agency that suggested 

is  better suited under the Ministry of Police or  another Police department.   But  because of the 

challenges that the Police department face at the moment, it is not been seen as something that will 

be put under the Police.  That is not the case Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>The National Security Agency is an outcome of our national security policy that we adopted last 

year and one key aspect of our national security policy was to do with cyber security.  And over 

the last year, Mr Speaker, working very closely with the New Zealand Secret Intelligence Service 

and other New Zealand agencies that is responsible for national security.  We are developing an 

agency, Mr Speaker, that will be capable of being part of a regional intelligence gathering and 

</span><span>intelligence sharing network. 

</span></div><div><span>This is more than just work that will include Police department, Mr Speaker, it will also include 

agencies such as customs, immigration and other such agencies that deal with security issues that 

are becoming more prevalent around the region.  I mentioned the most, the elements that are really 

</span><span>affecting  our  country  right  now,  are  the  elements  involving  cyber  security.    But  this  national 

security agency will also deal with aspects of people smuggling with trans-national crime, with 

unfavourable  persons  travelling  to  other  countries  with  drugs  and  other  such  crimes  which  are 

committed through the region. 

</span></div><div><span>It is expected that this national security agency, this again is part of the development and growth 

of country as part of the regional network of nations that are working together to combat these 

aspects of trans-national crime.  But working with our New Zealand counterparts, Mr Speaker, we 

</span></div><div><span>890

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 26 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>will  be  able  to  determine  what  shape  this  agency  will  take  and  whether  it  is  best  suited  as  a 

standalone agency or whether it should be attached to the office of the Prime Minister or whether 

it should be attached to the Police department. 

</span></div><div><span>We are getting to the stage, Mr Speaker, advises from New Zealand to be able to help provide this 

assistance and it remains to be seen as I said, how this agency will operate.  But what I do know, 

Mr Speaker, in the New Zealand context, the Secret Intelligence Service is an agency that provides 

or gathers and receives intelligence from its partners and it is an agency whose head of department 

reports directly only to the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Going a little bit of track here, sorry, Mr Speaker.  I stand to support this Appropriation for Police 

and look forward to the next budget where we will have a much better idea of how we are going 

to be staggering the appropriations for Police to address the retention and remuneration issues. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister for including Parliament Services with 

the Police annual budget. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,647,810 for Police stands part of the Schedule
