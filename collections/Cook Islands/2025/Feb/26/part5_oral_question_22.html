<h3>Oral Question 22</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  I cannot claim to be the Minister of the Solar System, but I can address the 

Honourable  Member's  question.    However,  I  note,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  only  have  30  seconds 

remaining.  If you prefer, I can provide a more comprehensive answer to the Honourable Member. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the Northern Group supply, this project involves the replacement of the entire battery 

systems for the Northern Group, which have reached the end of their lifespan.  This is a project 

</span><span>that we are working closely with New Zealand.  Unfortunately, the length of time that itâ€™s taking 

</span><span>to  finalised  this  particular  project  is  gone  beyond  than  what  I  expected.    We  will  however 

endeavour to speed up the process with the New Zealand government and we will stick with the 

New Zealand government funding because we have gone so far down the road that it would be 

pointless to now look at funding sources. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In the meantime, Mr Speaker, with the Southern Group battery system that are now also coming 

to their end of life, we are looking at advanced battery technology and something that we can work 

quickly with the Asian Development Bank and also the government of China.  And if things go 

according to plan with China, we may see both of these projects being conducted at the same time.  

As to the exact timeframe, I am afraid Mr Speaker I cannot provide an exact timeframe other than 

to say we are working quickly.  But in the meantime, we will have to supplement the power source 

on the outer islands with the diesel generators.  Thank you.
