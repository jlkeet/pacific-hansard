<h3>Oral Question 19</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Speaker,  and  thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Akaao.  In my last meeting with Alatoa, the CEO of Environment Services, which took place about 

two weeks ago, they were in the process of awarding a contract for that program.  Unfortunately, 

this contract is not for the actual mitigation work or the construction of the necessary structures.  

Instead,  it  is  for  a  company  to  collect  data,  conduct  research,  and  prepare  a  proposal  for  the 

government. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Mr Speaker, I share the frustration that many people feel regarding the recent tidal issues 

in the Takitumu and Puaikura areas. During that time, I was literally on the ground, even though I 

wasn't a Minister then.  I empathised with the people in those areas and felt their anguish. There is 

a pressing need for this program to advance to the point of taking tangible, physical actions, and I 

completely understand their concerns. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I assure the Honourable Member that I will follow up with Alatoa to determine the current status 

of  the  program.    Mr  Speaker,  these  are  the  challenges  I  face  as  a  Minister,  particularly  when 

navigating through various processes.  </span><span>Unfortunately, this is how things are, and itâ€™s disheartening 

</span><span>that our people must endure these delays. I will keep the Honourable Member informed and will 

share any updates accordingly. Thank you. 

</span></div>
