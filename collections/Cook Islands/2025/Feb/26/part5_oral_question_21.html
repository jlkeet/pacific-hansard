<h3>Oral Question 21</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  My question is to the Minister responsible for the Solar system.   

Because  we  are  aware  that  there  is  a  program  for  the  refurbishing  of  the  solar  system  in  the 

Northern Group.  I have asked the Ministry of OPM which is responsible as to when the program 

</span><span>is going to start.  The reply is that they are not definite and sure of the time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The reason why I am asking this question because we are running out of funds and the money is 

being used by the Outer Islands to purchase diesels.  So, the sooner for us to get this going in fixing 

</span><span>our Solar system then it will alleviate the problem of us buying more diesel. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor.
