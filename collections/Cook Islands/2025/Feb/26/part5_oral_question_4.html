<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.   Before I ask my question to the Leader of the 

country, I would like to share a message with the government; there is a saying that you may have 

won the battle, but the war still lies ahead.   </span><span>Now, here’s my  question for you, Prime Minister, 

</span><span>regarding the recent events involving three Chinese warships firing live rounds in international 

waters off New Zealand and Australia.  </span><span>As of yesterday, they have entered Australia’s exclusive 

</span><span>economic  zone.    Mr  Prime  Minister,  how  has  our  government  engaged  with  Chinese  Embassy 

officials in New Zealand regarding this breach of Australian waters?
