<div><span>CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,776,667 for the  

Ministry of Cultural Development stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank You, Mr Speaker.  I rise to give my support to this Vote Item because when 

we look at the Appropriation ending 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, it has reached $2 million.  Mr Speaker, I believe 

that we know this money comes 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, it expires.  Then we come to the 1</span><span>st</span><span> of July and I believe 

that is when the 60</span><span>th</span><span> Celebration commences ending on 4</span><span>th</span><span> August.  

</span></div><div><span>What I wanted to know Mr Speaker is whether we have sufficient money for Cultural Development 

during this celebration period.  That is why I stood up Mr Speaker and to support this Vote Item 

and also awaits how much more finance will be given to Cultural Development for the celebrations. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Tereapii Maki-Kavana; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak in this 

Honourable  House.    Kia  Orana  to  all  Members  of  this  House.    I  stand  to  give  support  to  this 

Allocation  to  this  Vote  Item  and  because  a  significant  event  took  place  in  Araura  yesterday 

following the Vote of No Confidence defeat.  So, our Prime Minister stood up yesterday and said 

</span><span>for our Sitting to continue today.  

</span></div><div><span>I wanted to stand up and support this Appropriation because on Araura yesterday, this was called 

Legacy Day.  This, a day has been created by our new Mayor and his Council with the support of 

</span><span>the traditional leaders on the island.  This is to celebrate our forefathers from Aitutaki who had 

</span><span>been Prime Ministers for this country and also including our leading councilors.  When I look on 

the walls of this House, I see faces of people who have been Prime Ministers.  It appears that about

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>70 percent of our leaders comes from the island of Aitutaki.  So, this day has been created by the 

council o</span><span>f Aitutaki to remember these peopleâ€¦</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span> Irrelevancy, Mr Speaker!  We are not here to talk about past or former Prime 

Ministers, we are here to debate on the $2 million appropriated for Cultural Development.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:  </span><span>I would have thought that my friend would agree with me, as this 

process  established by the people of Aitutaki  will also  contribute to  our celebration of the 60</span><span>th</span><span>

anniversary. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Honourable  Member,  please  return  to  our  Vote  Item.    Could  you  verify  the 

places of birth for those Prime Ministers? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:  </span><span>I know that visitors have come to our island of Aitutaki to celebrate 

this significant day established here.  This marks the beginning of our 60</span><span>th</span><span> anniversary of self-

governance by the people of Aitutaki, and I trust that my two colleagues will support me in this 

matter.  I am truly grateful for the efforts of our island council during this time. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I extend my best wishes to my constituents, and I strongly support this 

appropriation for the Ministry of Cultural Development. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,776,667 for the
