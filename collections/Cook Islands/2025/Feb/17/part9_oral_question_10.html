<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Yes, I will ask the question and the question is what is it that 

you mean by being transparent, consulting and open dialogue when that is the very issue that we 

have at the moment?  And while I am on my feet then you say that once we have had a chance to 

have a look at the agreement and release it, we will be consulting, welcoming consultation at that 

point; what is there to consult with when the agreement has been signed?
