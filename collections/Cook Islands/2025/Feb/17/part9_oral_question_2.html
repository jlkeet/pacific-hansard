<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Please Mr Speaker, if I can be allowed to speak on behalf 

of our bereavement.  On behalf of the Parliament of the Cook Islands, Speaker of Parliament and 

everyone here in this Parliamentary House, we would like to convey our condolences to the family 

of Papa Tauira Nikoia.  We all know that this Papa used to be a great agricultural person in our 

country.    As  for  his  programme,  later  on  today  at  4  p.m.,  his  body  will  be  returned  home  in 

Titikaveka.  His funeral will be held tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., at his residential place.  Thank 

you very much.  Therefore, our condolences to the entire family of Papa Tauira Nikoia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I have a question for the Honourable Prime Minister.  There was some news published 

in the newspaper regarding a huge debt of this country.  I believe, we are in debt by over $1 million.  

Therefore, my question is, what is the status with our reserved fund and also, what is the status 

about allocating some funds for a revolving fund? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I supported the proposal by the budget team regarding the revolving fund, which I 

strongly supported.  That is my question to the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
