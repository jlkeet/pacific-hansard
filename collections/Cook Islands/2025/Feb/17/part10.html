<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>I  call  the  Minister  of  Finance,  the  Honourable  Mark  Browne,  for  the  Second  Reading  of  the 

Appropriation Amendment Bill 2025. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Today, I have the opportunity to highlight further 

signs of our strength and resilience as we celebrate our 60 years of self-government.  And before 

I do that, I would like to move, Mr Speaker: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Appropriation Amendment Bill 2025 be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the growth in our economy, and our improving fiscal position which I will outline 

today are a testament to  the steps taken over the past  few years to  support our economy  while 

balancing our budget realities as well.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I present this Amendment Bill with full confidence, as we strive towards delivering 

on improving the lives of our people.  On the economic front, our latest financial year report for 

the year ending June 2024 shows that our Cook Islands economy has recovered well and is now 

</span><span>on a path to continued growth and resilience as well to the future. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in the year to June last year, our economy experienced a robust 16 percent in real 

terms, bringing us closer to pre-pandemic levels, even after adjusting for inflation.  Mr Speaker, 

this strong recover and positive outlook are not just something that we in government believe, but 

</span><span>it is also reported in the Asian Development Bank’s Pacific Economic Monitor forecast in August 

</span><span>last  year  that  we  would  grow  by  another  5.2  percent  for  the  year  to  June  2025,  showing  the 

confidence that one of our key development partners has in our economic trajectory.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it is no secret that tourism is the key industry in our economy, and over the 2024 

</span><span>calendar year, we welcomed over 170 thousand visitors to our shores, the second-highest that we 

have ever seen.  This rebound is a testament to the resilience and strength in our tourism industry, 

as well as the investments government has made to ensure these visitors can make their way to the

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Cook Islands.  The benefits to this activity are not confined to just the tourism sector, but flows to 

other sectors as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, these sectors play a vital role in our economy.  Our agriculture sector , for example 

sustains our growing population by supplying fresh local produce  </span><span>–</span><span> essentially creating a local 

export market where we bring the demand to our shores rather than sending these goods abroad.  

The  financial  services  sector  supports  businesses  with  essential  banking  services  while  the 

contracting,  construction,  retail  and  the  wholesale  sectors  all  benefit  from  a  thriving  tourism 

industry.    As  we  know,  Mr  Speaker  when  tourism  prospers,  these  other  industries  flourish, 

demonstrating  the  powerful  multiplier  effect  that  keeps  every  dollar  circulating  within  our 

economy. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the strength of our economy has enabled this government to invest in our bright future 

while  also  honouring  our  past.    In  addition,  we  have  taken  proactive  steps  to  work  with  our 

creditors to accelerate debt repayment, seizing the opportunity presented by our strong recovery.  

This early repayment will reduce our annual debt servicing costs, particularly for the loans that 

were essential during the pandemic that funded the wage subsidies, the business grants and the 

vital support for our people in the times of need. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this proactive approach has allowed the government to invest in vital infrastructure, 

including road improvements in Rarotonga and measures to ensure reliable shipping for our Pa 

Enua.    At  the  same  time,  we  have  allocated  an  additional  $2  million  to  celebrate  the  60</span><span>th</span><span>

anniversary of self-government </span><span>–</span><span> an occasion of great significance. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, strong economic management has enabled the government to address the needs of 

</span><span>our people while upholding fiscal responsibility, maintaining confidence in our nation’s stability.  

</span><span>This confidence extends beyond our borders earning recognition at regional and even global levels, 

and reinforcing the Cook Islands standing in the Pacific. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today,  I stand before you to  reaffirm  our government’s commitment to  building  a 

</span><span>stronger, more resilient Cook Islands.  As we look ahead, our focus remains clear </span><span>–</span><span> investing in 

the well-being of our people, strengthening our infrastructure and safeguarding essential services 

to support the continued development of our country. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, a key pillar of our development agenda is ensuring safe and efficient infrastructure.  

To  support  this  $500,000  has  been  set  aside  for  critical  road  maintenance,  ensuring  our  roads 

remain safe and accessible.  In addition, $5 million has been allocated to the Rarotonga Roads 

project, improving the connectivity for both our people and for visitors.  These investments will 

</span><span>enhance road safety and ensure the long-term sustainability of our road transport networks. 

</span></div><div><span>As we strengthen and improve our roads on land, Mr Speaker, we also recognize the vital role that 

inter-island  shipping  plays  in  keeping  our  Pa  Enua  connected.    To  ensure  more  reliable  and 

</span><span>efficient transportation, we are investing $3 million towards the procurement of a new shipping 

</span><span>vessel.  The initiative will facilitate the movement of people and goods between our Pa Enua.

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Reliable infrastructure goes beyond roads and shipping, Mr Speaker.  It also includes access to 

clean and safe water.  We recognize that this is a fundamental right for all Cook Islanders and to 

support our communities, we have allocated $500,000 to sustain the household water allowance 

of 50,000 litres per month, ensuring equitable access to this essential resource.  We have allocated 

50,000 litres per month ensuring equitable access to this essential resource. 

</span></div><div><span>Public  safety  remains  a  basis  for  our  national  priorities,  Mr  Speaker.    To  strengthen  law 

enforcement and community trust, we are allocating $145,000 to help the re-establishment of our 

community  policing,  reinforcing  the  vital  partnership  between  Police  Officers  and  the 

communities they serve.  Additionally, $100,000 has been set aside to support the Police Advisory 

Committee, further enhancing collaboration and public trust. 

</span></div><div><span>To  improve  the  financial  oversight  within  law  enforcement,  Mr  Speaker,  a  Memorandum  of 

Understanding  has  been  established,  enabling  the  MFEM-Shares  Services  to  provide  financial 

reporting support to the Cook Islands Police Service.  As part of this arrangement, certain funds 

have been allocated from Police to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management for the 

remainder of this fiscal year, ensuring accountability and efficiency in managing resources. 

</span></div><div><span>Beyond our domestic priorities, Mr Speaker, our government remain committed in strengthening 

diplomatic ties and supporting our diaspora.  To uphold these commitments, we have provided 

additional funding to ensure continued engagement with Cook Islanders abroad and also with our 

international partners. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, $80,000 has been allocated to support our international subscriptions, ensuring that 

we meet our international obligations for the fiscal year and maintain our active presence on the 

global stage. 

</span></div><div><span>And as we look ahead, Mr Speaker, we also take time to reflect and celebrate our national identity.  

This year marks our 60</span><span>th</span><span> year of self-governance and in recognition of this historic milestone, we 

have  allocated  $2  million  towards  the  60</span><span>th</span><span>  Te  Maeva  Nui  celebrations.    More  than  a 

commemoration, this occasion is an opportunity to honour our journey and reaffirm the strength 

of our culture, our people and our future. 

</span></div><div><span>While  we  celebrate  our  achievements,  Mr  Speaker,  we  remain  equally  committed  to  ensuring 

responsible financial management.  Thanks to our strong economic performance and our prudent 

fiscal policies, we ae on a solid cash position.  As a result, we take this opportunity to pay down 

some of our existing debt.  This will have the effect of reducing our debt servicing burden over the 

medium  to  long  term,  ensuring  financial  stability  while  continuing  to  meet  our  national 

</span><span>commitments. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, beyond the planned expenditure outlined today, our government has taken decisive 

action  throughout  the  year  to  address  urgent  funding  needs.    Through  Executive  Council  and 

</span><span>Article 70 of the Constitution, we have responded to pressing priorities, including providing cost 

</span><span>of living  relief to  our most vulnerable people by increasing  the Christmas Bonus payment and 

supporting the work of our Select Committees </span><span>to strengthen our nation’s governance.</span></div><div><span>825

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  it  is  my  privilege  to  share  with  you  today  positive  news  regarding  our  country’s 

</span><span>financial outlook.  Our revenue forecasts have seen an encouraging adjustment, with an increase 

of $9.5 million for this period.  Notably, this includes a $10 million in Core Sector Support funding 

</span><span>from the Government of New Zealand, a valued partner in our nation’s development.</span></div><div><span>Furthermore,  Mr  Speaker,  we  have  observed  a  modest  but  welcome  increase  in  tax  receipts, 

particularly from VAT contributions made by visitors who have chosen to experience the beauty 

of our shores.  This growth is a clear reflection of the strength of our tourism sector and more 

broadly, our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>As we look ahead, Mr Speaker, it is important that we allocate these additional funds strategically, 

ensuring they are invested in infrastructure and essential services that will not only support our 

people and communities but also sustain the long-term prosperity of our nation.  Tourism remains 

the  foundation  of  our  economy,  and  by  making  sound  investments  today,  we  are  securing  a 

stronger future for generations to come. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to provide an overview of our financial position following the 

recent updates to the 2024/25 Budget.  The total Appropriation has increased from$328 million to 

$396 million </span><span>–</span><span> a total increase of nearly $68 million. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  this  increase  may  appear  alarming  at  the  first  glance,  but  there  is  a  reason  for  this  large 

increase which I will explain.  As government is taking the opportunity to pay down some of its 

existing debt, to do so we must appropriate for it.  This alone increases our appropriation by over 

$40 million, and combined with expenditure plan for the previous fiscal year which was carried 

forward into  the current  financial year of $19 million,  these two amounts, account  for the vast 

majority of this increase. 

</span></div><div><span>This  has been funded, Mr Speaker through a combination of a strong cash position along  with 

additional tax revenues and the generous support from our development partners, for which we are 

sincerely grateful. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  this  budget  increase  is  dedicated  to  strengthening  the  services  we  provide  to  our 

people and enhancing infrastructure across both Rarotonga and the Pa Enua.  Specifically, $3.4 

</span><span>million  will  support  various  agencies  in  delivering  better  public  services,  while  $8  million  is 

allocated  to  critical  infrastructure  projects.    These  adjustments  reflect  our  commitment  to 

improving the quality of life for our people and ensuring the sustainable development of our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we have made commitments to the people of the Cook Islands and we have done our 

</span><span>best to honour those commitments whilst at the same time upholding fiscal discipline.  We have 

prioritised effectively keeping our eyes on the goal of building a stronger and more thriving society 

for us all.  It is my honour and privilege to table this Appropriation Amendment Bill before the 

House.  Thank you, very much.
