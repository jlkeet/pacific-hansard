<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for 

</span><span>the question.  We had a team effort in this morning’s progra</span><span>m where we would share the work 

load.  We were advised that there would be no speaking opportunity for the government, therefore 

part of our team came to Parliament to welcome the protestors and mindful that today was the 

tabling of our Budget and having just returned last night, Mr Speaker my time was consumed with 

preparing the Ministerial Statement to address our people as a result of this protest march where I 

knew I would be afforded appropriate time to be able to speak freely. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr Speaker I was taking the time this morning also to prepare for the Budget Speech 

that again will be delivered today here in Parliament.  But that is not to say that we are dismissing 

</span><span>the protest march or disrespecting the protestors.  We welcome everybody’s oppor</span><span>tunity to place 

their  protest  before  the  Parliament  and  as  a  government  and  as  a  Parliament,  we  have  heard 

numerous over the past 15 years various protests that have come before our Parliament and I recall, 

Mr Speaker the protest march on the purse sein fishing, the taxation protest on the increase of our 

VAT and taxation of pension, the protest of the Grey Power and also the protest of the helmet 

legislation  and  there  were  people  who  had  very  strong  views  against  the  decision  that  the 

government took on all of these issues.  But when carefully analysed, Mr Speaker people began to 

understand that the decision we made was in the benefit of them and all of our people and I have 

every confidence, Mr Speaker that when the details of our action plan are provided for open and 

free discussions, people will see the benefits that clearly will emanate from this. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, as I said in my Ministerial Statement, Mr Speaker we have seen and we have heard and we 

have listened to our people and we have understood the need for more consultation that has been 

asked for and this, Mr Speaker is something that we definitely will be committing to.  Thank you, 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Minister Elikana and you 

</span><span>have the floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I want to clarify that I was fully aware of the absence of the 

Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.  They informed me yesterday that, due to important 

commitments,  they  would  not  be  present  when  the  protestors  gathered  here  at  Parliament.    As 

</span><span>Minister  Responsible  for  Parliamentary  Services,  I  assured  them  that  I  would  convey  their 

apologies to the protestors who would be attending.  I sincerely hope that in the future, we will be 

given the chance to respond to the statements made by protestors, whether from the government 

side or the opposing side.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Leader of the Opposition.
