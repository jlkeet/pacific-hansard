<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please be seated.  Before we took the adjournment, a question was asked to the 

Prime Minister and therefore, I give him this opportunity for his answer. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  And I would like to take the opportunity to explain 

to the Members of this House and to our public the approach that we took in developing this action 

</span><span>plan for closer strategic partnership with the people of the Republic of China.  And to counter the 

allegation that this has been done without transparency and even worst by some quarters that this 

has been done in secret. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Let me refer you, Mr Speaker, to previous agreements that our country signed with New Zealand 

</span><span>and with Australia.  Those agreements Mr Speaker were signed on the basis of losing our National 

Sustai</span><span>nable Development Plan as the foundation for areas that we’ve identified as priorities for 

</span><span>our country.   Consultation, Mr Speaker was very heavily evident in the development of our NSDP.  

This is not the Government plan Mr Speaker but rather this is the C</span><span>ook Islands’ people plan.</span></div>
<div><span>The  lengthy  consultation  that  took  place  to  develop  our  NSDP  involved  the  NGO  groups,  the 

private  sector,  government  agencies,  traditional  leaders,  the  RAC  and  numerous  other  Cook 

Islands community groups.  In this development pl</span><span>an, Mr Speaker, there’s “kaveinga nui” is the

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>voice and the choice of our people.  When we come to the development of our agreements with 

other countries.  The first one with New Zealand, this was done in 2022.  The two governments 

had a meeting, and it was determined the areas the two can work in partnership.  And it was written 

</span><span>in a contract agreement, it is called the ‘Vaka Haurua’ or the ‘Vaka Purua’ –</span><span> double hull canoe. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  two  governments  signed  the  contract  agreement  and  then  given  to  the  public,  the  people.  

There was no measure of consultation in the development and the negotiation of that agreement 

because the voice of the people was captured in the foundation document that we used to negotiate 

with New Zealand and that was our NSDP. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The same with Australia, later that same year 2022, the two-government met responsible for the 

foreign  affairs  division  in  their  different  countries.    They  discussed  and  they  identified  and 

determined the areas where both governments can work together.  It was returned to our Cabinet 

and received and accepted by our Cabinet.  The two governments signed the contract and it was 

released  to  the  public.    Both  of  these  documents  are  right  before  me  now,  Mr  Speaker,  easily 

available online. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And if anybody is interested, it sets out the areas of cooperation between our countries with New 

Zealand  and  with  Australia.    It  is  from  this  documents,  Mr  Speaker  that  will  emanate  the  key 

specific projects that our two countries will enter into.  This provides the framework, Mr Speaker, 

for  areas  of  cooperation  and  collaboration  with  these  two  countries.    This  is  exactly  the  same 

</span><span>approach we have taken with the People’s Republic of China.  We have made no secret of the fact 

</span><span>that we want to enter into a strategic partnership agreement.  And as I have mentioned in previous 

communications  in  the  media,  this  is  something  that  we  have  been  in  discussion  with  our  key 

partners since last year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our officials have been in formal and informal discussions with their counterparts over the last 

year.  In our previous agreement we signed, Mr Speaker, we did not share the details of our </span><span>Vaka 

Haurua, Vaka Purua</span><span> with the government of Australia.  And we did not share the agreements we 

were in discussion with Australia or Tumanava agreement with New Zealand.  But until the two 

governments were happy with the final document and they were signed off, then we were able to 

share these documents. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I can confirm with our team that the discussions and negotiations on our part on the final language 

and the final wordings in parts of our agreement were reached only on the day of the actual signing 

with our comprehensive strategic partnership with China.  To correct the misinformation that is 

going around on social media by commentators here, that this agreement was already signed before 

we even left to go to China was totally wrong.  And to answer the question of the Leader of the 

</span><span>Opposition, as a lawyer herself, she should be aware that how can you be transparent about an 

agreement that it still under negotiation and even yet to be signed. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But I can say, Mr Speaker, that within this agreement, there is one area that we should be proud of 

</span><span>with  our  officials  in  their  negotiations  on  the  final  wording  of  this  document.    And  this  is  a 

</span><span>concession that the People’s Republ</span><span>ic of China agreed to and that is at any project that does take 

place  under  this  agreement  within  the  Cook  Islands  shall  fall  under  Cook  Islands  law.  

Furthermore, it shall follow the procurement policies of the Cook Islands.  This Mr Speaker is a

</span></div>
<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>concession  that  we  have  managed  that  no  other  pacific  island  country  has  managed.    And  the 

reason behind it, Mr Speaker, is very simple.  We are seen as a jurisdiction that obeys the rule of 

law.  We are seen as a jurisdiction that is able to pay its debts.  We are seen as a country that is 

solid and reliable.  That is why we have been able to get those concessions, Mr Speaker, something 

that we should be proud of our team for being able to negotiate on our behalf.  

</span></div>
<div><span>What we followed, Mr Speaker is the proper diplomatic protocol when two countries enter into 

agreements with each other.  And we have done everything in proper standards and requirements 

as a sovereign state.  I look forward to, Mr Speaker, these documents agreements being put online 

so that they will be made available for everybody to consider.
