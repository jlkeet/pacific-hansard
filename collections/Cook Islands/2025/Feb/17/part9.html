<div><span>STATEMENTS BY MINISTER 

</span></div><div><span>We have two Ministerial Statements today.  I call the Honourable Prime Minister, Mark Brown; 

you have the Floor.</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  everyone  today  here  in  this 

Honourable House, including our people listening in online. 

</span></div><div><span>As we gather today for the first Sitting of the Parliament year, we do so at the historic moment.  

This year, we commemorate 60 years of self-governance, a milestone that reflects the resilience, 

the vision and the determination of our people.   

</span></div><div><span>We have experienced many milestones, and achievements in  our journey as a nation, from  the 

visionary determination of our </span><span>ai tupuna</span><span> to enter into an arrangement of self-governance in free 

</span><span>association with New Zealand in 1965.  The building of the Rarotonga airport, to the economic 

hardships of 1997 financial crisis, and the subsequent rebuilding of our nation in the decades that 

followed.  We endured the devastating impact of COVID-19 where we closed our borders for two 

years.  Yet, we emerged with an economy that is recovered stronger than ever, reaffirming our 

place as the first Pacific Island nation to achieve high income status. 

</span></div><div><span>These defining moments remind us of an undeniable truth.  We are a nation that navigate our own 

future with vision, with grace, and with determination.  We have never been afraid to made the 

bold decisions.  To forge our own path and to take control of our destiny.  That is why today, as 

</span><span>we mark the beginning of this Parliamentary year, I stand before you with the same commitment, 

</span><span>to lead with confidence, clarity and conviction in the best interest of our Cook Islands people.

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our economy continues to evolve.  Tourism remains the backbone of our prosperity, 

bringing in over 170 thousand visitors in 2024, a near record number.  But we must not rely on a 

single sector to drive our development agenda.  The lesson we learnt through the experience of 

COVID-19, is that we must diversify our economic landscape.  Diversification of our economy is 

critical to ensure our economic resilience and sustainable development.   

</span></div><div><span>We are actively developing our seabed mineral sector under a world leading regulatory framework, 

ensuring  that  we  strike  the  necessary  balance  between  responsible  resource  management  and 

environment protection.  Our financial services sector continues to provide a strong foundation for 

growth, bringing in new opportunities for finance and investment.   

</span></div><div><span>Alongside  these  efforts  and  through  our  international  partnerships,  we  are  expanding  access  to 

global market positioning the Cook Islands as a leader in sustainable development and economic 

innovation.  Our recent engagement including with China, New Zealand, Australia, and the United 

States,  reflect  our  strategic  approach;  one  of  openness,  collaboration  and  sovereign  decision 

making.  We can choose to be a country that relies on handouts and is dependent on our big brother, 

or we can choose to be a country that can stand on its own two feet and can engage in constructive 

partnerships of mutual benefit.   

</span></div><div><span>We have been through a lot together Mr Speaker, over the past 60 years, we have fought for our 

place in this world, and we have built a nation that stands tall, proud and sober.  And we have done 

that as Cook Islanders.  Our country stands as a beacon to many others in the Pacific region.  Let 

us be proud of who we are and what we have achieved as a nation, and as a people.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our journey as a self-governing nation is not one of isolation but of partnership and 

engagement.  As we look outward, we re-affirm our commitment to multilateral agreements.  A 

recent example is the Paris Agreement and our Regional climate leadership.   

</span></div><div><span>Climate change remains one of our greatest extra special challenges and we will not stand idle 

while larger nationals debate their responsibilities.  The Cook Islands will continue to lead climate 

action,  advocating  for  stronger  commitments  from  the  global  partners  while  securing  vital 

resources to support our resilience.  In this time of change with the USA again pulling out of the 

Paris Agreement and its commitments, the Pacific countries now look to other countries to fill the 

</span><span>gap and do more.  Therefore, Mr Speaker it was reassuring in my discussions with Premier Liu 

that China will step up in terms of meeting their carbon emissions targets and also in supporting 

small islands states to help build resilience against the impacts of climate change.   

</span></div><div><span>At the same time, Mr Speaker we are strengthening economic diplomacy through initiatives like 

</span><span>our comprehensive strategic partnership with China, which provides structured opportunities in 

trade, infrastructure and the blue economy.  This does not replace our long-standing relationships 

with New Zealand, Australia and others but rather it compliments them ensuring that we have a 

diversified portfolio of partnerships. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me talk about our relationship with New Zealand, Mr Speaker.  The Cook Islands and New 

Zealand share a deep and enduring bond, one that is built on shared ancestry, history, family and 

neutral respect.  Our relationship has evolved over the decades and while New Zealand has been a

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>valued partner in our development it is also important to acknowledge the significant contribution 

that the Cook Islands has made in New Zealand.   

</span></div><div><span>Tens of thousands of Cook Islanders have helped shap</span><span>e New Zealand’s economy, its works force 

</span><span>and its cultural landscape.  Our businesses continue to support New Zealand industries to the tune 

of millions of dollars and our economic ties remain strong.  This is not a relationship of one-way 

support but rathe</span><span>r a partnership of shared success.  We are grateful for New Zealand’s ongoing 

</span><span>engagement and we recognise the many ways in which we work together for mutual benefit.  The 

rights and obligations codified in our relationship of free association are mutual and while we may 

at  times find matters in  which our views diverge, it is  important  that we  uphold  the reciprocal 

nature of our relationship. 

</span></div><div><span>As  we  look  ahead,  Mr  Speaker  we  do  so  with  commitment  to  strengthening  this  partnership 

ensuring that it remains grounded in respect, understanding and a shared vision for the future.  I 

look forward to my next discussions with Prime Minister Luxton in due course to promote and 

strengthen our collaboration whilst recognizing and respecting the sovereign status of both of our 

countries. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am aware that some in our community feel unheard in recent months and recent 

</span><span>decisions.  I know that today’s protest is not just about one issue.  It is about many.  It is about the 

</span><span>future of our country, it is about trust, it is about ensuring that every Cook Islander feels heard.  

Let me say, I see you, I hear you and I respect you.  Furthermore, let me say this, Mr Speaker we 

are all Cook Islanders.  We all want the best for our country.  We must never allow division to 

weaken our people.  We must never let fear be stronger in our hope in our future.   

</span></div><div><span>This government values, Mr Speaker transparency, consultation and open dialogue.  I welcome 

robust discussion and I assure our people that every agreement that we sign, every partnership we 

enter and every step that we take is guided by one single question </span><span>–</span><span> does this serve the long-term 

interest of the Cook Islands?  Mr Speaker, I have full confidence in the ability and capability of 

my Cabinet and of our senior officials to effectively advance and protect the Cook Islands interests. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this year we celebrate more than a milestone, we celebrate our identity, our resilience 

and our future.  For 60 years we have built a nation that stands proudly on the world stage.  We 

</span><span>have shaped our own destiny, strengthened our economy and forged meaningful partnerships that 

serve the interest of our people.  But beyond policies and progress, Mr Speaker this anniversary is 

about something deeper, our sense of belonging. 

</span></div><div><span>“Kua kite au i tōku tūranga, e avaiki tōku –</span><span>I know who I am, I have a homeland.”</span></div><div><span>This theme is not just a reflection of our past, it is a statement of who we are today and what we 

carry forward into the future.  It speaks to our deep connection to our land, our people and our 

culture.  No matter where Cook Islanders may be in the world,  we have a home.  We have an 

</span><span>identity and we have a nation that we continue to build together and as we look ahead, we do so 

</span><span>with confidence.

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our 60</span><span>th</span><span> anniversary is a time to reflect but also a time to recommit to ensuring that every Cook 

Islander, wherever they  are,  continues to  feel  the strength  of their homeland, the pride of their 

heritage, and the certainty of their place in our shared future.  Kia Orana e kia manuia, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I now call the Honourable Minister 

Tingika Elikana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I now lay the Statement on the Table. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  ELIKANA:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  Clerk  of  Parliament,  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  fellow 

Cabinet Ministers, Leader of the Opposition, all Members of Parliament, ladies and gentleman and 

to our people listening into this broadcast, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>And before I start my statement, I would just like to say congratulations to the Prime Minister for 

that very comprehensive and informative statement. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in 1965, we, the people of the Cook Islands exercised our right for self-determination 

and entered into a relationship of free association with New Zealand.  At that time our people had 

four governance choices to choose from:  

</span></div><div><span>1.</span><span>To go independent; 

2.</span><span>To remain a colony of New Zealand; 

3.</span><span>To explore Polynesian Federation with our near neighbours Tahiti or; 

4.</span><span>Self-governance in free association. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker with great foresight and historical and ancestry ties that bound us to Aotearoa, our 

people chose self-governing with free-association with New Zealand and so was born 60 years ago 

the  state  of  the  Cook  Islands  as  we  know  ourselves  to  be  today.    That  relationship  of  free-

association with New Zealand has remained an evolving one of partnership, freely entered into 

and freely maintained with both countries respecting the right and freedom of the other to pursue 

their own national policies and interest. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, since 1965 under successive governments and in cooperation with many development 

partners, the Cook Islands has developed in many ways.  Consonant with its growing experience 

and  expertise  in  foreign  affairs  matters  the  Cook  Islands  have  increasingly  assumed  direct 

responsibility for our own international relations, bilateral and multilateral, regional and global.  

</span><span>Those three-association arrangement that had been codified by the Cook Islands and New Zealand 

in successive understanding over the decades including the 2001 Joint-Centenary Declaration. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, to date the Cook Islands has established diplomatic relations and formal partnership 

</span><span>with 66 countries and European Union, we are members of over 40 organisations, including most 

</span><span>UN specialized agencies and are a party to over 150 multilateral treaties, conventions and protocols 

in our own right.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The world of 2025 is very different to that of 1965.  The Cook Islands finds itself at a crossroads 

of change, with skyrocketing inflation, supply chain challenges, graduated OECD DAC Status, 

and grappling more than ever with the effects of human induced climate change.  Amidst all these 

challenges, the world continues to show growing interest in our Pacific region. 

</span></div><div><span>That  interest  Mr  Speaker,  requires  our  government  to  take  a  proactive  approach  to  ensure  the 

continued security and prosperity of our people by harnessing international partnerships that can 

support deliver transformative outcomes for our people.  We must take and act on opportunities, 

to deliver on our national priorities, those that the people have determined and articulated in our 

National Sustainable Development Agenda (NSDA) 2020+.  A one-hundred-year plan to carry us 

through to 2121. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, much has been said in recent days about our relationship with Aotearoa New Zealand.  

That relationship is one bound by inter-generational ties which go back well over a century.  Back 

to the ocean voyaging times of our ancestors, who settled Rarotonga, and those who journeyed 

onwards to settle in Aotearoa. 

</span></div><div><span>Back to the ANZACs and the 500 young Cook Islands men, 5 percent of our population at the 

time, from across Rarotonga and our Pa Enua who enlisted to serve in the allies, war effort more 

than 100 years ago because Aotearoa asked us for help.  It goes back to 1965, and our act of self-

determination in  choosing self-governing in  free  association with  New Zealand, to  present  day 

2025  where  we  celebrate  together  with  New  Zealand  our  60  years  of  self-governance  in  free 

association with New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we are proud of our relationship of free association with New Zealand </span><span>–</span><span> one which 

has been beneficial for both New Zealand and the Cook Islands.  Our economies are intertwined, 

our people and cultures are intertwined, and our futures are intertwined.  Just as Aotearoa New 

Zealand continues to forge international partnerships in the interest of the people of New Zealand, 

so too must our government forge international partnerships in the interest of the people of the 

Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  despite  the  ordeal  of  COVID,  its  continuing  ramifications  and  our  OECD  DAC 

graduated status, our eye is on the lang games, as it must.  Economic growth that supports the 

</span><span>resilience of our people on Rarotonga and across our Pa Enua, taking better care of our human and 

natural capital, evolving from quantity to quality growth and diversify must be our choice, it is 

what will define us and it is what will ensure the survival of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, now more than ever, we must ensure that the Cok Islands’ voice is clear, that our 

</span><span>national  priorities  are  understood  and  our  international  engagements  are  built  on  genuine 

partnerships centered on respect for sovereignty and mutual benefit that will deliver for our people 

now and into the future. 

</span></div><div><span>Our voyage to Statehood has not been an easy one but it was a path worth taking.  It is a journey 

</span><span>we’ve ta</span><span>ken with courage, foresight, determination and a conviction that for our children to thrive 

into the future, we must chart our own course.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>With  that  same  mindset  and  determination,  the  Cook  Islands,  deliver  for  our  people,  tangible 

outcomes  and  workable  solutions  for  some  of  the  bespoke  challenges  we  face.    To  ensure  the 

security and prosperity of our people, let us renew our focus and be guided by the NSDA2020+. 

</span></div><div><span>I take this time to thank the many people who contributed to the development of the NSDA2020+, 

including those NGOs, businesses, the Church, our traditional leaders, development partners and 

our public service.  Thank you for your commitment and efforts, in service of our people.  The 

power of partnership lies not in what we receive, but what we build together. 

</span></div><div><span>The NSDA2020+ highlights our people’s priorities, and we welcome development partners who 

</span><span>would like to support and help us deliver on our 100-year vision of national wellbeing.  The Cook 

Islands, through our engagements continue to  see international  partnerships that are committed 

through voice and action, to genuine collaboration and delivering transformative outcomes for our 

people. 

</span></div><div><span>The Cook Islands as a people, a country and in its international persona, has developed and matured 

in the 60 years since 1965.  In those 60 years, together we have built a nation that in 1973, had a 

GDP  of  USD$747  per  capita,  to  one  that  today,  we  can  proudly  say  is  currently  sitting  at 

USD$17,033 per capita (data.un.org), from 0 diplomatic partners to 67, from not being able to do 

much in our own right, to joining over 40 international organisations and being a party to over 150 

treaties,  conventions  and  protocols,  in  our  own  right.    This  is  a  testament  to  our  adaptation, 

evolution, resilience and determination as a people and as a country. 

</span></div><div><span>In closing, what I would like you, to have taken away from this address today; where I want us to 

get to as Members of Parliament; and as it is relevant for your own interactions; to approach and 

consider  the  Cook  Islands  as  a  country,  a  people,  small  and  determined  enough  to  make  bold 

decisions quickly, agile enough to accept the need to take calculated risk and push boundaries, 

ready  to  solidify  opportunities  beyond  a  single  industry-based  economy,  and  with  a  leadership 

deeply committed to serving the needs of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>With enduring relationships and transformative partnerships, we know we can make it work. 

</span></div><div><span>I thank you all for your attention and I look forward to our collective celebrations of this 60</span><span>th</span><span> year 

</span><span>of our self-governance in free association with New Zealand.  Much work remains to be done if 

we are to ensure the security and prosperity of our nation </span><span>–</span><span> our lands, our ocean, our people </span><span>–</span><span> past, 

present and future. 

</span></div><div><span>With that Mr Speaker, I only have to say, Cook Islands, to stand firm.  Kia Orana and all the best 

</span><span>to us all. 

</span></div><div><span>I now lay my Statement on the Table. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  We have now come to question time for 30 

</span><span>minutes and the Floor is now open to Honourable Members.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti 

Tuta; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Please Mr Speaker, if I can be allowed to speak on behalf 

of our bereavement.  On behalf of the Parliament of the Cook Islands, Speaker of Parliament and 

everyone here in this Parliamentary House, we would like to convey our condolences to the family 

of Papa Tauira Nikoia.  We all know that this Papa used to be a great agricultural person in our 

country.    As  for  his  programme,  later  on  today  at  4  p.m.,  his  body  will  be  returned  home  in 

Titikaveka.  His funeral will be held tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., at his residential place.  Thank 

you very much.  Therefore, our condolences to the entire family of Papa Tauira Nikoia. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have a question for the Honourable Prime Minister.  There was some news published 

in the newspaper regarding a huge debt of this country.  I believe, we are in debt by over $1 million.  

Therefore, my question is, what is the status with our reserved fund and also, what is the status 

about allocating some funds for a revolving fund? 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I supported the proposal by the budget team regarding the revolving fund, which I 

strongly supported.  That is my question to the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you for the question from the Honourable 

Member.  As we will be tabling the Supplementary Budget shortly, Mr Speaker, the question raised 

by  the  Honourable  Member  will  be  more  adequately  answered  and  fully  answered  during  the 

debate on the Supplementary Budget where we can provide much more accurate figures to what 

he is asking for than what I am able to just pull off from the top of my head. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I agree with you; we will wait for the 

Supplementary Budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone this afternoon.  

Members on the other side of the House, Members on this side of the House, staff members of 

</span><span>Parliament,  everyone  here  within  this  Honourable  House  and  those  outside,  our  friends  in  the 

Public Gallery area; Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>This morning, we all knew that there was a protest and I would like to thank this Honourable House 

for  accepting  our  request  and  for  receiving  our  people  who  had  marched  to  the  front  of  the 

</span><span>Parliament building.  When the protest march concluded the media reporters from Rarotonga and 

also  from  New Zealand  and they were asking individual  persons what  their opinions are.  The 

person who came to  ask me a question and this was his question, why do you think the Prime 

Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister did not come to Parliament?  The only Parliamentarians 

</span><span>who  appeared  was  Minister  Vaine  Mokoroa,  Minister  Tingika  Elikana  and  the  Member  of 

</span><span>Parliament Sonny Williams.   My reply  to  him was, that he should go and ask them personally 

becau</span><span>se I don’t know why they did not appear.</span></div><div><span>819

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>A </span><span>māmā</span><span> came to see me and she said, it is very disrespectful of the government to not come and 

meet our people and tell us what are their thoughts.  So, here is the question Prime Minister why 

is it that you could not spare a half hour to meet with our people who wanted to raise some issues 

with government? 

</span><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister; you have the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for 

</span><span>the question.  We had a team effort in this morning’s progra</span><span>m where we would share the work 

load.  We were advised that there would be no speaking opportunity for the government, therefore 

part of our team came to Parliament to welcome the protestors and mindful that today was the 

tabling of our Budget and having just returned last night, Mr Speaker my time was consumed with 

preparing the Ministerial Statement to address our people as a result of this protest march where I 

knew I would be afforded appropriate time to be able to speak freely. 

</span></div><div><span>In addition, Mr Speaker I was taking the time this morning also to prepare for the Budget Speech 

that again will be delivered today here in Parliament.  But that is not to say that we are dismissing 

</span><span>the protest march or disrespecting the protestors.  We welcome everybody’s oppor</span><span>tunity to place 

their  protest  before  the  Parliament  and  as  a  government  and  as  a  Parliament,  we  have  heard 

numerous over the past 15 years various protests that have come before our Parliament and I recall, 

Mr Speaker the protest march on the purse sein fishing, the taxation protest on the increase of our 

VAT and taxation of pension, the protest of the Grey Power and also the protest of the helmet 

legislation  and  there  were  people  who  had  very  strong  views  against  the  decision  that  the 

government took on all of these issues.  But when carefully analysed, Mr Speaker people began to 

understand that the decision we made was in the benefit of them and all of our people and I have 

every confidence, Mr Speaker that when the details of our action plan are provided for open and 

free discussions, people will see the benefits that clearly will emanate from this. 

</span></div><div><span>So, as I said in my Ministerial Statement, Mr Speaker we have seen and we have heard and we 

have listened to our people and we have understood the need for more consultation that has been 

asked for and this, Mr Speaker is something that we definitely will be committing to.  Thank you, 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Minister Elikana and you 

</span><span>have the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I want to clarify that I was fully aware of the absence of the 

Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.  They informed me yesterday that, due to important 

commitments,  they  would  not  be  present  when  the  protestors  gathered  here  at  Parliament.    As 

</span><span>Minister  Responsible  for  Parliamentary  Services,  I  assured  them  that  I  would  convey  their 

apologies to the protestors who would be attending.  I sincerely hope that in the future, we will be 

given the chance to respond to the statements made by protestors, whether from the government 

side or the opposing side.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Leader of the Opposition.

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>Thank you for your answer Prime Minister and Minister.  It 

would  have  been  helpful  if  the  Ministerial  Statements  were  provided  before  it  was  read  today 

because it would then given us an opportunity to ask you questions regarding those statements.   

</span></div><div><span>From your speech however, Prime Minister one of the things that you, to me seem to emphasise 

transparency, consultation, open dialogue.  But that is the very issue that our people have, the lack 

of transparency, the lack of consultation and the secrecy. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, are you going to ask a question or carry on? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Yes, I will ask the question and the question is what is it that 

you mean by being transparent, consulting and open dialogue when that is the very issue that we 

have at the moment?  And while I am on my feet then you say that once we have had a chance to 

have a look at the agreement and release it, we will be consulting, welcoming consultation at that 

point; what is there to consult with when the agreement has been signed? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Members, I think it is time to interrupt our session.  It is time for 

recess and once we come back I would like to ask the Hon. Prime Minister to reply to the question.  

The Sitting is suspended until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, I think it is time for a break.  When we reconvene, I would like to ask the 

Honourable Prime Minister to respond to the question.  The Sitting is now suspended until 3.15 

p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please be seated.  Before we took the adjournment, a question was asked to the 

Prime Minister and therefore, I give him this opportunity for his answer. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  And I would like to take the opportunity to explain 

to the Members of this House and to our public the approach that we took in developing this action 

</span><span>plan for closer strategic partnership with the people of the Republic of China.  And to counter the 

allegation that this has been done without transparency and even worst by some quarters that this 

has been done in secret. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me refer you, Mr Speaker, to previous agreements that our country signed with New Zealand 

</span><span>and with Australia.  Those agreements Mr Speaker were signed on the basis of losing our National 

Sustai</span><span>nable Development Plan as the foundation for areas that we’ve identified as priorities for 

</span><span>our country.   Consultation, Mr Speaker was very heavily evident in the development of our NSDP.  

This is not the Government plan Mr Speaker but rather this is the C</span><span>ook Islands’ people plan.</span></div><div><span>The  lengthy  consultation  that  took  place  to  develop  our  NSDP  involved  the  NGO  groups,  the 

private  sector,  government  agencies,  traditional  leaders,  the  RAC  and  numerous  other  Cook 

Islands community groups.  In this development pl</span><span>an, Mr Speaker, there’s “kaveinga nui” is the

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>voice and the choice of our people.  When we come to the development of our agreements with 

other countries.  The first one with New Zealand, this was done in 2022.  The two governments 

had a meeting, and it was determined the areas the two can work in partnership.  And it was written 

</span><span>in a contract agreement, it is called the ‘Vaka Haurua’ or the ‘Vaka Purua’ –</span><span> double hull canoe. 

</span></div><div><span>The  two  governments  signed  the  contract  agreement  and  then  given  to  the  public,  the  people.  

There was no measure of consultation in the development and the negotiation of that agreement 

because the voice of the people was captured in the foundation document that we used to negotiate 

with New Zealand and that was our NSDP. 

</span></div><div><span>The same with Australia, later that same year 2022, the two-government met responsible for the 

foreign  affairs  division  in  their  different  countries.    They  discussed  and  they  identified  and 

determined the areas where both governments can work together.  It was returned to our Cabinet 

and received and accepted by our Cabinet.  The two governments signed the contract and it was 

released  to  the  public.    Both  of  these  documents  are  right  before  me  now,  Mr  Speaker,  easily 

available online. 

</span></div><div><span>And if anybody is interested, it sets out the areas of cooperation between our countries with New 

Zealand  and  with  Australia.    It  is  from  this  documents,  Mr  Speaker  that  will  emanate  the  key 

specific projects that our two countries will enter into.  This provides the framework, Mr Speaker, 

for  areas  of  cooperation  and  collaboration  with  these  two  countries.    This  is  exactly  the  same 

</span><span>approach we have taken with the People’s Republic of China.  We have made no secret of the fact 

</span><span>that we want to enter into a strategic partnership agreement.  And as I have mentioned in previous 

communications  in  the  media,  this  is  something  that  we  have  been  in  discussion  with  our  key 

partners since last year. 

</span></div><div><span>Our officials have been in formal and informal discussions with their counterparts over the last 

year.  In our previous agreement we signed, Mr Speaker, we did not share the details of our </span><span>Vaka 

Haurua, Vaka Purua</span><span> with the government of Australia.  And we did not share the agreements we 

were in discussion with Australia or Tumanava agreement with New Zealand.  But until the two 

governments were happy with the final document and they were signed off, then we were able to 

share these documents. 

</span></div><div><span>I can confirm with our team that the discussions and negotiations on our part on the final language 

and the final wordings in parts of our agreement were reached only on the day of the actual signing 

with our comprehensive strategic partnership with China.  To correct the misinformation that is 

going around on social media by commentators here, that this agreement was already signed before 

we even left to go to China was totally wrong.  And to answer the question of the Leader of the 

</span><span>Opposition, as a lawyer herself, she should be aware that how can you be transparent about an 

agreement that it still under negotiation and even yet to be signed. 

</span></div><div><span>But I can say, Mr Speaker, that within this agreement, there is one area that we should be proud of 

</span><span>with  our  officials  in  their  negotiations  on  the  final  wording  of  this  document.    And  this  is  a 

</span><span>concession that the People’s Republ</span><span>ic of China agreed to and that is at any project that does take 

place  under  this  agreement  within  the  Cook  Islands  shall  fall  under  Cook  Islands  law.  

Furthermore, it shall follow the procurement policies of the Cook Islands.  This Mr Speaker is a

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 February 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>concession  that  we  have  managed  that  no  other  pacific  island  country  has  managed.    And  the 

reason behind it, Mr Speaker, is very simple.  We are seen as a jurisdiction that obeys the rule of 

law.  We are seen as a jurisdiction that is able to pay its debts.  We are seen as a country that is 

solid and reliable.  That is why we have been able to get those concessions, Mr Speaker, something 

that we should be proud of our team for being able to negotiate on our behalf.  

</span></div><div><span>What we followed, Mr Speaker is the proper diplomatic protocol when two countries enter into 

agreements with each other.  And we have done everything in proper standards and requirements 

as a sovereign state.  I look forward to, Mr Speaker, these documents agreements being put online 

so that they will be made available for everybody to consider. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Members, sorry but we have come to the end of our Question Time.  

As for the Leader of the United Party, you may answer your question when we come back on 

Monday.  Thank you, Honourable Members.
