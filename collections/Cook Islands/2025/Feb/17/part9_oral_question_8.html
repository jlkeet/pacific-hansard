<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>Thank you for your answer Prime Minister and Minister.  It 

would  have  been  helpful  if  the  Ministerial  Statements  were  provided  before  it  was  read  today 

because it would then given us an opportunity to ask you questions regarding those statements.   

</span></div>
<div><span>From your speech however, Prime Minister one of the things that you, to me seem to emphasise 

transparency, consultation, open dialogue.  But that is the very issue that our people have, the lack 

of transparency, the lack of consultation and the secrecy. 

</span></div>
