<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone this afternoon.  

Members on the other side of the House, Members on this side of the House, staff members of 

</span><span>Parliament,  everyone  here  within  this  Honourable  House  and  those  outside,  our  friends  in  the 

Public Gallery area; Kia Orana.   

</span></div>
<div><span>This morning, we all knew that there was a protest and I would like to thank this Honourable House 

for  accepting  our  request  and  for  receiving  our  people  who  had  marched  to  the  front  of  the 

</span><span>Parliament building.  When the protest march concluded the media reporters from Rarotonga and 

also  from  New Zealand  and they were asking individual  persons what  their opinions are.  The 

person who came to  ask me a question and this was his question, why do you think the Prime 

Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister did not come to Parliament?  The only Parliamentarians 

</span><span>who  appeared  was  Minister  Vaine  Mokoroa,  Minister  Tingika  Elikana  and  the  Member  of 

</span><span>Parliament Sonny Williams.   My reply  to  him was, that he should go and ask them personally 

becau</span><span>se I don’t know why they did not appear.</span></div>

<div><span>Twelfth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>A </span><span>māmā</span><span> came to see me and she said, it is very disrespectful of the government to not come and 

meet our people and tell us what are their thoughts.  So, here is the question Prime Minister why 

is it that you could not spare a half hour to meet with our people who wanted to raise some issues 

with government? 

</span><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister; you have the floor.
