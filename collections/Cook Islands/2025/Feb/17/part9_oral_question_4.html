<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you for the question from the Honourable 

Member.  As we will be tabling the Supplementary Budget shortly, Mr Speaker, the question raised 

by  the  Honourable  Member  will  be  more  adequately  answered  and  fully  answered  during  the 

debate on the Supplementary Budget where we can provide much more accurate figures to what 

he is asking for than what I am able to just pull off from the top of my head.
