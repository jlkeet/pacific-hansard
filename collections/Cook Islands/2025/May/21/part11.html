<div><span>CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS OF PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 188 

</span></div><div><span>Report on a proposal to recognise the Cook Islands as a Christian 

Nation 

</span></div><div><span>I  call  the  Chairperson  for  the  Special  Select  Committee  on  Religious  Organisations,  the 

Honourable Tingika Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Before I move a Motion regarding this Report, I 

would like to thank the members of this Committee.  First, to the Leader of the Opposition, Tina 

Pupuke Browne, who serves as the Deputy Chairperson.  I also appreciate the support from the 

Honourable  Minister  representing  the  RAPPA  constituency,  Honourable  Albert  Nicholas;  the 

Member from Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara, Tereapii Maki-Kavana; the Member from Matavera, 

Vaitoti  Tupa;  the  Member  from  Ruaau,  Tim  Varu;  and  lastly,  the  Member  from  Amuri/Ureia, 

Toanui Isamaela.   

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank the staff from Parliamentary Services for your support in assisting the 

Select Committee and for your patience in accommodating our requests.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to note that our main Churches are well represented on this Committee.  

I believe their appointments were made due to their connections with the Churches.  There are four 

members  from  the  CICC,  including  myself,  Deputy  Chairperson  Tina  Pupuke  Browne,  Vaitoti 

Tupa, and Toanui Isamaela.  Minister Albert Nicholas represents the Catholic Church, Tereapii 

Maki-Kavana represents  the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and Tim  Varu represents  the LDS 

Church. 

</span></div><div><span>I want  our people to  be  aware of the Committee Members and the Churches they represent.    I 

believe each member has dedicated their utmost to support this committee. 

</span></div><div><span>We now have the Report before us, and while I do not want to go through the merits at this moment, 

I believe it is important to table it before we engage in further discussions.  I would like to say that 

</span><span>we have reached a conclusion, and this Report reflects the outcomes we have gathered from the 

public consultation. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, we believe that the recommendation presented to us for consideration is inappropriate, as 

</span><span>the Preamble of our Constitution clarifies our identity as a Christian Nation.  I would like to share 

</span><span>this with everyone, “In the Name of God Almighty, His love is endless and there is no end and we 

</span><span>the people of the Cook Islands declare that we do follow Christian belief and to apply the Cook 

Island custom and as outlined by the law to remind us that the Sabbath remain a Holy day and that

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>day in the week according to each person’s belief as the day of the Lord”.  For the benefit of our 

</span><span>people listening in, I feel it is important to read the relevant passage from our Constitution in the 

Preamble. 

</span></div><div><span>It  states, “In the Holy Name of God the Almighty,  the ever loving and the everlasting, we the 

</span><span>people of the Cook Islands recognizing the heritage of Christian principles, Cook Islands custom 

and the rule of law, remember to keep Holy the Sabbath day being that day of the week which 

</span><span>according to a person’s belief and conscience is the Sabbath of the Lord”.  This is why we believe 

</span><span>it clearly demonstrates to the world that the Cook Islands is a Christian Nation. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, if we adhere to the recommendations proposed, we would be in violation of Article 64 

of the Constitution, which outlines the rights of our people.  While we have reached a decision, it 

is also noted in the recommendations that the Secretary of Justice should be given the opportunity 

to review the legislation concerning Churches that are seeking to establish themselves in the Cook 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Because  we  have  identified  and  organised  a  group  known  as  the  RAC  (Religious  Advisory 

Council), they have no legal standing under the laws of our country. 

</span></div><div><span>Consequently, we have recommended to the Secretary of Justice the establishment of laws for the 

formation  of  Churches.    This  will  empower  the  relevant  body  to  engage  with  the  Secretary  of 

Justice and the public during their consultations and inquiries.  Mr Speaker, I would like to share 

some of the recommendations that have been presented to the Committee.   

</span></div><div><span>In accordance with Standing Order 156 (1), I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament take note of the Report for the Special Select Committee on Religious 

Organisations on a proposal to recognise the Cook Islands as a Christian Nation 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Chairperson.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Pupuke Browne 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is now open to speakers. 

</span></div><div><span>I can see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I rise to support the Motion put to the House by the 

Chairperson of the Select Committee.  I would like to provide a brief explanation to support the 

report of the Select Committee.  

</span></div><div><span>On page 14 of the report, there are recommendations submitted by the Committee regarding the 

Religious Organisations Restrictions Act 1975.  These recommendations were made during the 

Committee's consultation with the Cook Islands Christian Church, even though the Church did not 

specifically mention this Act.  Nonetheless, we believe it is important to propose that the Minister 

considers the principles of that Act as well.  

</span></div><div><span>In fact, we have concluded that the Minister should repeal this legislation, as it does not align with 

our  Constitution.    We  recommend  that  the  Minister  propose  a  new  legislation  to  outline  the 

religious standing in our nation.  Additionally, we suggest that legislation be created to address the 

RAC.  As mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee, the Minister must consult with the RAC 

before making any decisions.  

</span></div><div><span>However, we have discovered that the RAC council is not registered.  This issue is not isolated; 

other legislation, including the Immigration Act, also fails to mention the RAC.  Therefore, it is 

important that the Minister reviews and carefully examines the relevant legislation.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  work  of  this  hardworking 

Parliamentary Committee.  We now see the challenges and obstacles that we have uncovered today 

concerning the body that has been operating for 60 years.  This is a good example of a stepping 

stone for us, and we must give praise to the Lord for what we are endeavouring today.  I support 

the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition and also by the Committee, to legislate the 

RAC council.  I believe this is one of the Principal Acts that we should pursue to give thanks to 

them for their hard work. 

</span></div><div><span>We also acknowledge their efforts.  The reason, Mr Speaker, is that there are still organisations 

</span><span>within our nation that do not  accept  our flag, our anthem,  and our customs.   This  has been an 

</span><span>ongoing issue, particularly for myself.  We have accepted organisations that, in turn, do not accept 

</span><span>our flag and national anthem.  This is a significant concern for our people, especially for those 

</span><span>migrating and foreigners, as it affects them as well.  It has been a long-standing issue, and it is 

time for us to correct these matters and declare that we are a Christian nation. 

</span></div><div><span>We  are  doing  exceptionally  well  with  the  established  religions,  the  CICC,  SDA,  Catholic,  and 

Mormon faiths, along with their breakaway denominations, which have not posed a problem.  Mr 

</span></div><div><span>936

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Speaker, I express my gratitude to our forefathers who went out of their way to share the gospel, 

particularly in the year 1878, and took it to Papua New Guinea and other places.  Our forefathers, 

who  were  missionaries  from  the  islands  of  Mangaia  and  Aitutaki,  played  significant  roles  in 

spreading the gospel to the outside world, including the nation of Papua New Guinea.  

</span></div><div><span>Now, I believe there are 16 or 18 other denominations in our country.  The question here is why 

those  groups  did  not  go  to  Papua  New  Guinea  when  there  are  still  people  there  who  have  not 

accepted Christianity.  As mentioned by the Honourable Minister, I believe this is a very important 

message that aligns with our Daily Bread, especially as we reflect on the past few days.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  this  is  a  challenge  to  us  as  Members  of  Parliament  in  this  House  to  consider  the 

Immigration Act  and to  support the RAC in the positive contributions they are making for our 

country.  Our daily Verse for today is very fitting, showing God's care for the people and the nation.  

I  also  believe  that  this  is  appropriate  as  we  head  into  next  year,  when  we  can  call  ourselves  a 

Christian Nation.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  I would like to thank the Honourable Members in the House.  I believe that 

the recommendations in the Report are supported.  I just want to share some thoughts.  I would 

like  to  thank  this  committee  for  opening  their  scope  to  a  wider  sight  and  not  just  limiting 

themselves to what they were originally tasked to do.  They have encouraged the suggestion to 

create new legislation that the Minister should pursue. 

</span></div><div><span>I think it is appropriate for us to reflect on what we have been discussing over the years regarding 

the three pillars of our country, the traditional leaders, the Government, and the Religious Advisory 

Council that oversees the churches.  The Ui Ariki Act has been passed, along with the assistance 

from the government, which we all recognise but will not go into right now.  As for the Religious 

Advisory Council, we often talk about their role within our organisations, yet we fail to provide 

</span><span>them  with  necessary  assistance.    Instead,  we  frequently  ask  them  to  pray  for  the  country.  

</span><span>Therefore, I believe it is about time we support the establishment of this body and allocate an office 

</span><span>for  them  to  manage  their  affairs.    It  may  also  be  fitting  for  them  to  be  placed  under  the 

</span><span>responsibility of the Prime Minister to ensure their well-being. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, we have already submitted our report with recommendations as part of this budget.  We 

have also heard the Prime Minister's Statement regarding the revival of the Law Commission to 

</span><span>review our legislation.  Perhaps the Law Commission can determine whether this can be included 

</span><span>in the Constitution or enacted as another piece of legislation.  In reflecting on the discussions in

</span></div><div><span>the House, it appears that God is  always ahead  of us, and we are simply  trying to  catch up.  I 

believe it is appropriate for us to give our support to this organisation.  That is all I have to share. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I put the Question.
