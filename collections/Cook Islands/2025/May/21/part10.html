</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to express my gratitude to the three 

pillars of our country, including our Head of State, His Excellency Sir Tom Marsters and Lady 

Marsters.  I would also like to express my gratitude for our Chiefs on each individual island, 

along with your tribes and traditional leaders.  Additionally, my appreciation extends to our 

religious denominations and the Executive branch, including all Members of Parliament present 

in this House.  I must not forget to acknowledge the island governments in the Outer Islands, as 

well as the mayors and island council members.  Kia Orana to you all, in the Name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it is an honour to be here today to present our Government Budget for 2025, our key 

financing mechanism designed to support and guide more sustainable growth of our economy.  It 

is  also  my  great  privilege,  Mr  Speaker  to  present  this,  my  15</span><span>th</span><span>  Budget  in  my  capacity  as  the 

Minister of Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this year we celebrate more than a milestone.  We also celebrate our identity, our 

resilience and our future.  Over the past 60 years, the evolution of our National Budget tells the 

story of the Cook Islands growth as a self-governing nation.  In our early years we laid the ground 

work with what limited resources were available, investing in essential services like roads, schools 

and health care whilst also leaning on the generous support of our development partners. 

</span></div><div><span>As  challenges  arose,  we  responded  with  courage  and  reform,  adapting  and  strengthening  our 

financial management and ensuring that every dollar was used wisely.  Through these challenging 

times, Mr Speaker, there were important lessons that have helped shape our financial management 

as  we  became  more  aware  of  the  consequences  of  unsustainable  government  spending  and 

oversized  public  service,  and  accumulated  debt.    The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic 

Management has produced a series o</span><span>f videos called the ‘Legacy Series’ to help educate and remind 

our people of the highs and lows that have shaped this nation’s economic history.</span></div><div><span>In my last Budget Speech, I mentioned that in our 2019 Half-Year Economic and Fiscal Update, 

it painted a bright future for our next four years.  We were on track to see our national income; our 

GDP surpass $600 million.  But then of course, COVID struck.  But I am pleased to say that we 

are back on track to reaching our $600 million in real GDP in this financial year.  We all understand 

how significantly this affected our livelihood and we should never forget that as a government, we 

worked hard to keep our economy moving and to support its recovery.  Thanks to strong fiscal 

</span><span>stewardship in the years following COVID-19, our financial position has strengthened, allowing 

us to look ahead and continue making important investments for our country and our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our 2024 Budget, which carried the theme 

</span><span>“Perseverance”.    It  was  a  fitting  word  for  a  time  when  our  nation  was  still  emerging  from  the 

</span><span>shadows of COVID-19, facing global economic uncertainty and working hard to steady the path 

forward.  The perseverance demonstrated by our people and our businesses and our institutions 

carried us through these tough times.  It allowed us not only to stabilise, but more importantly, to 

grow. 

</span></div><div><span>Our tourism sector, Mr Speaker, saw a strong visitor arrival during 2024 calendar year reaching 

over  170,391  tourists,  demonstrating  the  success  of  our  airline  route  development  program  in 

broadening where our tourists come from.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The  2024  Budget  last  year  was  designed  to  reinforce  the  gains  made  towards  full  economic 

</span><span>recovery,  and  this  was  guided  by  the  government’s  Medium  Term  Fiscal  St</span><span>rategy  where  we 

prioritised for the upcoming years which included addressing staff recruitment and retention to 

ease the pressure on government services, improving water infrastructure, particularly in the Outer 

Islands, upgrading our data systems to better identify issues and support solutions and addressing 

infrastructure  needs  to  boost  safety,  wellbeing  and  service  efficiency.    It  was  a  reflecting  of 

</span><span>government’s ongoing commitment to fiscal responsibility.</span></div><div><span>Before I present this year’s Budget, Mr Speake</span><span>r, which reflects on our 60-year journey of self-

governance and continues our commitment to our people, I must express our deep gratitude to our 

development partners.  

</span></div><div><span>I extend a special thank you Mr. Speaker, to the Asian Development Bank, Japan, China, the Green 

Climate Fund, and also the Global Environment Facility for their continued support. I also extend 

my appreciation to the Government of Australia for their continued support through the Australia 

Cook Islands Partnership Program (ACPP).  

</span></div><div><span>Lastly Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, we are taking time this year to celebrate and to reflect 

on our 60-year journey of self-governance, and as part of this I want to acknowledge our longest 

serving development partner, New Zealand and their continued support to our country during this 

journey.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the theme for the 2025 Budget is “</span><span>Investing in our people</span><span>” or Akamauruuru’anga i to 

</span><span>tatou Iti Tangata. 

</span></div><div><span>This Budget is a result of the strong fiscal stewardship over the last couple of years coming out of 

the COVID-19 pandemic. Our fiscal position has improved enough that we are now able to look 

forward and make important investments in our people. 

</span></div><div><span>In October last year, 2024, the Public Sector Leaders’ Conference brought together senior officials 

</span><span>from across the Government to identify and establish priorities for the 2025 Budget process, guided 

</span><span>by the National Sustainable Development Agenda framework. 

</span></div><div><span>These discussions highlighted that priority areas for government resourcing were: developing our 

</span><span>people and workforce; strengthening the education system and career pathways; investing in health 

</span><span>and wellbeing; and adopting new technology. Our Budget 2025 delivers on these priorities.  

</span></div><div><span>A sustainable and resilient society, Mr Speaker, also looks after its most vulnerable. So, investing 

</span><span>in our people includes providing adequate social supports for people in times of need. This Budget 

</span><span>funds the roll-out of our Social Assistance Policy 2024 which includes increased welfare payments 

and  better  leave  entitlements  to  working  parents  in  the  private  sector.  There  is  also  funding  to 

address concerns with public sector pay scales and bringing them up to date with inflation, so that 

</span></div><div><span>925 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>we  can  recruit,  retain  and  develop  the  government  workforce,  with  a  focus  on  attracting  and 

retaining  Cook  Islanders  wherever  possible.  Mr  Speaker,  we  are  also  making  significant 

investments, particularly in our Police so they are properly equipped to carry out their duties. 

</span></div><div><span>Investing in our people means ensuring equitable access to high-quality healthcare and education, 

so  that  people  can  contribute  productively  to  our  society.  This  Budget  is  making  significant 

investments in health equipment and technology, to expand and improve health services; and also, 

in teacher training.  

</span></div><div><span>Capital investments will also make a major contribution to the wellbeing of our people, across 

Rarotonga and the Pa Enua. We are funding significant capital works to upgrade sea, air and road 

links, to improve connectivity and economic opportunities. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the investments in this Budget have been made possible by our fiscal responsibility 

in prudence over the last three years. We have successfully navigated our economy through the 

stormy waters of the COVID-19 period. And more recently, we have also been paying down debt, 

so that we are in a strong and prudent fiscal position and prepared for the uncertain times that lie 

ahead. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today’s Budget shows the results of the hard work th</span><span>at we have done to rebuild our 

economy. National GDP has continued to recover strongly, and has now reached around the target 

level that we have set in our Economic Recovery Roadmap. This is an important milestone, as it 

marks a return to the levels of economic activity that we last saw prior to the pandemic.  

</span></div><div><span>The strong growth in our economy, Mr Speaker has been driven by a resurgence in tourism. Visitor 

</span><span>arrivals numbers have been boosted by growth in ‘non</span><span>-</span><span>traditional’ markets, outside New Zealand, 

</span><span>and we are now exceeding the record levels that were set before the pandemic. In the year to March 

2025, visitor arrivals reached over 174,000, including over 39,000 visitors from Australia. 

</span></div><div><span>Other good news, Mr Speaker, is that inflation has been steadily dropping since its spike in 2022. 

</span><span>Annual  inflation has returned to  more usual growth rates, falling  to  3.1  per cent  in  the year to 

</span><span>December 2024. Inflation is forecast to continue at more modest rates, of 2.4 per cent this year 

</span><span>2025, and 2.8 per cent in next year 2026. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  I know that  there is  a need for more hearing of this wonderful great  news in  this 

</span><span>Budget, but I see it is time for our break and I will continue after our lunch break.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    It  is  time  for  our  break.    You  can 

continue when we return after the break.  I will suspend the Sitting until 3.15 p.m.

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>This  Sitting  now  resumes.    Before  we  had  the  adjournment,  the  Honourable 

Prime Minister was reading his Ministerial Statement and may I just remind the Members of this 

House, at his presentation this morning, I truly believe that our women were happy to listen to his 

Statement that was given to everyone present.  Now I ask him to continue with his Statement. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  As I left off Mr Speaker, we were talking 

about the Economic Outlook.  Our outlook is very positive.  Our tourism arrivals, especially from 

Australia and New Zealand are predicted to continue growing.  However, the growth will be at a 

more  moderate  pace,  as  capacity  constraints  in  the  airlines  and  the  accommodation  is  reached.  

This  will  be  reflected  in  economic  growth,  which  is  predicted  to  ease  to  annual  growth  of  8.4 

</span><span>percent this year and going on to 2.5 percent next year.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the bright outlook that we have there are some dark clouds to the gathering on the 

horizon.  The ongoing uncertainty in global trade policy, as the risk of geopolitical conflicts may 

have flow on effects to the Cook Islands economy.  This uncertainty is already having negative 

impacts  on  global  financial  markets,  investments  in  growth  and  we  are  not  immune  to  these 

impacts.  

</span></div><div><span>Our economy is highly exposed to external economic conditions.  A weaker global economy may 

flow through to our tourism sector, which could undermine our future growth.  Unfortunately, we 

may see higher inflation in imported goods prices, including from higher transport and logistics 

costs.  There is also potential for supply disruptions as global supply chains readjust to the new 

global tariffs.  

</span></div><div><span>However, Mr Speaker, we have been preparing for these uncertain times by ensuring our economic 

fundamentals are strong.  This includes taking a proactive approach to managing our debts and 

maintain a responsible fiscal position.  This is enabling us to make significant investments in the 

wellbeing and resilience of our people.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as we talk about “Investing in our people” I am reminded of a Verse from the book 

of First Peter 5:10, and it says, “And the God of all gr</span><span>ace who called you to his eternal glory in 

Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself restore you and make you strong, firm 

</span><span>and steadfast”.  </span></div><div><span>This verse Mr Speaker encourages us that although we may be suffering, that this suffering is only 

temporary.    The  growth  is  not  just  allowed  by  God,  but  he  started  the  growth.    We  are  now 

investing in our people so that we will continue to grow.  

</span></div><div><span>As we continue to navigate the challenges ahead, let us draw inspiration from these words and 

</span><span>remember  that  the  challenges  we  faced  were  to  test  us  and  that  those  challenges  provided  us 

strength and provided us with a deeper character.  

</span></div><div><span>927 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Throughout our history Mr Speaker, we have faced numerous setbacks, but through the grace of 

God we have come through and grown stronger, and these past years has been no different.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  as  we  look  at  this  year’s  Budget,  it  reflects  our  continued  commitment  to  fiscal 

</span><span>responsibility.  This budget maintains a balanced fiscal stance, meaning that we aim to spend only 

what we bring in, avoiding any unnecessary debt.  Maintaining this balance is crucial as it positions 

us to better withstand the future economic shocks or natural disasters without an over reliance on 

debt.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, managing our nation’s finances resp</span><span>onsibly means ensuring we have enough funds 

to handle unexpected challenges, such as being able to respond to another economic shock or a 

natural disaster.  It also means that we have the fiscal capacity to draw down on debts to respond 

if  we  need  to,  and  as  we  have  done  in  the  past.    The  strong  fiscal  responsibility  we  have 

demonstrated  over  the  past  three  years  is  evidence  of  our  commitment  to  ensuring  that  we  are 

ready for the next challenge which comes our way, whenever and whatever it is.  

</span></div><div><span>In say that Mr Speaker, we maintain active dialogue with our funding partners to find ways to 

effectively  manage  our  debt.    These  conversations  and  the  potential  outcomes  look  promising 

though  we  must  remain  cautious  with  our  spending.    our  net  debt  is  projected  to  decline 

significantly from $202 million or 27 percent of our GDP to $147 million or 18 percent of our 

GDP by 2028/29, reflecting both debt repayments and GDP growth.  

</span></div><div><span>Looking ahead Mr Speaker, nominal GDP is projected to grow steadily from $738 million this 

year to $823 million by 2028/29, creating a stable economic foundation for generating revenue 

and lowering our debt.  This economic growth Mr Speaker, combined with our prudent expenditure 

management is what underpins our fiscal strategy.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, i</span><span>n last year’s Budget Speech, I mentioned that this was not the time for austerity but 

</span><span>was  the  time  for  prudent  and  strategic  investment  or  stimulus,  and  the  fiscal  position  we  find 

ourselves in is a vindication of this approach.  While we did not increase expenditures much over 

the past three years, we made conscious choices not to embark on drastic cuts, and now we are 

seeing the fruit that this is borne.  In contrast we have seen the experience of countries making 

drastic budget cuts.  More often than not, it tends to make things worse, what we call economic 

</span><span>scaring.  One of the biggest consequences of austerity Mr Speaker for us here is that we lose our 

people, mainly to New Zealand or Australia, and we have seen it before and we all know people 

who have lived it.  Therefore, to continue investing in our people remains a commitment for this 

Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>In  summary,  Mr  Speaker,  our  fiscal  outlook  tells  us  that  government  is  in  a  good  position  to 

maintain  financial  stability  over  the  medium-term.    This  is  due  to  consistent  revenue  growth, 

controlled spending, a declining debt-to-GDP ratio, and making sure that we abide by the fiscal 

rules. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I now share with you some of the key initiatives that we have in this Budget that 

shows just how we plan on investing in our people.   

</span></div><div><span>928 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>In this Budget, we are increasing our funding for the Police Force to address long-standing staffing 

challenges.    Over  the  past  few  years,  our  Police  force  has  faced  persistent  shortages  that  have 

stretched their capacity and impacted their ability to serve our communities at full strength.  We 

recognise that policing is no easy task, it demands dedication, resilience and a deep sense of public 

duty.    I  want  to  take  this  moment  to  welcome  the  new  Police  Leadership  and  commend  every 

individual who chooses to wear the uniform and uphold the safety and wellbeing of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, to support recruitment and retention efforts, and to strengthen the overall capacity of 

our Police services, we are increasing funding by $1.1 million per year over the next four years.  

This  is  on  top  of  the  government-wide  phased  pay  scale  adjustments  and  these  funds  will  be 

directed towards addressing critical needs to ensure that our Police is well-equipped to meet the 

growing demands of public safety. 

</span></div><div><span>Teacher training, Mr Speaker, we understand the important role that our teachers have in guiding 

the next generation and giving them the skills to succeed in life for all of us.  But in order for 

teachers to truly fulfil this role and provide the highest quality of education to our children, we 

must  first  invest  in  them.    That  is  why,  in  this  Budget,  we  have  committed  to  an  increase  of 

$310,000 this financial year and a total of $1.2 million over four years to continue support for the 

</span><span>‘Teachers Training Program’.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we acknowledge that it is hard for some people, particularly our young people to find 

their footing when it </span><span>comes to investing in their first home.  Without doubt this is one ‘driver’ that 

pushes our young people to seek prosperity overseas.  To help with this, we are rolling out a “First 

Home  Builders  grant”.    This  initiative  locks  in  $630,000  over  four  years  </span><span>to  provide  targeted 

assistance to first home buyers who otherwise would be unable to build their first home.  This is 

the first such initiative since the early Housing Corporation days that was set up in 1978 to provide 

housing.    This  government  continues  to  be  responsive  to  changing  development  needs  when 

fiscally possible. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  a  well-functioning  public  service  supports  everything  from  infrastructure  and 

education  to  public  health  and  safety,  all  of  which  are  essential  to  building  a  strong  economy.  

Currently, some government agencies are still on the 2017 pay structure, while others are still on 

the 2019 pay structure.  This needs to be addressed so there is a consistency across all our agencies.  

</span><span>In support of this, we are committing $5.9 million to support a whole-of-government pay scale 

adjustment.  This will be done in a phased approach and is expected to reach full implementation 

</span><span>by 2027, two years’ time.  Of the adjustments provided, $492,000 is allocated for this year and 

</span><span>$4.7  million  over  four  years  towards  addressing  salary  adjustments  of  Island  Governments.  

Funding provisions over the four years totals $49.7 million. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Law Commission Act of 2007 was established to promote the regular review and 

improvement  of  our  laws,  ensuring  they  serve  the  Cook  Islands  effectively.    Through  this 

Commission,  we  will  continually  assess  our  legal  system,  recommend  necessary  reforms,  and 

</span><span>provide guidance to ensure our laws are clear, fair, and accessible.  Areas that require attention 

</span><span>include electoral reform, criminal procedures, our approach to intellectual property, and the legal 

frameworks  affecting  land,  trade,  and  even  cannabis.    Mr  Speaker,  our  agencies  have  also 

identified parts of the law that need updating, and it is crucial that we  remain aligned with our 

</span></div><div><span>929 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>international obligations.  The Law Commission’s role will be vital in guiding these reviews and 

</span><span>supporting the ongoing development of laws that meet the needs and values of our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>I turn to Pa Enua transport, Mr Speaker.  In 2023, we approved the Domestic Shipping Roadmap 

which detailed the establishment of a government-operated fleet to serve the people in the Northern 

and Southern group islands.  I am pleased to say that we have secured two vessels, one from Japan 

which will be due here in March next year, and one from China which will be due here in July.  

</span><span>These vessels are an essential lifeline for our communities and this Budget continues government’s 

</span><span>$2  million  investment  in  this  financial  year  towards  establishing  these  shipping  services.    Mr 

Speaker, this is a clear example of the benefits of what our country has done in actively diversifying 

our development partnerships or our relationships with key development partners. 

</span></div><div><span>As it becomes difficult to access development funding due to our country's graduated status, our 

government  has  taken  steps  to  broaden  our  international  engagement.    The  support  from  two 

</span><span>nations  for  our  shipping  needs  speaks  volumes  to  the  value  of  this  approach.    By  building 

</span><span>relationships with a wider network of trusted partners, we are ensuring that our infrastructure needs 

are met in ways that are important to us. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  these  actions  address  a  challenge  that  we  have  faced  for  far  too  long.    Domestic 

shipping faces high costs and limited demand, discouraging the private sector to invest and operate 

in this space, leading to inadequate shipping services in the Pa Enua.  The people of the Outer 

Islands feel these challenges most deeply.  When business is scarce, people must make do with 

solutions  that  are  simply  not  suitable,  using  old  ships  or  vessels  that  are  unfit  for  purpose.  

Communities cannot count on regular deliveries or safe shipping transport.  This bottleneck limits 

economic opportunity  and holds back development,  especially  for our  Northern Group islands.  

For these reasons, it was clear that a market-driven solution alone would not meet the needs of our 

people, and that is why we are taking direct action. 

</span></div><div><span>May  we  move  on  to  building  our  reserves,  Mr  Speaker,  we  remain  firmly  committed  to 

strengthening  our  financial  reserves  while  continuing  to  support  the  immediate  needs  of  our 

</span><span>people.   This includes a responsible plan to repay the loans we incurred during the pandemic and 

</span><span>create a clear path toward achieving fiscal surpluses.  We are also taking steps to ensure that our 

</span><span>stabilisation  account  and  loan  repayment  funds  are  adequately  resourced  to  meet  future 

</span><span>commitments.    Additionally,  we  are  progressing  our  work  towards  establishing  our  nation’s 

</span><span>Sovereign  Wealth  Fund,  to  build  our  reserves  so  that  we  are  financially  prepared  for  natural 

</span><span>disasters, economic shocks, and investing in our future generations.  Public consultation on the 

</span><span>Sovereign Wealth Fund gave clear guidance on its structure and objectives.  The Sovereign Wealth 

</span><span>Fund was desired to be independent of Government, invested responsibly for long-term growth, 

</span><span>and  to  provide  funds  in  the  future  for  key  wealth  categories  including  health,  education, 

</span><span>infrastructure and the climate, and to provide for resiliency against future disasters.

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  move  on  to  our  Capital  Investments.    The  Government  remains  committed  to 

prioritising  investment  in  physical  infrastructure  on  Rarotonga  and  the  Outer  Islands.    This 

approach recognises the vital role that well-developed infrastructure plays in supporting economic 

development, enhancing connectivity, and ensuring the wellbeing of our communities.  Our capital 

investments remain guided by the National Infrastructure Investment Plan and the Medium-Term 

Fiscal Strategy.  

</span></div><div><span>Over the next few years, Mr Speaker, capital works will ensure continued government investment 

while also supporting growth and better connectivity in the Outer Islands.  Even though our Outer 

Islands communities are small and remote, they deserve access to the basic standards of living. 

</span></div><div><span>A substantial amount of capital expenditure is coming from the Infrastructure Trust Fund, funded 

by New Zealand.  Significant capital projects, including the Manihiki Airport, also the Rarotonga 

Airport Runway End Safety Area project, and the Rarotonga Runway Slab Replacement, and also 

the Aitutaki Runway Extension, are currently being funded through the ITF.  This funding support 

enables the continuation and potential expansion of these major infrastructure projects, which is 

expected to help maintain demand for skilled labour in the economy.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, New Zealand has also announced funding through a mode of Climate Finance, for 

projects which are funded under the administration of the ITF, and this is as part of the Kerekere 

Moana Climate Financing modality.  Key among these projects is the replacement of batteries in 

the  Northern  Group  Islands  Renewable  Energy  systems  and  also  the  Aitutaki  Water  Supply 

project.    This  level  of  infrastructure  support  from  New  Zealand  reflects  the  importance  of  the 

special relationship between both our countries and again, I would like to thank New Zealand for 

its continual support.  

</span></div><div><span>In the Outer Islands, we are giving significant attention to improving and expanding air and sea 

infrastructure as a means to expand economic opportunities to our Pa Enua communities.  

</span></div><div><span>The Arutanga Harbour project, part of the Aitutaki Island Plan, is designed to ensure safe passage 

</span><span>for small  boats  and uninterrupted  access  for  cargo ships to  the island, and enable new tourism 

</span><span>development  opportunities.    The  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  aims  to  complete  the 

</span><span>project in 2026, with funding of $1.3 million allocated in this Budget 2025/26.  

</span></div><div><span>Work to upgrade Manihiki airport will receive an additional $4 million over two years.  In addition, 

</span><span>we are providing $1 million for repairs to the runway at Mangaia airport. 

</span></div><div><span>This 2025/26 Budget also includes $5.9 million over four years to improve the harbour and wharf 

infrastructure in the Outer Islands, in particular on Nassau and Atiu.

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>On  Rarotonga,  funding  continues  to  be  directed  towards  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of 

</span><span>deteriorating  bridges  and  road  networks.    Rarotonga’s  road  network  spans  201  km,  with  some 

</span><span>areas damaged by weather, erosion, and heavy use.  In this Budget, we have allocated $38.2 million 

for ongoing renewal and imp</span><span>rovements to Rarotonga’s roading network over four years, as part of 

</span><span>the Road Asset Management plan, as well as $15.9 million over four years for improvements to 

critical bridges.  

</span></div><div><span>This investment Mr Speaker, will enhance the productivity of the Cook Islands economy.  Not 

only  will  it  improve  road  safety  and  ensure  the  provision  of  essential  lifelines  in  times  of 

emergency, but it will also prolong the working life of our motor vehicles.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  am  very  excited  about  the  next  one.    As  part  of  our  ongoing  efforts  to  improve 

healthcare, plans are on the way to establish dialysis unit at the Rarotonga hospital.  This project 

is set to commence in 2027 for over two fiscal years and it will be in collaboration with the Ministry 

of Health, the Cook  Islands Investment  Corporation,  and the New Zealand Ministry of Health.  

This new dialysis unit will allow patients with kidney disease to receive high quality life saving 

treatment right here in the Cook Islands, reducing the need to travel overseas for essential care.  

</span></div><div><span>And finally, Mr Speaker, I turn to  our social  assistance programs.   Now, inflation has put  real 

pressure on households in recent years, much of it driven by external factors that are beyond our 

control.  But while we work on a long-term solution, we are also taking immediate steps to support 

those most affected.  Last year, Cabinet endorsed the Social Assistance Policy 2024 which has 

provided a roadmap for increasing support to those most in need.  This builds on our regionally 

renown for having the longest established supported social benefit framework in the Pacific region. 

</span></div><div><span>From 1 July Mr Speaker, destitute payments will increase from $400 a month to $500 a month to 

assist those who are unable to provide for themselves financially.   

</span></div><div><span>The Child Benefit will be extended to children 17 years old from 1 July 2026 and then up to 18 

years old from 1 July 2027.  The child benefit itself will also increase by $25 per month from 1 

July 2026 and again each year for three more years until it reaches $200 per month which doubles 

the current rate. 

</span></div><div><span>And  also,  Mr  Speaker,  we  recognised  how  important  it  is  for  parents  to  have  time  with  their 

newborns,  especially  in  those  crucial  early  weeks,  and  to  support  this,  from  1  July  2026,  paid 

maternity leave will gradually increase, rising by two weeks each year until it reaches 14 weeks of 

paid maternity leave.  From 1 July 2025, paternity leave will also be introduced at two weeks in 

</span><span>the private sector, paid at the minimum wage.  And to further ease the financial burden on new 

families, the newborn allowance will increase from $1000 to $1500 beginning this year from 1 

July.  

</span></div><div><span>As announced earlier in the week, to assist with the impacts of rising prices, the government has 

</span><span>also confirmed an increase in the minimum wage rate from $9.50 to $10 an hour.  And for a worker 

on 35 hours per week, this is an additional $900 a year.

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as we reflect on our 60-year journey of self-governance, we acknowledge those who 

have sat where we are today.  This includes not just our politicians and public servants, but also 

our  elders  and  community  leaders,  entrepreneurs,  and  our  youth,  and  all  members  of  our 

community who have paved the way for us in those early years through to those who stand before 

you today.  

</span></div><div><span>So, this year’s Budget is not just a financial plan, it is an expression of our values.  With the theme 

</span><span>being </span><span>‘Investing in our people’</span><span>, we are continuing an important commitment to the vision that 

the future of our nation lies in the wellbeing and potential of our citizens.  A vision founded by the 

</span><span>late Premier Sir Albert Henry when he said, “no one in the tribe should be left behind”.</span></div><div><span>So, as we come together to celebrate this year Mr Speaker, I think we can look back and be proud 

of how far we have come as a country.  Looking forward, it is our responsibility to keep the part 

so that future generations can look back too, as we do today, and also be proud.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank everybody for their attention and their support as we work together to build 

a stronger, more resilience Cook Islands.  May God continue to bless our country.  Kia Orana and 

Kia Manuia.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Minister of Finance.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Before I give my support for the Motion, I would 

like to remind this Honourable House of a proverb from our forefathers.  I believe that it is highly 

relevant and applicable to the budget being presented today. 

</span></div><div><span>I understand that some of our people living in New Zealand may claim this proverb as their own, 

but I assert that they have learned it from us.  The proverb goes like this, when I ask you what is 

</span><span>most  important,  your  response  is  always,  “people,  people,  people”.    This  budget  reflects  that 

</span><span>sentiment, as it emphasises our commitment to valuing our people and investing in them.  With 

that in mind, I stand in support of this Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I call the Honourable Minister of Finance Mark Brown on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Pursuant to Standing Order 213 (1), I move: 

</span></div><div><span>For the immediate referral of the Appropriation Bill to the Public Accounts Committee for 

review and to report back to Parliament on 16 June 2025 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion.
