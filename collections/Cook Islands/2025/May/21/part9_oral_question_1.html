<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Speaker,  and  greetings  to  all  our  Honourable 

Members  present  in  the  House  today.    I  have  a  brief  question  for  the  Minister  of  Agriculture, 

though I see she is not here.  My question pertains to our fertilisers </span><span>â€“</span><span> what is being done with the 

stock of fertilisers currently held by the Ministry?  In the Cook Islands, we often face delays in the 

arrival of fertiliser shipments, and we frequently find ourselves running low on supplies. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The fertilisers provided by the Ministry of Agriculture are more affordable than those from the 

CITC Store.  Therefore, I encourage the Minister of Agriculture to look into this matter, as we 

need to support our planters who are ready to cultivate their gardens and require fertilisers.
