<div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>our friends in the Public Gallery today.  Kia Orana to all our listeners in the Northern Group and 

here in the Southern Group, Kia Orana. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I ask my question, I would like to express my condolences for Leone, the owner of the Caf√© 

Ariki.  We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family; this was a sudden and unexpected event.  

The family had just returned from New Zealand, and after being taken to our hospital, she sadly 

passed away a few days later. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is my question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  We are currently experiencing a shortage 

of  workers  in  our  country.    To  clarify  my  question,  when  advertisements  are  placed  in  our 

newspaper,  there  are  often  no  applicants  for  the  advertised  positions.    When  we  post 

advertisements for individuals to work in homes, we see no applications coming in.  As a result, 

we  are  left  with  no  choice  but  to  seek  workers  from  overseas.    However,  this  process  is  not 

straightforward, as it typically takes nearly three months to obtain police clearances and medical 

checks from their home countries. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding  our  immigration  process,  as  I  understand  it,  you  must  submit  the  application  and 

medical documentation within seven days.  After that, you have 20 days to submit your application 

to Immigration as the sponsor for the workers.  Following this, you apply for the Work Permit, 

which also takes an additional 20 days. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question, Minister, is whether we can review these timelines.  Typically, when an application 

is  submitted, it is  checked, and  we  are informed to  expect  a  reply  within 20 days.   I raise this 

concern because I have personally been affected by these delays, and it is important to establish a 

more  efficient  process.    The  response  I  received  was  that  they  would  look  into  the  situation.  

However, I speak not only for myself but also for others, as we discussed our frustrations while 

waiting for our appointments.  We all agreed that the timeline takes too long.  I look forward to 

the Minister's response.
