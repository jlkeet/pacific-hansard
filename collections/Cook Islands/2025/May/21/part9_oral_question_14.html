<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much,  Mr  Speaker.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the 

Honourable Member for asking this question.  I want to remind the Member that he failed to inform 

us about the new genset that was taken to Aitutaki.  At the time, I did not realise, Mr Speaker, that

</span></div>
<div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>they actually wanted two new generators.  Had the Honourable Member shared that information 

with me during the process of procuring the new one that is currently in Aitutaki, we might have 

taken steps to ensure that we could procure two gensets. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr Speaker, our focus was on securing the one genset that is now set up in Aitutaki.  

At that time, our attention was primarily directed towards Phase 2 of the solar program in Araura.  

However, I have recently been made aware, Mr Speaker, by the Honourable Member from Vai-

Vai-Tau, that a short-term fix may be necessary before we move into the development of Phase 2 

of the solar program.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Given this information, let me go back to CIIC for further discussion, especially since Honourable 

Member Tai Herman brought it up to me about two weeks ago. 

</span></div>
<div><span>With Phase 2 of the solar program in Araura Enua, Mr Speaker, there has been about $8million 

</span><span>allocated for that project, which we have prioritised since my entry into this role.  This fund, Mr 

Speaker, sits under what I believe is the ITF fund.  Those of us who are aware of the ITF know 

that there is a lengthy process involved in accessing this particular fund. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr Speaker, the Honourable Members from Amuri, Vaipae, and Are-Nikau, including 

myself, have been working tirelessly as Aitutakians for Aitutaki.  It feels unfair to my own district 

because I was elected by RAPPA and not Araura Enua.  Nonetheless, there are several issues that 

we have taken on board, and I believe the Honourable Member would admit that we are making 

progress  in  Aitutaki,  particularly  regarding  water  and  power,  as  well  as  the  Arutanga  Harbour 

project. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I encourage the Honourable Member to talk to us directly.  In fact, there is no need to come to 

Parliament to discuss these matters; you can visit my office, and it will just be the two of us.  There 

is no need to grandstand on these issues </span><span>â€“</span><span> we can sort it out man to man, or rather, man to boy.  

Beyond that, I want to assure you that I am continuing to work on these matters.  It is not that I 

have not been made aware of the issues, and I will keep working.  We will talk more in the future. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  In the future, please ensure that he is included 

in any projects in Aitutaki so that he can be part of the government next year.
