<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker, and thanks to the staff of Parliament.  

Kia Orana to our friends who have joined us in the Public Gallery today.  I offer my heartfelt words 

of comfort to the Member who raised the question, as they are family to me.  My thoughts and 

support go out to the family during this time of bereavement and the loss of a loved one. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now, I would like to answer the question raised by this Honourable Member.  I will not go into a 

lengthy explanation, as I want to ensure my answer is accurate.  However, I would like to share 

what I know with this House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe the government has allocated over $200,000 to the Ministry of Agriculture 

to support the purchase of fertilisers.  The proposal entails that the Ministry of Agriculture will use 

these funds to acquire fertilisers, which they will then sell at a reduced price to the planters.  The 

revenue generated from these sales will be reinvested into purchasing additional fertilisers. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe the fertilisers have run out, and I am uncertain about the purchase of another 

</span><span>container.  I understand that the Minister and the Secretary of Agriculture are currently overseas 

</span><span>attending an important conference.  I will follow up on this matter and I will return to provide the 

</span><span>Honourable  Member  who  raised  the  question,  as  well  as  all  our  planters,  with  a  clear  answer.  

Thank you.
