<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  I would like to thank the Honourable 

Member  for  Murienua  for  this  ideal  question.    My  short  answer  for  now  is  to  request  the 

opportunity  to  gather  more  information,  and  I  should  be  able  to  respond  to  your  inquiry  by 

tomorrow.  I will provide further details regarding the numbers and specific foreigners residing in 

our country.  It is important to note that we currently have many tourists in the Cook Islands, who 

are also considered foreigners. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I may need to spend some time with the Honourable Member to clarify what he is specifically 

inquiring  about  regarding  foreigners,  whether  he  is  referring  to  foreign  workers  or  all  foreign 

visitors, including tourists and others.
