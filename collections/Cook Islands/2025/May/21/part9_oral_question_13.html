<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>MR. T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to your staff.  To our government, 

the  Prime  Minister,  and  the  Members  of  government  today,  Kia  Orana.    Kia  Orana  to  the 

Opposition and those in the Public Gallery. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is directed to the Minister responsible for CIIC.  Minister, I know you are a busy man 

within our country.  I can recall that when you were appointed as a Minister about two years ago, 

you visited our island and stated that you are an Aitutaki boy of Aitutakian heritage.  It has been 

two years now, and this is not to place any blame on you, as I understand that you are very busy. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  am  speaking  on  the  electricity  for  Araura.  The  problem  with  our  electricity  on 

Aitutaki is sti</span><span>ll not been solved.  This is not the first time I’ve raised about this issue. I have talked 

</span><span>about this in our previous Sittings but the people are coming back complaining about damages to 

their televisions, fridges and other electrical appliances caused by the power surges.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Last  week,  I  spoke  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Aitutaki  Board  and  the  CEO  of  Te  Mana  Uira  o 

Araura Enua.  They expressed concerns, stating that things are not looking good because there is 

only one genset operating on Aitutaki today.  According to them, if this genset fails, it will result 

in a blackout across Aitutaki.  This 'horse' is running 24/7, and there is no other 'horse' in the world 

that can do this;  fortunately,  this one is  from  Russia.  If this genset  were to  blow up, it would 

become  a  problem  for  my  MP  friends  from  Vai-Vai-Tau  and  Are-Nikau.    As  members  of 

</span><span>government, it is their responsibility to push this issue forward, but I’m uncertain about the current 

</span><span>situation.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The problem is next year’s elections and I don’t know if </span><span>they will get in. Mr Speaker, I will leave 

this and ask my question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The upcoming elections are a concern, and I am unsure whether they will secure their seats.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I will leave that aside and ask my question.  Honourable Minister, my question is 

straightforward </span><span>–</span><span> as an Aitutaki resident, can you confirm today that you will secure a genset for 

</span><span>us?  This confirmation is critical for the people of Aitutaki listening in, as well as for the Council 

</span><span>and the three of us here, to ensure that the two representatives do not lose their seats in government.  

</span><span>If you can confirm that you will provide a genset as soon as possible, that would be great.  Please 

</span><span>do not mention potential funding without a clear plan; if there is funding available, it should be 

</span><span>directed  towards  securing  a  genset.    If  the  funding  ends  up  in  your  hands  without  proper 

</span><span>commitment, it may simply be diverted elsewhere.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div>
