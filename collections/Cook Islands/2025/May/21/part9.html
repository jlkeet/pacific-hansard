<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Speaker,  and  greetings  to  all  our  Honourable 

Members  present  in  the  House  today.    I  have  a  brief  question  for  the  Minister  of  Agriculture, 

though I see she is not here.  My question pertains to our fertilisers </span><span>–</span><span> what is being done with the 

stock of fertilisers currently held by the Ministry?  In the Cook Islands, we often face delays in the 

arrival of fertiliser shipments, and we frequently find ourselves running low on supplies. 

</span></div><div><span>The fertilisers provided by the Ministry of Agriculture are more affordable than those from the 

CITC Store.  Therefore, I encourage the Minister of Agriculture to look into this matter, as we 

need to support our planters who are ready to cultivate their gardens and require fertilisers. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister acting on behalf of the Minister of 

Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker, and thanks to the staff of Parliament.  

Kia Orana to our friends who have joined us in the Public Gallery today.  I offer my heartfelt words 

of comfort to the Member who raised the question, as they are family to me.  My thoughts and 

support go out to the family during this time of bereavement and the loss of a loved one. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I would like to answer the question raised by this Honourable Member.  I will not go into a 

lengthy explanation, as I want to ensure my answer is accurate.  However, I would like to share 

what I know with this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe the government has allocated over $200,000 to the Ministry of Agriculture 

to support the purchase of fertilisers.  The proposal entails that the Ministry of Agriculture will use 

these funds to acquire fertilisers, which they will then sell at a reduced price to the planters.  The 

revenue generated from these sales will be reinvested into purchasing additional fertilisers. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe the fertilisers have run out, and I am uncertain about the purchase of another 

</span><span>container.  I understand that the Minister and the Secretary of Agriculture are currently overseas 

</span><span>attending an important conference.  I will follow up on this matter and I will return to provide the 

</span><span>Honourable  Member  who  raised  the  question,  as  well  as  all  our  planters,  with  a  clear  answer.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Honourable Minister for his concise 

</span><span>and straightforward answer to my question.  I recognise that this is a matter of interest to all our 

planters, and I appreciate that the Minister has provided the information they are seeking from the 

government.

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My next question pertains to Foreign Affairs, and I hope the Minister responsible for this Ministry 

can address it.  I would like to ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on how many foreigners are 

currently in the Cook Islands?  The reason for my inquiry is that this matter has been brought up 

in  this House, and our people are still seeking  clarity.  We have been directed to  the Statistics 

Office, which claims that there are 1,500 foreign workers in our country, but I find that figure hard 

to believe. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask the Honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs if he could provide us with an 

accurate figure regarding the number of foreign workers residing in the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  I would like to thank the Honourable 

Member  for  Murienua  for  this  ideal  question.    My  short  answer  for  now  is  to  request  the 

opportunity  to  gather  more  information,  and  I  should  be  able  to  respond  to  your  inquiry  by 

tomorrow.  I will provide further details regarding the numbers and specific foreigners residing in 

our country.  It is important to note that we currently have many tourists in the Cook Islands, who 

are also considered foreigners. 

</span></div><div><span>I may need to spend some time with the Honourable Member to clarify what he is specifically 

inquiring  about  regarding  foreigners,  whether  he  is  referring  to  foreign  workers  or  all  foreign 

visitors, including tourists and others. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister, for your response.  To be more specific 

with my inquiry, I would like to know how many foreigners are currently working here for the 

government and for our people, rather than including visitors or tourists. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I would have expected that you would take some time 

during our break to discuss this issue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  I suggest we wait until just before our break, and then we can step out to 

</span><span>discuss the question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Leader of the Opposition the Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne; you 

</span><span>have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Kia  Orana,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  everyone  in  this 

Honourable House today.  Kia Orana to the Honourable Prime Minister and your Members, as 

well as to my colleagues on this side.  Kia Orana to the staff of this Honourable House and to all

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>our friends in the Public Gallery today.  Kia Orana to all our listeners in the Northern Group and 

here in the Southern Group, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I ask my question, I would like to express my condolences for Leone, the owner of the Café 

Ariki.  We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family; this was a sudden and unexpected event.  

The family had just returned from New Zealand, and after being taken to our hospital, she sadly 

passed away a few days later. 

</span></div><div><span>This is my question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  We are currently experiencing a shortage 

of  workers  in  our  country.    To  clarify  my  question,  when  advertisements  are  placed  in  our 

newspaper,  there  are  often  no  applicants  for  the  advertised  positions.    When  we  post 

advertisements for individuals to work in homes, we see no applications coming in.  As a result, 

we  are  left  with  no  choice  but  to  seek  workers  from  overseas.    However,  this  process  is  not 

straightforward, as it typically takes nearly three months to obtain police clearances and medical 

checks from their home countries. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding  our  immigration  process,  as  I  understand  it,  you  must  submit  the  application  and 

medical documentation within seven days.  After that, you have 20 days to submit your application 

to Immigration as the sponsor for the workers.  Following this, you apply for the Work Permit, 

which also takes an additional 20 days. 

</span></div><div><span>My question, Minister, is whether we can review these timelines.  Typically, when an application 

is  submitted, it is  checked, and  we  are informed to  expect  a  reply  within 20 days.   I raise this 

concern because I have personally been affected by these delays, and it is important to establish a 

more  efficient  process.    The  response  I  received  was  that  they  would  look  into  the  situation.  

However, I speak not only for myself but also for others, as we discussed our frustrations while 

waiting for our appointments.  We all agreed that the timeline takes too long.  I look forward to 

the Minister's response. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Tingika 

</span><span>Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to my colleague for the question.  

</span><span>It is a valid inquiry that our border controllers need to consider.  I want to assure you that you are 

</span><span>not the first to ask this.  I have already inquired with the Head of the responsible Ministry, and I 

</span><span>will provide a response tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Toanui Isamaela.

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to your staff.  To our government, 

the  Prime  Minister,  and  the  Members  of  government  today,  Kia  Orana.    Kia  Orana  to  the 

Opposition and those in the Public Gallery. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is directed to the Minister responsible for CIIC.  Minister, I know you are a busy man 

within our country.  I can recall that when you were appointed as a Minister about two years ago, 

you visited our island and stated that you are an Aitutaki boy of Aitutakian heritage.  It has been 

two years now, and this is not to place any blame on you, as I understand that you are very busy. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  am  speaking  on  the  electricity  for  Araura.  The  problem  with  our  electricity  on 

Aitutaki is sti</span><span>ll not been solved.  This is not the first time I’ve raised about this issue. I have talked 

</span><span>about this in our previous Sittings but the people are coming back complaining about damages to 

their televisions, fridges and other electrical appliances caused by the power surges.   

</span></div><div><span>Last  week,  I  spoke  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Aitutaki  Board  and  the  CEO  of  Te  Mana  Uira  o 

Araura Enua.  They expressed concerns, stating that things are not looking good because there is 

only one genset operating on Aitutaki today.  According to them, if this genset fails, it will result 

in a blackout across Aitutaki.  This 'horse' is running 24/7, and there is no other 'horse' in the world 

that can do this;  fortunately,  this one is  from  Russia.  If this genset  were to  blow up, it would 

become  a  problem  for  my  MP  friends  from  Vai-Vai-Tau  and  Are-Nikau.    As  members  of 

</span><span>government, it is their responsibility to push this issue forward, but I’m uncertain about the current 

</span><span>situation.  

</span></div><div><span>The problem is next year’s elections and I don’t know if </span><span>they will get in. Mr Speaker, I will leave 

this and ask my question. 

</span></div><div><span>The upcoming elections are a concern, and I am unsure whether they will secure their seats.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I will leave that aside and ask my question.  Honourable Minister, my question is 

straightforward </span><span>–</span><span> as an Aitutaki resident, can you confirm today that you will secure a genset for 

</span><span>us?  This confirmation is critical for the people of Aitutaki listening in, as well as for the Council 

</span><span>and the three of us here, to ensure that the two representatives do not lose their seats in government.  

</span><span>If you can confirm that you will provide a genset as soon as possible, that would be great.  Please 

</span><span>do not mention potential funding without a clear plan; if there is funding available, it should be 

</span><span>directed  towards  securing  a  genset.    If  the  funding  ends  up  in  your  hands  without  proper 

</span><span>commitment, it may simply be diverted elsewhere.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much,  Mr  Speaker.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the 

Honourable Member for asking this question.  I want to remind the Member that he failed to inform 

us about the new genset that was taken to Aitutaki.  At the time, I did not realise, Mr Speaker, that 

</span></div><div><span>922 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 May 2025 

</span></div><div><span>Thirteenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>they actually wanted two new generators.  Had the Honourable Member shared that information 

with me during the process of procuring the new one that is currently in Aitutaki, we might have 

taken steps to ensure that we could procure two gensets. 

</span></div><div><span>Unfortunately, Mr Speaker, our focus was on securing the one genset that is now set up in Aitutaki.  

At that time, our attention was primarily directed towards Phase 2 of the solar program in Araura.  

However, I have recently been made aware, Mr Speaker, by the Honourable Member from Vai-

Vai-Tau, that a short-term fix may be necessary before we move into the development of Phase 2 

of the solar program.  

</span></div><div><span>Given this information, let me go back to CIIC for further discussion, especially since Honourable 

Member Tai Herman brought it up to me about two weeks ago. 

</span></div><div><span>With Phase 2 of the solar program in Araura Enua, Mr Speaker, there has been about $8million 

</span><span>allocated for that project, which we have prioritised since my entry into this role.  This fund, Mr 

Speaker, sits under what I believe is the ITF fund.  Those of us who are aware of the ITF know 

that there is a lengthy process involved in accessing this particular fund. 

</span></div><div><span>However, Mr Speaker, the Honourable Members from Amuri, Vaipae, and Are-Nikau, including 

myself, have been working tirelessly as Aitutakians for Aitutaki.  It feels unfair to my own district 

because I was elected by RAPPA and not Araura Enua.  Nonetheless, there are several issues that 

we have taken on board, and I believe the Honourable Member would admit that we are making 

progress  in  Aitutaki,  particularly  regarding  water  and  power,  as  well  as  the  Arutanga  Harbour 

project. 

</span></div><div><span>I encourage the Honourable Member to talk to us directly.  In fact, there is no need to come to 

Parliament to discuss these matters; you can visit my office, and it will just be the two of us.  There 

is no need to grandstand on these issues </span><span>–</span><span> we can sort it out man to man, or rather, man to boy.  

Beyond that, I want to assure you that I am continuing to work on these matters.  It is not that I 

have not been made aware of the issues, and I will keep working.  We will talk more in the future. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  In the future, please ensure that he is included 

in any projects in Aitutaki so that he can be part of the government next year.
