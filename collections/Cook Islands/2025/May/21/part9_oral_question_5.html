<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Honourable Minister for his concise 

</span><span>and straightforward answer to my question.  I recognise that this is a matter of interest to all our 

planters, and I appreciate that the Minister has provided the information they are seeking from the 

government.

<div><span>My next question pertains to Foreign Affairs, and I hope the Minister responsible for this Ministry 

can address it.  I would like to ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on how many foreigners are 

currently in the Cook Islands?  The reason for my inquiry is that this matter has been brought up 

in  this House, and our people are still seeking  clarity.  We have been directed to  the Statistics 

Office, which claims that there are 1,500 foreign workers in our country, but I find that figure hard 

to believe. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to ask the Honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs if he could provide us with an 

accurate figure regarding the number of foreign workers residing in the Cook Islands.
