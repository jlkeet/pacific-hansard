</span></div><div><span>That Paper No.47 be received

</span></div><div><span>Paper No.50.  The Commission of Inquiry (Ngateina Makitae) Order 1997, Serial No.

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No.50 be received 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Justice and Lands Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you and Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the 

staff of Parliament and to all Honourable Members on both sides of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the paper on the Report of the Ngateina Makitae Commission of Inquiry be 

received 

</span></div><div><span>And in doing so, Mr Speaker, I would like to make some brief comments just to help 

some of our radio listeners of our debate this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  before  I  proceed,  I  would  like  to  extend  Greetings  to  all  our  people 

listening in to our debate this afternoon in Rarotonga and in the Outer Islands.  And a 

special  Kia  Orana,  Mr  Speaker,  to  our  boys  from  New  Zealand  -  those  who  will  be 

successful in your selection of our National Squad against Fiji on Friday.  On behalf 

of Members of Parliament I would like to welcome our boys from New Zealand, the 

supporters  and  the  Executive  of  the  Rugby  Union  -  Kia  Orana  and  welcome  to  our 

shores.  Mr Speaker, it is an honour for whoever will win a selection in the team on 

Friday to play against Fiji.  It will be a very high honour for our boys to represent our 

country  in  the  game  against  Fiji  which  goes  towards  the  World  Cup.    I  think,  Mr 

Speaker, despite some negative publicity on the ability of our boys to play against Fiji 

on Friday, based on their game in New Zealand, I would like to ask our people here 

especially to support our team on Friday.  They are training hard.  One can only expect 

</span><span>them to play their best and to do well to represent our country on Friday.  The squad is 

</span><span>improving all the time, two more new players arrived on Monday night and I believe 

there are another two arriving on Friday morning from New Zealand.  You often hear, 

Mr Speaker, that sometimes it is difficult to get leave from your job and of course you 

may face the possibility of losing your job in New Zealand.  Our boys in New Zealand 

are confronted with this.  Those that are coming here and those still to come, ought to 

be congratulated for their efforts in coming here. 

</span></div><div><span>At the same time, Mr Speaker, I would like to extend a cordial welcome to our friends 

from Fiji, the rugby team from Fiji.  I believe they arrived last night and they are here 

also getting ready to play against our boys on Friday at the Stadium.  I would like to 

extend a Kia Orana to them also.

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in reference to this report before the House, the Commission of Inquiry 

was appointed on the 11th February 1997 and was a one man Commission involving 

Mr  Justice  Hillyer.    There  has  been  a  lot  of  publicity  in  the  media  in  regard  to  this 

crime that took  place here on Rarotonga, involving the complainant, in  this case Mr 

Scott of Ngatangiia.  The matter was fully investigated by the Police and charges were 

laid against the offender and the matter was dealt with in the High Court.  However, 

as a result, after the completion of the Court case other matters came to the notice of 

the Justice Department as well as the Chief Justice, Sir Quilliam.  Information which 

was  not  known  to  the  Chief  Justice  at  the  time  when  he  imposed  the  sentence  on 

Makitae  would  probably  affect  the  gravity  or  the  seriousness  of  the  sentence  of  the 

trial then.  It was as a result of this information, unknown to Sir Quilliam at the time, 

that warranted the need to set up the Commission of Inquiry to look into these factors.  

A  submission  was  made  to  Cabinet  and  recommended  the  appointment  of  a 

Commission  of  Inquiry,  and  on  the  11th  February  an  Order  in  Executive  Council 

promulgated the appointment of Justice Hillyer to  head this Commission  of Inquiry.  

The  Commission  of  Inquiry  was assisted by Mr Michael  Mitchell, a resident lawyer 

here.  And as we can see here today, Mr Speaker, this is the Report of the Commission 

of  Inquiry.    The  recommendations  from  this  Report  have  been  formulated  in 

discussion  with  the  Ministries  concerned,  i.e.  Justice,  Crown  Law  and  Police.    The 

recommendations  which  have  come  out  of  this  Report,  in  discussions  between  the 

three Ministries concerned, outline the role and responsibility of each Ministry.  In the 

event  of  cases  of  a  serious  nature  like  this  one  in  which  Ngateina  Makitae  was 

charged, or in more serious offences, all the Ministries concerned are happy with the 

recommendations  and  have  agreed  to  undertake  what  has  come  out  of  this  report, 

especially their own roles and responsibilities pertaining to such cases. 

</span></div><div><span>It is at this point in time, Mr Speaker, that I would like to extend my thanks to Justice 

Hillyer  who  headed  the  Commission  of  Inquiry.    Also  to  the  lawyer,  Mr  Michael 

Mitchell,  the  three  Ministries  involved,  the  Solicitor-General  and  his  staff;  the 

Commissioner  of  Police  and  his  staff,  and  lastly,  the  Justice  Department  headed  by 

Terry Hagan and his staff. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  can  assure  you  that  the  Inquiry  did  not  go  smoothly  as  most  people 

would think, especially in the Ministries concerned.  However, the main concern was 

the result of this Report, the recommendations which have come out of it that would 

definitely  assist  the  future  gravitation  of  preventing  a  situation  of  this  kind,  ever 

occurring  again.    The  differences  that  may  have  crossed  their  paths  in  the  past  or 

throughout their own investigations during the time of this case, been sorted out by the 

Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>At  the  same  time,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  again  extend  my  word  of  comfort 

especially  to  Mr  Scott  for  what  he  experienced  when  this  happened  and  even  the 

publicity that went through the media.  I know this will not cover the full trauma of 

the whole thing he went through.  I just hope that this will help not only now but for 

the future. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Tiriamate Ngatokorua 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>3091 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No. 50 be received 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any further speakers?  The Honourable Member Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker, to Honourable Members of the 

House and also to our people listening in to our debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>With regards to the report on the inquiry conducted into the Makitae case, it shows a 

lot of deficiencies in our police department.  Also the deficiencies are pointed out by 

the Judge, Justice Quilliam,  with our Crown Law Office.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the question here is the attack on one of our locals by somebody with a 

bush knife.  Here is a man with his own chicken farm trying to defend and to protect 

his property, suddenly in the dark of the night, somebody lunged at him with a knife 

and chopped him in the neck.  It seems in this report that the criminal, the person who 

</span><span>attacked him, was defending himself after stealing someone else’s chicken.  </span></div><div><span>I know the owner of the chicken farm was seriously ill, seriously injured, and he was 

about to die.  And yet when his case was handled by the police, there were failures on 

certain parts.  Failures to show the sitting Judge at the time, Justice Quilliam, the full 

facts of the case.  A number of evidence the Judge required to see in the Court, were 

not presented in that Court.  Material evidence was absent, like the knife used by the 

criminal to assault the chicken farm owner with.  And yet the police did not see it as 

serious  enough  to  charge  the  person  who  assaulted  the  victim-  with  the  charge  of 

attempted  murder,  but  rather  they  gave  a  lesser  charge  of  intent  to  injure.    I  do  not 

entirely blame the police department because they did seek some advice from Crown 

Law.  It seems to be, Mr Speaker, Crown Law did not consider it as serious enough.  

The charges against Makitae were verbally given in their recommendation instead of 

them writing it down and assisting the police in bringing charges of manslaughter.  It 

took another Judge, Mr Speaker, to realise there has been some mis-carriage of Justice 

in our Judicial system.   

</span></div><div><span>If this is the way we want to punish those who do  wrong to us, who accuse us, or who 

assault  us,  then  I  am  sorry  our  society  will  decay.    The  criminals  will  be  roaming 

</span><span>around  slashing  people  on  their  necks  and  walk  away  free  for  a  few  years,  three  or 

</span><span>four  years  spent  in  jail.    It  is  our  duty  to  our  people  to  ensure  that  proper  Justice  is 

carried  out  in  this  country.    Otherwise  nobody  will  be  safe  in  the  Cook  Islands 

anymore.   

</span></div><div><span>I congratulate the Minister of Justice for bringing this Paper into the House so we can 

all make ourselves fully aware of what went on in that Court.  Let us hope that it will 

not  be repeated in  the near future.  It is the obligation of our police department, our 

Crown Law, our Justice Department, to ensure that correct and proper procedures are 

taking  place  when  people  are  charged  with  serious  criminal  offences,  such  as  the 

Makitae case.  It is also important that our police department are provided with help 

when  they  require  it,  or  when  they  seek  assistance  from  Crown  Law,  the  Justice 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3092 

</span></div><div><span>Department  or from the public as a whole.  It is also the duty of the public to come 

forward and to assist with our police department in any criminal investigation.   

Now  the  Makitae  case  has  reached  this  House.    If  you  read  the  press  everyday,  Mr 

Speaker, you will see a lot of minor offences committed in this country.  The police 

department should be given every opportunity, every means, to address these offences 

because one day a minor offence will become like the Makitae case- a major criminal 

offence.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to give my apologies to the person Makitae attacked with a bush knife.  It 

may go a long way to correcting that fault.  It took this case for us to realise that there 

are weaknesses in our system and we should tighten up those places, to prevent further 

criminal offences such as this.  Thank you Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Before I call on a next speaker, I 

just  want  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  Honourable  Members  that  we  are  talking 

about the Commission of Inquiry, Order Paper.   

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, maybe I have misled the House.  In what I earlier 

had intended was to move that this Paper on the Commission of Inquiry, Paper 50, be 

heard together with Paper No. 68 which relates to the Makitae case.  Thank you Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Minister has explained himself and may I seek the leave of the 

House in order to debate these two Papers No. 50, and 68 together.  The Minister of 

Justice and Land. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No. 50 and 68 relating to the establishment of the Commission 

Inquiry and the Report of the (Ngateina Makitae) be received together 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Mii Parima 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any further speakers?  

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>3093 

</span></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>We will now deal with two Papers together. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No. 50 and 68 be received 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  Honourable  Members  of  the  House  and  also  our 

people listening in- Greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  give  some  words  of  comfort  to  those  families  who  are  in 

bereavement at this time and also I would like to give a warm welcome and greetings 

to our rugby team who have returned from New Zealand and also to the rugby team 

from Fiji who will be playing on Friday.  I believe all of us will be together to give our 

support the team needs in order for them to be encouraged to win the match. 

</span></div><div><span>At this time Mr Speaker,  I would like to say that the crime rate is currently increasing 

on our island and in this Country.  I would like to congratulate and acknowledge the 

Minister  responsible  for  the  Report  being  brought  into  this  House  and  I  would  also 

like to acknowledge the Commission of Inquiry for looking into this matter.  Through 

this inquiry, we have found deficiencies in the statements of the witnesses that were 

received by the Commission of Inquiry.  How can the Police be effective in executing 

their duties when they are not being paid a one hundred percent salary?  I see in the 

paper recently that the Police are going to use push bikes.  How can they perform their 

duties effectively when it takes two hours to get from one place to another to attend to 

the needs of the people?  We can see that the Police Department have gone right back 

to when we first started using push bikes.  No jeeps, no cars or motorbikes for them to 

travel on.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  I support the views raised by my colleague, the Honourable Member for 

Manihiki.  We should support the Police department and the departments concerned in 

order for them to perform their duties accordingly.  I am not only concerned with the 

department  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga,  but  also  those  departments  on  the  outer 

islands.    Also,  the    police  officers  in  the  Outer  Islands  should  come  to  Rarotonga 

every two years to be updated on the new procedures as regards policing.  We should 

</span><span>support the needs of the department.  Furthermore,  I support the view that the police 

</span><span>should be given proper transport to attend to the needs of our people.  Through the use 

of motorbikes, the police can attend an incident faster.  We can see that there are a lot 

of petty crimes on the island, so in order for the police to be on the spot when they are 

required they need motorised vehicles instead of push bikes. 

</span></div><div><span>There is another case where a person was killed.  I do not know what is the result of 

that inquiry.  I do not know what the budget will be like for that department, but I feel 

that they should be given a salary increase, they should receive the support they need 

in order for them to function well.   

</span></div><div><span>In the case of teachers, their money should be restored or eventually there will be no 

more  teachers    to  teach  our  children.    Mr  Speaker,  we  should  be  behind  our  police 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3094 

</span></div><div><span>department  and  give  them  every  support  that  they  require.    To  the  Minister,  maybe 

there is a need for a change of laws in order to meet the needs of today.   

I also see that the Crown Law Office needs our support.  There are a lot of our young 

people graduating from law school.  We should support the Crown Law Office and the 

Police  Department  in  their  duties.    Also  if  there  are  young  people  going  for  further 

education,  we  should  support  them  in  order  that  when  they  return  with  higher 

</span><span>qualifications they will support the departments who need them. This is so they don’t 

</span><span>go to Australia and New Zealand and remain there. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I support the Paper before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Agriculture Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and to all Honourable 

Members on both sides of the House as well as to our people who are listening in to 

</span><span>this afternoon’s debate.</span></div><div><span>Through you, Mr Speaker, I would like to give my words of condolence to those who 

are going through the loss of a loved one, here on the island of Rarotonga and on our 

outer islands also.  May god comfort you. 

</span></div><div><span>To the two rugby teams that are here in the Cook Islands, the National rugby teams of 

Fiji  and  the  Cook  Islands,  Kia  Orana.    I  would  just  like  to  say  through  you  Mr 

Speaker, whether any players today will recall in 1977 when the Cook Islands played a 

team  from  New  Zealand  captained  by  Bevan  Holmes,    who  was  then  an  All  Black 

No.8, and the coach of the Fijian team today, Brad Johnstone was actually in that team 

and our boys beat them too.  I welcome Brad Johnston back to the Cook Islands and 

fortunately  for  him,  he  decided  to  improve  his  rugby  in  Fiji.    I  say  to  him 

congratulations.  I would like to  remind him also,  you do not  crack a coconut when 

you drinking it at half - time with your fist, because you will crack your fist.  That was 

another incident that happened at half - time during that game when one of our local 

boys cracked his  nut  and the tourist decided, if he can it then I can too and hurt his 

hand on the hard nut. 

</span></div><div><span>Back to the Paper before us, Mr Speaker.  Like previous speakers before me, I support 

</span><span>the  Paper.    However,    I  must  say  through  you  sir,  that  I  am  disappointed  with  the 

</span><span>Report.  Mr Speaker, this is simply because on Paper No.50, the terms of references 

given  to  Justice  Hillyer  to  carry  out  these  five  points  in  there.    For  example,  Point 

No.1  says,      How  is  it  possible  for  the  Police  Department  to  reduce  a  charge  for 

attempted  murder  to  one  of  aggravated  assault?    If  our  legal  system  needs  to  be 

upgraded  I  was  expecting  the  Report  to  say  so.    Instead,  they  quoted  an  incident  in 

New Zealand, the right of the victim.  The victim had no right Mr Speaker.  To me, 

from the way I read this Report, what happened was that we, the Parliamentarians, the 

Crown Solicitors or the Justice Department was trying to support the criminal.  Maybe 

</span><span>there is a reason for that, maybe the criminal was diagnosed as a little bit sick.  If that 

</span><span>were  the  case,  why  didn’t  they  say  so?  Somehow  the  Police  filed  two  charges  </span><span>- 

attempted  murder  and aggravated wounding or whatever the case may be.  And yet, 

somehow between the defence lawyer and the Police Department and the Crown Law, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>3095 

</span></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>they decided to reduce the charge.  I cannot see anything in this Report saying that the 

victim agreed to it. 

</span></div><div><span>Now to come back to my concern in the Report, because I feel that this sort of report 

that  comes  into  this  Parliament  is  to  look  at  critically,  carefully,  not  necessarily  to 

speak about the Police going on push bikes or whatever the case may be.  That is not 

our role.  Our role in here is to legislate!  To ensure that there are Police Officers who 

carry  out  the  responsibility  of  legislation  that  we  put,  our  Ministry  of  Justice  and 

Crown Law. 

</span></div><div><span>I notice a fax here from the Solicitor-General in his Report.  It is not even defined.  It 

is  not  even  clear,  some  of  the  areas  of  my  concern  are  in  regards  to  the  Terms  of 

Reference  that  was  given  to  Justice  Hillyer.    There  is  no  point  coming  in  here  and 

criticising the Police or criticising the Justice.  I am saying to you Sir, what is needed 

is an accurate report or an assumption to be tabled into this House so that Parliament 

would be in a position to have a look in order to evaluate or to amend our Act. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I believe all these administrations - Justice, Crown Law and Police - that Justice 

Hillyer was critical of all of them.  As I said, Mr Speaker, it is all very well.  He said,  

</span><span>“As to why all the facts were not disclosed I can only say that the evidence disclosed 

inadequate preparation by all those involved in the file.”  That is the bottom line.</span><span>  The 

Justice  was  saying  that  nothing  was  done.    The  question  then  is,  what  does  he 

recommend  to  us?    Is  there  any  way  to  implement  legislation  to  stop  that  this 

happening?  Because after all, we are the law makers of the country.  We take advice 

from our legal system.  I do not want to come into this House and talk about the Police 

not being paid their 15 percent.  I do not want to come into this House and talk about 

the Policemen not having motor cars or whatever.  Because that responsibility is for 

the h</span><span>ead of that Ministry.  This Parliament’s responsibility I believe is to legislate, to 

</span><span>stop  this  sort  of  thing  happening.    Even  in  saying  through  you  Sir,  that  the  Judge 

criticised practically all of our legal system, but he still failed to tell me what needs to 

be  put  in  place.    Did  he  recommend  a  form  of  legislation  to  make  sure  that  this  is 

carried  out?  Or  does  it  require  procedural  matters  attached  to  our  Act,  in  order  that 

there is a procedure in there if this sort of thing happens?  The procedure is there and 

</span><span>the Police will be able to carry this out.  Maybe that will happen.  I don’t know.</span></div><div><span>Now in saying all that, Mr Speaker, through you Sir, I don’t like his criticism of our 

people.    I  don’t  like  his  criticism  of  the  Justice.    Nor,  do  I like the criticisim  of the 

</span><span>Police  as  well  as  the  Crown  Law  because  he  did  not  come  to  the  bottom  line.    I 

believe  any  Inquiry  as  such,  if  it  is  going  to  be critical,  let it be critical  but  through 

you,  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  saying  that  he  should  at  least  put  some  recommendations  in 

place on how or what needs to be done to stop this sort of thing happening again. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my views on this paper.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Firstly,  Kia  Orana  to  you  Mr 

Speaker,  on  my  return  from  an  overseas  trip  and  also  Kia  Orana  to  the  Honourable 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3096 

</span></div><div><span>Members  of  this  House,  to  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the 

Ministers who I see that some are not in this House.  Kia Orana also to the Leader of 

the  House  and  members  in  Government.    I  would  like  to  extend  a  very  special 

greetings  to  each  and  all  of  the  Members  on  the  Opposition  Bench,  Dr  Robert 

Woonton, Dr Pupuke Robati, Mrs Ngamau Munokoa, and Upokomaki Simpson.  Kia 

Orana also to the Leader of the Opposition who is trying to look for some money or 

for something to help this country - Kia Orana to him.   

</span></div><div><span>Special greetings to our people Mr Speaker.  I am not sure whether they still have their 

</span><span>radios  on and for those who still have those radios on, please greet those who don’t 

</span><span>have their radios on. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  extend  special  greetings  to  those  families  who  suffered  loss  of 

loved  ones  during  the  time  we  were  overseas.    We  heard  about  those  bereavements 

and  it  was  sad  to  see  all  those  people  die.    Although  it  is  a  long  time  since  the 

bereavement,  I  would  like  to  send  a  very  special  condolence  to  the  Manine  Mato 

family, to  the daughter and also  to  the son and also  to  Paul  and all the families and 

people in Ngatangiia.  I would like to give to you my words of condolences. 

</span></div><div><span>Also to the ..?... family I would like on behalf of my wife and family to give to you 

our words of comfort in your time of bereavement.  And to any other person who is 

bereaving over the loss of a dearly loved one or of a friend, I would like to extend to 

you my words of comfort. 

</span></div><div><span>The good news, Mr Speaker, is that our group is back with a very shiny flag and we 

were given a gold medal while we were on our trip.  Mr Speaker, I would like to ask 

that  when  this  video  arrives  here  in  Rarotonga,  that  this  video  be  shown.    This  is 

because  this  gold  medal  was  given  at  the  farewell  function  of  this  organisation,  the 

International Golden Oldies Rugby Festival.  At the time this award was given, it was 

presented  at  a  ceremony  that  was  held  in  a  auditorium  in  Vancouver  Canada  and 

maybe Honourable Members are aware of the situation about the hot air balloon.  This 

hot air balloon flew around in the auditorium and when it came overhead of the table 

belonging to the Cook Islands group, it came straight on to the table.  The question Mr 

Speaker, is what is the significance of what the world has seen about this incident.  Of 

the 124 participating teams at this particular festival,  they are now aware that there is 

existing  in  this  world  a  country  called  the  Cook  Islands.    Mr  Speaker,  Over  4,000 

delegates were dining at that time.  I would say Mr Speaker, that it is very good aspect 

that we promoted the Cook Islands at this function that we attended.  Luckily we were 

not asked the question, how is our economy is doing?  We were not there to talk about 

our  economic  situation  we  were  there  to  represent  the  Cook  Islands  at  this  festival.  

</span><span>Whatever we brought back, please don’t look down on us.  Thank you Mr Speaker.</span></div><div><span>I would like to come back to this Paper and Report.  I would like to congratulate the 

implementation of this Commission of Inquiry and for the Report that it has presented. 

I  am  just  a  little  disappointed  Mr  Speaker,  that  the  inquiry  did  not  go  into  further 

</span><span>corruption by Government.  We have heard and we have seen in the media all sorts of 

</span><span>complaints and I have wondered whether that would have been a good idea to include 

that  aspect.    In  order  that  there  are  no  more  doubts  about  all  these  corruption 

allegations that have been coming through the media all this time.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>3097 

</span></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>I have gone through the Report very quickly, Mr Speaker, since I received my copy.  

And I am satisfied with the Report, Mr Speaker, because it informs us, what has been 

done,  what  has  occurred,  and  what  has  happened  during  the  court  hearings  and 

furthermore,  what  conclusions  have  been  made  and  what  sentence  was  finalised.  

There are certain points in this Report that have already been outlined by the previous 

speakers.    Previous  speakers  expressed  their  views  about  the  weaknesses  that  are 

currently  existing  in  our  Acts.    One  thing  I  would  like  to  say  right  from  the  start,  I 

would  like  to  congratulate  Mr  Scott  and  his  Lawyers  for  pursuing this matter to  the 

point  of  it  becoming  an  inquiry.    It  is  a  pity  that this has not  been carried out  years 

ago.  I know of certain incidents, for example a couple of young ladies were hit by a 

truck  belonging  to  a  Government  Department  several  years  ago  right  opposite  the 

Ngatangiia Church on the road side.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I will interrupt you Honourable Member.  I can see we do not have 

the quorum.  I will ask the Clerk at the Table to ring the bell. 

</span></div><div><span>Bell rung 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Members.  You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  I like to thank the back benchers, I think the bad ones are 

the Ministers.   Thank you, Mr Speaker, for trying to get these Members to return to 

this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when I recall that particular accident, there is nothing to laugh about, Mr 

Speaker, there is nothing to joke about.  There were two people that died on the road.  

They  were  killed  by  a head on collision right  there and then.  And these two young 

girls  were  sisters  and  they  died  instantly.  I  have  heard  nothing  whatsoever  with  

regards  to  that  accident.    In  fact,  I  did  not  even  hear  of  a  hearing  or  court  case 

regarding that particular accident.  I went  around to see the police department about 

</span><span>the accident or whether it’s call an accident I am not sure, but there were two people 

</span><span>killed and I went to see them.  It appears to me Mr Speaker,  that there seems to have 

been  some  secrecy  surrounding  this  kind  of  incident  and  this  is  one  of  them.    For 

example,  who  decided  that  the  case  be  withdrawn?    Who  decided  that  it  is  not  a 

serious  matter?    Furthermore,    who  decided  if  it  was  just  an  accident?    And  who 

</span><span>decided that there should not be any court prosecution?   It was really sad Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>to  see  two  people  killed  and  nothing  seriously  done  to  look  into  the  matter  of  what 

actually  happened.    When  I  read  this  Report  here  about  Mr  Scott  and  his  incident, 

there is no doubt, Mr Speaker, it brings out the same background of those past cases.  

</span><span>So I am very pleased that this has taken place even though it didn’t happen during our 

</span><span>time.    The  main  thing  is  that  it  has  happened  now.    We  see  that  Mr  Scott  and  his 

lawyer  have  taken  this  up and a Commission  of Inquiry was put  together and hence 

this report in front of us.   

</span></div><div><span>And when you go through the report Mr Speaker, you could see mis-interpretations of 

</span><span>certain reports,  for instance the doctors report.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Honourable Member Mataio Aperau. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3098 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. APERAU:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, 

</span></div><div><span>I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Normal Extension speaking time be  

granted to the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  May I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mrs N. Munokoa 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the mover, and the 

seconder  and  Members  who  have  supported  my  extension  time.    Thank  you  very 

much and a special thank you to my brother in law in the back.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Report definitely shows things that could have been improved.  The 

Commission of Inquiry outlined some weaknesses that could easily be put right by the 

people  in  charge  of  those  areas.    The  Report  also  indicates    the  Police  have  been 

ineffective,  the  Crown  Law  office  has  been  ineffective  and  maybe  the  law  is 

ineffective.  But what it indicates really is that the lawyers fighting for the defendant 

seem to be more effective than all these departments: Police, Crown Law, and perhaps 

the  law  itself.    I  am  disappointed  to  hear  speakers  from  the  Government  side 

criticising that  the Commission of Inquiry did not indicate what should be done about 

it.  I have just gone through the Report quickly and I noted the Commission of Inquiry 

</span><span>did </span><span>indicate areas that should be put right.   

</span></div><div><span>If we are to improve our law, it refers us to the New Zealand Act which is the Victims 

</span><span>of  Offences  Act  1987.    You  see,  Mr  Speaker,  I  have  nothing  to  complain  about 

</span><span>concerning  the  report,  all  I  am  saying  is  I  am  glad  an  inquiry  has  been  made.    I  go 

along with what the Commission of Inquiry has stated and I think something should 

be  done  according  to  this  Report.    What  Government  probably  expected  was  the 

Commission  of  Inquiry  to  put  down  exactly  what  they  want,  whether  guilty  or  not 

guilty.  That is to the charge of attempted murder or at least to a charge that will have 

a sentence of not two and a half years, but much more than that.   

</span></div><div><span>I support the Report, Mr Speaker, and I hope something can be done about it in order 

</span><span>to  avoid  any  further  incidents  such  as  this  and  others  that  have  been  ignored  in  the 

</span><span>past.  Because if we look at it today, the unfortunate person has been Mr Scott, and we 

do not know who may be next.  Burglaries can occur in similar cases, maybe at a farm 

like mine, a shop, or any other place like these.  Anything can happen to these places.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>3099 

</span></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  up  to  Government  to  look  at  the  Report  and  say  “hey,  we  know  what  is  in  the 

</span><span>Report,  we know what is recommended and it is up to us to make something better 

</span><span>for this country”.  But if a Member of Government got up to say “we can’t see much 

</span><span>in the Report to tell us what to do.  Where else can we look to expect something better 

</span><span>to  be  done?”.    Even  in  the  views  that  there  is  nothing  much  in  the  Report  to  make 

</span><span>them  realise  what  is  better  to  be  done,  they  are  in  the  position  to  make  something 

better  because    the  seriousness  of  the  case  is  strong  enough  to  warrant  something 

better be done.  

</span></div><div><span>Before I sit down, Mr Speaker, I give my support to  the Report, and to give special 

greetings to our boys from New Zealand who are already here to prepare themselves 

for the game against Fiji.  I am not sure whether the Fijians are here already.  I would 

like to give both teams who are here a special welcome, and hope that the game itself 

will be in the best of sportsmanship for the benefit of sport.  Let us not look at it in the 

likes of war, but as a sport.  It has always been my belief that whoever performs well 

and does well to win the game, deserves to win.  I give my best wishes to both teams, 

especially to the team who will do their best, and better the other.  I am sorry to hear 

criticism of our boys who tried their best overseas, but on the other hand maybe they 

have been slack and not tried their best in order to come on top.  I feel sorry for them 

because  of  that  discouraging  comment.    I  would  have  liked  to  hear  words  of 

encouragement from our people.  At least our young people today can come to realise 

there  are  people  out  there  who  cannot  tolerate  our  athletes  who  perform  purely  for 

pleasure and not put in the hard commitment into the game that is sponsored.  When I 

look at the training our young people do today, it concerns me when I compare it to 

some  years  back  they  are  not  training  to  keep  themselves  fit,  they  are  adopting  a 

casual approach and that is not appealing. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Education and Tauranga Vananga, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I rise to support 

the motion for Paper No.50 and 68 to be received.  But before I express my views on 

the two Papers, I would like on behalf of my wife and family and our Constituency to 

pass on to the family of John Varu of Vaipae our condolences for the passing away of 

his wife and our Aunt Mere yesterday.  May the Holy Spirit be close to you all and us 

all, and comfort us all in our loss.  But we are confident with the promise of the glory 

</span><span>of the second coming and resurrection of the righteous. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly I would like to join other Members of Parliament who have spoken before 

me  in  wishing  our  two  teams,  the  Cook  Islands  Rugby  XV  and  the  Fiji  Rugby  XV, 

good sporting on Friday.  Of course we in the Cook Islands will look for a win by our 

national  team,  but  we  do  realise  our  team  is  the  underdog  in  this  encounter.    Any 

Cook Islander who does not wish our team to win is not a Cook Islander.  But it will 

be difficult of course.  However I would like to congratulate the Fijian national team 

because ... 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I have to interrupt the Honourable Minister, there is no quorum. 

</span></div><div><span>Ring the Bell.
