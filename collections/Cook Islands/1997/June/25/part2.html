<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Constitution  Amendment  (No.22)  Bill,  Third  Reading.    We  will now take the Third 

Reading.  The Honourable Minister of Finance, Hon. Sir Geoffrey Henry, K. B. E. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:  </span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you,  to  all 

Members of Parliament and a very warm Kia Orana to our people who are listening in 

to our discussion this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Constitution Amendment (No.22) Bill be now read a Third time. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  certain,  Mr  Speaker,  that  Members  of  the  House  will  recall  our  spirited 

discussion of this Amendment when the Second Reading was taken.  I have no wish to 

traverse the Merits and Principles of the Bill, nor indeed the various important issues 

raised in  connection with  it.  Suffice to  say, that it is one extra aspect of the reform 

programme  that  Government  is  bringing  into  place.    It  goes  without  saying,  Mr 

Speaker, that the reform is an ongoing exercise and may at times necessitate bringing 

statutory  documents  for  approval  of  this  House.    This  Constitution  Amendment  has 

been laid off for the constitutionally required 90 days and those 90 days are now up.  I 

am  therefore  pleased  to  move  the  Motion  for  the  third  reading  of  the  Constitution 

Amendment Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Prime Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Thomas Hewett. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  put  the  question  before  the  House,  because  this  is  a  Constitutional 

requirement,  I  would  like  to  ask  all  Members  to  rise  from  your  seats  when  the 

question is raised. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Constitution Amendment (No.22) Bill be now read a Third time 

</span></div><div><span>Those in favour please rise from your seats.
