<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  The Honourable Minister Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  just  rose  to  suggest  that  we  go 

through the clauses in parts. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  May I seek leave of the House? 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Short Title and commencement. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Short Title Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>2985 

</span></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>We will now deal with the Parts. 

</span></div><div><span>Part I -  Interpretation.  Part I includes Clauses 2 through to Clause 9. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Part I Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman  good  afternoon  to  you  and  to  all  Honourable 

Members  in  the  House.    I  notice  there  are  only  two  Cabinet  Ministers  in  the  House 

today and so I express to those who are away or unwell the best of health and let us 

hope with the right medication you will all be back on your feet in a few days time.  

Kia Orana to  you all.  Also to  the rest  of our people, I understand there are a lot of 

people  suffering  from  the  flu.    My  wife  is  one  of  them.    I  express  to  all  those  poor 

people suffering at this time, a very happy and pleasant recovery in due course. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr. Chairman, I have already indicated to the Minister in charge of the Bill that the 

</span><span>Opposition would like to see a speedy transition of the Bill as there is nothing new to 

cover, and therefore we could expect the Bill to be completed by this afternoon.  There 

are however two queries, maybe while we are going through the clauses the Minister 

might be able to get hold of the advisers because these two matters irk me somewhat.  

I  was  on  the  Select  Committee  and  these  issues  were  discussed  by  that  Select 

Committee, but I am still puzzled about these two areas.  I want to mention these two 

areas  quickly  and  resume  my  seat  and  hopefully  get  a  reply  to  it  later  on  in  the 

discussion on the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>The first one is to re-examine the question of pig food.  When we were on the Select 

Committee we were advised by the Government experts on the Bill that pig growers 

are already paying Turnover Tax on pig food, and because of that there is no point in 

giving pig food exemption under the Value Added Tax.  That was the advice given to 

us. 

</span></div><div><span>I have since that time held discussions with pig food importers, and they say while it 

must  have  been  on  paper  somewhere  that  Turnover  Tax  ought  to  be charged on pig 

</span><span>food,  the  practice  for  at  least  the  last  five  years  is  that  Turnover  Tax  has  not  been 

</span><span>charged.  I think the officials were correct when they said that on paper Turnover Tax 

was chargeable on pig food, but in practice it was not being collected.   

</span></div><div><span>A major importer the Honourable Minister Tupou Faireka confirmed he has not been 

charged Turnover Tax on pig food he has been bringing in.  Therefore that confirms it 

to me that while the officials were correct in saying pig food is subjected to Turnover 

Tax, it has not been charged - they were not collecting the tax on it.  I would like to 

draw  this  to  the  Ministers  attention  because  following  on  from  that  precedent  it  is 

</span><span>clear to me that pig food has not been exempted in the Second Schedule.  Although, 

</span><span>according to  the Second Schedule- animal  feed, not  being dog food or cat  food, has 

not been exempted.  I do not know what that means.  It also applies to imports on or 

before the 30th of June 2003.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify this issue.  I am quite 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2986 

</span></div><div><span>sure  then  there  will  be  a  lot  of  smiles  on  the  faces  in  just  about  every  household, 

because everybody breeds pigs, except for our SDA brethren, and they do need to buy 

pig food to help feed their pigs.  It is going to hurt everybody if there is going to be a 

12.5  %  increase  in  the  cost  of  pig  food  by  the  introduction  of  this  Bill.    Although 

people like the Honourable Member, Thomas Hewett eat pork regularly, most of the 

other law abiding SDAs do abide by their rule, and I am appealing this exemption to 

help people like the Honourable Member, Thomas Hewett, with their pork supplies. 

</span></div><div><span>It would also not affect the commercial breeders because they are entitled, if they are 

registered,  to  claim  back  their  VAT  contribution  because  they  are  commercial 

producers.  Whereas the end users, like us ordinary backyard pig breeders because we 

are not commercial producers, would not be able to claim it. 

</span></div><div><span>The second query that I have before I conclude my address on this Part is to ask the 

Minister-  what  has  happened  to  the  mediation provisions that we discussed, that we 

devoted so much time on?  I have been trying to look for it and I just cannot find it.  

The  mediation  clause  in  the  Bill  that  we  talked  about  in  the  Select  Committee,  Mr 

Chairman, is to give people a last chance before they go to Court.  A last chance to see 

</span><span>if somebody can referee the dispute between the individual and the Tax Department, 

</span><span>as a last possible reprieve before facing charges in Court.  We spent a lot of time in 

the  Select  Committee  explaining  this  to  the  officials  who  consisted  of  the  Solicitor-

General.    He  knows  how  we  feel  about  it.    This  was  a  unanimous  feeling  amongst 

Committee members, that before somebody appears in Court, knowing that if you face 

a charge under any tax law these are very tough and harsh.  You do not escape.  Very 

few  people  escape  the  tax  charges,  and  the  Committee  was  mindful  of  a  mediation 

provision to allow for some negotiations to take place before a person goes to Court.   

</span></div><div><span>Now it would upset me greatly if, having listened to the Committee - and I put a lot of 

onus on the Solicitor-General - he knows our position on this clause and we maintain 

that we are legislating for the Cook Islands - that we cannot be very harsh compared 

to,  say,  like  large  cosmopolitan  countries  like  New  Zealand  and  Australia,  that  we 

want our laws to have a human face.  It would create some upset when the Committee 

says  look,  put  some  provision  in  there  to  allow  mediation,  to  allow  a  last  minute 

possibility  of  avoiding  a  charge,  of  diverting  the  full  impact  of  the  law  against 

individuals  and  everybody  agreed  with  this  and  then  you  wait  for  the  Bill  to  come 

</span><span>through and show that, I can’t see that anywhere unless I’m going blind and somebody 

</span><span>can point it out to me.  To me </span><span>that’s a fundamental omission by the Solicitor</span><span>-General 

</span><span>to put this main clause in here to protect our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, the powers of the Collector under this Act, under the Income Tax Act, 

he would have the most formidable powers of any official, far  greater than even the 

Police.  The Collector can go into your bank account at the bank.  He can go through 

everything  that  you  have  in  the  Bank  as  long  as  you  are  based  here  in  the  Cook 

Islands.    So  when  you  are  charged  by  RMD,  when  you  are  prosecuted  by t</span><span>hem,  it’s 

</span><span>really  a  waste  of  time  pleading  not  guilty,  saying  no,  I  oppose  the  charge,  because 

usually when you get to that stage they would already have your bank account and all 

</span><span>your business records and it’s a hopeless exercise trying to fight it.  That </span><span>is why it is 

important  that  while  you  give  the  Collector  great  powers  to  access  your  records  - 

while you give the RMD major powers to investigate, there ought to be a cushioning 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>2987 

</span></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>effect  within  that  harshness.    There  ought  to  be  provisions  to  allow  some  kind  of 

remedial  negotiations  to  take  place  between  the  Department  and  the  victim  of  the 

exercise,  the  subject  of  the  investigation  who  would  otherwise  end  up  in  Court 

immediately. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my only concerns about the Bill.  Obviously nothing is perfect but it is there 

and I would say this Bill will probably be far more realistic and effective than others 

because  of  the  amount  of  work  that  has  been  put  into  it.    And  of  course  no  law  is 

permanent.    If  at  any  time  in  the  future  we  find  that  the  VAT  law  is  harsh,  and 

unconscionable, very tough on the people and the people are hurt by it, then we ought 

to review it again and definitely as the alternative Government in the future we will be 

very remedial to changes if the people so desire.  That would give comfort to those of 

our people who feel that the VAT is harsh.  That is just a word of comfort to say to 

our  people.    We  will watch it conscientiously from  the side, we will observe if it is 

going  to  hurt  the  people.    Then  the  next  Government,  the  Democratic-Alliance 

Government, will take care of things on your behalf. 

</span></div><div><span>So I shall leave you all with those fine thoughts.  Thank you very much Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister, Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Greetings to you, Mr Chairman, and 

Greetings  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  the  House  and  Greetings  to  our  people 

listening in to our debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  for  their 

assurance  that  the  VAT  Bill  will  pass  through  the  House  today.    Secondly,  Mr 

Chairman, I think some of his queries need some response from myself.   

</span></div><div><span>In response to his first query in regards to the exemption of VAT on pig food, I would 

like  to  state  categorically  that  that  is  the  case.    As  he  has  rightly  pointed  out  in  the 

Schedule, goods imported on or before the 30th June 2002 consisting of animal feed 

within Section 23.09 of the Cook Islands Customs Tariff, it is defined in there what 

animal feed is all about. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Does it include pigs? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  It defines stock food which means pig food, chicken pellets and 

other necessary food required to feed livestock.  But it does not include foodstuff for 

dogs and cats.   

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, Mr Chairman, the exemption is also included for fertilisers to encourage our 

backyard farmers.  Because they come under the same category as people who raise 

chickens or stock, these two measures the Committee felt should be included, a design 

</span><span>to encourage the backyard farmers to fend for themselves.   

</span></div><div><span>The reason there is  a definite date stipulated for the removal of this exemption is to 

encourage the farmer to take advantage of it straight away, rather than wait until they 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2988 

</span></div><div><span>are ready.  But that does not mean to say that in the year 2002, if the need is still there, 

it  will  not  be  continued.    As  that  is  the  date  stipulated  for  the  removal  of  the 

exemption.    This  is  designed  to  provide  a  five  year  grace  period  for  farmers  to  get 

their act together and take advantage of the concession incorporated in this year.   

</span></div><div><span>And  secondly,  Mr  Chairman,  with  regards  to  the  mediator  service  that  has  been 

</span><span>spoken about, towards the end of the Committee’s deliberations while it was preparing 

it’s draft report for the H</span><span>ouse, the Committee made several proposals to be included in 

the  report.    The  idea  being  for  these  proposals  to  be  incorporated  in  this  Bill.  

However  when  the  proposals  were  sent  to  the  officials,  they  felt  that  some  of  those 

proposals could be incorporated in the Bill, while others could become laws by way of 

Government  Policy Statements.  And unfortunately the mediator service came under 

that category.  I think that in the original draft there was a mediator service provision 

under the RMD, the Revenue Ministry Department.   

</span></div><div><span>For the sake of the Members I have already instructed the Tax team to provide policy 

measures  so  that  they  could  be  introduced  to  coincide  with  the  date  of  the 

implementation  of  the  VAT  Bill.    That  is  not  the  only  area  where  policy  decisions 

</span><span>need  to  be  made.    There  are  other  areas  the  officials  felt  were  more  practical  under 

</span><span>policy issues, rather than be incorporated in the Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>The feeling was that once this is incorporated in the Bill, you are locked into what that 

Bill says.  And there is very little flexibility to allow movement within the framework 

of what the intention is.  I will take heed also, Mr Chairman, of the comments that the 

Bill  can  always  be  changed  if  the  need  is  there.    In  fact,  Mr  Chairman,  during  the 

camera session last Thursday some concerns were expressed by some of the Members.  

But  the  Members  were  comforted  by  the  knowledge  that  the  Bill  can  always  be 

amended  to  suit  the  time.    So  I  would  like  to  give  further  assurance  that  that  will 

happen if there is a need to alter the Bill as we go along.   Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  your  staff  -  Kia 

Orana to the Honourable Members of this House and to our people listening in to our 

deliberations this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>I did not get up to criticise what has been said in this House, Mr Chairman, however I  

want to raise a few comments from the questions that I had asked on a particular topic.  

The  question  asked  was-  is  there  any  tax  exemption  on  pig  or  chicken  food?    This 

explained  by  the  Minister.    Those  who  feed  pigs,  Mr  Chairman,  are  concerned  and 

they want to know whether pig food will be taxed or not.  I am not raising this point 

because  I  do  not  need  to  feed  pigs.    No!    We  are  making  this  law  to  be  fair  and 

suitable for everyone.   

</span></div><div><span>A question I would like to raise is- what about people like me who order foodstuff to 

feed people?  I will be taxed on that.  My problem here is, I am asking why is it that 

commercial pig farmers get upset because they will be taxed with Value Added Tax 

on  the  pig  feed  that  they  import,  when  I  import  flour to  make bread to  feed people.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>2989 

</span></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Why do I get taxed on that?  Not just bread, Mr Chairman, I also order tins of corn-

beef and tins of fish, food that is part of our staple diet, that people here eat regularly, 

but I am still being taxed.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, my understanding is our laws are made for everyone not just to favour 

or for the advantage of a few, it is made for everyone.  The exemptions that are given 

under  this  VAT  Bill,  Mr  Chairman,  are  for  stock  feed,  pig  feed  and  chicken  feed.  

What about cat feed and rat feed?  They are still animals.  Why are we not exempting 

the importation of their feed?   

</span></div><div><span>I have nothing against what has been proposed in the Bill, Mr Chairman.  What I am 

concerned about are people who try and inject ideas that will be to their benefit only 

and not  for others.   I order foodstuff to  feed people from  which they get strength to 

feed their pigs, but they do not pay for the importation of their pig feed.  I have to pay 

tax if I have to import food to feed those people who feed their pigs.   

</span></div><div><span>I just thought I would get up, Mr Chairman, and talk about this particular topic.  I do 

not  want  those  import  pig  and  chicken  feed  to  feel  offended.    I  am  just  sharing  my 

</span><span>thoughts.  We have an abattoir to slaughter pigs, Mr Chairman, and we know that pig 

</span><span>meat is sold to people to eat.  This would be considered the same case as in my case, 

where  I  import  food  to  feed  people.    So  to  all  the  pig  growers  you  heard  the 

explanation given by the Minister, you are lucky.  That is all I am going to say, you are 

the lucky ones and we are the unlucky.   

</span></div><div><span>Next time we make a law, let us make it so that it will fit all cases, and be beneficial to 

everyone within the community.  If business people are going to be taxed let them all 

be taxed.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any other speakers?
