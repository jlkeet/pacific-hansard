<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Interrupted debate on the question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $378,000 for Cultural Development Stands Part of the Schedule. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers?  The Honourable Member Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>    Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Chairman,  and  to  the  staff  of  the  House.  

Greetings to the Prime Minister and his delegation who are overseas.  Greetings to the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Members  of  the  Government  side  and 

Members of the Opposition.   Greetings to you all.  Greetings to our people who are 

listening  in  to  our  debate  this  afternoon.    I  believe  that  people  have  turned  on  their 

radios in order to listen to our debate.  Mr Chairman, may I seek your indulgence to 

allow me to give special Greetings to my people in Aitutaki.  Greetings to the people 

of  Araura  Enua,  to  those  who  are  listening  and  to  those  who  are  not-  Greetings.    I 

believe you are listening in to the debate this afternoon in order to know what we your 

Members are debating in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I rise to give my support to the allocation for the Ministry of Culture.  

</span><span>This is one of the most important departments in our nation today.  This department 

</span><span>deals with the preservation of our culture, customs and traditions.  I believe I spoke on 

this  particular  department  last  year,  but  I  rise  now  because  I  have  a  request  to  put 

forward.    Now  I  rise  to  air  my  views  for  the  culture  and  traditions  of  Aitutaki.    I 

believe that this is  one of the islands whose culture has extended right round all the 

islands of the Cook Islands and beyond.   

</span></div><div><span>Today,  Mr  Chairman,  only  one  of  our  elders  survives  who  knows  the  culture  of 

Aitutaki, and most of the culture of the Cook Islands.  My concern now is what will 

</span><span>happen when this elder in our community passes away.  Yes, in the past he was called 

</span><span>upon, but that has not eventuated again for a long time.  Maybe his skills have been 

forgotten.  If it has not happened today, but I believe it will happen in the very near 

future.  I can recall one of the Land Court sittings on Aitutaki.  This man orally recited 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>3223 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>his genealogy.  He became exhausted after a while and ended up saying a parrot fish 

</span><span>lay  with  “manini”  and  they  brought  forth  offspring.    These  things  are  happening 

</span><span>nowadays.    A  lot  of  people  are  getting  wise  to  this  matter  because  they  know  their 

genealogy,  so  they  overcome  the  problems  that  the  old  man  said  earlier.    Mr 

Chairman,  I  know  the  allocation  for  this  department  is  not  enough.    I  trust,  Mr 

Chairman,  the  Minister  responsible  for  the  Cultural  Division  and  the  head  of  that 

division are listening to what I have to say.  I am looking for an extra sum of money to 

be  allotted  in  order  to  extract  from  the  knowledge  of  this  old  man  so  we  may  all 

benefit from it.   

</span></div><div><span>I have taken this old man around the many maraes on Aitutaki and each time he will 

say this belongs to so and so and then he gives the chant to go with each marae.  If this 

dear old man passes away then the young people will come up with their deceit and 

lies  and  the  knowledge  of  this  old  man  will  be  lost.    So,  Mr  Chairman,  this  is  the 

reason for my request for some more funds, for this dear old man. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  This is your second speech Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span>  During the times that the culture of our various islands come up on 

TV, I very entertained by the culture of Mangaia.  You will see the truth in some of 

the things they say, and you will also  see the compromising and the cheating that is 

coming out of it. 

</span></div><div><span>This is why I rise to speak.  To put in this request application, Mr Chairman, because I 

can feel that this problem will come up in the very near future.   

</span></div><div><span>I can recall when an orator once brought  forward a story.  He said, the canoe of Ru 

came  from  Haumoana  and  Akitua.    There  are  a  lot  of  people  who  know  about  this 

legend that I have mentioned and they believe that Ru did come from Haumoana and 

</span><span>Akitua,  and  not  from  Rautaro.    The  small  islet  in  the  Aitutaki  lagoon  got  it’s  n</span><span>ame 

</span><span>“Akitua” when Ru’s brother broke his spine.  The legend or genealogy that Ru came 

</span><span>from Rautaro eventually faded away.  If this story is not upheld today, the people will 

come  up  with  their  own  stories,  saying  that  Ru  came  this  way  and  this  way,  so  the 

culture will be lost. 

</span></div><div><span>I know that the $378,000 allocated for Cultural Department will not be sufficient, but 

</span><span>still  I  wish  to  raise  this  point  while  the  Minister  is  listening  to  me  and  to  see  if 

</span><span>something can be done.  I also know, Mr Chairman, that the Constitution Celebrations 

are also conducted by this Department, but a lot of the celebrations will not be carried 

out this year because of insufficient funds.   

</span></div><div><span>We see and we hear of a lot of people saying that the country has gone down because 

of  this  Government.    We  all  have  some  kind  of  understanding,  Mr  Chairman.    We 

know  our  Bibles.    We  are  Christians  leading  today.  We also  should know why our 

country  has  encountered  this  problem.    Well  before  this  happened,  Mr  Chairman, 

</span><span>Honiara is one of those countr</span><span>ies who don’t celebrate their independence day because 

</span><span>of lack of funds, and other countries.  The Opposition side is saying it was you who 

led our country into this position and I am sure your people will be surprised if I say 

who  led  our  country  into  this  problem.    The  word  of  God  says-  </span><span>“there  is  a time for 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3224 

</span></div><div><span>every season under the sun”.  Therefore there is a time for plenty of money and a time 

</span><span>for to be poor.  There is a time for good and a time for bad.  So it has already been 

established.  I am  not  a prophet  but  I have read the Bible.  So I refer to  the Second 

Timothy,  Chapter  2,  Verse  3  which  says  the  cause  of  this  problem  is  greed, 

dissatisfaction etcetra. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  talking  about  the  Cultural  Department  and  the allocation of funds towards this 

department  in  the  Budget.    That  is  why  I  rose  before  anyone else, Mr Chairman, so 

that no one will criticise, because they were saying they will not criticise.  That is why 

I got up, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  go  further,  Mr  Chairman,  the  Opposition  is  thinking  that  when  there  is  a 

General Election they will become Government. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>We are not on that topic yet Honourable Member.</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>    I  have  a  chant  that  I  will  recite  as  it  always  comes  up  whenever  I 

encounter problems,  wherever I may be.  This  is  how it goes- nothing is impossible 

with God.  If this is how they are thinking in the time to come, I am saying that there 

is nothing that God cannot do. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    This  is  your  last  speech  time  Honourable  Member.    So  let  us 

speak to the allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  the  culture  of  today  is  not  following  our  traditional 

ways.    I  compare  the  composed  songs  of  our  people.    I  would  like  to  say,  Mr 

Chairman,  that  our  traditional  hymns  are  now  fading  away.    Our groups singing the 

ute  are  fading  away  and  also  other  traditional  ways  of  singing,  they  are  all  fading 

away.  This is the kind of thing that the Cultural Department should be concentrating 

on, to maintain all these kinds of traditional singing.  One day, Mr Chairman, I called 

out  to  my  grandson  to  get  a  hammer  for  me,  but  he  stared  at  me  and  did  not  even 

know what I was saying.  I spoke in Maori to him initially and he did not understand 

me,  but  when  I  spoke  in  English  he  then  understood  what  I  wanted.    Today  our 

language is gradually fading away and soon we will be speaking in English for most 

of the time.   

</span></div><div><span>I enjoy traditional hymns, Mr Chairman, because every time I hear them being sung I 

join in and sing along.  In our Church we are not allowed to sing traditional hymns in 

Church, we have to  sing  them at  home.  Some religions of today are not allowed to 

sing  these  traditional  hymns,  but  English  songs  only.    These  traditional  hymns  are 

disappearing,  Mr  Chairman,  because  our  elderly  people  who  are  the  composers  of 

these traditional hymns had taken them from the Bible, verses from the Bible and then 

composed into hymns.  There are many hymns being sung today that are not from the 

Bible, and the very traditional hymns that are brought out from the Bible are no longer 

being used. 

</span></div><div><span>So this is my humble request before us to see that these areas are taken care of so that 

our future generation will not miss these opportunities. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>3225 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>There are things happening today, Mr Chairman, such as when we form a “paepae” or 

a “marae” nowadays, anybody can put stones around a place and call it a “marae”, and 

</span><span>yet these stones are from the beach or have rolled down from the mountain.  People 

</span><span>have collected them and put them together, saying this is a “marae”, but it is not.  </span></div><div><span>In one instance we went around to inspect the maraes and we came across a stone and 

</span><span>he said to me “this stone is for Tane”, which I understood it to be at the time the stone 

</span><span>for  Otaua.    It  commemorated  the  place  where Otaua had jumped to  his  death.   This 

</span><span>man said “no this stone is for Tane”.  In Vaipae there is a stone for Tane.  So these are 

</span><span>the  kinds  of things  where somebody creates his  own stories as to  the legends of the 

island.  Luckily I was aware of the legend.  I will tell my children the exact location of 

these stones, and I will not follow what this man has said.   

</span></div><div><span>Before I run out  of my time, Mr Chairman, I would like to raise my point again for 

some allocation to help restore and maintain our legends , culture and traditions.  Now 

my time has run out.  I say thank you to you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Ngamau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>    Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Greetings  to  you  Deputy 

Prime  Minister-  Acting  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  also  to  Honourable 

Members  on  the  Government  side,  and  Greetings  also  to  us  on  the Opposition  side.  

Greetings  also  to our people listening in to our debate this afternoon and also to the 

staff members in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise, Mr Chairman, even though I did not expect to express any objections.  I have 

my own views that I would like to share.  When I look at the Cultural Development I 

think  this  appropriation  allocated  to  Cultural  Development  is  a  waste  of  time.  

Because  I  know,  Mr  Chairman,  there  are  a  lot  of  things  that  is  happening  in  our 

country that our country cannot up-keep.  There is a department that is now crying out 

who will bring good health to our country and to our people.  So I feel, Mr Chairman, 

that it is a waste of time to allocate this fund for the Cultural Centre.   

</span></div><div><span>Our culture as  far as  I can remember, Mr Chairman, is  our own language which we 

teach in our own homes.  And when we go to school the teachers train us to speak our 

</span><span>language and also to learn our culture.  And when we go to church we are taught the 

</span><span>Christian way of living. 

</span></div><div><span>There are times in our lives when we have to show what we have learned in school.  

Before people only used this knowledge when tourists visited our country.  From 1965 

to 1990, where we once displayed our culture during celebrations in Tupapa, this site 

was  only  a  small  place.    Every  year  each  island  in  the  Cook  Islands  came  here  to 

Rarotonga, and they lived in the meeting houses for one week.  During this time they 

displayed the culture of their individual islands.  In 1992 the auditorium was built and 

</span><span>I will admit that this is a very nice building, but at the expense of the people because 

</span><span>they  are  the  ones that got  laid off.  Today people are crying, Mr Chairman, because 

Government cannot provide things for them any longer.  I want to ask the Government 

Members- what are you going to do about this?  I do not want any of them to say that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3226 

</span></div><div><span>they do not know what is happening.  What are we going to do about this?  What is 

happening in our country today?  Mr Chairman, my suggestion is to slash the budget 

for  Cultural  Development,  although  this  has  been  in  operation  for  five  years  now, 

people can still perform their arts or perform their culture within this building.   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  aware  of  the  loan  that  we  still  have  to  pay  for  this  building.   Vote Item 3, Mr 

Chairman, the information services, if people are getting information from this place 

then that money should go to pay those who work within this place.  The fourth one is 

quality  improvement  of  visitor  attraction.    The  fifth  one  is  culture  and  historical 

heritage, and the sixth is the Forum and I will not talk about that.  These are some of 

the areas that will get money from the appropriation, they will collect the money, Mr 

Chairman.  My request is- </span><span>why don’t we use those revenue generating areas to collect  

</span><span>money  and  work  it  out  in  a  way  where  it  will  pay  those  who  work  for  this  place.  

Although the budget for Cultural Development has been slashed from over $400,000 

to $378,000 I think in this time of financial difficulty there are other important areas 

where  this  money  can  be  better  used.    Those  are  my  views  on  this  Vote  Item,  Mr 

Chairman.  I do not have anything to say about culture like the Honourable Member 

had.    My  culture  is  to  look  for  money  to  help  myself  and  also  my  family  my 

community.  Those are my contributions.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Acting Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you, Mr Chairman, and your staff.  Kia Orana 

also to Honourable Members on both sides of the House, and special Greetings to our 

people.  I also extend a special one to my constituency of Pukapuka and Nassau- Kia 

Orana to you all today.   

</span></div><div><span>The allocation before us now is for $378,000 for Cultural Development.  It is very sad 

to hear the comments from the Opposition not only this year but in past Budgets, also 

how little they value our culture.  Mr chairman, any race or any people that does not 

have a culture has no firm foundation, they are only drifting.  On the other hand, Mr 

Chairman,  I  want  to  inform  the  staff  working  for  Cultural  Development  that  if  the 

Demo Alliance Party becomes the Government, they will abolish this Ministry.  It is 

of no importance to them. In the past, Mr Chairman, other departments have tried to 

teach our children about our Culture but what they teach is only some of it, not all of 

</span><span>it.    The  little  that  they  have  taught  our  children  we  should  not  ignore,  but  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, we should thank them for their efforts.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  personally  I  would  have  wanted  to  give  more  money  for  Cultural 

Development in this allocation because this Ministry is now trying to get the legends 

and  customs  from  each  island  and  what  they  have  obtained  is  only  some  of  them.  

What I want is all of them, so they can be written down.  Mr Chairman, we have to 

remember that now we are going into a new age.  Many things have changed.  Sooner 

or  later  we  will  forget  our  heritage,  the  heritage  of  the  people  of  the  Cook  Islands.  

</span><span>You only have to look at the indigenous people of Australia and New Zealand.  They 

</span><span>are  struggling  to  revive  their  culture  in  order  that  they be seen as the people of that 

Country.    If  we  are  not  careful  Mr  Chairman,  as  the  Honourable  Member  from 

Aitutaki Paora Teiti said, we will lose our culture.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>3227 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  the  building  this  Government  has  built  to  preserve  our  culture,  the 

Opposition  is  always talking a lot about  it.  Mr Chairman, we do not  have to  worry 

about  this  because  when  a  new  Government  comes  into  power,  if  they  think  the 

building is unnecessary they can demolish it.  However, as long as this Government is 

in  power,  this  buildings  stands  because  it  is  a  place  for  our  culture  to  be  displayed.  

For  our  people  pride  to  be  displayed.    We  should  not  look  at  the  building  and  how 

much money has been spent on it.  We should look at aspects other than the Budget.  

For example, what new things have we learnt from this place.  If we look at the many 

cultural groups that have been through the Cook Islands displaying the culture of their 

country.  If we did not have this building, where are they going to show it?  Are they 

going to show it in the little shacks the Demo Government left us?  Even our young 

people have this pride within them.  In this building they can do their culture to the 

best of their ability.  Mr Chairman, they know that they have a building to show their 

culture.  They will not be discouraged to show that in this building.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I was saddened to see the TV programme abolished that was promoted 

by  the  Cultural  Development  Ministry.    When  the  Cultural  development  asked  an 

orator to tell the legends of the Cook Islands, I am sure that there were many people 

who  were  amazed,  it  was  the  first  time  they  had  even  heard  of  such  information.  

There are many things that Cultural Development can do for the Country but because 

of the lack of funding, their wings have been snipped.  Mr Chairman, the Leader of 

the  Opposition  last  year  said  our  people  know  their  culture,  there  is  no  need  for  a 

Ministry.  A lot of people in the Cook Islands think culture is just about dancing.  In 

bigger  Countries  they  value  their  culture,  they  pay  people  to  gather  information  and 

statistics to use for future generations. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  one  of  the  most  important  allocations  this Government  has brought  into this 

House.    Mr  Chairman,  as  I  said  earlier,  although  those  who  work  for  the  Cultural 

Development Ministry want to do more for culture in our Country they are limited by 

funding restrictions.  

</span></div><div><span>Action songs are not a permanent culture of this Country, it is a temporary culture.  As 

the  Honourable  Member  Paora  Teiti  said  earlier,  a  lot  of  our  traditional  hymns  and 

chants  are  slowly  fading  away.    When  the  Song  Quest  comes  around  we  hear  our 

young people singing English songs instead of Cook Islands songs.  This is dangerous 

to our culture.  It shows our people no longer have pride in their culture. 

</span></div><div><span>By  right,  Mr  Chairman,  I  should  not  have  any  concern  about  this  because  my 

language, the language that I speak on my island is written and our legends have been 

written and we teach that to our children in our schools.  I have a lot of sympathy for 

what is happening here on the island of Rarotonga, Mr Chairman.  That is why I am 

voicing  my  concern.    Also,  in  regards  to  the  way  our  people  speak  today  and  our 

children speak today, Mr Chairman.  You will hear them speak a few words of Maori 

and the rest  is  in  English.  Mr Chairman, I am  not  saying that it is bad to teach our 

</span><span>people  what  happens  today  or  in  today’s  life.    They  should  have  an  understanding 

</span><span>about  the outside world  and that has  been made available to  them because they will 

need it one day when they go to these places, when they leave this Country. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3228 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I attended a meeting in Auckland in 1982.  The problem that was put 

forward  in  that  meeting,  Mr  Chairman,  was  one  of  communication  between  parents 

and their children because the children speak a different language to the parents and 

the parents find it very difficult to understand what the children are saying.  Thus, it 

was a communication problem.  The solution that we  came up with at that time, Mr 

Chairman,  we  told  them  that  the  problem  was  that  you  taught  your  children  one 

language  only.    Because  the  language  taught  at  school  is  the  language  you  are 

speaking  at  home.    You  are  supposed  to  be  speaking  to  your  children  in  your  own 

mother  tongue  and  when  they  go  to  school,  they  learn  the  other  language.      The 

parents  feel  like  strangers  because  they  cannot  communicate  with  the  members  of 

their family. 

</span></div><div><span>I will finish here, Mr Chairman, and save my speaking time maybe later on.  I feel that 

I have said enough in support of this allocation for Cultural Development.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Deputy Prime Minister.  Can I have a next  speaker 

please? 

</span></div><div><span>I can see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you and your staff 

and Honourable Members, and to our people listening in - Kia Orana.  Kia Orana to 

the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  who  is  busy  doing  some  work  for  the  Country    -  Kia 

Orana - but of course he has no hesitation with us in the House to do our part as an 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>It surprised me, Mr Chairman, when I saw the Honourable Member, Paora Teiti stand 

up  very  quickly  this  afternoon  to  get  on  to  his  colleague,  the  Honourable  Minister, 

Ngereteina  Puna  to  do  something  about  his  request  that  he  has  given  in  the  past.    I 

sympathise with him.  I would have thought, Mr Chairman, that being in Government, 

he has easy access  to  any Minister of Government  to demand what he wants for his 

constituency  or  for  his  people  for  that  matter.    Is  this  an  indication  of  not  working 

together, not being able to do business together instead of bringing it to the notice of 

</span><span>the  House.    I  strongly  support  the  Member’s  views  and  I  demand  that  the  Minister 

</span><span>respond to that request of the Honourable Member, Paora Teiti.  

</span></div><div><span>You  know,  Mr  Chairman,  we  have  been  talking  about  this  Cultural  Development 

</span><span>Department all this time, ever since this Government took over and ever since they put 

up this massive building which cost this Country millions and millions of dollars.  We 

have not finished talking about it because it pushed this Country down, down to the 

lowest bottom of the hole.  This was not built for our culture, Mr Chairman.  This was 

built as a monument for this Prime Minister today.  We warned this Government time 

and  time  again  that  this  asset  is  going  to  drag  us  down  the  hole,  but  nobody  in 

Government  listened  to  us.    We  advised  them,  that  we  cannot  see  how  the  revenue 

from this huge asset is going to repay the loan on itself.  I must say that a lot of the 

</span><span>Ministers and Members today did not have anything to do with that decision because 

</span><span>they were not in Government then.  However, I know that back row of Cabinet, round 

the back there, they are the ones who pushed for this massive and huge debt for this 

Country. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>3229 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Ever  since  the  establishment  of  this  building,  Mr  Chairman,  this  Cultural 

Development Centre, has not really come up with a good Government Policy for the 

establishment, for the administration, for the revenue making of this Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>I know what we are going to do with this when we become Government.  This is one 

department, Mr Chairman, that should be privatised.  There should not have been two 

Museums  on  this  island.    There  should  not  be  two  Libraries  on  this  island  and  you 

</span><span>don’t need the Government Department to run the culture of this Country.  We have 

</span><span>had no department in the past, at times specifically allocated or established to run the 

culture.  The responsibilities have been provided as part of a department, like Internal 

Affairs.  And our culture was being handled with no trouble at all in those days.  And 

we  did  not  have  to  come  into  the  House  and  say,  where  is  the  money.    There  is  no 

money  for  the  culture  but  at  one  stage,  Mr  Chairman,  we  had  to  allocate  over  $3 

million  for  this  department.    I  said  earlier  Mr  Chairman,  that  when  we  become 

Government, we know what to do with this and what I am saying is, today the policy 

of revenue making for this department, for this Culture Centre is almost zero.  At one 

time over $3 million was appropriated for this Cultural Development Centre and the 

revenue  we  had  was  only  $50,000.    Today,  what  do  we  see.    We  see  only  $25,000 

revenue from this Ministry.  That is why I am saying, we had to do something better 

than this and the answer to that is, give it to the private sector.  I know every Minister 

who goes to Hawaii, they are invited to go to this BYU and when they come back they 

tell us how beautiful it was, how successful it was.  I have been waiting for them to do 

something  about  this  huge  asset  that  we  have,  something  similar  to  that.    However,  

they have not done anything about it in order to stimulate the revenue building for this 

Culture Center. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  been  encouraging  our  people  from  the  Outer  Islands  to  build  themselves, 

around  this  building  ,  homes  or  halls  to  look  after  their  people  when  they  come  to 

Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  You may take your second speaking time Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    And  each  island  have  done  their  best  to  establish  these 

buildings surrounding this massive building.  And yet, we have not even opened our 

eyes,  this  Government  have  not  even  opened  their  eyes  to  do  something  within  that 

compound in that massive building with million and millions of dollars invested to do 

</span><span>something like that.  I am sure, Mr Chairman, there are talented people, perhaps those 

</span><span>who are working for that department.  Or those who have left the Country because of 

frustration at the way this Country is run by this Government.  Or even people in the 

private  se</span><span>ctor  now  I  am  sure  have  the  talent  to  utilise  this  massive  asset.    We  can’t 

</span><span>even afford to pay the loan right now.  

</span></div><div><span> So we are asking the question, Mr Chairman, what is the Nauru Government doing 

</span><span>today  about  the  loan  for  this  Culture  Development  Centre?    Because:  (1)  we  can’t 

</span><span>continue paying the loan (2) this massive asset is  mortgaged against the Rarotongan 

</span><span>Hotel.    When  you  read  the  newspaper  you  will  understand  the  lack  of  advanced 

</span><span>planning  about  possible  changes  and  that  possible  change  is,  one  of  them  has 

happened now.  The Government of Nauru has changed.  Whereas, when the previous 

Nauru  Government  was  in  power  the  deal  was  acceptable  and  problems  were  not 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3230 

</span></div><div><span>foreseen.    Now,  However,  we  know  that  there  is  a  change  of  Government  and 

therefore,  the  mortgage  no  longer  has  the  same  understanding  between  the  two 

Governments  this  loan  for  the  Cultural  Development  Centre.    So  where  do  we  end, 

now are we better off or are we worse of?  It is quite obvious, Mr Chairman, that we 

</span><span>are  worse  off  and  I  don’t  want  to  go</span><span>into  talking  about  Tata  Crocombe’s  free, 

whatever you call it, deal with the Rarotongan Hotel, I don’t want to touch that.  </span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please come back to the allocation Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Yes of course, Mr Chairman, I do not want to touch that 

anyway.    My  concern  is  there,  Mr  Chairman,  and  I  hope  that  this  Government  will 

start  looking  at  the  interview  of  utilising  this  huge  investment  that  we  have  in  this 

</span><span>building  and  do  something  that  will  create  revenue.    Don’t  depend  on  these</span><span>  outside 

people that may come to the Cook Islands one day and have their entertainment in the 

hall.  Get something programmed so that you have every week a festival or a culture 

like they have in Honolulu at the BYU.  Where they have every night, even if we have 

it  just  one  day  a  week  is  enough  for  a  start  with  getting  all  the  islands  to  produce 

something and call it a culture night or something like that.  Do something.  It appears 

to me, Mr Chairman, the tendency is to look outside of the Cook Islands, who may be 

</span><span>interested  in  investing  in  the  Cook  Islands.    Why  can’t  we  just  see  it  beyond  our 

</span><span>noses?  There are people here who have got the talent and invite them to do something 

about it.  Encourage them to do it and they will do it if they are given a chance.  

</span></div><div><span>You know, I listen to the Government Members get up and talk about Korero, getting 

on TV to tell the Korero about each island.  You know, when you listen to some of 

them, half of them are true, half of them are just made up stories.  It is all right now 

because  it  is  the  sponsors  who  pay  them,  but  before  this  Government  was  paying 

everything.   Sometimes when these kind of programmes come on, you can easily tell 

some  of  them  are  half  true.    You  think  that  you  can  bring  a  programme  like,  how 

farmers  can  get  together  and  encourage  breeding  of  animals  or  whatever,  for  the 

</span><span>benefit of the Country but you don’t you get all these rubbish put on TV and you hope 

</span><span>that the programme will pass quickly and get onto something better.  The emphasis by 

Government Memb</span><span>ers seem to go, I will finish, I don’t care if somebody criticises me 

</span><span>about it.  Some of the Government Members were saying that, the Korero you know 

</span><span>that they are putting the emphasis on this alone.  Don’t think that we don’t have our 

hearts.  Don’t think that it is only establishing a cultural development centre in order 

</span><span>to hold our culture.  If you have a $20 million massive building that you cannot put 

</span><span>the culture properly, or utilise, establish and administrate it. What is the use of a $20 

million building that cannot handle the culture properly.  I even hear them saying, well 

</span><span>today the “imene tuki” is not sung as often as in the past.  What is happening?  You 

</span><span>have got the facilities to maintain that and you are losing it.  You are admitting that 

you are losing it so what is the use of a culture development when you are admitting 

</span><span>that you are losing it.  So I don’t understand the point, Mr Chairman, the only thing 

that I can understand is they can’t run this Country properly.   And for them to own up 

</span><span>and say, oh well you are right Mr Lloyd Powell this Country is bankrupt and we have 

</span><span>to go into a General Election.  Because this is still a concern to me, Mr Chairman, that 

</span><span>nothing  has  come  up  to  protect  Government  in  saying  that  Lloyd  Powell  made  a 

mistake in making that fax message. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>3231 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    You  have  gone  astray  Honourable  Member,  come  back  to  the 

point. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Oh  well,  because  we  are  talking  about  money,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, I can’t help touching on that.</span></div><div><span>This  allocation  I  would  have  preferred  to  give  it  to  the  Health  Department.    Do  not 

misunderstand me in thinking that I do not care for my culture.  My priority is, there 

are people dying up there because of lack of funds.  There are people now depending 

on  Maori  medicine  more  so  because  when  they  go  to  the  Hospital  there  is  an 

inadequate supply up there.  They depend too much on the traditional medicine when 

some of them should have been referred to where better medication could have been 

administered.  The unfortunate thing is they are dying by going through this confusing 

process.    If  the  Minister  wants  me  to  prove  that,  I  can  because  I  have  handled  a 

patient.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please come back to the Vote Item Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I got carried away because I see 

the  importance  of  the  allocation,  more  so  for  the  Health  Department  and  I  want  the 

Minister to help me there.  Of course this has already been allocated by the Minister of 

Cultural  Development,  the  Honourable  Ngereteina  Puna.    He  thinks  more  of  this 

Cultural Development than he does of the schools.  Because the schools urgently need 

his  support.    I  know  he  has  put  his  job  on  the  line  and  I  would  like  to  see  what 

happens  when Education realises  what  an inadequate budget  this Minister has given 

them.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I do not  give my support to this allocation because I see more urgent 

needs  elsewhere  today.    It  is  unfortunate  because  there  are  people  working  in  this 

Ministry who have been trained and who have talent, but the amount of money is only 

enough to keep them going and it is not enough to supply them with materials for the 

job they have to do.  I have been in the situation where I find people trying to look as 

though they are doing something.  It is not their fault.  The fact is they do not have the 

materials and facilities and are just trying to do something out of nothing.   

</span></div><div><span>Even if Government is fed up with us raising the issue about the massive loan for this 

massive building, we have committed the country to the fact that we are going to keep 

on reminding them until they get out of Government.  They are still bragging about it. 

So thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member for Vaipeka, Tautu and Vaipae Thomas Hewett. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEWETT:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to  you and to  your staff.  

Kia Orana to our people who are listening in to the radio this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give my support to the allocation of $378,000 for Cultural Development.  I 

strongly believe this will be enough to look after them for this financial year.  I feel 

they  are  doing  something  to  help  us  because  they  will  be  collecting  revenue  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3232 

</span></div><div><span>$25,000.    I  strongly  feel,  Mr  Chairman,  the  allocation  provided  for  Cultural 

Development will help those who work for this Ministry to gather the our culture and 

preserve it.  Also, to gather antiquities and preserve them in Cultural Development.   

</span><span>They organise activities such as the Song Quest and the children’s dance competition.  

</span><span>I have done research on genealogies and I conducted some of my research from this 

place.    From  this  place  I  managed  to  get  a  book  on  different  legends  and  stories  of 

each island.  I feel the staff of Cultural Development are doing their work to the best 

of their abilities.   

</span></div><div><span>I am happy, Mr Chairman, because the Honourable Member Ngamau Munokoa got up 

and  said  to  her  supporters  who  work  in  Cultural  Development-  </span><span>“you  should  be  sent 

home”.    This  is  to  tell  our  people  if  they  become  the  Government  they  will  abolish 

</span><span>Cultural Development.  This Government will not do that.  This Government will give 

more  money  for  the  Ministry.    This  Government  has  to  distribute  Government 

resources fairly amongst all the Ministries.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  the  Honourable  Member  Ngamau  Munokoa  said  “our  people  are 

crying”.  I will prove to you they are not.  You only have to go to the bars and you will 

</span><span>find our people there drinking, so where is the crying?  I have visited the bars before 

and now that the public workers have been laid off there are more people at the bars 

than  ever  before.    The  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Dr  Terepai  Maoate  said 

</span><span>“Cultural Development is pulling this country down”.  If they become the Government 

</span><span>they will show areas where improvement can be made for cultural development.  Mr 

Chairman they were the Government for some time and they did not do anything.  The 

roof still leaks.  They are saying to you today that when they become the Government 

they will look for other ways to improve things... 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span>  They were in Government and now they are talking about when 

they become Government.  I have challenged their leader to a bet on this, as to who 

will lose.  But he was afraid and did not honour the bet.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, yesterday one of my friends arrived on the island.  He was here in 1970 

</span><span>and he has been back to the Cook Islands five times.  He knows our culture of those 

</span><span>days.  He knows the place where our Culture is displayed.  He told me that the Cook 

</span><span>Islands’ culture in those days were like a horse race.  However this time when he came 

</span><span>back this time and saw the building for Cultural Development, he told me it is one of 

the best buildings here.  Mr Chairman, the last time this man was here, it was a rainy 

day when he visited the place where our Culture is displayed.  He could not believe it 

this time when everything is nice.  He told me he cannot see this anywhere in wealthy 

countries but you will see it in the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate, was saying they will privatise Cultural 

</span><span>Development  when  they  become  Government.    We  hear  these  days,  Mr  Chairman, 

those Members in the Opposition are saying they will privatise these places.  They are 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>3233 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>getting upset at what Government is doing privatising Government Departments today 

and yet we hear in this House now that they will privatise a Government department. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  This is your second speaking time Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span>  Maybe the Honourable Member did not realise he said this before 

and yet he is saying today something totally different.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I feel very proud of this Culture Centre because I like talking to women 

tourists.    I  do  not  think  the  Members  in  the  Opposition  will  get  upset  because  they 

have aged and they do not think about those things any more whereas for myself I am 

still young.  Mr Chairman, that is my culture, when I see these young girls, tourists, I 

go and talk to them and ask them what they think of the place and how they like it.  I 

have also asked them about the Culture Centre.  They tell me this is one of the best 

buildings in the Cook Islands and they have never seen anything like it anywhere else 

in the world.  The Honourable, Dr Terepai Maoate was saying that people are dying 

up  in  the  hospital  because  of  insufficient  funds.    This  happened  way  before,  Mr 

Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Member  had  also  said  that  the  Minister  for  Cultural  Development 

and  Education,  Ngereteina  Puna,  does  not  care  about  education  as  well.    When  we 

look  at  Education,  Mr  Chairman,  we  will  find  a  big  allocation  of  $3,155,000 

compared  with  that  of  Cultural  Development  which  is  only  $378,000.    I  want  the 

Honourable  Member,  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to  prove  to  this 

Government that people are dying because of no medication.  In New Zealand people 

are dying.  They have the machinery and the medication. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  Culture,  Mr  Chairman,  on  my  island  of  Aitutaki  there  are  many 

different  cultures  that  we  used  to  practice  that  are  not  being  shown  now.    In  my 

constituency  there  are  many  different  orators.    When  you  listen  to  their  stories  one 

tells a different story from the other.  So I support what my colleagues said earlier on 

that we should allocate some funds to give to this person so that his stories are written 

in a book. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, in my village there are different stories that we hear about Maru, how 

Maru got to the island and when and how he died.  And how Terae and his younger 

</span><span>brother grew up and what happened to them.  I also read in this book </span><span>“Te Korero”, Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, the story about what happened to Nokunoni.  Included was the legend on 

how Vaipae became victorious  in  the battle over Nukunoni.  One story was on how 

the Vaipae people made an oven so that everyone in that village died.  I enjoyed the 

Books  that  I  borrowed  from  the  Cultural  Development.    Especially  the  stories  they 

told about my island.   

</span></div><div><span>I am supporting the allocation for Cultural Development.  We are not giving $1 or $2 

million.  We are only giving quarters of a million dollars compared to Education who 

</span><span>we have given over $3 million, Health will be getting $3.5 million.  When you go on 

</span><span>what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, you will be lead to think that we have 

given more for Cultural Development than for Education and Health.  As I said earlier 

on,  Mr  Chairman,  in  my  village  they  are  building  canoes.    They  are  also  making 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3234 

</span></div><div><span>carvings  and  other  artifacts.    They  are  making  traditional  things,  Mr  Chairman,  to 

show the tourists visitors there. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  finish  here  at  the  end  of  my  second  speaking  time,  Mr  Chairman.  

Maybe some of the Members in the Opposition will get up and speak.  That is when I 

will  get  up  and  reply.    Now  I  would  like  to  give  my  support  for  the  allocation  of 

$378,000 for Cultural Development. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Upokomaki Simpson. 

</span></div><div><span>MR U. SIMPSON:</span><span>  To you, Mr Chairman, and Honourable Members on both sides 

of the House and to our people listening in - Kia Orana to you this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  stand  to  express  my  views  on  this  allocation  for  Cultural  Development.    I  do  not 

agree with this allocation, Mr Chairman.  However, I would like to propose that their 

budget or their allocation be reduced.  At this time, Mr Chairman, I do not think our 

culture will disappear.  In the past years, Mr Chairman, culture has been taught in the 

</span><span>Outer  Islands’  schools.    Also  in  the  homes,  the  grandparents  or  the  parents  of  our 

</span><span>children  teach  culture  to  our  children.    Also  within  the  tribes,  Mr  Chairman.    Each 

tribe has their own culture, and that is what is being taught to our people.  Our culture 

was upheld by our ancestors, Mr Chairman, and we are still upholding it.  I am sure 

this will carry on in the future.   

</span></div><div><span>The culture on the island of Atiu, Mr Chairman, was prohibited from being displayed 

at the Cultural Development Centre and was to be left on the island.  Because, some 

of the stories that are being told, Mr Chairman, it contradicts what has been told on 

Atiu.  I do not think our culture will disappear, Mr Chairman.  I think that it will live 

on for many years to come.  However, I do not think we should abolish the Cultural 

Development, Mr Chairman, because this was money spent from our people.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to say that for these difficult times, Mr Chairman, we should reduce the 

allocation  for  Cultural  Development  and  give  that  to  areas  that  are  in  need.    For 

example, the bridges.   As we read in  the newspaper this morning, Mr Chairman the 

bridges are unsafe.  Our bridges need to be improved because our </span><span>people’s lives are at 

</span><span>risk.  We do not know when these bridges will collapse.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, the same goes for the water here on Rarotonga.  It needs improvement 

because when it rains the water coming out of the tap is dirty.  This is not seen on the 

</span><span>island of Atiu, because Atiu’s water system is different to that of Rarotonga’s.  When 

</span><span>you  turn  the  tap  on,  even  on  rainy  days  on  the  island  of  Atiu  the  water will not  get 

dirty.   

</span></div><div><span>Likewise  with  Health  and  Education,  Mr  Chairman,  until  such  time  that we recover 

from  these  difficult  times  with  our  money,  then  we  can  look  at  other  areas  we  can 

</span><span>spend that money on.  Those are my comments, Mr Chairman, on this allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister for Health Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>3235 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Good afternoon to you, Mr Chairman, and Good afternoon to 

the  Honourable  Members  of  this  House,  to  the  Acting  Prime  Minister,  Ministers, 

Government Members, Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition 

and  Members  of  the Opposition- Kia Orana.  Kia Orana also  to  our people who are 

listening in to our discussions this afternoon.  To those here in Rarotonga those in the 

Southern  and  Northern  groups.    Kia  Orana  also  to  my  constituency  of  Tupapa  and 

Maraerenga,  to  all  the  people  living  there  Kia  Orana.    To  the  religious  leaders, 

traditional leaders and leaders of Government- Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand, Mr Chairman, to express my views on this allocation for Culture Development  

and  also  talk  a  bit  more  about  the  views  concerning  Health.  Mr Chairman, I am  in 

support  of  this  allocation  for  Cultural  Development  because  I  believe  that  it  is 

important for our culture to be looked after, to be preserved during this time.   

</span></div><div><span>I think, Mr Chairman, the time for debating the construction work has long gone, we 

should be concentrating more on what improvements we can bring to the service.  The 

money  that  was  used  to  develop  the  area  around  the  former  constitution  park  is  the 

money that we are owing the Nauru Government.  My ears are sick of listening to the 

questions  raised or asked by the Leader and the Deputy Leader and Members in  the 

Opposition on where the $3 million for the Rarotongan had gone to.  I want to confirm 

to  you,  Mr  Chairman,  and  Honourable  Members  and  our people that $3 million  has 

not  yet  been  given  to  Tata  Crocombe  and  Co.    The  money  given  was  $70,000,  Mr 

Chairman,  to  renovate  the  Rarotongan  but  that  money  was  not  given  to  Tata 

Crocombe.  We have read about this in the newspaper in the past few days.   

</span></div><div><span>What we are talking about is the allocation for Cultural Development.  The $3 million 

is not a transaction yet.  The money that we are talking about to be transacted between 

Tata and the Government is yet to transpire.  The points that have been raised by the 

Opposition are not true.  What the Government is doing now is negotiating with the 

Nauru  Government  so  that  the  mortgage  of  the  land  can  be  released  in  order  for 

Government  to  hand  over  the  contract  to  Tata  Crocrombe.    Secondly,  when  the 

transaction  that  Government  has  to  make  for  the  contract  is  completed,  then  that 

money will be refunded.   

</span></div><div><span>We  have  seen  the  great  reduction  in  the  allocation  for  Cultural  Development.  

</span><span>Workers  have  been  laid  off  from  the  Ministry.    Those  people  who  have  been  kept 

</span><span>behind  are  the  people  believed  to  be  able to  carry out  the functions of the Ministry.  

The  development  within  this  Ministry  has  been  seen  by  the  Government.    With  the 

reduction of around 50 Ministries previously in Government, this department is one of 

the surviving departments.  I strongly support the functions of the Ministry.  I am not 

concerned about the building, the statue, or whatever there is around the department, 

but my concern is that the development of culture in our country is for the importance 

of our own children when they grow up.   

</span></div><div><span>We used to carry out our constitutional celebrations in the past, but because of what 

the country is facing nowadays we have left those celebrations out.  The purpose is not 

to  forget  about  our  culture  and  not  to  forget  the  things  that  our  elderly  people  have 

passed down.  We can recall, Mr Chairman, that there were some artistic displays at

</span></div><div><span>the  centre.    We  discovered  the  talent  of  our  young  people  that  most  of  us  failed  to 

recognise  previously.    The  singing  talent  of  our  young  people  has  been  encouraged 

with the talent quests and the opportunities for them to compose songs.  So these are 

just some of the valuable things passed down or even created and demonstrated by the 

young  people  themselves  of  this  country,  and  these  are  the  things  that  need  to  be 

maintained.   

</span></div><div><span>To go back to the statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who said 

that  people  are  dying  because  of  insufficient  medication  at  the  hospital.    I  want  to 

assure the people that every request that was put forward by the Health Department to 

Government for supplies of medication and for assistance, the Government has not at 

any time refused these requests. Not at any time has this department objected to any 

recommendation by doctors for overseas treatment of patients.  

</span></div><div><span>During  the  time    the  Dengue  Fever  epidemic  affected  our  country,  at  no  time  did 

Government stop any request by the Health Department.  When we talk about death, 

death  comes  to  every  home  but  the  people  who  take  local  medicine,  it  is  their  own 

decision.    I  want  the  Deputy  Leader  of the Opposition  to  prove to  me that someone 

has died as a result of the hospital being unable to provide medicine and that person 

instead  turned  to  local  medicine.    There  are  minor  problems  occurring  amongst  the 

staff at the hospital but it is not something we should be using as a political attack on 

Government.  I ask, that if we are talking about the health of our people we should be 

talking directly to that person and not beat around.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, just recently I have appointed the Medical &amp; Dental Council with the 

Honourable  Dr  Robert  Woonton  as  Chairman  and  Dr  Wolfgang  Losaker  and  Dr 

George  Hosking  as  members.    If  there  is  a  problem  like what  we are trying to  raise 

these are the people who are to look into those problems.   

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  say  that  there  is  an  increase  in  the  Budget  for  the  Health  Department  of 

almost  $1  Million.    This  is  what  Government  has  done  for  the  Health  Department 

budget.  We have heard last time when we talked about the budget, that when  there is 

</span><span>a  reduction  in  one  department’s  budget,  there  is  a  benefit  in  the  Budget  of  another.  

</span><span>Like  the  Cultural  Department,  there  is  a  great  reduction  in  their  Budget  this  year  in 

order to substitute for the Health Department.  I will end here by giving my support to 

this allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  Greetings Mr Chairman, to all Honourable Members in the House 

and to our people who are listening to the debate, greetings to you all.  

</span></div><div><span>The first part of the Cultural Development allocation is Policy Advice.  $108,600 for 

Policy Advice only; in other Ministries they have been allocated over $2 Million for 

</span><span>the program of Policy Advice.  If we tried to put Policy Advice allocation together, we 

</span><span>do not need to lay people off their jobs.  There will be enough money there to pay for 

these people to work, those who are being made redundant.  Mr Chairman, before the 

Culture Centre was built, our children already knew about their culture.  There was a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>3237 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>great  amount  of  money  spent  on  the  Culture  Centre.    Before,  the  allocation  for 

Cultural  Development  was  $7  Million,  then  $5  Million,  3  million  and  now  it  is 

$378,000.  It even went up to the level of  $9 Million for this department.  $9 Million 

for  this  single  Ministry  alone.    This  is  a  very  nice  building  but  it  has  hung  a  rope 

around  the  necks  of  our  people,  the  people  of  the  Cook  Islands.    There  are  a  lot  of 

people who have been sent home from this department.  What do we want - to retain 

the building or retain these orators?  I suggest that we give Nauru the building in order 

for Nauru to release the Rarotongan Hotel.  If we can get $3 Million out of it, that is a 

lot of money.  There is a lot of money needed and required to maintain the building.  

Why not give it to Nauru and let them maintain and service the building?  This is our 

problem,  Mr Speaker,  the building is beautiful but it has become a rope around the 

necks of our people.  We should be looking after our people.  We ought to feel sorry 

for our children who are being sacked from their jobs because of the money that is tied 

up in this building.  Mr Chairman, I wish to retain our people and keep them working 

rather  than  look  after  a  building.    Those  people  who  were  sacked  are  hungry  now.  

Which do we prefer - to give them jobs and provide for the needs of our people?  I am 

happy to see our people working.  The old Constitution Park with kikau shacks which 

can be replaced each year and at no debt at all.  I would rather see that our people are 

happy than to have all the beautiful buildings in the world and our people go hungry 

and leave for Countries like New Zealand and Australia. So that we can see that we 

are much more happier for tourists to come around and see this big building but not 

realising that our children are suffering at home and are hungry because they do not 

have any money.  

</span></div><div><span>I feel sorry for the Minister at the time when he became Minister for this Department 

because the allocation has been cut right down.  Nevertheless, he is not the Minister of 

Finance  because  we  know  that  only  the  Minister  concerned  with  finance  is  the  one 

that gets the best because when the Prime Minister was Minister of Culture it was a 

very high budget but now it has been reduced, so I feel sorry for the Minister.  If only 

my people in my time saw the same thing as you are doing now I would be much more 

happier.  However, our people look  at  things carefully and see that the needs of our 

people are met first.  So my concern here, Mr Chairman, is for this policy advice.  If 

this policy advice is done away with, then leave the money to pay for the workers.  I 

would  be  much  more  happier  to  see  this  happen.    We  do  not  need  these  policy 

advisers.  What are they going to advise about?  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister for Tauranga Vananga, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman, and also thank you Honourable Members 

for your contributions and your support to the allocation to the Cultural Development 

Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to answer some of the points raised by the Members from the sea side, 

</span><span>our  friends  on  the  Opposition  side.    Yesterday,  I  relayed  some  messages  to  a  dear 

</span><span>mother  and  today  I  wish  to  do  the  same  thing  for  a  couple  of  mothers  and  I  will 

continue doing that for our elderly people. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3238 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to greet these dear Mamas:  Mama Takapu, Mama Maara, Mama Maui 

Mani, Mama Metua Solomona and Mama Tekeu and also to Mama Maine Tetevano. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to give my greetings also to our young people, Under 18s who 

will be representing the Cook Islands in Fiji which is led by Robert Savage and also 

Taiora Henry.  

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly,  my  greetings  to  Papa  Tekepu  Williams    presently in  hospital who I believe 

will be leaving for New Zealand for further medical treatment and I hope and pray that 

you go and come back well. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now speak upon this big allocation to the Tauranga Vananga in the amount of 

$378,000. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  That is the smallest. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    No  matter  how  much  money  is  allocated  to  any  department  we 

know  it  will  not  be  enough  but  we  will  have  to  accept  the  amount  allocated  to  us 

within our means, so the head of this Department has assured that they will do the best 

to  do  their  duties  within  and  to  make  sure  that  there  is  enough  funds  there  to  keep 

them  going.    I  would  like  to  congratulate  also  the  former  head  of  the  Cultural 

Development  Unit,  Tamarii  Tutangata  who  is  now appointed to  a higher position in 

SPREP  now  stationed  in  Apia,  Western  Samoa.    He  was  replaced  by  Mrs  Carmen 

Temata  earlier  this  year.   I would like to  thank these two because they were able to 

manage  the  affairs  properly  and  also,  they  spent  within  their  means  that  they  were 

given.    Although  t</span><span>hey  were  given  $473,000  in  the  last  financial  year’s  budget  they 

</span><span>managed to make a savings of $88,000. 

</span></div><div><span>While  I  am  congratulating  and  thanking  the  heads  of  the  Ministry  of  Cultural 

Development, I would like to thank the heads of the various Ministries because they 

managed to work within their budgets. 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at the outputs for Cultural Development for this financial year there are 

six major ones.  Output No.1 is Policy Advice; Output 2. Asset Utilisation; Output 3. 

Information  Services;  Output  4.  Quality  Improvements  and  Visitor  Attractions; 

Output  5.  Cultural  and  Historical  Heritage  and  Output  6.  Forum  Maintenance 

</span><span>Program. 

</span></div><div><span>If the Members of this Parliament who would like to know what work is going to be 

done under each of the six outputs I would like to ask them to look at the back of their 

book of Estimates under page 6.1. and you will find there what each output represents.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Member  for  Rakahanga,  Papa  Pupuke  Robati to 

read output 1. which is Policy Advice.  He will find the Policy Advice Reports, he will 

also  find the advice on Maori language standards and also monthly financial reports 

</span><span>and no questions need to be asked about these because they have all been stated here 

</span><span>in the outputs. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>3239 

</span></div><div><span>9 July 1997 

</span></div><div><span>I listened carefully to the words of sympathy expressed by the Honourable Dr Pupuke 

Robati about him saying that he feels very sorry for me because at first, the allocation 

for this Ministry was in the millions and now only a couple of thousand dollars. Mr 

Chairman, the message for the Honourable Members and also for our people listening 

in,  is that the $378,000 that we have allocated here for Culture Development  is not 

money from ourselves, it is generated by ourselves.  This money does not include aid 

and  there  is  no  aid  money  in  this  allocation.      Government  policy  is  for  us  to  live 

within our means and to live according to what we can afford.  Mr Chairman, it does 

</span><span>not  mean  to  say  that  we  don’t  have  any  friends.    We  do,  we  have  friends  in  the 

</span><span>UNESCO, the Australian Cultural Fund and the NZODA but the message here is we 

do not have to rely on them to supplement or to give us money to help for any activity 

that  we  want  to  do  in  our  Country.    If  only  the  former  Prime  Minister  of  the  Cook 

Islands, the Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati had stopped there, I would have 

been very pleased with his comment.  However,  when he went on to say that during 

their  time  in  Government  they  ensured  that  each  Ministry  or  Department  got  a  fair 

share of the resources  within Government,  I was not impressed with what he stated.  

Because  when  he  was  in  Government,  Rakahanga  almost  capsized  full  of  aid  from 

overseas.      I  also  listened  carefully  to  the  comments  by  the  Honourable  Member 

Upoko Simpson and the Honourable Member Ngamau Munokoa when they said that 

the parents within the homes can make the improvement and can also take the place of 

teaching culture to our children.  That maybe true, Mr Chairman, but we only need to 

look  at  New  Zealand  and  what  the  Maori  are  going  through.    Mr  Chairman,  that  is 

exactly  what  they  wanted  to  achieve.    They  wanted  to  preserve  their  culture,  they 

wanted  it  to  be  passed  down  from  generation  to  generation,  from  parents  to  their 

children verbally.  However, what happened is what these two Honourable Members 

are  saying  happened,    they  lost  their  culture.    Luckily,  they  are  trying  to  revive  it 

again.  Maybe, it is not their fault, Mr Chairman, because they are not governing the 

Country.  Under this Cook Island Party Government, Mr Chairman, we will not allow 

that  culture  of  ours  to  be  taken  away  from  us.    We  would  like  to  ensure  that  our 

Country is carried ahead or that our Country is preserved by establishing the Ministry 

of Cultural Development.    

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, as we all know, our custom is what crowned us or is our crown.  When 

we speak our own language, the Maori language.  When we practice our own culture, 

then people will know where we come from, they will know that we come from the 

</span><span>Cook  Islands.    However,  Mr  Speaker,  if  we  practice  and  speak  someone  else’s 

</span><span>language and so</span><span>meone else’s culture, then people will think that we are black Pakeha.  

</span><span>I  would  like  to  remind  you,  Mr  Chairman,  about  the  vision  that  the  Prime  Minister 

</span><span>from the Government shared for the year 2005, I quote Mr Chairman “ to get a good 

</span><span>way  of  life,  to  achieve  a  standard  of  living  better  than  any  in  the  region  and  in 

harmony with our </span><span>culture</span><span> and environment.  This is a very good vision, Mr Chairman, 

and this Government will do its bit to achieve that vision.
