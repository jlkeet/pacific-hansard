<div><span>(NO QUORUM) 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> I would like to repeat what I said earlier, Mr Speaker, about 

</span><span>these two outstanding ladies who have been composers since 1950’s when I was just a 

</span><span>little  girl.    When  Marguerite  Story  composes  a  song,  her  nephew  George  Tonga 

Henry,  sings  the  song  for  her.  For  Annie  Boaza,  when  she  composes,  she  sings  the 

song with the young people of Nikao.  Today, we hear the songs that were composed 

by these two ladies, being sung by other singers who reap the benefits of the work of 

these two women.  I believe we should support the Bill before the House after it has 

gone  through  the  Select  Committee.    There  are  a  lot  of  other  composers  who  have 

composed songs but it is the musicians of today who are benefiting from those songs.  

Maybe  when  this  Bill  is  enacted,  maybe  then  these  people,  who  are  composers  of 

many  songs  will  also  share  the  benefit.    As  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Joseph 

Williams,  has  said,  I  strongly  support  what  he  has  aired  because  that  is  what  we 

should be doing-  supporting the Bill in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Can I have a next speaker please?  

The Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Greetings to you, to all staff members of the 

House,  good  afternoon.    Greetings  also  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime, 

Ministers, and also to Honourable Members on the Government side, and also to all 

Honourable  Members  on  the  Opposition  side.  Greetings  to  you  this  afternoon.  

Greetings also to our people who are listening to our debate this afternoon regarding 

the Bill before the House.   

</span></div><div><span>I didn’t think I would rise to speak on the Bill but seeing that the Bill will be given to 

</span><span>Select  Committee,  I  came  to  think  that  we  have  a  lot  more  time  to  debate  the  Bill 

before the House, that is why I got up to speak.  This is not the first time that a Bill 

has gone into Select Committee, where, what  we discussed prior to putting it to the 

Select Committee, was the very same thing that we talked about when it came back.  

Nevertheless,  Mr  Speaker,  what  I  am  saying  now  will  probably  be  the  same  thing  I 

will  be  saying  when  the  Bill  is  brought  back  into  the  House  after  the  Select 

Committee.   

</span></div><div><span>This matter that we are looking at, Mr Speaker, is for the benefit of the composers and 

the  writers  because  they  compose  and  they  write,  yet  other  people  are  reaping  the 

benefits of their labour.  But because we are looking at this right now, it is included in 

the Bill, I believe this is the time that they will reap the benefits of their labour.   

</span></div><div><span>There is an excellent composer in Aitutaki, whom I know, called Papa Akaperepere. 

There are a lot of songs that he composed that are now being sung by many musicians 

today, where the benefits are going to them, and not to this dear old man.  Regarding 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>181 

</span></div><div><span>the  many  talented  people  we  talked  about  earlier,  who  have  all  passed  away,  like 

Kauraka  Kauraka,  it  is  their  children  or  families  who  should  continue  to  reap  the 

benefits  of  their  work.    This  sort  of  work,  such  as  composing  songs  and  writing 

stories,  is  hard  work,  but  it  is  not  the  original  composers  who  are  benefiting  from 

them.    Other  people  have  memorised  or  copied  the  work,  and  recorded  it,  and  they 

</span><span>have benefited from them, even though they didn’t compose it themselves.  What we 

</span><span>are  doing  now,  in  the  Bill,  Mr  Speaker,  is  for  the  protection  of  the  composer.    It 

</span><span>prevents people from taking somebody else’s composition and passing it off as their 

</span><span>own work, and benefiting from it.  So, the suggestion that the Bill is too big and the 

cost  of  it  is  too  high,  is  not  our  business.   It  is  the responsibility of the people who 

drafted this Bill.  I am sure they are aware of the financial situation or they would not 

have proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee.  I am  not happy with the 

</span><span>Leader  of  the  Opposition’s  suggestion  that  the  Bill  not  be  taken  into  a  Select 

</span><span>Committee.  The size and cost of this book is none of our business.  It is the business 

of  those  responsible  for  it.    I  am  not  happy  with  what  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition 

said </span><span>earlier, he tried to twist facts around and take someone else’s credit.  </span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I strongly support the Bill before the House.  I also support the view that 

the  Bill  should  be  presented  to  a  Select  Committee  so  the  views  of  our  people  i.e 

whether  they  accept  what  it  requires of them, can be compiled for reviewing.  With 

regard  to  the  expenses  incurred,  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  it  is  not  our  job  to  be 

</span><span>responsible for it, but the Minister’s and the rest of the people directly involved to see 

</span><span>that it is paid. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  gotten  up  also  because  I  would  like  to  see  our  talented  people  who  compose 

and write to get the benefits of their labours.  There are a lot of songs that an old man 

had once composed that is being used by musicians who are getting the benefits out of 

what he has done.  Mr Speaker, that is all I have to say.  Thank you for allowing me to 

speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I rise to give my support to the Principles of the Bill 

before the House.  Even though I did not have time to look through this thick book of 

119 pages, when I do read the Bill it will help me to identify the places I do not agree 

</span><span>with, but the Principles before the House I support. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  first  person  I  heard  talk  about  Copyright  was  one  of  our  Cook 

</span><span>Island’s  sons.    I  am  sure  we  have  heard  many  of  his  compositions,  he  is  Nipurahi 

</span><span>Nipu.  When he mentioned Copyright to me I inquired and was told we do not have an 

Act to that effect.  Before Government changed, I did not have the time to look into 

this matter like what is being done today. 

</span></div><div><span>Looking  at  the  Bill  before  the  House,  Mr  Speaker,  I  do  not  think  there  is  anything 

</span><span>urgent in it.  What is urgent to me is what has happened to the MOWEPP.  I think that 

</span><span>is a far more important issue for us to discuss at this time.  I think it is best we give 

this to a Select Committee as has been proposed so we can do away with this and talk 

about what is happening today.  Mr Speaker, I think we should leave the Bill for the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>182 

</span></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>time  being  and  we  should  talk  about  more  important  issues  as  I  said  before  the 

MOWEPP issue.  The island is running short of water, another example is sooner or 

later nobody will be collecting rubbish along the sides of the road and the roads are 

getting  potholes  in  them  again.    This  is  the  first  time,  I  think,  a  Ministry  of 

Government has closed down.   

</span></div><div><span>So I think we should leave the Bill alone for the time being and come back to more 

urgent issues like MOWEPP closing down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MARSTERS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, all the Greetings have 

gone before me and I do not want to greet more so to all our people Kia Orana to you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give my support to the Bill before the House.  Also I would like to say a lot 

of work was put into the drafting of this Bill, as we can see it is a very thick Bill.  I 

would like to thank the Minister of Education, Ngereteina Puna, for the hard work put 

into  enabling  this  Bill  to  reach  this  House  today.    Mr  Speaker,  I  think  the  young 

people of our country who are composers should be very grateful to the Minister.  In 

past years there have been attempts to bring in a Bill like this one to protect our artists.  

So  often  we  take  for  granted  what  is  taking  place  and  we  tend  to  forget  the  person 

responsible trying to make good for those who are not privileged in certain respects.  

This very thick Bill before the House reflects the attitude that the Minister responsible 

for it have been endeavouring, over the last few years, to try and get protection of our 

musicians before this House, as the Minister responsible for the cultural development 

of our country has not forgotten this area of development of our people.   

</span></div><div><span>Like the Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati, just said before me, there has been 

concern by musicians as to protection of their material.  So often as it has already been 

expressed  before  me,  material  composed  by  local  artists  continues  to  be  used  by 

others, not only here but overseas to their advantage financially.  How sad when those 

composers living here see all those tapes coming from Tahiti on the shelves here for 

sale  and they do not  benefit from  them, yet  knowing full well that material  sung on 

those tapes were their composition.  A lot of this traffic in the past has been mainly 

</span><span>between the Cook Islands and Tahiti.  The fact that that was happening, to that point, 

</span><span>when the Copyright laws were enforced their it saw a lot of our people travelling there 

in order to take advantage of those Copyright laws.  Mr Speaker, that costs money for 

our artists to travel to Tahiti, pay for those facilities, for recording material, then from 

then on they are able to accept some of the royalties that come out of those actions. 

</span></div><div><span>I venture to say Mr Speaker that the royalties they were getting out of their endeavours 

were  probably  just  a  small  percentage  of  what  are  really  due  to  them.    And yet,  Mr 

Speaker,  if  we  already  had  those  Copyright  facilities  here  in  the  Cook  Islands  I  am 

</span><span>sure that our local artists would have benefited better. 

</span></div><div><span>And  then,  Mr  Speaker,  for  your  information,  our  local  artists  have  been  going  to 

Tahiti  to  take  advantage  of  the  Copyright  facilities  there  only  over  the  recent  years.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>183 

</span></div><div><span>The pirating of our material has been going on for much longer.  We hear names being 

mentioned in this House referring to composers of the recent past.  But a lot of songs, 

a lot of materials used are still popular today, and they were composed well before our 

time, even before your time, Mr Speaker.  Some of the music composed from the past 

has been lost.  Some have been changed to the extent where it no longer sounds very 

similar to the original song.  The Honourable Member, Pa Teiti, earlier said, some of 

the music pieces have been taken out, piece by piece in order to enhance another new 

piece of music.  In fact, some of them have been skeletonised to such an extent where 

it is no longer the original. 

</span></div><div><span>What we have before us this afternoon, Mr Speaker, is the beginning of what will be 

the protection of materials produced by our own people and people from outside who 

would like to take advantage of this piece of legislation in the Cook Islands.  It will no 

doubt  be  said  that  it  is  long  overdue,  but  better  late  than  never,  Mr  Speaker.    One 

consolation as far as I am concerned, Mr Speaker, is we have a Minister who had the 

foresight to at least see there was this need in Cultural Development which needed to 

be addressed, and he has addressed it today by putting before us this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Agriculture, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker,  and  Kia  Orana  to  you.    To  cut  my 

Greetings  short, Kia  Orana to  Honourable Members  on both  sides of the House and 

our people listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like through you, Mr Speaker, to thank the Minister, and also the Secretary of 

Cultural Development, Carmen Temata and her staff.  I would like to thank them all 

for making it possible for bringing in the legislation, through their Minister, that we 

have  before  the  House  in  the  form  of  this  Copyright  Bill.    From  the  beginning,  Mr 

Speaker,  I  am  saying,  that  we  were  amending  the  laws  since  1913  up  to  1984.  

Looking at the last page, if Honourable Members could turn to the last page of their 

Bills, we will find that we fall under these enactments.  When we pass this legislation 

it will mean all the laws that are referred to in the schedule will all be repealed.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Minister, Mr Speaker, because he is proposing that this Bill 

be referred to  a Select  Committee.  That Select Committee will receive submissions 

</span><span>from  our  people  and  I  think  this  is  the  area  that  is  important,  that  our  people 

</span><span>understand what the Bill talks about and what it is that the Bill will provide for them.  

Also when the final product comes out, everyone can take credit for their efforts and 

not just a few. 

</span></div><div><span>The question that I want to ask through you, Mr Speaker, to the Minister is - what are 

the things which fall under the protection of this Copyright Bill?  The song composers 

only  or  other  things?    Mr  Speaker,  if  this  is  the  case  then  what  are  we  going  to  do 

about the patterns of hats that the Northern Group women have when they make their 

</span><span>hats and also the basket patterns that we in Ngaputoro and we in Mauke have?  Also 

</span><span>the </span><span>tivaevae</span><span>  patterns here that the ladies  here in  Rarotonga create.  Who is  going to 

protect their original creations?  I am asking the Select Committee to consider this.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>184 

</span></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>The other example, Mr Speaker, is the fashion designers such as Ellena Tavioni.  Who 

is going to protect her fashion designs, for example, the </span><span>muumuu</span><span> and so on?  And if 

we want to take this further, what about the pearl shell designs and the other things we 

do  with  the  pearl  shells  that  our  people  have  skills  in  doing.    Also  concerning  the 

</span><span>designs  by  our  carvers.    It  is  easy  to  copy  the  designs  of  our  peoples’  carvings.  

</span><span>Nowadays the </span><span>tangaroa</span><span> is made in Asia and brought back and sold here in the Cook 

Islands.  How are we going to protect that?  What about the traditional hymns that we 

compose  in  the  Outer  Islands  and  bring  here  in  the  time  of  the  Constitution 

Celebrations?  I heard one in Papua New Guinea, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  that  is  the  point  that  I  would  like  to  leave  to  the  Minister  and  for  the 

Select  Committee to  look  into.  Look into it very carefully and give a chance to the 

composers to bring in their views; composers of chants, composers of songs and the 

arts.  Mr Speaker, in support of this Bill before the House, I want to ask the Minister 

and his Select Committee to come up with a name for this Bill.  This sounds funny.  It 

</span><span>sounds childish like saying “copycat”.</span></div><div><span>Because what we are intending to do here, Mr Speaker, concerning the purpose of this 

Bill is - to look for a law, to come up with a legislation that will protect the interests 

of  our  composers.    Mr  Speaker,  if  we  can  achieve  this  then  I  will  assure  you  that 

within  two  years  the  benefit  will  be  pouring  back  into  our  country  and  into  the 

community, to  the benefit of our people, because our composers will be encouraged 

and they will want to create to be more innovative. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  this  brings  to  my  mind  the  late  Turepu  Turepu,  Kauraka  Kauraka  and 

Papa  Tutu  Ringiao.    The  anticipation  that  this  Bill,  this  law  will  be  put  in  place  to 

protect  what  they  had  accomplished  during  their  lifetimes  of  compositions.    Mr 

Speaker, Ringiao who was also a very good composer when he was in Mauke, Willie 

Crummer  from  Ngatangiia  were  both  waiting  for  a  Bill  like  this  to  be  enforced  in 

order to ensure that their work be protected from pirates.  These days we have people 

</span><span>like Tepoave Raitia, Robert Ioaba, Nia Heather and the list goes on, I can’t name all of 

</span><span>them,  whose  request  has  finally  reached  the  Minister  who  has  decided  to  do 

something about it.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when I was still a young man in New Zealand, I always loved to hear the 

</span><span>song “My dear land Rarotonga” that was composed by Teata Makirere.  There was the 

</span><span>song by Pepe and Sonny Tetuairo also.  To all the composers who we have seen in the 

past I would like to apologise to them, Mr Speaker.  We were not able to bring this to 

protect  them  in  the  past  but  the  most  important  thing  here  now  is  that  we  have 

something in place to protect the younger generation and our composers today.  And I 

think they will make use of this today.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there are many names, that I have mentioned in this House, of composers 

right through out the Cook Islands in Aitutaki, Atiu, Mauke, Mangaia, and even here 

in Rarotonga amongst other islands in the Cooks.  But, the sad thing is, when I come 

</span><span>to think of it, our older people have been holding on to our legends, traditions and our 

</span><span>pride, and now it is in the hands of children.  Although we were not paid during those 

times what we have done will still be remembered or used today.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>185 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time,  Mr  Speaker,  to  acknowledge  those  in  the  Northern  Group 

like Nipu, those in Penrhyn, Manihiki, Rakahanga and even those young people now 

in Pukapuka who have all been coming up with their own compositions.  I would like 

</span><span>to  apologise  to  our  people  and  ask  them  to  please  excuse  me  if  I’m  not  able  to 

mention your names.  To the Honourable Minister, please don’t rush into completing 

</span><span>this  matter  until  you  have  called upon our people for their submissions  so that their 

views can be considered first.  Because this thing is not originally ours.  Mr Speaker, I 

would like to congratulate the Minister and the Department of Cultural Development 

for this Bill that we have in the House.  I would like to give my support to them and 

through you, Mr Speaker, thank you once again to the Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Before we proceed further I would like to remind you Honourable 

Members that there is a book written in the Maori language.  The book was produced 

in 1888.  And that book is this very book that I have in my hand.  The Copyright of 

this  book  is  now  with  the  headquarter  of  the  CICC  in  Takamoa  and  no  other 

organisation can reproduce this book.   

</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  I rise to give a very brief view, Mr Speaker.  Before doing so, 

Mr Speaker, I would like to say Kia Orana to you and to all staff members and to all 

Honourable Members in this House and finally to our listening audience.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to join together with the other Honourable Members of the 

House in acknowledging the victory of Jim Marurai in the election on Mangaia.  I pray 

and hope that he will be a worthy servant for his people.  I am sure it is not because of 

the new leader of the Opposition that he succeeded but he won of his own merit.  This 

will be to enhance and to strengthen the position of the second Opposition party, lead 

by  the  Honourable  Member,  Norman  George.    We  have  two  Oppositions  here  in 

Parliament,  that  is  the  Opposition  No.  1  compiled  of  four  Members,  and  the 

Opposition No. 2 with three Members. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> You are irrelevant Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  You can recall in the newspaper how the Honourable Norman 

George  wrote  encouraging  remarks  to  get  up  and  lead  his  people.    I  can  see  a  very 

exciting  future  for  debate  in  this  House  with  the  new  situation  we  have  two  lots  of 

Opposition  in  Parliament.  1) Norman gets  the boot.   2) DAP conference still going 

ahead.   

</span></div><div><span>Anyway, this is my congratulations to the new Member who will be appointed.  We 

will  be  receiving  him  tomorrow  to  be  sworn  in  and  properly  addressed  as  an 

Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Bill  we  have  before  the  House,  brought  for  the  Minister  of  Tauranga  Vananga 

</span><span>where the Opposition said was not urgent.  I say it is.  It won’t be important for them.  

</span><span>They do not see the value it will have for our country.  It needs a good Cook Islands 

Party Government to bring in legislation of this kind and to see the importance of this 

piece of legislation to the people of the country, especially for those who have talent 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>186 

</span></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>to  contribute.    This  Mr  Speaker is  another kind  of cultural  development,  which will 

benefit directly the economic development of the country.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, all we need to do is look at the great compositions of our people.  We see 

a  lot  of  compositions  by  our  people  who  have  gone  through  the  process  of  creating 

them  and  where  other  musicians  have  gotten  the  benefits.   They were the ones who 

have received rewards for composition that are not truly theirs but belong to someone 

</span><span>else.  It’s too late for people like Turepu Turepu and Kauraka Kauraka.  Are we going 

</span><span>to  wait  until  it  is  too  late  for  other  Cook  Islanders?    No  we  are  not.    Any  Cook 

Islander  who  develops  skills  in  this  area  can  reap  the  benefits  of  his/her  skills  now.  

There are people who continue to develop their skills and knowledge today.  We want 

to see our people raise thousands and millions of dollars for their productions.  And 

yet  the  Opposition  says  it  is  not  important.    Well  according  to  Government  it  is 

important,  it  is  too  late  for  some who were experts in  their field,  who unfortunately 

have passed on before their skills could be acknowledged.   

</span></div><div><span>I wish to congratulate the Minister of Cultural Development.  This has been his baby 

and the baby of this Government for a long time.  I strongly support this, Mr Speaker, 

and also the referring of the Bill to a Select Committee in order to receive submissions 

and contributions towards this Bill.  I strongly support the spirit of the Bill before the 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  Our next speaker is 

the Honourable Minister, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    I  would  like  to  thank  all  Honourable  Members  who  have 

contributed towards the Copyright Bill before the House.  I would like to thank you, 

Mr Speaker, for revealing to us a Maori name for this Bill.  This is a purpose, for us to 

look back at names which our people once used and adopt those names for the things 

that we do today.  If we can not do this then we need to find something relevant for 

today.   

</span></div><div><span>I am pleased with the many contributions received from the Floor of this Honourable 

House  towards  the  Bill.    I  trust,  Mr  Speaker,  the  Select  Committee  we  will  appoint 

later  on,  will  have  a  look  at  this  very  fat  juicy  book  before  us.    I  would  like  to  say 

thank  you  to  all  who  contributed  to  the  Bill  before  us,  to  the  many  people  of  talent 

</span><span>who have contributed to the formation of this Bill before the House - I would like to 

</span><span>thank them all for their contributions.   

</span></div><div><span>We feel sorry for those talented people who have passed on and were thus not able to 

have  their  skills  recorded  under  this  Bill.    The  Government  has  to  create  the  Bill 

before the House and this is something relevant which will be of benefit to the people.  

Mr  Speaker,  this  is  all  I  have  to  say  in  praise  of  every  contribution  in  the  House 

toward the Bill.
