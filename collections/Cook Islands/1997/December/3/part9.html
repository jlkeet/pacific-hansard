</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr Speaker.  For my little time left,  I would 

like to say that I hope that the content of this document, the content of this Copyright 

</span><span>Bill, will be the views of our talented people of the Cook Islands and not just a copy 

</span><span>of other countries Copyright Bills.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  Can I have a next speaker please.  

The Honourable Member, Ngamau Munokoa.  

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>  To you, Mr Speaker, to  all  staff members, Greetings to  you 

</span><span>all.  Also to our listening audience, Greetings.  Also, to our new friend and it wonâ€™t be 

</span><span>long now when you will be joining us. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the Bill before the House, Mr Speaker, because in my own 

constituency Nikao, there are two ladies that I know, who are outstanding composers.  

They are Marguerite Story and Annie Boaza.

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  will  interrupt  you,  Honourable  Member.    We  do  not  have  a 

quorum.  I will ask the Clerk at the Table to ring the Bell.
