<div><span>BILL READ A FIRST TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Can the Honourable Minister please name the date and time of the 

Second Reading of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Forthwith, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Copyright Bill is now ordered for a Second Reading forthwith.  

Thank you, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Minister, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>   Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Copyright Bill be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand before you and Honourable Members with great joy in my heart 

that,  at  last,  this  Bill  has  arrived  in  this  Honourable  House.    Before  addressing  the 

Principles  and  Merits  of  the  Bill,  first  of  all,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  Mr  Jim 

Marurai in his resounding victory in the By-Election in Ivirua constituency yesterday.  

Of course it is no joy to our Party, the Cook Islands Party, that we lost.  However, the 

will  of  the  people  has  been  made  known  and  I  congratulate  the  Honourable  Jim 

Marurai. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I would like to send out a message of Kia Orana to the Honourable Norman 

George and his supporters who are now in conference.  I wish them well. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, coming to the Bill, I would like to thank very much all those people who have 

been involved in the putting together of the Bill before this Honourable House today.  

They are too numerous to tell you.  However, I would like to pick out, in particular, 

the present Solicitor-General, Janet Maki, who drew this Bill up during the course of 

this year and to you, mademoiselle, thank you very much indeed, and also to your staff 

who helped in the typing of the Bill before us, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I also want to thank the Secretary of Cultural Development, Mrs Carmen Temata and 

her  staff,  for  their  persistence  in  having  this  piece  of  legislation  prepared  and 

presented to this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is about the second or third draft of the Bill and I want to tell you and 

Honourable Members, that the first draft was submitted to the people concerned and 

who  are  affected  by  the  provisions of the Bill,  and I want  to  thank those who made 

contributions. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, the Bill before us is based on the latest New Zealand Copyright Act.   Because 

</span><span>this  is  new  ground  for  the  Cook  Islands,  we  are  happy  that  we  can  turn  to  New 

Zealand for guidance and hence the using of their legislation. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>175 

</span></div><div><span>Just a little history concerning Copyright. It began as a moral concept that eventually 

found  its  way  into  the  law  books.    In  Ancient  Greece  and  Rome  the  copying  of 

</span><span>someone  else’s  work  was  condemned  as  morally  wrong  and  studies  of  Roman 

</span><span>literature show that the Romans were aware that the publication of a work involved a 

moral right to the work. 

</span></div><div><span>After  the  invention  of  the  printing  press  in  the  15th  century,  the  copying  of  written 

works  became  easier  and  piracy  began.    The  clergy  looked  to  the  kings  of  the  day, 

over  whom  they  generally  had  strong  influence,  to  protect  their  interests  in  their 

libraries and their monopoly on many kinds of printed works, such as the Bible.  From 

this resulted a number of royal decrees and statutes granting privileges.  Most of these 

privileges  were  aimed  at  protecting  what  were  then  called  stationers,  who  are  today 

called  publishers.    Often,  this  protection  was  granted  for  commercial  reasons  to 

protect their investment in printing equipment.  Now, let us ask ourselves what about 

the authors of those books?  The growth of Parliamentary democracy led to a new era 

in law making and Copyright became no exception to this as the value of the printed 

word and the ability to  reproduce it increased.  Laws which were the forerunners of 

</span><span>today’s Copyright laws were entered onto the statute books and these were passed in 

</span><span>Germany,  France,  England,  Prussia  and  so  forth.    The  Constitution  of  the  United 

States  gave  the  Congress  the  power  to  vote,  promote  the  progress  of  science  and 

useful arts by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right 

to their inventions and discoveries.  From the late 1700s until this century, some 200 

years  later,  the  Principles  of  Copyright  law  have  remained  basically  the  same.    The 

principal changes have been due to changes in technology.  As international travel and 

communications  developed,  countries  began  trying  to  keep  pace  with  this.    Some 

</span><span>countries  recognised  each  others’  laws  by  clauses  in  their  own  laws.    Some  entered 

</span><span>into  bilateral  treaties,  whereby  they  agreed  to  protect  the  inadequate,  some,  multi-

lateral treaties whereby a number of countries all agreed to recognise and protect the 

</span><span>products of each of them, were entered into.  The earliest of these was in the 1880’s 

</span><span>but the first major and truly international one did not come into being until 1952 when 

the Universal Copyright Convention was adopted.  Now, coming to the Cook Islands, 

Mr  Speaker,  our  country  through  New  Zealand,  is  a member of this convention and 

the  Berne  Convention,  for  the  protection  of literary and artistic works.  Under these 

conventions,  the  Cook  Islands  is  obligated  to  make  provisions  for  the  protection  of 

literary and artistic works and to provide for the adequate and effective protection of 

the rights of authors and other Copyright proprietors in literary, scientific and artistic, 

cinematographic works and paintings, engravings and sculptures.  Under section 627 

</span><span>of our Cook Islands Act 1915, we adopted New Zealand’s Copyright Act 1962.  It has 

</span><span>often been said that there was no Copyright law in the Cook Islands up to the one that 

we  are  about  to  put  in  place,  but  that  is  not  right  because we have this in the Cook 

Islands Act  1915.  There was provision for it.  There has been some confusion over 

whether this Act was in fact adopted correctly and this had led to the public believing 

that we have no Copyright laws in the Cook Islands and there is a need to clarify this 

through the introduction of this Copyright Bill.  Now, this Bill before this Honourable 

House  promotes  the  Principles  contained  in  the  Copyright  Act  1962  and  further 

</span><span>recognises the advancement of new technology.  This Bill has been long awaited by 

</span><span>the members of the public and I am sure that it addresses the problems that they have 

in protecting their creative interests, not only here, but in other countries as well.  Mr 

Speaker, it is my intention to establish, this House willing, a Select Committee to look 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>176 

</span></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>at the Bill before this House.  This Committee will review the contents of the Bill and 

receive further submissions from members of the public on the Bill.  Even though we 

feel that we have done that, we feel also that there maybe some members of the public 

and particularly those in the outer islands, who have not had an opportunity to make 

submission on the Bill before the House and they will have the opportunity to do so 

through the Select  Committee.  It was originally my intention to have  the Copyright 

Bill in place by the end of this year but I am now looking forward to the next sitting of 

this Honourable House to  put  this Bill  through, so that it will become an Act of the 

Cook Islands.  I am sure, those who are awaiting the enactment of this Copyright Bill, 

will not mind waiting another month or two so that we can do the job properly.  I ask 

all Honourable Members of this Honourable House to please give your support to this 

milestone of a legislation.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR</span><span>SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Dr J. Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>DR</span><span>J.</span><span>WILLIAMS:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and to the Members 

of  this  Honourable  House.    I  am  delighted  indeed,  Mr  Speaker,  to  Second  this  Bill, 

partly because it is long overdue.  Before we proceed with the Bill, I want to also, like 

the Honourable Minister of Education, congratulate the new Member of Parliament of 

Mangaia,  Jim  Marurai,  for  his  election  into  Parliament  yesterday.    There  is  another 

matter I would like to refer to but it is not appropriate at this time, that is the matter  

regarding  the  closure  of  MOWEPP,  Mr  Speaker.    With  your  indulgence  later, when 

the Motion for Adjournment comes in, I beg that you give me time to speak on that 

particular  subject.  You  should  also,  Mr  Speaker,  if  I  might  suggest,  give  the 

opportunity to the Members of the House to debate that particular issue. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  the  Bill,  I  support  this  wholeheartedly  and  I  want  to  commend  the 

</span><span>Minister of Education for his presentation and his explanation of the Copyright Bill.  

Even though, Mr Speaker, that we had adopted the 1962 New Zealand Copyright Act, 

that  in  itself  was  not  sufficient  because  it  did  not  belong  to  us.    As  the  Minister  of 

Education stated, and I support him wholeheartedly, that it is overdue, it is time it is 

brought to this House.  You see, our culture is a unique culture.  Our music, our songs, 

our dances and performing arts are all unique to the Cook Islands.  Unfortunately, in 

the past, many of our music have been copied overseas in other Polynesian countries 

without  the  authors  or  composers  being  adequately  rewarded.    This  Bill,  when  it 

</span><span>becomes an Act before the end of the year, will give that Copyright protection to the 

</span><span>authors of the music and songs, and any literary work produced in the Cook Islands.  

You see, Mr Speaker, as the Bill is a big one, and it has 233 clauses. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>177 

</span></div><div><span>Unfortunately, this is the first time I have seen the Bill, I have not had the time to go 

through  it  thoroughly,  but  I  will.    In  glancing  through  it,  and  listening  to  the 

presentation by the Minister in charge of this Bill, I have no hesitation in giving my 

full  support.    This  Copyright,  as  it  says  in  the  explanatory  note  of  the  Bill,  covers 

literary  work,  dramatic  work,  theatrical  and  artistic  works,  sound  recordings,  films, 

cable programmes, etceteras, etceteras, etceteras.  You see the standard of education in 

this  country  has  advanced  to  the  stage  where  our  own  people  are  now  capable  of 

writing novels, literary works, they are capable of becoming artists in their own right.  

Once they enter into any original work of their own that work must be protected and it 

will be protected by this Bill when it becomes law.  Mr Speaker, there is no doubt at 

all of the high calibre of our composers of music and songs, Cook Islands music and 

songs.  Unfortunately, they have not reaped the entire benefits of their efforts because 

they have been copied by other artists in places like French Polynesia.  This Bill will 

protect  their  work  and  their  rights,  and  because  it  gives  Cook  Islanders  all  that 

protection when they enter into a new type of work, I support the Bill wholeheartedly.  

I    am  also  glad  the  Minister  has  indicated  the  Bill  is  being  referred  to  a  Select 

Committee.    I  hope  the  Minister  will  urge  the  work  of  the  Select  Committee  to  be 

completed as quickly as possible so this can be re-presented to the House and we can 

adopt it as law.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR</span><span>SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>May I have the next speaker please?  The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.</span><span>DR</span><span>T.</span><span>MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  to  our 

people  listening  in.    Although  I  have  spoken  earlier,  Mr  Speaker,  I  did  not  want  to 

boast about our victory in Mangaia; I left that to see what response was coming from 

the  Government  side.    It  is  pleasing  to  see,  Mr  Speaker,  the  response  from  the 

Government side and I commend them on that sort of attitude- not to take it as a big 

blow, but being very modest and accepting defeat. I am pleased with their response.  I 

did not want to get up and wave the flag of the Demo Alliance Party just because we 

won  another  seat,  Mr  Speaker.    I  thank  those  who  have  spoken  congratulating  the 

victory  of  the  Honourable  Jim  Marurai.  Of  course,  Mr  Speaker,  like  the  previous 

speakers, I give congratulations to the gentleman, Jim Marurai, and to his family, and 

his  executive,  his  supporters,  the  people  of  Ivirua,  both  C.I.P.  and  Demo  Alliance, 

they  all  voted  for  Jim  Marurai.    You  know,  Mr  Speaker,  when  the  change  of 

</span><span>leadership in the Opposition took place some people said why now?  Didn’t you know 

</span><span>there is a by- election going on in Ivirua?  Well, to be honest, Mr Speaker, the change 

of leadership in the Opposition did not make any difference to the victory Jim Marurai 

has shown us.  In fact, Mr Speaker, it has given Jim Marurai more votes by the change 

of the leadership.  The Ivirua people are intelligent enough to know what is happening 

</span><span>and who they should vote for and that’s exactly what they did. They know that I am 

</span><span>the Leader of the Opposition and I am sure they want to be behind me. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, the Bill, Mr Speaker, I know I have dwelled on this a little bit too long but I will 

</span><span>come back to the Bill.  Mr Speaker, when I was looking for my copy of the Copyright 

</span><span>Bill  I  couldn’t  find  it,  but  when  my  colleague,  the  Honourable  Ngamau  Munokoa 

</span><span>showed me, I said is this the one?  This is not a Bill, this is a file.  It is so thick, Mr 

Speaker, I have never come across a Bill like this and it will cost you $60 if you want 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>178 

</span></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>a  copy.    I  am  not  sure,  Mr  Speaker,  whether  you  are  aware  in  the  media  today,  the 

Ministry of Works has got no money and yet this Minister is able to come up with an 

expensive  book  here  that  costs  $60  if  you  want  to  buy  a  copy.    Now,  where  is  the 

priority going?  Right now, we have a crisis, that the Ministry of Works cannot afford 

to continue and they are in transition. 

</span></div><div><span>Now the Minister is asking for a Select Committee.  There is going to be more money 

required by this House, by Parliamentary Services, to provide that service, to fund that 

service.  It is easy for the Minister to request the Members of Parliament to establish a 

</span><span>Select Committee but he doesn’t rea</span><span>lise that the Clerk of Parliament, you Mr Speaker, 

have to look into ways and means of getting funds to provide this service.  The other 

day, Mr Speaker, I was embarrassed to find out that the Clerk of Parliament asked his 

staff  to  ring  around  for  sponsors  to  pay  for  this  broadcast  we  are  doing.    What  is 

happening,  Mr  Speaker?    What  is  happening  that  the  Minister  may  not  be  aware?  

Where  is  the  Prime  Minister  today,  the  Minister  of  Finance?    Where  is  he  today?  

</span><span>Why aren’t they here to sort out the crisis wi</span><span>th the MOWEPP Ministry? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  want  to  ask  you  Honourable  Member  to  come  back  to  the  Bill.  

You are going too far.  Please come back to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  speaker.    I  was  only  trying  to  justify  my 

argument as to why the minister is asking for these extra services when he knows very 

well  that  the  Parliamentary  Services  has  not  got  the  budget  to  do  these  things  he  is 

</span><span>asking.    Surely,  Mr  Speaker,  you  are  fully  aware  of  this  and  you  can’t  really accept 

</span><span>expenses  like  this  that  wi</span><span>ll  incur  on  your budget,  which he knows, you haven’t got.  

</span><span>To be fair to you, Mr Speaker, he should move this and say this is where I am going to 

get the money from in order to sponsor this particular request of establishing a Select 

</span><span>Committee.  I don’t ev</span><span>en know whether this has been budgeted for.  Even then, Mr 

Speaker, the Clerk has already indicated in the media that he has not got any more to 

</span><span>spare.    I  am  really  concerned,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  are  in  a  situation  that  we  don’t 

</span><span>seem to have any answers to the problems that we have, and if we have a situation like 

</span><span>this where the Ministry of MOWEPP hasn’t got any money, this is a supply problem 

</span><span>Mr Speaker.  I would have put this aside, Mr Speaker, and if they cannot do anything 

about  the  money  crisis  now,  they  should  immediately  bring  in  a  Supplementary 

Budget.  Just throw the current budget document out and put in a new one and place 

the priorities where they should be and run the country properly. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Honourable Member, you are irrelevant.  Will you please come back 

to the Motion on the Floor? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Yes, I quite agree with you but we 

need  money  to  fund  this  Select  Committee  that  the  Minister  is  requesting  to  be 

established.  That is why I am asking, Mr Speaker, that the current budget document 

should be thrown out and a Supplementary Budget be brought into the House where 

we  can  reallocate  the  monies  and  get  the  essential  services  going,  form  a  Select 

Committee, then we have monies available for the priority services that are required. 

Send  an  urgent  message  to  the  Prime  Minister  to  come  back immediately and solve 

the crisis here in this country. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>179 

</span></div><div><span>I am concerned, Mr Speaker, and I am sure, so are you, and Honourable Members of 

this  Honourable  House,  and,  in  particular,  I  am  sure  this  is  of  real  concern  to  the 

Minister  of  MOWEPP  with  regards  to  what  he  can  do  in  providing  the  essential 

services for our people.  Even though, Mr Speaker, I am in favour of supporting this 

Bill to give our people the right, but I am saying the priority must be somewhere else 

right  now,  Mr  Speaker.    I  was  expecting  the  Minister  of  Finance  to  get  up  this 

morning  and  give  a  Ministerial  Statement  to  explain  the  crisis  with  regards  to  the 

MOWEPP. I would have done that, Mr Speaker, but I am not a Minister.  However, I 

intend  to  bring  this  up  on  Friday  afternoon  because  that  is  the  only  time  I  can  be 

allowed to present my views on the crisis. 

</span></div><div><span>So, those are my views with regard to the Copyright Bill, my views pertaining to the 

cost incurred, the money that is required for priority areas.  In my view it is not urgent 

for us to look at these things now but to look at the crisis the MOWEPP Ministry is 

facing. 

</span></div><div><span>However, while we are on the subject of the Copyright Bill, I go along with the views 

expressed  by  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Joseph  Williams,  that  the  importance  of 

this Bill, as well as what the Minister has outlined.  I recall the talents of people like 

Turepu  Turepu  and  others  who  have  died,  their  talents  have  been  stolen  by  other 

people in other countries, our neighbours and our friends, without them getting a cent 

from their talents.  Also, people like Kauraka Kauraka, and there are many others that 

we can name, who have done a lot of work and did not get the benefit of their talents.  

With  that  principle, Mr Speaker, I know that nobody in  this House will say we will 

not support this.  Everyone should support it, because to me, the concept behind this, 

is  to  protect  the  talent,  to  protect  whatever  our  people  can  produce,  whatever  our 

artists can show, in order to have them benefit from those efforts and not have other 

people come and steal it.  I hope, if I go through this document, Mr Speaker, I will be 

shown the Cook Islands views . . . 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I have to interrupt you, Honourable Member.  There is no quorum.
