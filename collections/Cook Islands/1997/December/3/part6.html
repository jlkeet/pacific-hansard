<div><span>MESSAGE NO.7 

</span></div><div><span>The  Queen’s  Representative  in  pursuance  to  Article  3  of  the  Constitution  on 

</span><span>behalf of Her Majesty and in pursuance of Article 43 of the Constitution recommends 

Parliament to proceed upon the Bill the Short Title whereof is the -  

</span></div><div><span>Copyright Act 1997 

</span></div><div><span>DATED at RAROTONGA this 3rd day of December 1997.”</span></div><div><span>I will now place it on the Table. 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR</span><span>R.</span><span>JACK:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Presentation of the Public Bill be postponed until after the disposal of 

</span><span>Motion No.3.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR</span><span>SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Leader of the House.  May I call for a Seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr U. Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Education, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>172 

</span></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>HON.</span><span>N.</span><span>PUNA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.  On behalf of the Honourable Minister, 

Tiki Matapo, Minister of Parliamentary Services, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Parliament resolves to proceed upon the Copyright Bill in the English 

language only 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, very briefly on the Motion, I would like to ask Honourable Members of 

the House to bear with me in this request because firstly, this is a Bill on a subject that 

is  new  to  our  country,  plus  the  fact  that  it  is  a  very  bulky  piece  of  legislation.  

Therefore, I am asking if we can proceed in the English language only but of course 

we will be debating it in English and Maori.  As we know, the normal practice is, a 

Bill is always translated into Maori before proceeding. I am asking that we proceed on 

this  Bill  because  it  is  in  the  English  language  only  and  we  are  unable  to  bring  the 

Maori  translation  of  the  Bill  to  the  House.    The  discussion  of  the  Bill  will  be  in 

English and Maori but the printing of the Bill is in English only. 

</span></div><div><span>MR</span><span>SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Hon. Dr T. Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.</span><span>DR</span><span>T.</span><span>MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, to Honourable 

Members of the House, to your staff and to our people listening in.  Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I do not see any controversy for me to second this Motion.  We have a job to 

do and there is no point in trying to muck around. 

</span></div><div><span>With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to raise a very important issue right 

</span><span>now.    Yesterday,  just  before  we  adjourned,  I  made  an  urgent  announcement  with 

</span><span>regards  to  the  fire  that  was  taking  place  on  the  hill  at  Turangi.    I  appreciate  your 

support with that announcement because it has taken effect with the young people, the 

</span><span>mapu</span><span>,  in  Ngatangiia  district,  to  respond  to  the  call.    Unfortunately,  the  people  who 

own that hill and land, not many of them turned up, and the family who caused the fire 

were not responding to the work that the people around were doing.  I am told that the 

fire  has  recurred  right  now  and  it  is  extending  towards  the  Avana  Valley  at  this 

moment. 

</span></div><div><span>I am very concerned, Mr Speaker, because we have this crash fire unit that responds to 

</span><span>these calls from the community.  There is a need for our people to listen to this sort of 

thing.    There  is  a  need  for  parents  to  educate  their  children  and  teach  the  children 

during this time of drought not to light unnecessary fires.  Yesterday, there were two 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>173 

</span></div><div><span>fires,  one  on  the  hill  at  the  back  of  Turangi  and Avana, and the other one at  Avana 

behind  the  old  packing  shed.  The  day  before  that,  I  understand  that  there was a fire 

</span><span>also at Wigmore’s place in the valley. The expenses incurred through this free service, 

</span><span>voluntary  service  by  the  Crash  Fire,  is  costing  a  lot  of  money,  thousands  of  dollars 

have gone into that and thousands of litres wasted on that unnecessary happening. 

</span></div><div><span>I had a personal experience yesterday, Mr Speaker, with regards to the effort by these 

young  people  of  the  Crash  Fire,  led  by  their  Director,  Nga  Jessie,  and  George 

Nicholas.  I commend them for their job.  That is not enough, Mr Speaker, if we are 

going  to  thank  them  for  a  job  like  that  and  our  children  continue  to  light  fires  that 

cause unnecessary wastage for the Crash Fire people and the equipment they have to 

spend in order to stop these unnecessary fires.  We have to ask our people to stop this 

and the only way they can do that is to get to our children and others, who are weeding 

around the back and lighting fires, to stop that practice immediately.  We are right in 

</span><span>the middle of a drought.  We haven’t got enough water for home use and here we are, 

</span><span>we have to spend a lot of water, thousands of litres of water was used yesterday, and 

who  knows  how  much  more  we  are  going  to  have  to  use  while  we  are  still  in  the 

drought.  Quite  often,  Mr  Speaker,  this  is  taken  as  an  accident  and  nobody  seriously 

looks at who has done it, why it has happened and what penalties should be imposed 

on  that  kind  of  negligence.    Penalties,  such  as  paying  for the expense of getting the 

fire  shut  down  by  these  Crash  Fire  people,  somebody  should  pay  for  that.    We  are 

</span><span>right  in  the  middle  of  a  financial  crisis,  Mr  Speaker.  We  can’t  afford  to  see  such  

</span><span>unnecessary  spending  again  during  this  time.    So,  I  am  expressing  this  concern,  Mr 

Speaker,  I  thank  you  for  allowing  me  a  bit  of  time  on  it  and  I  would  like  to  ask 

Members of Parliament to go back to your own constituencies and encourage parents 

to look after their children and make it known to everybody this is a disaster that has 

happened to us in Ngatangiia, and it has not stopped. It is continuing and I am not sure 

the Crash Fire people have the effort or the means to go back and stop this fire.  It is 

ongoing at the moment and it really is a concern. 

</span></div><div><span>One  has  to  go  through  the  experience,  Mr  Speaker,  to  drag  these  hoses  up  the  hill, 

through the smoke, through the fire to  get  to  the end of it, to  where it is leading, to 

stop it with that hose of water. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  I believe it is worthwhile reminding and telling 

our people of this concern and hopefully something can be done about it. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
