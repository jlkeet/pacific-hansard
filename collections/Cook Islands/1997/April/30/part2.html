<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Broadcasting Amendment Bill,  interrupted debate on the Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>May I call for a new speaker please?  The Honourable Member Tepai Tepai. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  TEPAI:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  to  your  staff  this 

afternoon.    Kia  Orana  also  to  Honourable  Members  on  the  beach  side  and  to 

Honourable Members on the mountain side.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  I stand in support of the Amendment Bill before the House.  I feel this is 

something  that  will  be  of  benefit  to  the  people  of  the  Cook  Islands.    We  utilise 

television  for  the  purpose  of  viewing  to  see  what  is  happening  in  our  country  and 

overseas.  My problem is what I saw on Wednesday or Thursday night last week.  The 

particular program I watched that night showed a place in Takuvaine.  It highlighted 

problems  caused  by  the  young  people  to  certain  properties  such  as  vehicles  and 

complexes.    The  satisfying  thing  is  that  the  management  showed  the  actual  place 

where these problems took place. It also showed the place where it was alleged those 

young people are living. 

</span></div><div><span>My problem Mr Speaker was, that  when this journalist asked the police officer which 

village  is  the  worst  in  these  small  offences,  the  police  officer  cited  Arorangi.    Mr 

Speaker, I know  this police officer is supposed to uphold the law.  He should be using 

</span><span>his  time,  effort  and  more  so,  his  power  to  eliminate    these  offences.    Instead,  he 

</span><span>appeared on the TV and condemned my village. 

</span></div><div><span>I appreciated the screening of the current issues of concern, that was appropriate.  We 

knew that they were in Takuvaine. But when it came to naming the worst offending 

village, the Officer cited Arorangi.  That,  I did not like. I did not like what the police 

officer did.   He called my village people as thieves and yet there are 5,000 or 6,000 

people  living  in  Arorangi.    After  all,  the  tax  collected  from  Arorangi  is  around 

$10,000 per year which is all geared to eliminating problems such as these.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  that night if I had been that officer’s Minister that policeman would find 

</span><span>himself  on  the  road  because  what  he  said,    I  feel,    is  not  true.    What  I  would  have 

thought was for this police officer  to see those who committed these minor offences 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>2742 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>and  educate  them,  correct  them.  Instead  he  came  on  the  television  and  said  that 

Arorangi is the worst in stealing. Everybody in the Cook Islands now would think that 

he is correct.  This is a warning and should be a lesson for those who go on television.  

Be careful about what you say.  Do not accuse people because one day you may be the 

one  who  will  be  trapped  by  what  you  say.    Television  is  good  overall  but  there  are 

times you do not agree with some things they portray. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  another  example  is  our  criticism  leveled  at  Government.    We know the 

Opposition  criticise  Government  a  lot.    What  we  have  to  understand  is  that 

Government  is    the  people  of  this  country.    Yesterday  or  the  day  before  I  heard  the 

Deputy Leader of the Opposition Honourable Dr Maoate say that Government should 

hand over the Sheraton Hotel to  Pa Ariki to complete. 

</span></div><div><span>He is fighting against Government that Government should give the Sheraton Hotel to 

Pa  Ariki  and  the  people  of  Takitumu.    I  would  have  thought,  Mr  Speaker,  that  this 

Honourable Member would ask television to come and film him while he stands next 

to the lime oven that Ngatangiia has and tell us how long this oven has been there and 

</span><span>other information about the oven and leave Pa alone. Don’t follow Pa around because 

</span><span>Pa is doing well.  We know, Mr Speaker, that Pa has done her bit about this lime oven 

</span><span>but what he should have done was to get up and say what this lime oven is for.  Mr 

Speaker,  I  think  these  are  the  things  that  we  have  to  look  at  more  closely.    Let  us 

implement  what  should    be  done,  we  have  all  kinds  of  projects  floating  around  and 

nothing has been done yet. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to come back and dwell a bit more on this accusation of  Puaikura.   I won’t 

mention  his  name,  Mr  Speaker  and  I  don’t    intend  for  him  to  come  and  apologise 

</span><span>about what he said.  But I think that he should be more careful about what he is going 

to  say from  now on, especially on the TV.  I have an Ariki in my village and I also 

have religious leaders and leaders within the community.  I think it would be best if 

that Police Officer came and met those leaders  instead of shooting his mouth  on the 

television.  Mr Speaker, that is the reason why I got up.  I wanted to say this.  Now 

</span><span>that it has all been said,  I am cool now.  It’s always been on my mind and if I don’t air 

</span><span>it out, I might get sick.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Our next speaker is the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti from Amuri. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you.    Greetings  also  to    the 

Honourable  Members  of  this  House,  to  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister,  Ministers,  Government  Members,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and 

Opposition Members - Kia Orana.  Greetings also to our people who are listening in to 

our discussion.  I would like to send special greetings to my home land Mr Speaker.  

To  the  Mayor,  to  the  Government  Representative,  to  the  Island  Councillors,  to  the 

Elders, to our old people on the island, to the young people and to our children - Kia 

Orana.  I know the people on the island of Aitutaki are very concerned about the heavy 

rain  that  we  received  since  Saturday,    Sunday,  Monday  and  yesterday.    Yesterday  I 

was  still  in  Aitutaki,  Mr  Speaker,  but  I  was  called  to  come  back  to  make  up  the 

quorum.  Yet when I arrived in the House today I  see  a lot of Members.  I know there 

are  some  homes  on  the  island  of    Aitutaki,  Mr  Speaker,  that  the  water  almost 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2743 

</span></div><div><span>swamped.      I  think  this  was  the  day  that  we  set  aside    for  the  clean-up  because  we 

knew that the clouds were going to clear up.  On this  day we decided we would go 

and  help  out  these  homes.    Some  bridges  on  the  island  have  been  blocked,  Mr 

Speaker, and I feel rather unhappy because I am here while my people are working. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to give my full support to this Amendment Bill before the House.  

Yesterday    I  listened  to  comments  by  Members  of  this  House  about  this  Bill.    Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, I don’t know where the problem was, whether it was my radio or whether it 

</span><span>was  the  broadcasting.    This  Bill  before  the  House  allows  for  people  to  apply  for  a 

license to broadcast.  Before, whatever is shown on television here in Rarotonga will 

be  watched  by  Aitutaki.    That  was  the  case    but  today  what  Rarotonga  sees  on 

television is not seen by my people in Aitutaki.  I know that my friend from the island 

of Aitutaki spoke about some of the problems that Aitutaki is facing. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday  I  also  heard  the  Honourable  Member  for  Manihiki.    He  was  asking 

Government  to  give  them  the    right  to  broadcast  and  televise  for  the  islands  of 

Manihiki  and Rakahanga.  I also  heard the comments from the Honourable Member 

for Rakahanga and he was opposing this Bill.  They said yesterday that Manihiki is the 

</span><span>elder brother and Rakahanga is the younger brother.  I know something about brother 

</span><span>ships  Mr  Speaker,  they  agree  on  issues.    If  the  older  brother  says  we  do  things  this 

way,  then  the  younger  brother  agrees.    But  yesterday  in  the  case  of  Manihiki  and 

Rakahanga, Manihiki agreed and Rakahanga opposed. 

</span></div><div><span>I  don’t  blame  the  Honourable  Member,  Pupuke  Robati  for  objecting  this  Bill.    This 

</span><span>reminds me of a rugby match Mr Speaker.  Just before the rugby players run on to the 

field,    the  Captain  will  come  and  remind  the  team  that  there  are  15  players.  The 

Members  in  the  Opposition    should  stick  to  oppose  and  leave  the  supporting  of  the 

</span><span>Bill to us Members in Government.  I don’t know if the Members in the Opposition 

</span><span>made an agreement before they jogged into this House or whether when it came to the 

time  to  enter  the  House,    they  just  came  in  without  any  type  of  consultations.    The 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati received the  ball, but he didn’t </span><span>want to pass 

it to his running colleague.  He was hanging on to this ball but never passed it and I 

</span><span>was pretty sure that he will score a try but he didn’t.</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati was correct in objecting this Bill because 

</span><span>television will never get to Rakahanga.  Do you think it’s worthwhile if television is 

</span><span>shown to only four people? 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  acknowledge  the  objection  by  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke 

Robati on the Amendment Bill before the House.  You see, this is like a rugby match.  

Sometimes when you take the ball, you know that you will score if you continue. But 

because this is a team game, you pass it to your colleague.  Often when you pass, the 

catcher will end up dropping the ball and you miss out on a try.  Mr Speaker, I suggest 

that  the  Honourable  Member  for  Rakahanga  stick    to  his  suggestions.   Maybe those 

involved in this activity will look at the island of Rakahanga.  He told us the reasons 

why  he  was  objecting  and  I  think  those  who  are  in  this  work  will  think  about 

Rakahanga in the future. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>2744 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Members  are  interjecting    that  I  should  look  for  ways  to  help  the 

island of Aitutaki.  I will talk about Aitutaki soon.  As my friend mentioned yesterday 

in his speech in this House,  Mr Speaker there is no one responsible to pay the power 

or to pay the operator of the television on the island of Aitutaki.  So,  the Government 

Representative took it upon himself to look for ways and means to pay the power and 

to pay the operator of this television station.  The Bill that is in the House right now is 

giving access to anybody who wish to take over the broadcasting or the televising to 

make an application.  At the moment the Government Representative is trying to do 

everything  possible  to  maintain  this  service,  including  the payment of the electricity 

</span><span>but  he  is  still  trying  his  best  to  do  what  he  can.    We  don’t  know who is  actually in 

</span><span>charge of this matter. The Government Representative may have the right to enter into 

</span><span>and assist.  I don’t know whether the  Government is ope</span><span>rating the station but it is the 

Government Representative who is now doing something about it. 

</span></div><div><span>So the Bill that is in the House right now gives other people the opportunity to make 

an application if they wish to carry on the responsibility of maintaining the services.  

There  are  problems  here  but  there  are  some  good  as  well.  Let  us  look  at  the 

advantages  and  the  disadvantages. The Government  has had a look  at  this issue and 

</span><span>we think that this is the way out of this quagmire. I stand to support this Bill because 

</span><span>when  this  Bill  comes  into  force  then  there  is  an  opportunity  for  those  who  are 

prepared  to  take  up  the  responsibility.      At  the  moment  we  do  not  know  who  is 

responsible to keep the station going.  Mr Speaker,  I strongly support the Bill before 

the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can I have the next speaker please?  The Honourable Minister for 

Education,  Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Greetings  to  you.    Greetings  to  all 

Honourable Members of the House and to all who are listening in to this debate.  A 

special  greetings  to  my  own  constituency  in  Aitutaki;    to  the  Government 

Representative,  to the Ui Ariki,  to all Minister of various churches in Aitutaki and to 

all the people, greetings to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my full support to the Bill before the House.  Before I dwell on the Bill, 

Mr Speaker I seek your indulgence to allow me to express my love and my word of 

comfort  to  those who are bereaved by the loss of their loved ones.   First of all to a 

</span><span>former Minister of Government,   a  former Member of Parliament and also my elder 

</span><span>brother William Estall, most especially to my sister in-law Pati Estall and the family 

who are moaning for the passing away of my Brother. Secondly, to the grandchild of 

Mr  Tekake  Williams    and  the  parents  who  are  presently  in  Manihiki,    may  God 

comfort you all.   Thirdly, to the late Kurapai Ioana of Atiu who had been taken back 

to Atiu for burial, especially the family and relatives, Kia Orana to you all in the name 

of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.    Forthly,  to  the  late  Kaitamaki  Ngatoko  of  Mitiaro  who 

passed  away  in  New  Zealand,    to  your  family  I  give  to  you  my  words  of  comfort.   

</span><span>And to those families whom I haven’t mentioned,  I give to you all the on behalf of 

</span><span>my constituency and on behalf of my wife and family our  words of comfort to you all.  

May God comfort you all as we travel through these difficult times..   

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2745 

</span></div><div><span>And also a special greetings to the Nga-Pu-Toru teachers in Atiu,  for the Workshop 

on    special  education.  I  was  there  yesterday  and  personally  declared  the  workshop 

open.    Although  I  was  invited  to  send  a  message  to  the  participants,  I  felt  that  my 

being there in  person will be a greater encouragement to  them.  So to you all in the 

</span><span>Teacher’s Workshop in Atiu,  I give my best regards. </span></div><div><span>And also  to  the Principals of the northern group schools who are in their Workshop 

today,    I  give  you  my  best  regards.    Thank  you    also  to  all  the  teachers  who  had 

sacrificed their holidays in order to take part in the  three workshops which were held 

here  in  Rarotonga.  These  include  the  Early  Childhood Education, English and lastly 

the  Social  Science.    I  also  wish  to  express  my  greetings  also  to  the  Cook  Islands 

</span><span>Teachers’ Institute meeting which was held last week. Later on in the afternoon, I will 

</span><span>be  meeting your president  to see to the conditions and needs and also to the pay of 

the teachers at large.   

</span></div><div><span>Lastly  I  would  like  to  thank  the  people  of  Enua  Manu  for  taking  good  care  of  me 

while  I  was  in  Atiu  and  also  the  SDA  Church  in  Atiu.    Also  for  the  camp  you  are 

holding  today  at  the  school.    I  give  my  best  regards.    Also  I  would  like  to  give  a 

</span><span>special thank you to the two Honourable Members from Atiu for the shade you have 

</span><span>provided while I was there which was also provided by the Ui Ariki of Atiu. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to send my regards to these 

various people and organisations.  Now I will return to the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span> I would like to say thank you to the Minister of Broadcasting the Honourable Tepure 

Tapaitau for bringing this Bill before the House since 1989.  The purpose of the Bill is 

to  extract  from  the  principal  Act  to  make  an  Amendment,  to  give  others  the 

opportunity to apply for a license thus allowing them to operate a service. This move 

</span><span>coincides with Government’s move to privatise Government assets.  As we are aware 

</span><span>Mr Speaker, the Television and broadcasting service has now been given to this new 

company  called  the  Cook  Islands  Broadcasting  Service.  We  also  know  that  the 

members  of  the  company  are  all  local  Cook  Islanders.  I  do  not  like  it  when 

Newspapers  or  the  local  media  publishes  articles  that  Government  assets  are  being 

sold  to  foreigners  and  not  to  the  local  people  of  this  Nation,  namely  the  Maori 

population.  We  can  see  that  in  this  particular  case,  this  asset  has  been awarded to  a 

local company.  There is an interjection from across the floor from the Members of the 

</span><span>Opposition  asking,  what  about  the  Vaimaanga  Hotel?    Mr  Speaker,  I  am  sure  that 

</span><span>Honourable Members are aware that this business of putting assets on the market has 

got  to  be  followed  through  in  accordance  with  proper  business  procedures.  Like  the 

broadcasting  service,  anyone,  any  organisation  or  business  may  apply  to  buy  these 

assets.  As  far  as  the  Vaimaanga  Hotel  is  concerned,  there  has  not  been  any  deal 

finalised.  The  process  of  getting  the  best  deal  and  in  accordance  with  Government 

policy is proceeding. So let nobody in this House or out in the community point the 

finger  and  accuse  Government  of  selling  to  foreigners  when  the  deal  has  not  even 

been finalised. 

</span></div><div><span>Returning  to  the  issue  of  the  Cook  Islands  Broadcasting  Service.  I  want  to 

congratulate  the  shareholders  of  the  Cook  Islands  Broadcasting  Service.  I  want  to 

congratulate the Chairman and the board of trustees for the kind of programme that is 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>2746 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>on  our  television  screens.  It  is  very  very  refreshing,  and  very  appropriate  for  our 

people.    I  personally  like  the  spiritual  content  of  the programmes that are on the air 

and  I  know  our  young  people  and  children  can  and  will  benefit  from  these  spiritual 

programmes. There are negotiations currently underway for pay TV and other services 

of  the  broadcasting  area.  But  that  is  still  under  negotiation  by  the  people  in  this 

particular Field.  But I want to highlight the power of the media through television, the 

radio,  and  through  the  newspapers  and  magazines.    Mr  Speaker,  they  are  very 

powerful.  Let  us  harness  this  powerful  media  for  the  benefit  of  the  people  of  this 

country.  Let us not allow it to run out of control.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any further speakers?  I now call on the Honourable Minister Tepure 

Tapaitau for his reply. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  Kia  Orana  to  you,  Kia  Orana  to 

Honourable Members of this House this afternoon. Kia Orana also to our members of 

the general public who are listening in to our debate on the Amendment Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  in  rounding  up  the  debate  on  the  merits  and  principles  of  the 

Broadcasting Amendment Bill before the House this afternoon, I would like to thank 

all the Honourable Members who spoke in support of the Bill. I also take note of what 

the Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati stated in the House yesterday in regards to 

the non availability of a full telecommunications system and television service to be 

provided to the island of Rakahanga. Like him I share his concern as I also come from 

the same island, with firm connections with Tongareva, Manihiki and Rakahanga.  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker,  this  morning  I  made  some  inquiries  with  Telecom’s  telecommunications 

</span><span>executive  board  in  relation  to  what  was  raised  yesterday  in  the  House  by  the 

Honourable Dr Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  a  response  to  those  inquiries,  Mr  Speaker,  and  this  came  from  the  Chief 

Executive Officer, Mr Stuart Davies of TCI.  Mr Speaker, through you I ask for your 

indulgence  and  leave  to  read  the  response  to  the  House.    The  gist  of  the  letter,  Mr 

Speaker, is:  

</span></div><div><span>No.1.   

</span></div><div><span>“Telephone Service to Rakahanga”.</span></div><div><span>TCI installed a high quality two channel telephone service to Rakahanga from 

the  satellite  earth  station  in  Manihiki  in  December  1996.  The  two  telephone 

</span><span>circuits  terminate  at  TCI’s  Office  in  Rakahanga.    The  telephone  circuits  are 

</span><span>capable of carrying facsimile and TCI has installed a facsimile machine in its 

Rakahanga  Office.    The  service  is  operating  on  a  temporary  trial  basis  at 

present  to  evaluate  the  reliability  as  theoretical  calculations  show  that  this 

service cannot work.  Despite the theory, it is working and TCI will travel to 

Rakahanga to make a permanent installation. The Member for Rakahanga, the 

Honourable  Pu</span><span>puke  Robati  personally  rang TCI’s Chief Executive Officer to 

</span><span>thank him for the new service in January 1997. The new service operates over 

</span><span>the  telephone  network  and  there  is  no  need  for  the  “over”  as  on  HF  radio 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2747 

</span></div><div><span>circuits.    At  present  the  service  is  through  the  operators.    There  have  been 

some  delays  in  getting  the  permanent  installation  installed  and  for  this  TCI 

apologises. 

</span></div><div><span>Television Service</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>The television service as provided to the Outer Islands can be provided but at a 

cost of approximately $80,000 and there is a major problem with the delivery 

of the programme tapes to Rakahanga until the airport is recommissioned.  As 

I understand it, Government is considering private or island council ownership 

</span><span>of the Outer Islands television stations which TCI supports.”</span></div><div><span>The Chief Executive Officer, Mr Speaker, ends this letter by saying he hopes the 

above is of some assistance and Kia Manuia. 

</span></div><div><span>At this point in time, Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Chief Executive Officer of 

TCI for providing that information which I have just made available to the 

Honourable Members of this House and to the people of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>You know, Mr Speaker, there has been one or two suggestions from the Members of 

the House which can be taken as food for thought.  In particular Mr Speaker, yesterday 

the Leader of the Democratic-Alliance Party suggested that I as Minister in charge of 

Broadcasting  should  cancel  and  revoke  the  present  arrangement  between  the 

Government and the Cook Islands Broadcasting Service which is a private company.  

He also suggested, Mr Speaker, that I re-advertise the tender and to get a new crowd to 

provide television and radio services. You know, Mr Speaker, I find this suggestion to 

be  absurd,  ridiculous  and  irresponsible.  Ridiculous  and  irresponsible,  Mr  Speaker, 

because  for  me  to  cancel  the  present  arrangement  is  illegal  and  such  action  would 

incur a civil liability on Government. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  They are not functioning. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>    The  fact  of  the  matter  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  there  is  still  an 

existing contract between the Government and CIBS. For me to intervene is not only 

illegal,  Mr  Speaker,  but  it  would  be  an  irresponsible  attitude  that  I  would  not  even 

think of.  He calls from his side of the floor that they failed to perform.  I want him to 

stand up and prove to this House that they have, because he could not. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Those Members from Aitutaki have already said. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAI:</span><span>    You  see,  Mr  Speaker,  there  is  nothing  that  I  can  do  unless 

there has been a breach of the existing contract.  There has not been and my hands are 

really tied. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in the past I have had a number of approaches by other interested parties 

to be involved in the broadcasting area.  I have explained to these people that there is 

nothing really that I can do to put on tender the Broadcasting Services as there are no 

grounds  or  causes  for  me  to  believe  that  the  present  contract  with  CIBS  has  been 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>2748 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>breached.    On  that  basis,  Mr  Speaker,  I  have  told  him  the  legal  position  and  that 

position still remains until such time that there is a breach to be found. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  pay  tribute  to  George  Pitt  and  his  crowd  for  the 

continued service in the area of TV and radio.  Despite the fact, Mr Speaker, they have 

been through some very difficult and rough patches in the past  I am pleased to advise 

this  House,  Mr  Speaker,  that  there  are  negotiations  being  held  between  CIBS  and 

another interested party and I am told that these negotiations will soon be finalised in 

the  very  near  future.  I  have  a  message  for  Mr  Pitt  and  his  associates.    Keep  up  the 

good  work.    Hold  tight  to  the  programmes  that  you  have  been  beaming  on  our  TV 

screens  when  there  has  been  nothing  else  to  be  shown  because  of  the  financial  and 

administrative difficulties that you are going through.  I am sure that the bulk of the 

watching and listening public appreciate the Christian programmes that you have. I am 

also sure that these programmes are being appreciated by most of the viewing public, 

are  very  educational  and  mixes  well  with  the  Christian  upbringing  of  our  people  in 

this country. 

</span></div><div><span>There is a concern Mr Speaker, that was raised from the members of the Outer Islands 

</span><span>regarding their TV station.  They talked about the costs involved and the operators not 

</span><span>being paid. I share that concern with them.  When CIBC was privatised, Mr Speaker, I 

made  it  a  must  that  the  Outer  Islands  stations  are  not  forgotten  in  the  deal.  But  Mr 

Speaker, in the negotiations between CIBC and CIBS the costs, the wages and salaries 

of the operators became obstacles to the contract being finalised. In the end, CIBS was 

privatised and an alternative arrangement had to be found for the Outer Islands. The 

Outer  Islands,  Mr  Speaker,  through  their  Government  Representatives,  Mayors  and 

Island  Council  were  given  the  option  of  running  their  own  TV  stations  and 

negotiations and consultations with the Island Council of each island and the Aronga 

Mana have been going on for quite some time. 

</span></div><div><span>There  has  been  continued  dialogue  between  my  committee  working  on  the  outer 

islands set up and between the Island Council of each of the outer islands. Very soon 

Mr  Speaker,  there  will  be  a  final  proposal  that  is  going  to  be  adopted.  If  it  is 

acceptable to the Island Council it will then be put into place.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would be a miss if I did not acknowledge the time and effort put in by 

former chairpersons of the Cook Islands Broadcasting Corporation.  I pay tribute Mr 

</span><span>Speaker,  to  Mr  Tim  Arnold,  Ewan  Smith,  Brett  Porter,  John  Wichman  and  Percy 

</span><span>Henderson  for  providing  their  time  and  effort  and  the  management  of  the  previous 

board of the corporation before the privatisation was initiated.  I thank you all for your 

contributions in maintaining the services in the past years. However, Mr Speaker, I am 

saddened  to  hear  the  adverse  remarks  made  by  the  Honourable  Dr  Terepai  Maoate 

about  certain  members  of  the  board  taking  advantage  of  their  positions  in  the 

promotion of their own companies at the cost of services. As Minister of broadcasting 

Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to apologise to those who have been offended by 

the Honourable Members remarks and are unable to defend themselves in this House.    

</span></div><div><span>In  conclusion  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  give  my  assurances  to  our  people  in  the 

outer  islands  as  soon  as  all  the  arrangements  for  your  TV  stations  are  ready  and 

finalised,  these  proposals  would  be  returned  to  you  to  be  adopted  and  if  they  are 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2749 

</span></div><div><span>acceptable  to  the  Island  Council  and  Aronga  Mana  they  will  then  be  put  into  place.  

Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister for your comments and reply.
