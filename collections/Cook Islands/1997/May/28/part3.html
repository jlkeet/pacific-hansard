<div><span>NO QUORUM 

</span></div><div><span>We  now  have  a  quorum.    So  the  Honourable  Member  from  Nukuroa  you  may 

continue.   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VAVIA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I was thanking the Chairman for preparing the report 

by this Committee which we can see before the House.  This is the Prime Minister Sir 

Geoffery  Henry  K.B.E  and  also  all  the  Committee  Members  who  worked  hard  in 

performing the tasks that they were given. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  to  Honourable  Members  on  the  Government  side  and  also  to  those  in 

Opposition.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to give my support to this Report.  This is a beautiful report in the 

sense that it is a Report with some positive effects concerning everyone in the Cook 

Islands.  With regards to the efforts from different parties in contributing to the final 

Report and the Bills, I would like to give my acknowledgment to the FEM staff and 

Government  for coming up with  this idea of introducing VAT.  I would also like to 

extend my appreciation to the officials who assisted in every way with the Committee.  

Finally,  I  would  like  to  pass  on  the  same  appreciation  to  all  those  who  made 

submissions to the Committee including witnesses that came and gave evidence.   

</span></div><div><span>Although  there  was  a  draft  VAT  Bill  and  an  Income  Tax  Bill,  these  witnesses 

highlighted areas in the two Bills that would best be suited to this country.  Some of 

them appeared twice before the Committee.  Some of them came and gave their time 

freely, as well as advice to the Committee.  That shows that their interest is with the 

Bills, and with a better out-look for the future of the Cook Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>However,  Mr  Speaker,  those  efforts  by  the  Committee,  and  including  the  witnesses 

were whittled down even to the sense of leaving a bad taste.  Because it is sad if the 

Leader  of  the  Opposition  feels  that  only  himself  and  his  Deputy  were  mostly 

</span><span>responsible  for  putting  this  Report  together.    Despite  that,  this  Report  followed  on 

</span><span>after the VAT and Income Tax Bills, and I hope members of the public would call into 

Parliament to pick up a copy of the Report first, and then the Bill at a later stage. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>2947 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, several Members have spoken about the Bill, but it is such a huge Bill we 

can never get through most of the clauses of both Bills.  As such I believe there are 

</span><span>still  a  lot  of  people  who  feel  that  they  do  not  understand  the  Bill  or  it’s  contents.  

</span><span>There is no doubt in my mind that once they pick up the comprehensible Report, they 

will start to get a picture of how it should be applied and what benefits they can get.  It 

will  not  take  long  at  all  to  understand  how  to  apply  VAT.    It  is  not  as  hard  as  you 

might think.  You probably just need a couple of days of reading, and getting to know 

what area of VAT applies to you, including the Income Tax Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>During those meetings, Mr Speaker, the Committee came to a total of 40 findings.  Of 

course  we  must  realise  there  was  already  a  draft  Bill  earlier  produced  by  FEM  and 

Government.  That draft Bill was looked at by witnesses and members of the public 

interested in the formation of a better tax regime for the Cook Islands.  As a result of 

the meetings, findings were reached by the Committee.  I will not quote all of them, 

probably just two.  That is, one of the first findings of the Committee was that -VAT 

is  a  much  fairer  tax  regime  than  Turnover  Tax.    That  is  a  finding  that  has  been 

discussed over and over again and for the good reason that it is much more beneficial 

than TOT.   

</span></div><div><span>Another of the findings in the Committee’s Report is that it was noted that TOT was 

</span><span>not  efficient  for  two  reasons.    That  is,  avoidance  at  the  retail  end  of  the  scale  and 

avoidance  of  the  Turnover  Tax.    Secondly,  businesses  were  allowed  to  accumulate 

debt with Inland Revenue.   

</span></div><div><span>The last finding that I will refer to in the House too, although there are a total of 40 

findings, I have no intention of repeating them as they have all been written down in 

this Report.  However, the last finding I would like to mention in the House, is under 

the Income Tax Bill where the proposed Income Tax Bill provides no exemption for 

the allowances of politicians.  So that means that the proposed VAT Bill does not give 

any special benefits for politicians allowances and apparently everybody is treated the 

same whether or not he or she is a politician.  I am not sure whether the Opposition 

supports that or not. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  no  intention  of  going  any  further  into  the  Report  as  it  is  self- 

explanatory, but maybe just one more matter as far as income tax is concerned.  That 

this proposed Income Tax Bill is proposing a tax threshold of $6,000.  To me this is 

</span><span>new, because in the past $5,500 exemption only applied to those who earned $5,500 

</span><span>and less. 

</span></div><div><span>But  the  $6,000  tax  threshold  applies  to  anyone  who  pays  tax. Those earning $6,000 

and  under  will  not  pay  tax  and  those  who  earn  over  $6,000  will  pay  the  difference.  

That,  Mr  Speaker,  is  what  I  wanted  to  add  on  to  the  Income  Tax  Bill.    Before  I  sit 

down I do intend to add more to both Bills during the Principles and the Merits.  In 

particular,  the  effect  that  a  close  neighbour  of  this  country  has  introduced  the  same 

kind  of system into their country about ten years ago and the effects of that on their 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>And, Mr Speaker, that is all I wish to say in support of the Report by the Value Added 

Tax Committee.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2948 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Ngamau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Greetings to you, Mr Speaker, and to all the staff and also to 

Honourable Members of this House, both on the Government side and the Opposition 

side.  Greetings also to the Prime Minister and to all Cabinet Ministers with regard to 

the  Bill  that  is  being  debated  in  the  House.  Also  to  Honourable Members from  the 

Opposition  side  who  are  part  of  the  Select  Committee,  and  also  my  greetings  go  to 

those  who  were  involved  in  making  recommendations  and  being  present  at  the 

meeting  of  the  Special  Select  Committee,  both  Papaa  and  Maori,  who  had  a 

contribution to make to the Report. 

</span></div><div><span>I  was  pleased  that  the  Pastor  of  the  CICC  Church  was  present,  and  also  Mr  Hugh 

Baker from Nikao, I believe that you were involved in the preparation of this Report 

and  also  I  would  be  glad  to  share  with  you  some  thoughts  regarding  this  tax  in  our 

village.   

</span></div><div><span>I am not trying to object to the Bill or support it.  I have a subject in my mind that I 

feel  I  should  say  regarding  this  Bill  because  I  believe  the  Government  of  today  has 

brought this recommendation into the House.   Government has created this Bill to be 

brought into the House and has formed the Select Committee consisting of Members 

from the Government side and the Opposition side, to look into matters.  I believe that 

what  these  people  have  put  together  will  not  be  contrary  to  the  needs  of  the 

community at large, but of benefit to all.   

</span></div><div><span>We know that our country comprises people from a range of backgrounds in terms of 

living  standards.    We  can  regard  some  to  having  a  high  standard  of  living  or  are 

considered wealthy, and there are those in the middle or of an average quality of life, 

and  finally  there  are  those  who  are  not  too  well-off  or  are  within  the  low  income 

bracket  area  and  who  rely  mostly  on  being  self-</span><span>sufficient  utilising  our  country’s 

</span><span>natural resources on the land and in the sea.  I would like to address especially widows 

in our country who have lost their husbands and do not know what or how they need 

to do the things to support their families, especially those widows under 60 years old.  

I  will  leave  that  to  you  people  to  ponder  over  and  one  day  I  will  come  back  to  this 

same thing that I raise now. 

</span></div><div><span>I  for  one  do  not  fully  understand  this  Bill  that  is  coming  into  the  House  and  I  also 

believe that there are others who do not understand it.  But I rest assured that this will 

come to light in the very near future.   

</span></div><div><span>When  I  look  at  it  since  the  day  the  Democratic  Party  Government  brought  the 

Turnover  Tax  into  force,  they  started  off  at  10  %.    For  me,  I  find  it  very  hard  to 

implement  this  Turnover  Tax  introduced  by  the  Democratic  Government,  but  the 

moment we get into action and start implementing the Act, then we will start to find 

out.  Maybe through the course of time as we work on these things, we will come to 

thoroughly understand the effects of the composition of the Bill.  So until we put this 

Bill int</span><span>o practice, then shall we know it’s true effects.</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>2949 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>I wish to speak on a point raised by Mr Hugh Baker.  In light of people who do not 

have  businesses  to  compensate  for  payments  of  electricity  in  their  homes,  for  some 

consumption of electricity is high and with this 12.5% of VAT imposed on this, what 

will happen to them?  At present, when you come up to 76 or 78 units you will have to 

pay 23 cents per unit.  Exceeding 78 units will require you to pay 31.5%.  Then you 

come to a column where if you use more power, you then pay 43 %.  Therefore if you 

try  to  calculate  properly  this  43%  that  you  are  charged  per  unit  in  addition  to  the 

12.5% on top of it, it is almost like you are running a business.  When I look at this 

area, Mr Speaker, this is a burden not really for myself but considering the people at 

large.   

</span></div><div><span>The  stock  food  and  fertilisers  have  been  made  tax  exempt.    The  people  of  Inland 

Revenue explained that when growers and even the backyard growers go and buy their 

stock  food,  everyone  of  them  have  to  be  registered.    I  am  really talking about  those 

people  who  are  just  beginning  to  get  into  this  kind  of  work,  where  it  has  been 

explained  that  once  you  have  been  registered  you  must  keep  your  receipt  to  be 

presented when the need arises to the Inland Revenue Office. 

</span></div><div><span>So it is this area that I am looking at in order that our people can claim refunds.  My 

</span><span>request to Government is to consider these points that I am raising, because you hold 

the majority of the House and we are only a few in Opposition, but we are doing our 

job.    I  would  say  times  are  tough  and  hard  going.    There  are  a  lot  of  people  in  our 

country nowadays who are finding  it difficult as we go along the way.  So I will ask 

those people at Inland Revenue that when our people come to seek help and advice, I 

ask you to attend to their needs and not to get angry at them.   

</span></div><div><span>There  have  times  when  I  have  been  asked  by  some  people  if  I,  as  a  Member  of 

Parliament,  am  paying  taxes,  or  are  we  all  here  being  exempted.    The  answer  was 

given to you by the previous speaker in the House that everyone is taxed right across 

the board.   

</span></div><div><span>This is all that I have to say, Mr Speaker, thank you and Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much  Honourable  Member.  Our next  speaker is 

the Honourable Member Dr Robert Woonton from Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you Mr Speaker on this 

</span><span>rainy afternoon.  Also to Honourable Members on the Government side and also for 

us on the Opposition side. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to speak on the Report that was presented in this House by 

the  Parliament  Special  Select  Committee.  I understand, Mr Speaker, that the Select 

Committee  had  a  numerous  amount  of  people  make  representations  to  this  Select 

Committee  regarding 

those  are 

recommendations made to the Committee that I am fully in support of.  While this is 

only  a  Report  of  the  Select  Committee  and  not  the  Bill  regarding  VAT  and  Income 

Tax, therefore I cannot make too many comments out of this until we see the actual 

Bill pass before the House.  Like what the Leader of the Opposition said earlier, there 

is  no  true  certain  thing  in  life  unlike  death  and  taxes.    Tax  is  a  necessity  that 

</span></div><div><span>the  VAT  and  Income  Tax. 

</span></div><div><span>  And  above 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2950 

</span></div><div><span>everybody  will  have  to  face.    But  we  all  want  to  have  that  tax  fair  and  equitable  to 

most of our people or to the public who are paying taxes.   

</span></div><div><span>I  heard  earlier  the  Associate  Minister  of  Finance  the  Honourable  Papamama  Pokino 

make the comments that the Outer Islands have been the victim of higher taxes in the 

past  as  regards  to  Turnover  Tax.    He  is  quite  right  when  he  stated  that  the  Outer 

Islands now may enjoy a cheaper tax on goods sold in the Outer Islands.  However, he 

fell short of explaining that it is only the business people in the Outer Islands who will 

benefit from this VAT.    

</span></div><div><span>In  fact  the  end  user,  the  people  who  buy  from  the  shops  will  be  the  ones  who  will 

continue to pay the higher prices inspite of the lower VAT Tax that will be imposed 

onto the business people.  The Tax is no longer 10% it will be 12.5% and if you take 

the costs of transport and insurance of those goods, it will be met by the end user, who 

is  the  customer.  Inspite  of  lower  VAT,  the  costs  of  that  item  will  in  fact  increase.  

Especially for the man on the street.   

</span></div><div><span>I  also  note  that  a  number  of  requests  have  been  made  to  exempt  numerous  farming 

</span><span>activities,  educational  facilities,  requests  that  these  should  be  exempted  from  VAT.  

</span><span>And  in  fact  if  we  continue  giving  all  these  exemptions,  it  will  erode  back  whatever 

revenue  Government  will  have  on  VAT.    The  net  effect  will  be  a  lower  revenue 

earned then if it was a straight out Turnover Tax.   

</span></div><div><span>Nowhere in the report do I see some exemptions given to those pensioners having to 

pay their own medicine in our chemists on the island, or even their medical costs.  I 

think it is only fair, Mr Speaker, that the pensioners and the children should be given 

some kind of exemption when they are out there to purchase their medicines.   

</span></div><div><span>Likewise  any  donations  to  the  schools  should  be made exempt.  Mr Speaker, if you 

look at the example of a parent who donates a thousand dollars to a school, but if you 

are  charging this person 12.5% of a thousand dollars that is only $250.  The parents 

have given more to the school then Government will gain from the use of the VAT.  

So if I was the Government I would favour exempting those who donate especially to 

our  institutions  such  as  our  the  Education  Department  and  our  Health  Department.  

Because  I  understand,  Mr  Speaker,  that  these  two  institutions  are  the  worst  of  the 

Government  funded,  if  anything,  they  are  under  funded  by  this  Government.    If 

</span><span>however, we accept some kind of exemption with regards to donations to the Health 

</span><span>Department and donations to the Education Department,  I am sure the public at large 

will be paying a lot more in these kind of donations then a few collected taxes.  With 

regards  to  the  VAT  on  the  power  charges,  I  cannot  understand,  Mr  Speaker,  

Government is giving a facility in one hand and at the same time asking the Aponga to 

charge  our  people  another  straight  out  12.5%.    It  will  not  be  a  2.5%  interest  it  is  a 

straight 12.5% increase.  That is a very substantial increase to any power charges, be it 

domestic or a business power charge.   

</span></div><div><span>In  fact  come  1st  of  July,  if  your  power  charge  is  a  $100  you  are  required  to  pay 

another  $12.50  which  totals  now  to  $112.50  for  your  power,  inspite  of  the  fact  that 

there is no increase in what you consume.  The Minister earlier stated that it is not a 

straight  out  charge of 12.5% on top of the current Turnover Tax which is 10%, it is  

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>2951 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>added to the 10% which is a 2.5% increase, rather than a 12.5% increase.  It creates a 

lot of confusion in those people who are paying VAT.  

</span></div><div><span>Of most concern, the VAT is poorly understood by a lot of small business people.  I 

am not concerned about the big businesses.  They have accounting firms to look after 

them.  I am talking about the numerous small Cook Islanders who are not well versed 

with the use of VAT. One thing is for certain though Mr Speaker, it is going to be at 

an increased cost to them if they have to employ the services of accountants to keep 

and balance their books as a result of them not being well versed with the use of VAT.   

Therefore, they have to resort to employing accountants to do their paper work.  I am 

aware of stories whereby an accountant has charged well over $120 an hour to balance 

the books of  little businesses.  There is nothing wrong with the charges, but can our 

small businesses afford these charges as a result of them being  forced to employ an 

accountant? 

</span></div><div><span>I can predict, Mr Speaker, that in six months time 50% of our small businesses will 

have a lot of difficulty trying to balance their books because of VAT which is poorly 

understood  by  our  own  people.    I  know  the  revenue  and  management  people  have 

</span><span>explained to our people.  I still hear rumblings from the general public that they do not 

</span><span>understand what  VAT is  all about.   Mr Speaker, the complaint is  not  so much what 

was  explained  about  VAT  but  what  will  appear  in  the  final  draft  of  the  Bill.    What 

they are saying and what is in the Bill are two totally different things. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact  I urge Government to go out there and explain to our little people how VAT 

works,  because  there  is  no  greater  fear  than  fear  of  the  unknown.    If  the  people 

understand what VAT is, they will have nothing to be scared of and they will be out 

there paying it on the 20th of every month.  To use another term Mr Speaker, our tax 

package should be user friendly.  Our people should be fully aware of how it works 

and how to live with it.  Mr Speaker, I shall wait until the real VAT Bill comes before 

the House before I make any further comments. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  to  your  staff.  Kia 

Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  who  are  currently  doing  other 

</span><span>business  for  Government,  and  to  all  the  other  Ministers.    Kia  Orana  to  all  the 

</span><span>Government  Members and also  to  the Opposition Leader, his Deputy Leader and all 

the Members.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rose  to  reply  to  some  comments  made  by  the  Honourable  Member 

Norman George but because he is gone, that is all right.  Kia Orana to our people who 

are listening into our discussion on a very important issue that I feel our people should 

understand fully. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I also would like to greet my people on my home island.  Kia Orana to 

the  people  living  on  the  island  of  Araura.    All  your  grievances  and  problems  of  the 

past  have  reached  us.    We  have  had  discussions  with  the  Minister  Ngereteina  Puna 

and the Honourable Member Thomas Hewett.  We have come up with ideas to solve 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2952 

</span></div><div><span>your problems.  I would like to ask you, don’t lose heart, maybe in the future we will 

</span><span>get answers to solve those problems. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand, Mr Speaker, to speak on the Paper before the House.  Firstly, I would like to 

thank the Committee members who discussed the Bills before presenting a Report to 

Parliament.  Also the officials who helped the Committee.  Thank you very much. 

I would like to  thank the Honourable Member Dr Robert Woonton.  He made some 

very good comments on the issue that we are presently discussing in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  If only this is what the Honourable Member Norman George had done, 

nothing would go wrong in this House and we would not be irrelevant but instead he 

got  up  and  spoke  on  something  entirely  different  from  the  Paper  before  the  House.  

This  Paper  shows  us  how  we  are  going  to  pay  our  taxes  and  what  we  are  going  to 

receive from them.   

</span></div><div><span>This Paper does not talk about how we are going to expend the money that we will be 

receiving from  tax revenues.  What  the Paper talks about is the responsibility of the 

tax  payer  as  regards  the  percentage  of  the  tax  that  we  have  to  pay  and  also  other 

</span><span>benefits to the taxpayer.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  Personally  I  get  very  upset  when  people  talk  about  how  Government 

spends the money that they received from tax collection.  The taxpayers still have the 

thought  that  the  tax  money  is  theirs,  and  not  for  Government  to  spend  for  other 

purposes.  Mr Speaker, If you work and you get paid, you have to pay taxes that is our 

law, you must pay taxes.  This money does not belong to you any more, it belongs to 

whoever you are paying this tax to.  If you do not want to pay taxes, then the answer is 

simple.      Just  sit  there,  do  not  buy  anything,  then  you  will  not  pay  any  tax.  For 

example, if I want to lease a piece of my land to someone, it is set out.  This is how it 

works.  This is the condition, This is how much money I want, and this is the rate for 

the lease annually and you have to pay for it.   If you pay this money to the landowner, 

that  money  belongs  to  him.    You  cannot  go  back  and  say,  if  ever  you  think  of 

spending that money you must come and ask me first.    

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Speaker, in order for Government to get revenue, this is what Government 

plans.    You  work,  you  pay  tax,  that  tax  money  does  not  belong  to  you  anymore.   It 

</span><span>belongs to Government.  That is Government’s business as to how to spend the money 

</span><span>that you paid in tax.  That money, that tax that you pay Government does not belong 

</span><span>to  you  any  more,  Mr  Speaker.    A  lot  of  people  are  making  noises  about  how  the 

</span><span>Government is spending the tax money.  That is Government’s business.  It is not your 

business  anymore  because  it  is  the  Government’s  tax  money.    I  have  seen  in  the 

newspaper, Mr Speaker, comments to the effect that this is the people’s money and I 

</span><span>have often asked myself, is it true?  This means, Mr Speaker, that I have the right as 

the leaseholder to pay the landowner his share of the goodwill and also the annual rent 

for  the  lease  that  I  have  and  it  is  also  my  business  to  ask  the  landowner  how  he  is 

going to spend that money. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in this paper and also in the Bills, I feel that it is very simple.  But there 

are  areas  that  need  further  clarification  as  highlighted  by  the  Honourable  Member, 

Robert Woonton and the Honourable Member, Ngamau Munokoa.  Maybe these two 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>2953 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Members are not aware that the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy played a part 

in creating this tax package and yet, maybe those two did not explain to the rest of the 

Opposition  Members    what  was  happening.    They  are  the  ones  coming  out  in  this 

House making wrong comments about the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>In acting, Mr Speaker, if you are an actor in a film, no matter if you are shot or sliced, 

you  will  not  die  and  you  will  end  that  film  still  alive.    The  Honourable  Member, 

Norman George got  up and thought  he was the actor of this paper before the House 

and  the  next  minute  he  realised  that  he  was  shot  by  the  two  Members  in  the 

Opposition and he got hurt.  That is probably why he got up and left the Chamber.  I 

have  no  problem  with  that  Mr  Speaker,  because  we  know  the  Honourable  Member.  

There are certain things that he wants to be the actor for. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  reason  why  I  rose,  is  to  ask  this  House  not  to  talk  about  how 

</span><span>Government is going to spend the taxpayer’s tax that they pay.  Rather, to talk about 

</span><span>the content in the Bills and also in this Report.  For example, the registration.  How is 

</span><span>it going to work?   What are the benefits if I register or if I don’t register? Wi</span><span>ll I get 

any  benefit  from  it?    What  I  am  really  looking  at  Mr  Speaker,    is  will  there  be  any 

</span><span>qualification  required  for  those  who  are  putting  in  an  application  to  apply  for 

</span><span>registration?  So if there is any benefit, will they be required to have a certain number 

of things in order for them to be able to qualify for applying to be registered?  So how 

can we make a claim because the 12.5 % is explained? For example, if you buy a tin 

of meat, what do you claim out of a tin of beef if you have this right to register?  Mr 

Speaker,   Previous speakers have spoken their views on this.  Maybe we will wait for 

when the Bill  comes in,  because we are debating on the Report at  this time.  It will 

become  clearer  for  us  to  speak  when  the  Bill  comes  in.    Sure,  I  will  rest  here,  Mr 

Speaker, because this is not the end of this Report that we are deliberating over.  So 

this is what I have to say, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, to all the staff, 

to Honourable Members and to our people listening in.  

</span></div><div><span>There  is  no  doubt  Mr  Speaker,  from  the  response,  that  there  is  a  lot  of  interest 

</span><span>amongst Members to speak on the Bill.  Which indicates a strong concern for what  is 

</span><span>to be put for our people as far as tax is concerned. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  confine  myself,  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  Report,  but  firstly  I  would  like  to  say 

thankyou  very  much  to  the  Committee.    I  feel  that  we  have  worked  as  a  team  and 

thankyou to your staff also.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, Like what has been mentioned earlier, I am beginning to believe that  one 

of the ways we can sort out controversial issues or issues that are very important to the 

people  of  this  country  is  by  going  through  a  Select  Committee.    I  have  enjoyed  the 

experience not only on this Select Committee, but also on other Select Committees in 

the past up to now, but particularly this one.  This has been a very conflicting issue, a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2954 

</span></div><div><span>very  concerned  one  not  only  for  me  as  a  Member  of  the Committee, but  as I see it, 

conflicting from the point of view of the people. 

</span></div><div><span>Value  Added  Tax,  in  combination with  Income Tax as a Bill  is  a complicated issue 

and it has a language of its own.  We have heard the Honourable Minister, Ngereteina 

Puna state, that we have had twenty meetings on this Select Committee.  It shows you 

Members of Parliament and our people listening in that there has been a lot of concern 

and  a  lot  of  hard  work  to  understand  the  Bill  first,  and  to  understand  why  it  is 

necessary to bring into Parliament as the Report says. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to give a special thankyou to those who have put in a lot of effort to bring 

forward  submissions  to  this  Select  Committee.    There  is  special  mention  of  their 

</span><span>names in the Report, Mr Speaker, and I therefore won’t mention their names for the 

</span><span>fear of missing some out.  But I would like to thank them very much indeed for the 

effort  that  they  have  put  in  for  the  Committee.    It  was  through  them  that  the 

Committee  was  able  to  deliberate  on  certain  very  important  issues  and  these  have 

already been mentioned by some of the speakers today. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like also to give a special thankyou to the staff of the FEM and also to Crown 

</span><span>Law. In their responses to the requests by the Committee, to assist the Committee in 

certain aspects of the issue, they were working long hours up to the early morning and 

we appreciate that very much Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to say, Mr Speaker, that the attitude that I see with Members of the Select 

Committee  into  this  VAT  and  Income  Tax  Bill  was  really  one  that  has  ended  with 

what is best for the people of this Country.  I appreciate the effort given by the Prime 

Minister  as  Chairman  of  this  Committee,  the  Honourable  Papamama  Pokino  as 

Deputy  Chairman  of  this  Committee  and  to  all  of  us  who  have  been  named  as 

Members of the Select Committee that have worked on this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>The concept that I see here, Mr Speaker, is based on the experiences that we have had 

with Turnover Tax.  From the submissions, from the expressions and the experiences 

of people that were involved, that is enough to convince me that we have had enough 

experience of Turnover Tax.  Turnover Tax as we know, is tax upon tax, upon tax and 

there is no ending until it gets to the consumer.  There is no such thing as we will see 

with VAT, that is to have a drawback on what you have paid on the Turnover Tax. 

</span></div><div><span>The experiences of New Zealand and other countries I feel are of benefit to us when 

dealing with this tax package.  It is the view that I have and the view of the Committee 

that this package should be a better one for our country.  To me, Mr Speaker, it must 

be considered and looked at as a package, not two separate packages.  This has to be 

looked at that way, otherwise people will be looking at the VAT as the same thing as 

Turnover Tax and Income Tax.   

</span></div><div><span>My advice, Mr Speaker, is that for anyone to appreciate the package, it has got to be 

looked at both in view of the VAT and also in view of the advantages of the Income 

Tax Bill.   I feel  that it is  fair to  say, Mr Speaker, as has already been mentioned by 

other speakers that we should not rubbish the Turnover Tax.  It was something that we 

had to go through.  We appreciated it at the time, and we learnt our lesson from it and 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>2955 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>now we have decided that it has taken us down a hole and we need something better.  

No-one should be pointing fingers at others because both administrators in the past up 

to now have used the Turnover Tax system.  

</span></div><div><span>As already stated, Mr Speaker, the VAT is taxed on the Consumer, it is a consumer 

oriented tax.  The difference with VAT is that it is only taxed once not like the TOT 

where you found that tax is placed and moved from one to the other, from importers 

wholesalers to retailers.  

</span></div><div><span>When  we  look  at  this  Report,  it  simply  tells  you  the  objective  of  the  Committee.  It 

informs  us  what  the  submissions  were  and  who  the  people  were  who  brought  the 

submissions  to  the  Committee.    The  Report  outlines  the  proposals  for  Members  of 

Parliament to look at.  If you go through the Report, you will find there are 28 changes 

that this Report is proposing for Honourable Members to address.  

</span></div><div><span>The Report simply recommends that the Bill be withdrawn and for it to be redrafted 

by the Crown Law.  You will find in page 22 of the Report, the number of proposals 

that  the  Committee  is  asking Parliament to  approve for changes in  the Bill.   It  talks 

</span><span>about  the  provision  for  a  mediator  service.    It  also  talks  about  the  changes  that  the 

</span><span>Committee  saw  fit.    For  example,  to  allow  importers  to  have  the  Value  Added  Tax 

paid  before  the  20th  of  the  next  month  instead  of  at  the  bottom.    It  also  allows  any 

business  to  make  individual  arrangements  for  settlement  of  its  liabilities.    It  allows 

defaulters  not  to  be  denied  deferred  payments  in  the  system.    It  also  makes 

accommodation  operators  pay  VAT  on  a  case  or  invoice  basis.    If  the  20th  of  the 

month for the VAT falls on a holiday,  it will be put on the next available day instead 

of bringing it forward.  It  also  provides for articles that are not normally ordered by 

any company or anybody, it will allow a person or a individual to bring that article in 

without Value Added Tax.  

</span></div><div><span>I am aware that the Value Added Tax on sea freight and air freight to the Outer Islands 

has already mentioned and I think that is important.  This is because the Outer Islands 

want to have that zero rating so that the pricing of things will be reduced to a certain 

extent without having to go much higher than if the Tax was imposed.  

</span></div><div><span>There has been discussion on the gift, Mr Speaker, I would like to say that the reason 

for  allowing  the  amount  to  go  up  to  $5,000  is  to  encourage  people  to  donate  to 

</span><span>institutions, to  charitable organisations ,even to  the hospital.  You are allowed to do 

</span><span>that  as  long  as  it  is  not  less  than  $200  and  not  more  than  $500  this  is  really  to 

encourage our people to donate to these institutions.   

</span></div><div><span>The request by the live stock farmers and the growers has also been attended to by this 

Committee  and  there  is  a  recommendation  here  to  exempt  fertilisers  and  stock  food 

for live stock.  

</span></div><div><span>I know that the pensioners have also been mentioned with regards to their electricity 

consumption and there is  special attention to that.  Not all pensioners will qualify and 

there  will  be  a  list  of  those  who  will  qualify  and  this  will  go  to  the  Aponga  for 

exemptions.    

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2956 

</span></div><div><span>I am aware that my time is running out Mr Speaker, but I would like to ask Members 

of  Parliament,  Honourable  Members  to  respond  to  the request  of the Committee for 

the Report to look at these changes that have been listed which are 28 altogether, as I 

stated previously. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  with  your  indulgence  I  wish  to  convey  this  message  to  the  people  of 

Takitumu that the march that was organised for the Primary school to march through 

Takitumu has now postpone because of bad weather.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No. 67 be received 

</span></div><div><span>Paper received 

</span></div><div><span>Can an Honourable Member please close us with a prayer. 

</span></div><div><span>Prayers 

</span></div><div><span>This House do now adjourn until tomorrow Thursday 29th May 1997 at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting adjourned at 3.58 p.m.</span></div><div>Page: <a>1</a>, <a>2</a>, <a>3</a>, <a>4</a>, <a>5</a>, <a>6</a>, <a>7</a>, <a>8</a>, <a>9</a>, <a>10</a>, <a>11</a>, <a>12</a>, <a>13</a>, <a>14</a>, <a>15</a>, <a>16</a>, <a>17</a>, <a>18</a>, <a>19</a>, <a>20</a>, <a>21</a></div>
