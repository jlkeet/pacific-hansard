</span></div><div><span>Paper No.67.  The Report of the Parliamentary Special Select Committee established 

by Parliament to look into the Value Added Tax Bill and the Income Tax Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, on behalf of Sir Geoffrey 

Henry K.B.E, Chairman of the Special Select Committee established by Parliament to 

look  into  the  Value  Added  Tax  Bill  and  the  Income  Tax  Bill,  I  have  the  honour  to 

present the Report of that Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>I now lay on it the Table. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I now call upon the Leader of the 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  R.  JACK:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you,  Kia  Orana  also  to  all 

Honourable Members of this Honourable House on both sides, and also to our people 

of the Cook Islands listening in to our deliberations this afternoon.  Also a special Kia 

Orana to my electorate of Avatiu, Ruatonga up to Palmerston Island. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, 

</span></div><div><span>I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 70(1) be suspended in order for the House to proceed onto 

the consideration of the Paper No.67 forthwith. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Leader of the House.  May I call for a Seconder please.   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr U. Matata. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>2937 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No.67.  The Report of the Parliamentary Special Select Committee established 

by Parliament to look into the Value Added Tax Bill and the Income Tax Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I call upon the Honourable Minister Papamama Pokino, I can see in the gallery 

students  from  Tereora  College.    I  can  also  see  a  lady  teacher.    So  on  behalf  of  the 

House we welcome you to the Session this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call upon the Honourable Minister Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:</span><span>    Thank  you  again,  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia 

Orana to you once again.  To your staff and to all Honourable Members of the House 

and  our  people  who  are  listening  in.    Special  greetings  to  our  visitors  from  Tereora 

</span><span>College. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Report of the Parliamentary Special Select Committee established by 

Parliament to look into the Value Added Tax Bill and the Income Tax Bill be 

received. 

</span></div><div><span>In  doing  so,  let  me  remind  the  House  that  an  interim  Report  has  already  been 

submitted to the House for debate. 

</span></div><div><span>However  this  Report  is  the  final  Report  of that Committee.  Mr Speaker, before we 

proceed may I apologise to the House, because I had promised that the Bills would be 

submitted  to  Parliament  today.    Unfortunately  as  you  can  see  they  are  very  thick 

documents and are still being printed which will be ready by tomorrow morning.  To 

complicate  matters  further.  I  have  been  informed  by  your  staff  that  these  two 

documents need to be reduced further to a standard format of this size before it can be 

classed  as  a  Parliamentary  document.    However,  I  have  not  spoken  to  the  Clerk  yet 

</span><span>and  I  hope  to  consult  with  him  and  ask  for  his  agreement  so  that  the  Bill  can  be 

</span><span>submitted  in  the  format  already  under-going  the  printing  process,  as  the  reduction 

process will add to the procrastination. 

</span></div><div><span>Whatever happens, Mr Speaker, the printing and the binding of the document in this 

format,  will  be  completed  by  tomorrow  morning.    It  was  intended  then  to  distribute 

the copies to the Members and for the Members to go into camera to go through with 

the  officials  responsible  for  drafting  this  Bill,  to  go  through  with  them  in  detail  to 

explain  to  the  Members  in  essence  what  the  Bill  is  all  about.    By  following  that 

</span><span>process, it is hoped that when the Bill is finally submitted for debate, that the debate 

</span><span>will be as short as possible because the Members will then be aware of what is inside 

the Bill.  In fact, Mr Speaker, I think there has been enough explanation to the public 

for them to be interested in the debate in this Chamber. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2938 

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  the  Report  itself,  Mr  Speaker,  let  me  just  repeat  the  names  of  the 

Members on the Select Committee.  The Chairman of the Committee is Sir Geoffrey 

Henry,  and  the  Members  are  myself,  the  Honourable  Member  Tangata  Vavia,  the 

Honourable  Member  Norman  George  and  the  Honourable  Member  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate.    I  can  assure  you  that  we  sat  through  many  days  to  make  certain,  what  is 

incorporated in the Bill reflects the views of the general public. 

</span></div><div><span>Many  submissions  were  received  either  in  writing  or  verbally,  and  I  believe,  Mr 

Speaker,  the  submissions  presented  were  reflections  of  a  wide  cross-section  of  our 

community.    They  were  from  the  business  sector,  the  various  community  clubs  and 

some submissions  from  some backyard farmers and fishermen.  We even received a 

submission from an Outer Islands business person. 

</span></div><div><span>While we were going through and scrutinising all the submissions, the officials were 

visiting  communities  on  Outer  Islands  to  explain  to  people  the  general  effect  of  the 

new Bills.  Although the Committee may think that what has been incorporated in the 

Bills is the best they could do, we can only judge that by its effect when it comes into 

operation.  According to the proposals the Bill is to come into effect on the 1st July 

</span><span>this year.  We will not truly know of its full effect until the 1st July, 1998.   

</span></div><div><span>However,  Mr  Speaker,  as  the  Committee  went  through  the  task  of  examining 

submissions and going through clauses in the Bill, I became convinced that the Bill is  

the  best  that we could  devise for our country.  Although based on tax regimes from 

other  countries,  the  Committee  set  out  as  much  as  possible  with  the  intention  of 

</span><span>introducing a local “face” to the Bill.  By adapting the Bill to the needs and conditions 

</span><span>pertaining  to  the  situation  of  the  Cook  Islands,  it  will  create  a  more  sound  and 

effective  Bill  of  our  own,  instead  of  unnecessarily  just adopting overseas provisions 

and measures which may in some areas be irrelevant.  For example, I think at the last 

meeting we held we introduced two measures we thought will help our local business 

people,  our  local  farmers  and  fishermen.    The  two  issues  took  us  a  long  time  to 

deliberate  over,  but  eventually,  and  finally,  we  decided  that  there  was  a  need  to 

encourage the local fishermen and farmers.  Those measures that were introduced saw 

the zero rating of food stock and fertilisers.  This means there will no longer be any 

taxes due, for food stock and fertilisers. 

</span></div><div><span>At  this  stage,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  correct  some  misconceptions.    I  do  not 

</span><span>know whose fault it is but it appears that the perception of the general public is that 

</span><span>VAT (Value Added Tax), is going to be imposed on top of the TOT (Turnover Tax) 

that  is  currently  in  existence.    Let  the  public  be  assured  that  once  the  VAT  and  the 

new Income Tax is implemented, Turnover Tax will be repealed.  In other words, the 

Value  Added  Tax  will  replace  the  Turnover  Tax,  and  not  be  combined  with  the 

Turnover  Tax.    As  a  result,  there  is  very  little  change  as  far  as  tax  payments  are 

concerned.  For example, at  the present  time when you buy something from  a shop, 

you will be paying something like 11.1% on top of the price of the item you bought to 

cater  for  Turnover  Tax.    Once  this  new  package  is  introduced  you  will  pay  12.5% 

instead of 11.1%.  The difference, Mr Speaker, is only Rarotonga will pay that.  In the 

Outer  Islands  they  have  been  paying  over  16%  Turnover  Tax.    I  think  that  is 

something  that has  been misunderstood in  the past.   I do not  think that most people 

have been aware that the Outer Islands are paying more Turnover Tax than the people 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>2939 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>in Rarotonga.  Because Turnover Tax has been imposed on landed cost.  So that the 

Turnover Tax is applied on the cost when it gets to the business in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Honourable Member Norman George.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Normal Extension be granted to the Honourable Minister to speak on  

this Paper, as well as to any of the other Members who may wish to  

do so, that Normal Extension be granted 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Can I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Dr R. Woonton 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Minister you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Mover and the Seconder 

of  the  Motion  and  also  the  Members  of  the  House  for  agreeing  that  I  be  able  to 

continue to speak.   

</span></div><div><span>As I was saying, Mr Speaker, the Outer Islands pay Turnover Tax on the cost at the 

door of a business or retailer.  In other words, they buy their goods in Rarotonga, pay 

for the transport of those goods to the wharf, pay for the freight on a boat, a barge or 

plane, then again the transport of the goods into their shops and addition of the mark-

up and finally 10% on top of all of that.  Which at the end is equivalent to about 16 

something percent.   

</span></div><div><span>What this VAT is proposing is to do away with the VAT on freight which includes the 

boating transport of goods, so that the outer island people pay 12.5% of the cost of the 

goods from Rarotonga.  Plus of course, in addition, the mark-up of the business people 

in the Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>As you can see, this package is fairer to the Outer Islands and unfair to Rarotonga by a 

difference  of  1.4%.    Therefore,  the  reduction  to  certain  expenses  will  allow  a 

reduction  of  the  cost  of  the  whole  package.    Lesser  expenses  required  of  them  I 

assume,  then  what  was  expected  to  be  paid  previously.    In  fact,  Mr  Speaker,  the 

response and the vibration we have received from the business sector is that- once the 

VAT is in place, the costs of the actual goods will be reduced as well.  That is just one 

part of the VAT package that I would like to see in place, although there will be other 

</span><span>advantages.  For example, the plane fares to the Outer Islands will not be subjected to 

</span><span>VAT.  And as we are aware, the people using the planes are mainly Outer Islanders, so 

that is an added advantage as far as the Outer Islands is concerned.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2940 

</span></div><div><span>In  case  the  people  of  Rarotonga  start  grumbling  about  the  favours  that  we  are 

providing for the Outer Islands, let me just remind them that ever since the Turnover 

Tax was introduced it has seen the Outer Islands suffer as a result.  And that is for a 

period  of  15  or  16  years,  where  they  had  to  pay  the  excessive  Turn  Over  Tax.    By 

introducing these new measures it at least minimises the burden of tax payments in the 

Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Before I finish,  Mr Speaker, I think it is  in  order for me to  give thanks to the many 

people who presented submissions, either in writing or verbally.  As the report notes, 

Mr Speaker, they are too numerous for me to go through name by name.  Nevertheless 

I  think  these  people  know  who  they  are  and  I  thank  you  all  for  your  assistance  and 

your  contributions  in  providing  what  we  think  is  a  fair  tax  system  for  the  Cook 

Islands.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  Can I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Hon. N. George 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Paper No. 67 be received 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    To  you,  Mr  Speaker,  to  all  the 

Honourable Members of the House and to our people listening in this afternoon Kia 

Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>I  also  extend  a  very  special  Greeting  to  the  Tereora  College  students  in  the  public 

gallery, it is always nice to see students about.  And, Mr Speaker, I hope that they will 

be invited one day to all come in here and be given a trial run on how to speak in the 

Chamber, as seen on TV by some students recently in New Zealand.  I hope they can 

show Members of this House better manners, better usage of appropriate English, and 

not to exercise the use of bad words.  So, Mr Speaker, it is always a pleasure to see 

students, and the Opposition very much support every school student at work, and also 

feel sympathy for them every day because Government is unable to provide them with 

adequate facilities.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  this  Report  in  Parliament  Paper  No.  67  is  a  very  good  one.    I 

recommended it to the public, especially to those interested in the new Value Added 

Tax and the new Income Tax Packages.  They are available at Parliament, so purchase 

your copy for just $12.  But I want to advise all the Demo/Alliance supporters that the 

caucus  copy  will  be  at  our  Opposition  Office  in  town,  if  you  want  to  see  it  for  free 

come to our office and it will be made available free to you.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  together  with  Dr  Maoate  we  participated  in  this  Select  Committee  to 

study and see what improvements can be made, to take evidence from different groups 

of  people  about  their  views  on  these  new  taxation  packages,  and  together  we put  in 

many hours.  Our task on the Committee was to try and humanise this tax package, to 

try and make it as acceptable and easier to live with, as possible. That was our role as 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>2941 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Opposition  Members.    But  we  are  very  happy  to  report  that  every  time  we  took  the 

lead on this, our friends in Government went along with us.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, no one enjoys taxation.  Everybody hates taxation.  There is a saying that- 

</span><span>“there are only two certainties in life, one is taxation and the other one is death”.  As 

</span><span>you can see, Mr Speaker, both are unpleasant. 

</span></div><div><span>So overall, when you look at the tax package there is an element of fairness compared 

to the Turnover Tax because this is a follow on from the Turnover Tax.  The TOT was 

</span><span>the  first  regime  to  introduce  this  form  of  taxation  back  in  the  80’s.    Of  course  like 

</span><span>everything else, once you have tried and tested something out you will find that a later 

model  will  always  be  better  with  improvements.    In  terms  of  comparison  with  the 

Turnover  Tax,  one  could  say  that  VAT  is  a  fairer  form  of  taxation  compared  with 

Turnover Tax.   

</span></div><div><span>When  one  looks  from  the  Government’s  viewpoint,  Government  will  also  be 

</span><span>collecting more revenue by adopting this new taxation package.   

</span></div><div><span>The  last  person  on  the  index  but  by  no  means  the  least,  is  the  one  that  we  are 

</span><span>concerned with.  We feel sorry for the consumers, the ordinary citizens, the kids in the 

gallery, their mothers and fathers.  They are the ones who are going to feel the pinch 

of  this  tax.    The  end  user,  the  consumer,  is  the  person  who  pays  for  it  all  without 

receiving a refund.  I warn, that there will be some price increases.  I warn, that the 

price of electricity will go up.  But I am also happy to record that the Committee have 

gone to  extra trouble to  ensure that those pensioners and the destitute, who are on a 

single pension with no other income, will be protected by the introduction, they will 

be given relief by the release of the new Value Added Tax.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  some  pensioners  are  very  high  earners,  for  example,  people  such  as 

yourself, earn a lot of money and therefore, the Committee was conscious of the fact 

that  there  are  some  wealthy  pensioners  and  some  non  -  wealthy  pensioners  as  well.  

Pensioners like the Minister of Education who are earning  huge salaries will not be 

given any special consideration.  As I say, for those old age pensioners and people on 

destitute allowances will not  be hurt by the increase in  power charges because there 

will be some provisions made for them to either be exempted, or I suspect they will 

get a slight increase in their allowance to cover the new power charges. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my experience with this Government is the following.  When they refer 

matters to a Select Committee, which is a rarity.  That is probably the only time that 

they  do  something  straight  because  by  referring  things  to  a  Select  Committee,  they 

involve members of the Opposition.  But when they are left on their own, when they 

do things on their own.  Their political agenda always poisons their minds.  They are 

forever coming out with something that will always benefit them politically at the end 

of the day. You see, when you introduce tax packages, you are talking about finances, 

you are talking about revenue.  

</span></div><div><span>In  the  so  called  “Henry  Powell”  reforms  that  we  are  supposed  to  be  enjoying  and 

</span><span>experiencing, there are so many things that are Okay and there are so many things that 

are crooked.  In some cases, especially little insignificant cases, there is transparency 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2942 

</span></div><div><span>where  it  counts,  where  it  involves  large  amounts  of  public  funds,  transparency 

becomes  a  blackout,  a  total  blackout.    The  end  result  is  that  vital  information,  for 

example the Rarotongan deal, where $750,000 of the taxpayers money has been given 

to a private person to refurbish the hotel with all risks, no guarantees. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MARSTERS:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  What is your Point of Order 

Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MARSTERS:</span><span>    Irrelevancy,  Mr  Speaker,  this  Honourable  Member  cannot 

help  himself,    he  just  cannot  help  himself.    He  must  at  all  times  attack  this 

Government and the good work that this Government is trying to do.  He was a part of 

this Committee, but he still cannot help himself from having a go.  Mr Speaker, please 

bring him back to the point. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Can  the  Honourable  Member  please  leave  that  matter  and  come 

back to the Paper on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, you see we are speaking about reforms and this is 

tax.  The tax is what brings money, and it is the money that this tax brings in  that this 

Government is giving to people like Mr Crocombe without security, without guarantee 

and it is your money, it is the taxpayers money from this type of Report that we have 

before us.  It is under this package of reform.  How can you have a one sided reform? 

How  can  you  have  one  reform  in  one  corner  and abuse on the otherside?  How can 

you  do  that?  Our  job  in  Opposition,  is  to  highlight  the  hypocrisy  and  to  a  certain 

extent,  dishonesty,  that  is  going  on  in  Government  today.    Mr  Speaker,  we  are  told 

that  the  new  reform  package  involves  total  accountability,  transparency.    There  are 

laws,  there  is  a  FEM  Act  in  existence  which  clearly  spells  out  that  every  financial 

transaction in the country shall be disclosed to this Country, shall be disclosed in this 

House.  I have not read any disclosure about the Crocombe deal over the Rarotongan 

of over $750,000.  We are also concerned that a sum of closer to $5 million will be 

spent on the Forum.  Then the public has been advised  - </span><span>it isn’t going to be $500,000, 

</span><span>more likely $5 million. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MARSTERS:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  What is your Point of Order 

Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MARSTERS:</span><span>    The  issue  of  the  Rarotongan  should  not  be  read  in 

conjunction with this Report.  This Report is about the tax package before this House.  

The Honourable Member should know.  After all, he was part of the Committee who 

prepared  the  Report  which  concerns  the  tax  package  which  will  be  coming  to  the 

House very shortly.  Please Mr Speaker, bring this Honourable Member back on track. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Point of Order is quite irrelevant Honourable Member.  Please 

take your seat and do not answer back while I am speaking. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>2943 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>What I am saying Honourable Member is that the Point of Order is quite relevant.  I 

suggest that you leave that matter there and come back to the Report with which we 

are dealing with at the moment. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  you  do  not  collect  taxes,  you  do  not  introduce 

</span><span>taxation measures, you don’t force people to pay taxes without the ability to explain to 

</span><span>them how their money is going to be spent.  Taxation is a duty that is placed on the 

people to pay money to Government and that duty of paying taxes includes the duty of 

Government to act responsibly. 

</span></div><div><span>The gist of what I am saying, Mr Speaker, is that while we have this taxation system 

under the reform package being set up to collect more taxes, the Government is failing 

in its duty to account for those taxes.  And if the system is faulty at the moment, then 

</span><span>there  is  the  need  for  improvement.    If  we  don’t  highlight  these  mistakes  and  these 

</span><span>weaknesses, then what is the use of us being in this House?    

</span></div><div><span>My  argument  is  an  overall  view,  from  the  collection  point  of  view  to  the  spending 

point of view and I was highlighting the areas of spending that some Members in this 

</span><span>House find unpalatable.  And I am just sorry that you find that it is not relevant when 

</span><span>it is quite clearly relevant to the issue that is before us.  When you collect money from 

the people, you have to budget how you are going to spend it and that budget must be 

presented to this House and it must be questioned in this House and approved in this 

House before you can spend that tax money.  That is why we are here.  We are not yes 

Opposition  Mr  Speaker.    We  are  here  to  represent  the  people,  to  raise  questions  on 

behalf of the people and to show weaknesses on the part of Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Our plea to the Prime Minister and to his Government today is, </span><span>don’t trample on the 

</span><span>intelligence of our people.  The more you show a lack of respect for them, the more 

you do things without full accountability. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  those  are  my  observations  based  on  both  point  of  views,  from  the  tax 

point of view and also from the expenditure side.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>      Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Are  there  any  other  speakers?  

The Honourable Minister for Education and Tauranga Vananga, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  stand  to  support  the  Motion  for  the 

Report, Paper No.67, to be received by Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>After  listening  to  the  Honourable  Member,  Norman  George,  Leader  of  the 

Democratic-Alliance  Party,  one  cannot  help  but  have  a  stomach  ache.    Here  is  a 

Member  of  Parliament  who  is  constantly  pointing  out  what  he  thinks  to  be  corrupt 

practices by this Government.   Yet,  when he was a Minister of the Crown he was a 

very corrupt Minister to the tune of spending thousands of dollars from this Country 

for travel.  I think it would be true to say Mr Speaker, that he would have pillaged the 

coffers of this  country to  the tune of well over half a million dollars when he was a 

Minister  of  the  Crown.    And  today  we  find  him  trying  to  make  himself  out  to  be  a 

saint.  I think, Mr Speaker, that we have a classic example of a person who can see 

faults but he cannot see his own.

</span></div><div><span>Be that as it may, I would like to congratulate the Members of the Select Committee 

who  have  put  before  this  House  this  excellent  Report.    The  Members  of  the 

Committee have been made known to our listening public and I would like to thank 

you  all.    This  includes  the  two  Members  from  the  Opposition,  the  Honourable 

Member, Norman George and the Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate.  But for 

the Honourable Member, Norman George to claim that two of the Members from the 

Opposition  were  responsible  for  humanising  the  Value  Added  Tax  Bill  and  the 

Income  Tax  Bill.    Well,  that  is  just  a  very  wild  claim  aimed  at  politicising  these 

excellent Bills which the Committee are putting forward to this House.  No doubt they 

have contributed significantly to the evolving of the two Bills.  But for him to claim 

that the two of them were responsible for the excellent Report and the excellent Bills 

that will shortly come before this House, it is absurd. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  sorry  that  the  Honourable  Member,  Norman  George  has  left  the  House  but  I 

wanted him to hear what I had to say.  When I was in Atiu just recently, some people 

there  came  to  see  me  and  to  talk  to  me  about  the  VAT.    I  said  to  them,  well,  your 

Member  is  a  Member  of  the  VAT  Select  Committee  and  he  was  in  Atiu  just  a  few 

days before I got there.  Did you go to see him? They replied that they did.  What did 

</span><span>he say to you?  They said oh, well they told him what they thought of the VAT but he 

</span><span>didn’t  seem  interested.    These  were  their  very  words.    He  didn’t  seem  interested  in 

</span><span>what they had to say to their Member. 

</span></div><div><span>I note that the Committee sat on twenty occasions.  I think this would be a record for 

any  Select  Committee  and  I  thank  the  Select  Committee  and  their  Secretary,  Mr 

Russell Puna, because the Secretary was doing a lot of work and I also would like to 

pay tribute to the Secretary of the Select Committee, Russell Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  highlight  a  comment  made  by  one  of  the  witnesses  who  appeared 

before the Committee.  I would like to attribute this to Mr David Wright from Trends 

Ltd and this is what it says on page 14 what he said to the Committee and I liked what 

</span><span>he had to say.  I quote, “However, it could be fairly said that the tax consultants have 

</span><span>relied  heavily  on  </span><span>comparative  New  Zealand  legislation  in  framing  the  new  laws.”  

That is the VAT Bill and the Income Tax Bill.  Now I continue with the quote.  “This 

</span><span>is understandable, as their past expertise has been drawn from experiences within New 

Zealand.    New  Zealand  circumstances  are  not  Cook  Islands  circumstances  and  the 

</span><span>wants and needs of both country’s economic circumstances are different and I would 

</span><span>caution  the  Committee  against  accepting  without  critical  study  a  clone  of  the  New 

</span><span>Zealand legislation.”  This is th</span><span>e sentence that I really liked - the last sentence in the 

</span><span>quote.    “Let  us  instead  try  and  develop  legislation  that  is  appropriate for the special 

</span><span>circumstances  of  the  Cook  Islands  and  let  us  show  boldness  and  vision  in 

</span><span>development  of  laws  framed  to  suit  our  country’s  particular  special  needs  in  the 

Cooks.”    In  my  view,  this  is  a  beautiful  statement  and  I  am  sure  reflective  of  the 

</span><span>attitudes  of those people who came to  meet  with  the Select  Committee as witnesses 

and who also made submissions. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Leader  of  the  Opposition  was  saying  earlier  that  the  Prime  Minister,  the 

Honourable  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry,  should  not  trample  on  the  commonsense  of  the 

people of this country.  I am saying to you Mr Speaker, and Honourable Members and 

our people listening, that what has happened in the bringing together of our people to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>2945 

</span></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>help Parliament and to help Government in framing an acceptable tax package for our 

country,  this  has  shown  exactly  the  opposite  to  what  the  Honourable  Member, 

Norman George was claiming, concerning the Prime Minister of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>So in addition to thanking the Members of this Select Committee from this House, I 

would like to thank those witnesses and those who made submissions concerning the 

VAT  Bill  and  the  Income  Tax  Bill  for  their  wisdom,  for  their  knowledge,  for  their 

experiences,  and  for  sharing  with  us  Parliamentarians  their  hopes  for  our  country  in 

terms  of the tax package.  I apologise, because time will not  permit  me to  speak on 

excerpts from other witnesses statements to the Committee.  But I want to say that I 

am  very  pleased  to  note the generally supportive contributions  and the general  good 

will  from  our  people  in  putting  in  place,  in  helping  us in  Parliament to  put  in  place 

something that is acceptable to our people.  

</span></div><div><span>On page 22, we notice proposals for Recommendations that the Select Committee are 

going to  add to  the VAT Bill.   I am happy to note that the inter island freights and 

fares by air and sea will be exempted from VAT, from Value Added Tax.  I am also 

pleased  to  see,  this  is  a  point  touched  upon  by  previous  speakers,  that  there  will  be 

</span><span>consideration for qualified pensioners as regards exemptions from payment of tax on 

</span><span>their power bills.  I also note exemptions being recommended in the area of stock feed 

and fertilisers.  

</span></div><div><span>I note that it is the intention of this Select Committee and also of Government and I 

am  sure  of  this  Parliament  that  these  Tax  Bills  be  put  in  place  ready  for 

implementation  as  from  the  1st  of  July  1997.    And  for  recommendations  under  the 

Income  Tax  Bill,    I  am  pleased  to  see,  as  stated  under  9.20  this  is  in  reference  to 

donations. The Recommendation is that this be taken into consideration for amounts 

not  less  than  $200  and  not  greater  than  $5,000.    I  think  that  this  is  a  significant 

increase  from  the  maximum  provided  by  the  Income  Tax  Act  for  donations  and  so 

forth.  

</span></div><div><span>As a result of my visit to Avatea school, at the invitation of the Honourable Dr Robert 

Woonton  who  is  a  Member  of  the  school  committee  of  Avatea.    I  went  there  and 

witnessed the excellent  work being carried out by the parents community.  I noticed 

from out of their own pockets and also by canvassing the businesses who sponsored 

some of the class rooms at Avatea.  That the classrooms were beautiful, carpeted and 

</span><span>also painted up brightly and the ceilings were sealed and they had  lights like we have 

</span><span>installed here.   I was just amazed with the transformation from the classrooms that I 

used to see in previous visits.  I am sure that what I saw at Avatea is also happening in 

other schools and colleges in the Cook Islands.   But here is the point that I want to 

make clear and that is, this new Bill recognises those contributions by parents to their 

</span><span>children’s schools and also to their education.   And exemptions will be granted under 

</span><span>the  provisions  for  the  Income  Tax.  Once  again,  thank  you  very  much  to  all  those 

parents out there in the communities for your support of the schools of your children.   

</span></div><div><span>And  the  last  point  I  note  is  the  flat  rate  of  15%  for  Secondary  Income  for  tax 

assessment  purposes.    You  see,  one  of  the  principles  undergirding  this  thrust  of  the 

new  Income  Tax  package  is  to  lighten  the  burden  of  tax  on  our  people  concerning 

Income Tax so that they will have more money in their pockets.  So that their efforts 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>28 May 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2946 

</span></div><div><span>to earn more money through secondary sources would be recognised and encouraged.  

Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member from Nukuroa, Tangata Vavia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  to  Honourable 

Members  of  this  House  and  also  a  special  greetings  to  the  Chairman  of  this 

Committee  who  is  the  Prime  Minister  of  the  Cook  islands  and  also  to  all  the 

Committee Members established by Parliament to look into these two Bills.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    I  will  interrupt  you  Honourable  Member.    We  do  not  have  the 

quorum.  I would like to ask the Clerk at the Table to ring the Bell for five minutes.
