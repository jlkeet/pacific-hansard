House that the photographs taken last week by the photographer are now ready and are 

just  about  to  be  mounted  into  huge  frames.    The  photographer  has  given  us  a  very 

cheap  price.    The  cost  for  one  photo  is  not  $3.00  it  is  $2.50,  so  can  Honourable 

Members please pay $2.50 to the girls in the office.
