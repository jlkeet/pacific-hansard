<div><span>PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER took the Chair at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Honourable Members, please be seated.  Kia Orana to Honourable 

Members in the name of our good Lord this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, a word of thank you to our chaplain, Father Jim for his encouraging message 

to us this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  we  go  on  to  our  work  for  today,  I  have  an  announcement  to  make.    The 

message that I am about to read is a reply to a letter to the Clerk of Parliament that I 

sent  back  because  I  did  not  want  to  read  that  letter  in  this  House.  I  do  not  want 

Members of Parliament to write letters to be read in this Parliament, except for letters  

from that Office. 

</span></div><div><span>This is what was written in that letter.  This is a letter written by the General Secretary 

of the Democratic Alliance Party, Mr Aporo Dean. 

</span></div><div><span>“The Democratic Alliance Party,</span><span>

Avarua,  

Rarotonga, 

Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>26 November 1997.  

</span></div><div><span>To the Clerk of Parliament,  

Department of Parliamentary  Services, 

P.O. Box 13, 

Rarotonga, 

Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Dear Sir, 

</span></div><div><span>It  has  come  to  our  attention  that  Norman  George  M.P.  for  the  electorate  of 

Tengatangi/  Areora/  Ngatiarua  has  formally  requested  by  letter  to  you,  that  he  and  

fellow Atiu M.P., Upoko Simpson, be disassociated from the Opposition Caucus.  

</span></div><div><span>The  Democratic  Alliance  Party    and  Opposition  Caucus  are  saddened  by  the  step 

taken  by  Mr  George  and  regard  it  as  childish.    We  believe  he  took  this  action  as  a 

response to him being replaced by the Opposition Caucus with Dr Terepai Maoate as 

Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>I  make  an  emphatic  distinction  between  Mr  George  and  Mr  Simpson  because  we 

</span><span>understand that Mr Simpson was unaware of Mr George’s action.  We wish to warmly 

</span><span>invite  Mr  Upoko  Simpson  to  remain  with  the  Opposition  Caucus.    The  decision  by

                                                                                                       26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Caucus  to  vote  Mr  George  out  as  Leader  of  the  Opposition  was  done  openly  and 

democratically  at  a  meeting  Mr  George  himself  chaired.    Therefore,  it  is  hard  to 

understand his motives in disassociating himself from the Opposition Caucus.  We are 

</span><span>obviously disappointed with Mr George’s </span><span>latest antics but although reluctant we have 

no choice but to accept his request and hope that  you will accept it accordingly.   

</span></div><div><span>Yours sincerely, 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Aporo Dean, 

</span><span>Democratic Alliance Party”.</span></div><div><span>I now place it on the Table.
