<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Electoral Bill.  Interrupted debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second Time 

</span></div><div><span>I can see the Honourable Minister Tiki Matapo is already on the Floor now, so I call 

upon the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>   Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to  you and your staff, to 

Honourable  Members  in  the  House,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    Kia Orana to  our people 

who are listening in this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to seek the Leave of this House so that this Sitting may adjourn, to 

enable  Members  to  have  an  informal  Sitting  and  to  discuss  the  Bill  in-camera.  

Perhaps I should say, suspend the Sitting, Mr Speaker, to enable Members to discuss 

the Bill in-camera.   

</span></div><div><span>As you may recall during the debate on the principle and merits of the Bill a strong 

consensus  of  Members  which  in  fact  was  brought  also  to  the  attention  of  the  both 

Leaders of the Opposition parties.  This suggestion was that we be able to meet and

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> September 1998 

</span></div><div><span>discuss and also to be able to bring the current Chief Electoral Officer, the Chairman 

of the Electoral Review Committee and another Solicitor from the legal fraternity to 

assist  Members  of  the  House  with  parts  of  the  Bill  and  to  raise  improvements  or 

amendments  or whatever the case may be.  The outcome of this will have a bearing 

on, perhaps a better product or a better Bill.  Most likely it will affect the progress or 

movement through the Bill and certainly shorten the time needed to pass it. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my views.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.  The  Honourable  Member  Dr 

Terepai Maoate, Leader of the Democratic Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR.T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff, 

to  Honourable  Members  and  a  special  Kia  Orana  to  our  Prime  Minister  -  welcome 

back to the Chamber.  Kia Orana also to our people who are listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to support the request by the Minister in charge to discuss the Bill 

informally.  When the Bill  was presented, we in the Opposition had a look at it and 

felt that there is no real need to argue much about it, especially since the whole Bill 

has been rewritten - it does not include just the amendments that are presented.  It is a 

completely new draft altogether.  The benefit of looking through the whole Bill is to 

both sides of the House.  So we have made a suggestion to the Minister in charge that 

this could be done.  I am glad that the Minister has, along with Government, approved 

to have this discussed informally first.  I am sure, Mr Speaker, we should be able to go 

through  the  Bill  quite  fluently  and  quickly.    After  we  have  done  that  we  will  have 

made our final decisions or conclusions on the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>So  those  are  my  comments  and  suggestions,  Mr  Speaker.    But  before  I  sit  down,  I 

would  like  to  endorse  your  welcoming  remarks  to  the  Honourable  Dr  Williams.  

Welcome back to  the Chamber.  You will no doubt go through the Hansard and see 

the comments made to your request to be pardoned for being away from Parliament.  

It was all to your favour and to the favour of the Honourable Members of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Now the Honourable Minister is 

</span><span>now seeking the Leave of the House to suspend this Sitting.  What is the opinion of 

</span><span>the Honourable Members? 

</span></div><div><span>So may I take it Honourable Members, that Leave is granted? 

</span></div><div><span>Leave for Suspension Granted</span></div><div><span>Leave is granted Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Sitting be Suspended until such time . . . 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> September 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1079 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> We will now suspend the Sitting. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting Suspended at 1.19 p.m.
