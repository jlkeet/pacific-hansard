</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Order, order, please! 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> I can remember during the elections of 1994 that there were a lot of 

travelling by Ministers and public funds were being used for campaign purposes.  In 

some cases, the Minister would visit an island twice because of the authority given to 

them  as    a  caretaker  Government.  I  know  this  because  the  Prime  Minister  went  to 

Rakahanga twice and one time when he was there he ran into a shovel handle. This is 

why I think it is a good idea whenever Parliament is dissolved that Government ceases 

</span><span>work and hands power over to a Transition Authority. I think it’s a good idea that this</span><span>is looked at. I don’t think the Clause is enough.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  SIR  G.A.  HENRY:</span><span>  I  would  like  to  agree  with  the  suggestion  by  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati, not this last one, but his earlier point of view  

where he suggested that we take it to the people.  He said to take it to the people, now 

</span><span>he  says  put  it  into  a  Constitution  Amendment  Bill.  I  can’t  understand  this  man’s 

behaviour. I suspect this Honourable Member’s American ad</span><span>visors are giving him bad 

advice, which is why he is getting worse. At least we have heard his views, and we are 

moving ahead. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Long Title: An Act to Amend the Constitution.

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Long Title stands part of the Bill?</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be Reported to Parliament Without Amendment? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
