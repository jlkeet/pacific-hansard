<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  We will now resolve Parliament in the Committee of the Whole. 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 1: Short Title. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 2: Cabinet 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 3: Duration of office of Members of Cabinet 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 4: Transitional 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  I  would  just  like  to  ask  what  is  wrong  with  the 

recommendation in the Report of the Commission Political Review and why is it not  

being followed?  Why do we have this new Motion? Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Mr Chairman, just a short point of explanation with regard 

to the issue. The Transition arrangement that the Leader of the Opposition was talking 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1473 

</span></div><div><span>about  earlier,  and  what  the  Honourable  Dr  Pupuke  Robati  is  talking  about  now,  is 

different to what the Commission is talking about. This Transitional Clause is saying 

that it will be the future Government, after the Election, who will effect the changes 

with regards to reducing the numbers of Members and selecting the Cabinet Minister 

</span><span>from outside. This is what ‘transitional’ means in this case. This Clause is setting the 

</span><span>foundation, for whichever Government is elected, to follow these guidelines, which is, 

for 7 Ministers in Cabinet - with one Minister who may be appointed from outside of 

Parliament.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Prime  Minister.    The  Honourable,  Dr  Pupuke 

</span><span>Robati.  I’m sorry Honourable Member. The Honourable Prime Minister.</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY: </span><span>Mr Chairman, I move that we report to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>The Question is:  

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div>
