<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>The Marriage Amendment Bill.  Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>I can recall the last Member speaking on the Bill was the Honourable Member Paora 

Teiti, so I now call upon him to continue if he so wishes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker for the opportunity to carry on talking on the 

amendment before us.  I am aware that there are Members who are not satisfied and 

there are those who are satisfied with the Bill before the House.  Maybe they are those 

people who were not permitted to be married in a certain church. In the many different 

religions there are different requirements that must be fulfilled before a couple can be  

married.  Now,  any  organisation  can  appoint  a  marriage  celebrant  to  conduct  a 

</span><span>wedding  of  anyone  at  any  time.  In  the  Seventh  Day  Adventist  Church,  there  are 

</span><span>certain restrictions as to marriage. Even if the couple are both SDAs, a pastor will not 

be permitted to marry them if they have not met certain requirements. In some cases, 

the  pastor  may  marry  them  but  not  within  the  church.  Maybe  it  is  because  of  these 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>886 

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>restrictions within the different churches that this Bill was thought up by people who 

were  not  permitted  to  be  married  in  their  church.  They  decided  to  approach  the 

Minister to devise this Bill in an effort to avoid these restrictions in their church. 

</span></div><div><span>I  believe  there  are  many  people  today  who  are  not  officially  married.    Maybe  these 

people  do  not  have  any  religious  affiliations,  which  is  why  they  cannot  approach 

religious  organisations to officiate their marriage. On the one hand, this Bill is good 

because  it  makes  it  easier  for  people  who  are  living  in  defacto  relationships,  to  be 

married. That  is preferable to us. This Bill improves the status of these people. As I 

said  earlier,  marriage  is  a  sacrament  of  God.  Before  these  two  can  be  married  they 

make vows and declarations - not before the pastor - but before God. As the verse in 

</span><span>the Bible says, ‘w</span><span>hat God has put together, let no man put asunder until death do them 

</span><span>part’.  Although  it  is  not  God  who  conducts  the  actual  wedding  ceremony,  the Bible 

</span><span>says  if  they  make  their  vows  before  a  minister  in  the  presence  of  God,  then  their 

marriage is blessed and made holy. This is all I have to say, Mr Speaker. Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable  Member,  Dr  Terepai  Maoate,  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Democratic 

Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span>   Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to  you and to your 

staff, to all Honourable Members and to our people listening in.  I have listened to the 

explanations given by the Minister in charge, the Honourable Tiki Matapo, as to the 

motive behind the introduction of this Amendment. I have been thinking it over and 

over  and  I  have  discussed  it  with  my people and it does give me some concern, Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>There are three things coming to mind when I look at the amendment Bill.  Firstly, I 

think the Bill is aiming to make marriage an easy achievement. 

</span></div><div><span>The  second  point,  that  comes  to  mind,  is  to  keep  religions  out  of  marriages  when 

necessary.    And  thirdly,  what  comes  to  mind  according  to  the  explanation,  this 

amendment is strongly motivated by our tourism development in the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I have looked at the facts of life with regards to marriage - marriages that have taken 

place in churches or under the guidance of ministers of churches- all these avenues of 

people getting married are not  immune to  deficiencies.  Also, I note that  if anybody 

today,  and  has  been  the  case  in  the  past,  if  anyone  wanted  to  get  married  without  a 

minister of the Church, you can go straight to the Registrar and get yourselves married 

there.    But  in  our  culture,  in  our  customs,  most  people  are  married  by  ministers  of 

churches  and  the  aim  for  that,  in  my  view,  has  been  to  make  it  a  solemn  or  a  holy 

ceremony  in  the  uniting  of  two  people,  a  man  and  a  woman.  It  is  an  expression  of 

commitment  for  that  union.  The  public  is  made  aware  of  that  union.  It  is  a 

commitment,  an  assurance  that  what  is  taken  as  a  solemn  promise  should  not  be 

broken. But should a couple decide that they would like to have a quiet one, or have 

one or three or four, or a little bit more of the people around as witnesses, they can do 

so by (1) asking for the minister of any church, or the church that they belong to, to  

have  them  married;  (2)  they  can  quietly  go  to  the  Registrar  and  have  them  married 

there. There are conditions that you have to comply with in those activities.  From the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>887 

</span></div><div><span>majority of people married, Mr Speaker, I imagine that more people go to ministers of 

churches  or  even  in  churches  to  get  married,  rather  than  go  to  the  Registrar  of 

Marriages. 

</span></div><div><span>I  wish  I  had  access  to  figures  with  regards  to  broken  marriages,  but  I  gather  from 

across  the  floor  that  the  rates  are  pretty  high  and  the  question  that  we  may  ask 

ourselves is why is it high?  And perhaps we might ask ourselves is this one way of 

reducing it? 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I strongly believe, Mr Speaker, with the view that marriage is, in our language, 

</span><span>tapu</span><span>.  The man and woman who have decided to get married have decided to make a 

commitment  and  they  will  make  promises  to  keep  that  commitment,  in  front  of  the 

minister of the church and in front of God.  I still believe in that, Mr Speaker.  I will 

not deviate from that practice and I will not follow any other practice that will be seen 

to be giving an ordinary person the power or the right to perform marriages under any 

other condition  but  those that have been practised with the attachment of religion to 

the solemn marriages of young people, or even older people, as the case may be. 

</span></div><div><span>Let’s not be carried away by the motive of certain tourist operators who would like to 

</span><span>have  the  convenience  of  performing  marriages  in  order  that  the  marriages  they 

perform on beaches, or small islands, or other places, in hotels or other places, where 

this  is  seen  as  a  good,  entertaining  place  for  them  to  get  married,  especially  those 

tourists who have come from overseas to be entertained by these practices of marriage 

that is going to be approved by this amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>We may have an amendment to this Amendment, Mr Speaker, to say that perhaps that 

this Amendment only deals with tourists, but what is the reflection of that on to our 

people?  Because if you make one law it must be applied to every individual in that 

community.    It  will  be  something  that,  in  my  view,  people  will  look  and  say  well, 

</span><span>there’s  no  point  going  to  church  any  more  and  have  your  weddings  done  in  church.  

I’ll just get a tour operator who has got a li</span><span>cence to perform the marriage and get him 

to get us married.  It will appear to me that the holiness of this very important union of 

marriage will be lowered to the extent that it may be abused in the future.  This may 

also  be  seen  as  a  greed  to  take  all  what  one  can  benefit  from  the  performance  of 

marriages  through  this  concept  of tourism promotion in  our country. What  is  wrong 

with  the  ministers  of  churches  being  given  donations  from  these  practices  that  it  is 

</span><span>ongoing?  Why are we creating something which is not really our culture?  Why are 

</span><span>we all of a sudden going out  to  the beaches and having our marriages conducted on 

beaches?    Why  are  we  encouraging  marriages  on  these  small  islands?    Is  this  our 

</span><span>practice?  Is this our culture?  I don’t think so.  So wh</span><span>at I am saying, Mr Speaker, is I 

</span><span>don’t go along with what the Bill is trying to create. Of course, in the church, out of 

</span><span>church,  on  the  beach,  on  the  islands  -  God  will receive all those good things that is 

asked  of  him.  But  I  think  the  motive  here  is  directed  towards  tourism,  and  I  feel 

tourists should come and see how we do it, where we do it, and do it there.  

</span></div><div><span>What we are going to do now is, we listen to what the tourists want and we respond to 

</span><span>their needs.  I believe that if we continue with the way of life that we are used to and 

the  way  that  we  perform  our  religious  marriages,  the  tourists,  in  most  cases,  will 

follow that.  The question I am asking is, what can happen?  What may happen in the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>888 

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>future?  Who knows, maybe through this amendment you’ll hav</span><span>e people who will be 

</span><span>looking more at tourists’ needs and respond to those tourists needs.  Maybe a couple 

</span><span>of men will want to get married and will get married through this avenue.  Even two 

women,  as  tourists,  can  come  to  this  country  and  decide  to  get  married.    Does  this 

amendment stop that?  Will it stop that sort of thing happening? There is no limit to 

what these people can do and where they do it.  They can go out there, in the middle 

of the ocean between here and Aitutaki, on a boat, and get married, or, put them on a 

raft and have them married there. 

</span></div><div><span>What  I  would  have  liked  to  see,  Mr  Speaker,  is  a  reinforcement  of  our  current 

Marriage Act.  Not to make things easier for people who want to get married, divorce 

and then get married again . . . divorce, marry again.  It looks like, Mr Speaker, from 

the  information  from  across  the  Floor,  that the rate of divorce is  high.  In my view, 

this will probably also make it even higher because of the exposure to witnesses. They 

will see that it is demanding on the couple to have these marriages either through the 

registrar or through anybody else who has become a marriage celebrant.  I would like 

to see our customs, with regard to marriages, carry on the way it always has, with the 

ministers of churches conducting  the ceremony and not  have their rights deviated to 

</span><span>people who have no religious background.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Utia Matata.   

</span></div><div><span>MR U. MATATA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you this afternoon.  Kia 

Orana  to  the  Honourable  Members  of  this  House  on  both  sides.    Kia  Orana  to  the 

people of the Cook Islands, especially to those who are listening in this broadcast.   

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  go  onto  the  Bill  before  the  House  today,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  send 

words of Greetings to the people of my Constituency of Akaoa, Vaiakura.  A message 

to  the  people  of  the  Vaiakura  tapere,  there  will  be  a  meeting  at  the  Betela  meeting 

House.  I would like everybody to attend this meeting this evening.   

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to the Bill before the House - Marriage Amendment Bill.  In my view is 

a tough issue because it will not only apply to tourists but to our people as well.  As I 

was listening to the explanation by the Minister responsible for this Bill, an important 

aspect that I think he was trying to outline was that, this Bill is intended mainly for the 

tourist  industry.    One  of  the  toughest  issues  explained  was  the  idea  that  a  lot  of 

tourists  who  come  here  to  get  married  want  to  do  so  without  having  to  have  the 

ceremony in any religious organisation.  That is my biggest concern, the fact that they 

want their marriage conducted by someone with no religious affiliation.  As we know 

there are a lot of people here who have no particular religion.  We all understand that 

this country is  a Christian nation.  I think this means that everyone living here have 

some sort of religious affiliation.  It could also mean that there is no one who does not 

belong to any particular religion.  Mr Speaker, the introduction of Christianity to the 

Cook Islands was by Europeans.  By white people.  It started on the island of Aitutaki, 

we  know,  in  1821,  then  went  to  all  the  Outer  Islands  and  eventually  came  to 

Rarotonga.  This being done by white people.  In the days before this introduction, our 

</span><span>people did not get married.  It wasn’t until the arrival of Europeans that we were told 

</span><span>of marriage, that a man should marry a woman and it was the good thing to do.  We 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>889 

</span></div><div><span>accepted  this  wholeheartedly  with  marriages  for  our  people  becoming  holy  and 

beautiful.  Marriage is not done by anyone but by someone who holds that authority.  

Today  we  find  that  tourists  who  come  here  to  get  married  want  to  be  married  by 

someone who has no religious affiliation. 

</span></div><div><span>The statistics as of December 1996, there were 485 people with no religious beliefs.  

The  islands  of  Rarotonga  alone  had  389  people  with  no  religious  affiliation.    The 

Southern  Group  of  the  Outer  Islands  there  were  81  people.    In  the  Northern  Group 

Islands there were 15 people with no religious affiliation.  Today, there are more than 

ten  religious  denominations  in  the  Cook  Islands.    Before  last  year,  there  were  only 

four religious organisations recognised by the Cook Islands and last year an Act was 

made by this Parliament to allow any religious organisation to apply to the Minister of 

Justice to  have their religion  recognised by this  country.  So, today we see there are 

quite a lot of religious organisations in the country but still there are people coming to 

our  country  telling  us  that  they  do  not  want  to  be  married  by  anybody  from  those 

religions.  This Bill tells us that any organisation may apply to the Registrar General in 

order that they be able to nominate people to solemnise marriages.  This means that 

people  with  no  religious  background  or  affiliation  can  apply  to  become  marriage 

</span><span>celebrants and then they can marry these people who have no religion of their own. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as indicated by previous speakers this I think will take away the holiness 

that is associated with marriage.  My true feeling is that I will not allow people who 

have  no  religious  belief  to  become  marriage  celebrants  as  this  Bill  indicates  to  us.  

Although  we  are  told  that  the  main  reason  for  this  particular  Bill  may  be  for  the 

benefit  of  our  tourist  industry,  I  can  see  that  our  people  will  also  get  involved  in  a 

situation where they will be able to use this Bill.  We might find some people who are 

in  a  drinking  party  and  end  up  married.    There  will  not  be  the  sanctity  of  holy 

matrimony  that  we  know  today.    This  is  what  I  am  afraid  of,  Mr  Speaker,  the 

consequences that will follow from what we are creating today.  If only we were trying 

to strengthen the position of officiating ministers then I think we will not be facing a 

situation that we are facing today with this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I    heard,  and  I  was  not  pleased  when  I  heard  this,  that  there  have  been  marriages 

carried out in our country by non-religious celebrants or a Registrar or a Justice of the 

Peace.    I  was  not  happy  when  I  heard  this.    I  am  sure,  Mr  Speaker,  the  Minister  in 

Charge of this Bill knew that these views I am presenting were the views of Members 

</span><span>of this House.  I can’t say I support the Bill because of what I have said.  Those are my 

</span><span>views, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Honourable Members on both sides of the House 

and to our people listening in, Kia Orana this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rose,  Mr Speaker, to  give my personal  views,  the views of Inatio Akaruru, not  the 

views of the Deputy Prime Minister of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>890 

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  my  views.    Firstly,  I  would  like  to  remind  the  House  that  not 

everybody  in  the  world  is  the  same.    Some  people  are  Christian  and  believe  in  the 

teachings  of  the  Messiah,  Jesus  Christ.    Some  people  have  a  different  god  and 

different  beliefs  from  ours.  Some  people,  millions  and  millions  of  them,  do  not 

believe  in  any  god.    Some  of  these  millions  of  people  are  travelling  the  world  and 

some of them come through our country.  I do not believe that this Bill encourages us 

as Christians to believe in marriages outside of our faith, or to be married by people 

who  are  not  religious  ministers.    We  also  must  remember  that  there  are  millions  of 

people in the world who do not believe that they should get married before a minister 

of  religion.    There  are  some  people  in  the  world  who  want  to  get  married  before 

someone so long as that person is an official who is allowed to marry them.  If we are 

afraid  this  Bill  is  going  to  destroy  our  religious  faith  then  we  do  not  have  any 

Christian  faith.    Our  belief  and  faith  in  the  teachings  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  is  a 

special bond between that person and his God. Real faith is what you have with your 

God. If you require a law to strengthen your faith then that is not faith. Yes. Jesus told 

us those who believe in Him without actually seeing Him, have the strongest of faiths. 

He who has not seen Him but  believes in His teachings is on the path to everlasting 

life.  

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  my  beliefs  with  regard  to  faith.  Coupled  with  this  is  the fact  that a lot of 

people  travel  through  our  country.  If    we  examine  Clause  3  of  this  Amendment 

closely,  we  will  see  that  not  every  person,  put  forward  by  an  organisation,  as  a 

marriage  celebrant  will  automatically  get  the  right.  They  have  to  satisfy  certain 

requirements of the law, the Registrar General and the Minister of Justice. Once they 

have established that this organisation is an upstanding and honest organisation, then 

maybe  they  will  allow  the  licence  to  be  granted  to  the  person.  The  onus  is  on  the 

Minister  of  Justice  to  be  able  to  prove  that  these  groups  or organisations are in  fact 

eligible to have marriage celebrants. 

</span></div><div><span>It also tells us in Clause 3, Mr Speaker, that the Minister or the Registrar General may 

remove the licence of a marriage celebrant if he breaks the law or does not carry out 

his job properly. I have no doubt, Mr Speaker, that if a young person is brought up in a 

religious way then I am quite certain if that young man is to get married he will take 

his beloved and get married in a church before an officiating minister. If there are two 

young people who were not brought up in a Christian religion, do you think that these 

two young people would go and get married in front of a minister of religion? No, I do 

</span><span>not think so. They will go and find somebody who is allowed by law to marry them 

</span><span>because they don’t have any religious convictions themselves. This has occurred a lot 

</span><span>in our country. Let us not think that it is a new thing. Many people have been married 

by the Registrar of the High Court, not by a minister of religion. 

</span></div><div><span>I think, Mr Speaker, we have to wake up to the reality that we are in 1998. We must 

also realise the fact we have no right whatsoever to tell two young people where they 

will get married and who will officiate - it is their right to choose whether they want to 

be married by a minister of the church or the Registrar. This Bill says it is the Minister 

</span><span>and the Registrar General’s job to ensure that the marriage</span><span> is conducted properly and 

</span><span>in  accordance  with  the  law.  Despite  my  Christian  convictions,  Mr  Speaker,  that 

marriage is a sacred thing,  if two young people do otherwise then that is their right to 

choose,  I  cannot  tell  them what  to  do. Marriage is  a holy sacrament, Mr Speaker. If 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>891 

</span></div><div><span>you marry in the church you must remember you have made a vow before the minister 

and before God. You cannot change your mind and discard your wife because you will 

be breaking the holy law of God as written in the Bible.  

</span></div><div><span>I ask myself, do I  have the right to force my beliefs on someone who does not have 

any religious beliefs? I do not.  I can guide them or share my beliefs with them, but I 

</span><span>cannot  make  them  do  what  I  want.  We  have  no  right  to  say  ‘this  is  how and where  

</span><span>you will ma</span><span>rry’. True, some of us parents have done this to our children </span><span>- we want our 

children to  marry in  the church because we are a Christian country. We believe that 

marriage is sacred and it should occur in a church. We know the ways of our children 

today, if we parents try to force them, such as making them find a wife whose religion 

</span><span>is compatible with yours, your son will rebel and tell you ‘hey, I have my own right to 

decide, it is not for you to decide who I shall marry’. </span></div><div><span>That  is  why  I  have  stated  my  thoughts.  I  have  no  fear  of  this.  My  Christian  faith  is 

between my God and myself. But I do not ignore the views of these people who have 

no faith at all. We must realise the fact that there are a lot of people in the world who 

</span><span>don’t  have  any  religious  beliefs  </span><span>at  all  and  some  of  those  people  live  here.  That  is 

</span><span>according to our latest statistical report.  It is our duty, Mr Speaker, to ensure that we 

</span><span>create laws that include all the people in our country, in order that those who wish to 

get married, who are not Christian, whether they are resident here or are visitors, can 

marry as they wish. Let us not think badly of them, we should show compassion. Just 

as God  allows the rain to fall and the sun to shine on both good and bad people, so we 

should  make  laws  to  include  both  people  who  have  religious  convictions  and  those 

who do not.  It  is  better for us, Mr Speaker, to  create legislation so that people from 

within or outside of the country cannot do as they please. They have to operate within 

the law. The law covers everyone.  

</span></div><div><span>I have no problem.  I support the merits and the principles of this Bill because people 

are different. There are many kinds of people in the world with different beliefs. What 

we  need  to  do  is  provide  for  the  needs  of  these  various  types  of  people  when  they 

come to our country. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  all  I  have  to  say,  Mr  Speaker.  Thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  express  my 

thoughts on the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

</span><span>Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Legislative Services, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff as well 

as to the Deputy Prime Minister, my colleagues in Cabinet and Members on both sides 

of  the  House,  as  well  as  our  people  listening  in  to  our  debate  this  afternoon  -  Kia 

Orana. A special Kia Orana through you, Sir, to my Aronga Mana in Mauke and the 

Religious Advisory Council who are listening to me now. Therefore, the views that I 

am expressing to you Sir, is theirs.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, first and foremost, we do not have any problem with the majority of the 

amendments that were brought into the House by the Minister.  Secondly, we do not 

want this issue in the House to be a religious argument against politics in the House.

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>The simple thing that we are bringing into the House, that I am asking the Minister, 

which  I  have  asked  the  Minister  over  the  last  two  days,  with  regard  to  a  simple 

amendment to Clauses 2 and 3 of the Amendment.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, in Clause 2, the heading is “Marriage Celebrant”.  That is the word.  Then it 

goes on in Clause 2 (1); “The principal Act is hereby amended by omitting, wherever 

it  appears,  the  expression  ‘officiating  minister’,  and  substituting  in  each  case  the 

expression  “marriage  celebrant”.    In  Clause  3,  Sub</span><span>-Clause  (2),  the  last  words  are 

</span><span>“marriage celebrant” again.  In Clause 3 of the new Amendment includes amendments 

</span><span>to  sections  8,  9  and  10.    Yes.    Because  in  Clause  8  of  the  principal  Act  it  says 

</span><span>“officiating  ministers  of  specified  religious  bodies”  which  we  a</span><span>re  repealing  today.  

And  you  will  find,  Mr  Speaker,  in  the  first  schedule  of  the  principal  Act  it  clearly 

defines the Cook Islands Christian Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Seventh 

Day Adventist, the Church of Jesus Christ - the Latter Day Saints Church or anyone in 

the new Amendment.  I agree.  Any other religious organisation can go onto that list 

</span><span>but the problem that we have is the taking away that word, “officiating minister” and 

replacing it with “a marriage celebrant”.  That is the problem</span><span> that we have. 

</span></div><div><span>All  right.    We  have  these  organisations  on  Mauke  -  the  Cook  Islands  Christian 

</span><span>Church, the Catholic Church, the Seventh Day Adventists, and the Mormons.  If we 

had Apostolic there or AOG or whatever, they are religious organisations, we would 

like  them  to  be  on  there  too,  but  to  be  recognised as Orometua.  Like the questions 

asked before me, hey, hey, hey, what right have we to tell our children - </span><span>‘you can’t get 

someone  else  to  marry  you.  You  have  to  go  and  marry  in  the  church’.    And  I  am 

</span><span>asking  the  same  question,  what  right  have  we  in  this  House  to  take  away  the  title 

</span><span>“officiating minister”.  To me this is not law.  To me it is recognition of them in their 

service  to  God.   There is  an argument that it hasn’t been removed because they can 

</span><span>still  cond</span><span>uct  marriages  in  the  church,  but  as  what?  As  “marriage  celebrant”?  If  we 

</span><span>translate the phrase into Maori, it means a person who conducts marriages. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I will support every amendment in the new Amendment.  I will support it 

in total to the Bill.  All I am asking through you, Sir, today is to bring back Clause 8 of 

the  principal  Act.    That  is  all.    It  is  just  that  qualification  for  ministers  of  religious 

organisations to be recognised as ministers.  They are already in the schedule.  There 

is no need to change the schedule, they are already in.  But the rest, this country needs 

to  go  ahead,  Mr  Speaker,  and  needs  to  accommodate  the  new  way  of  life  that  our 

</span><span>people  are  going  through.    That  is  all  that  I  am  simply  saying.    Although  under  the 

</span><span>Amendment  they  can,  because  they  are  already  there,  they  can  marry.    They  can 

continue to marry.  I think all my sons, my youngest, if they are going to get married 

then go and marry in the church.  They are not going to get married by an Orometua 

but by a marriage celebrant although we are used to referring to him as a minister. In 

name, in law, it is saying he is not a reverend, he is a marriage celebrant.   That is all I 

am asking.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  have five children. Of that five, two were married by pastors in  the 

</span><span>church.  One  was  married  at  the  Justice  Department  by  the  Deputy  Registrar.  The 

</span><span>eldest was  married at  home by a Minister of the church. And my youngest, she was 

</span><span>married at home by her AOG pastor. I did not want to interfere in my children’s way 

</span><span>of  life  except  to  support  them.  But  their  marriages  were  recognised  by  the  law  that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>893 

</span></div><div><span>was in place. On the marriage certificate it showed her marriage was conducted by a 

minister  of  her  church.    This  is  what  bothers  me  -  this  Amendment  allows  for  the 

marriage  certifica</span><span>te  to  be  signed  by  a  ‘marriage  celebrant’  and  not  by  a  church 

</span><span>minister.  I am asking this, what right has any legislation of any country to take away 

the  title  of  Orometua  from  every  religious  body  in  this  country?    I  am  not  talking 

about international countries.  I am talking about us here.  What right has any piece of 

legislation to say to the Orometua, if you marry a member of your congregation, under 

</span><span>the law you are a ‘marriage celebrant’ not a minister? </span></div><div><span>Through you, Mr Speaker, I wish to bring to the notice of this House, that in a brief 

meeting with the GRs and the Mayors on Monday morning - I am in agreement with 

them - that Clause 8 should be put back into the amendment. We support the rest of 

the  Bill  but  we  would  like  a  simple  amendment,  the  retu</span><span>rn  of  the  title  ‘officiating 

minister’.  Of  course  on  top  of  that,  Mr  Speaker,  is  the  inclusion  of  every  other 

</span><span>religious organisation in this country, on that schedule. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my views and when the time comes and we get to the clauses, I will come 

back with my amendment.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Mama Mau Munokoa.   

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  all  staff 

Members.  To the Deputy Prime Minister and all Honourable Members of the House 

on the Government and on the Opposition sides, Kia Orana to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  never  thought  the  Honourable  Member  for  Mauke  would  go  this  far 

when he was talking about marriage celebrants. As I understand it, what is happening 

is  marriages  in  our  country  are  conducted  by  the  different  churches  as  well  as  the 

Registry  office.  I  think  the  important  thing  is  Clause  3,  Sub-clause  8  -  Approval  of 

organisations to recommend  marriage celebrants. This is all that bothers me. I am not 

happy at the prospect of allowing other people, outside of the Registrar and the clergy, 

to  be  marriage  celebrants.  If  we  want  other  people  to  be  marriage  celebrants,  then 

there  are  the  J.Ps.  Let  us  not  create  any  more  marriage  celebrants  or  we  will  create 

more problems for our country. We already have J.Ps and the clergy of the ten or more 

religions on our island. I have no problem with them because I know they are carrying 

out the requirements of their churches and doing their jobs well. If  anybody wants to 

get married but he does not have any religious affiliation, then he should get a J.P. or 

</span><span>the  Registrar to conduct his marriage, if he doesn’t want to get married in a church.</span></div><div><span>In our village of Nikao, we have organisations like youth organisations and I do not 

want  to  see  these  organisations  making  a  recommendation  for  their  own  marriage 

</span><span>celebrant.  I  don’t  want  the  pastor  to  discover  that  there  are  four  other  people  in  the 

</span><span>village who may conduct marriages also. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we have a very small country, we do not have a population of 80,000 or 

90,000. That is why I believe the law, as it was passed in 1973, should remain as it is 

</span><span>and I don’t want any additions to it. I don’t have a problem with the rest of the Bill, 

</span><span>just  Clause  3, Sub-clause 8 which allows an organisation  to  make recommendations 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>894 

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>for a marriage celebrant. I would like to recommend that we be careful in what we do, 

</span><span>Mr Speaker.  We have got to be sure that we make the right choice. We don’t want to 

</span><span>make  the  wrong  decision  and  start  blaming  each  other  when  things  go wrong. Then 

our own  people will start accusing us of making mistakes until we are all confused as 

to  who  really  is  to  blame.    Let  us  not  make  a  similar  mistake  as  we  made  with  the 

issuing of liquor licenses - we may end up debating the effects of licensing too many 

marriage  celebrants  like  we  have  debated  the  effects  of  issuing  too  many  liquor 

</span><span>licenses. We must be sure that the licenses we give out don’t cause us more trouble, 

that  we  won’t  regret  it  and  start  compl</span><span>aining  about  it  in  this  House.  We  have  to  be 

certain that we make the right choice in here, so that it suits our people. Those are my 

thoughts, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Education, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you,  Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I rise to strongly support the 

Bill presented by this devout Christian Minister. Before I go on to the Bill, because it 

is the first time I have spoken since I heard of your recent marriage, it is my pleasure 

on  behalf  of  my  wife  and  children  and  the  people  of  my  constituency,  Arutanga-

Reureu-Nikaupara,  where  some  of  your  family  come  from,  Mr Speaker, to  give you 

our congratulations on your recent marriage. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  I  would  like  to  give  my  congratulations  to  the  organisers  of  the  Maire 

Maeva  Nui  and  the  Tarekareka  Games  which  were  held  at  the  beginning  of  this 

month.  We  were  very  impressed  and  heartened  by  the  organisation  of  these  two 

special festivals. I thoroughly enjoyed the festivals as did our people. Therefore,  we 

thank you very much.   

</span></div><div><span>Also,  I  would  like  to  specially  thank  my  Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  Mrs 

Carmen Temata and your staff for the very good job you did in these celebrations.  An 

important aspect of these celebrations is the fact that Government did not spend any 

money on the Constitution Celebrations this year.   

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition is moaning because we did not spend anything on the 

</span><span>celebrations. It’s almost as if Government has committed a sin</span><span>.  I want him to know 

that  this  is  a  sign  that  our  country  has  grown  up  and  it  does  not  rely  on  the 

Government for everything, the way it used to do.  I am congratulating these people 

for a job well done.  

</span></div><div><span>Also,  I  would  like  to  give  special  thanks  to  our  business  community,  to  Air  New 

Zealand,  Air  Rarotonga,  and  EXCIL,  our  new  shipping  company,  and  others  whose 

names I cannot mention as I do not have the list of names here, please excuse me. 

All of these, and others, gave their sponsorship of the Constitution Celebrations. That 

is  why,  Mr  Speaker,  I  thought  it would be a good idea to  show my appreciation  for 

what they have done this year.  

</span></div><div><span>Coming back now to the Bill before us. As I said earlier, I support the principle of the 

Amendment  Bill.    A  couple  of  days  ago  we  passed  an  Act  amending  the  Judicature 

Act and we all  supported this in so far as this Act gives more power over land matters 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>895 

</span></div><div><span>to Justices of the Peace, because we know we have to move ahead.  Today, we see the 

Minister  of  Justice  the  Honourable,  Tiki  Matapo,  has  brought  another  Bill  with  the 

same sort of principle. 

</span></div><div><span>I heard the views  of the Acting Prime Minister, Honourable Inatio Akaruru, and my 

views  run  along  the  same  lines  as  his  because  this  Bill  that  we  see  before  us,  is 

amending the Marriage Act that was established in 1973. In here, we are giving power 

to the Justices of the Peace to become marriage celebrants.  Also, we see that there is a 

section  on      organisations  that  think  if  they  meet  the  criteria,  the  Registrar-General 

may  give  them  the  right  to  select  a  leader  from  their  organisation  to  be  a  marriage 

celebrant. 

</span></div><div><span>Unlike  that  which  was  said  previously  by  some  Members,  the  licensing  of  marriage 

celebrants will not  occur without proper investigation by the Registrar General of the 

organisation  making  the  application.  The  Registrar  General  will  make  sure  that  this 

organisation fulfils </span><span>certain religious, philosophical and lifestyle requirements. I don’t 

</span><span>see  anything  wrong  with  this  because  they  will  be  closely  scrutinised  before  that 

application will be approved. The organisation wishes this to be so also because they 

</span><span>want their own people to be their own marriage celebrants.  

</span></div><div><span>I listened to the views of the Member for Nikao, the Honourable Aunty Mau Munokoa 

with her concern for Sub-clause 8, where every religious body not enumerated in the 

First Schedule of this Act is entitled to have an officiating minister. When we look in 

the  First Schedule there are only four approved organisations and they are:  the Cook 

Islands  Christian  Church,  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  the  Seventh  Day  Adventist 

Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  This Schedule does not 

</span><span>include the Baha’i Faith, the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Apostolic Church and others.  I 

</span><span>mention these other religious organisations because we know that they are amongst us 

today.    They  have  their  own  officiating  ministers  but  they  are  not  in  the  First 

Schedule.  Clause  8  gives  them  the  right  to  present  their  officiating  ministers  to 

become marriage celebrants.  

</span></div><div><span>We heard the views of the Honourable Member from the island of Mauke and he gave 

us the views of his  people, from  the views  of the Religious Advisory Council, from 

the views of the Aronga Mana and the Ui Ariki and this is good.  He has given us the 

views of his people. 

</span></div><div><span>I  agree  with  the  title  “marriage  celebrant”.  The  word  “marriage  celebrant”  includes 

</span><span>ministers  of  religion,  Justices  of  the  Peace,  and  the  Registrar-General.  They  are  all 

marriage celebrants. I am a Seventh Day Adventist. We have a problem with some of 

the islands in our country where there is no official ordained minister there. If some of 

our young people in the Seventh Day Adventist church would like to get married then 

they have to wait for one of our ordained ministers, such as Pastor Teaukura or Pastor 

Eliu  and  others.  They  have  to  wait  until  an  ordained  minister  arrives  on  the  island 

before they can be married in the church.  

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Papa Pupuke, Member for Rakahanga, is calling out they should go 

to a CICC or to a Catholic minister. That is okay, but some of our SDA youth want to 

be married by a SDA pastor. This amendment solves this problem. The Marriages Act 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>896 

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1973 tells us that an officiating minister must be a pastor or a minister of religion. We 

have cases in our churches, in the Outer Islands, where there is no Pastor but we have 

somebody  who  is  looking  after  the  congregation,  an  assistant  pastor,  under  this 

Clause, I think, they are given the right to become marriage celebrants. They will be 

granted licenses so that they may marry our young people in our church. 

</span></div><div><span>I heard the views of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Speaker, and I would like to ask 

you,  Sir,  if  you  address  him  next  time  not  to  address  him  as  the  Leader  of  the 

Democratic-Alliance Party because in this House, he is the Leader of the Opposition. I  

agree with his view that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, should not let a man  marry 

a man, or a woman to marry a woman, in our country.  This is a good point.  

</span></div><div><span>In the Second Schedule,  it tells us who a man cannot marry and lists 20 categories.  I 

</span><span>think,  the  21st  category  should  be  ‘no  same  sex  marriages’.  It  also  states  whom  a 

</span><span>woman cannot marry and lists the 20 categories of people that a woman cannot marry, 

</span><span>but  it  does  not  list  another  woman.  I  think  ‘no  same  sex  marriages’</span><span>  should  be 

included. I am not kidding, I support the Leader of the Oppositions views.   

</span></div><div><span>I  think  we  will  ask  the  Minister  responsible  for  this  Bill,  if  we  could  make  an 

</span><span>amendment  such  as  I  have  suggested,  because  we  know  there  are  problems  in  New 

Zealand where people want men to marry men and women to marry women. We do 

not want such a situation occurring in our country. Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Those are 

my views - Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you this afternoon, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all 

the Honourable Members of this House, Kia Orana also to all our people listening in 

this  afternoon. May I, Mr Speaker, congratulate you on your recent  marriage. May I 

wish you every happiness for the future.  

</span></div><div><span>If I may, Mr Speaker, extend a special welcome to all the Mayors who were recently 

in Rarotonga from different islands of the Cook Islands.  And a special Kia Orana to 

all the G.Rs and the different Chief Executives from each of the islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  before  this  House  is  the  Amendment  to  the  Marriage  Act  of  the  Cook 

Islands.  Perhaps  there  are  some  amendments  that  most  of  us  and  our  people  will 

support  but  there  are  some  areas  which  the  public  openly  does  not  support.    My 

</span><span>concern, Mr Speaker, is that what this Amendment doesn’t say. These are points that 

</span><span>have been raised by both members of government and the Opposition. Where do we 

stand in the case of two men wanting to go through the sanctity of marriage? Likewise 

if two women decide to  get  married.  It  is  important  for our people .  This question 

hits at the very fabric of our society, Mr Speaker. The amendment to the Bill is really 

controversial and I would like to request that the Minister of Justice who brought the 

Bill before the House withdraw this Bill into a Select Committee where the views of 

our people are obtained so that we can make a clear and more suitable legislation for 

the  country.    By  having  the  Bill  withdrawn  to  a  Select  Committee  would  give  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>897 

</span></div><div><span>opportunity  for  different  religious  organisations,  different  organisations,  to  be 

represented before any amendments to the Act is made.   

</span></div><div><span>While  part  of  the  Bill  provides  for  J.Ps  to  be  able  to  carry  out  the  function  of  a 

marriage  celebrant,  it  leaves  some  loopholes  where  some  groups,  who  may  not  be 

necessarily religious, will be able to apply for a licence to perform marriages.  As it 

stands,  the  amendment  to  our  Marriage  Act  can  allow  people  with  Satanic 

backgrounds to apply for a licence to perform marriages.  I feel our duty is to provide 

good laws for our country.   

</span></div><div><span>I also understand that there are religious organisations that may not be recognised in 

our statute.  It is about time we recognised those religious organisations that are not in 

the schedule, with regards to the number of religions in our country.   

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker, these amendments leave us open to a lot of changes.  Many of those 

changes may not be conducive to better governance or better running of this country.  

I wholeheartedly believe that this matter should be referred to a Select Committee to 

clarify areas  that are of doubt  to  our people and to  make amendments  that are more 

</span><span>suitable to our way of living.  That is all I have to say, Mr Speaker.  Thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you and all Honourable Members of the 

House.  To our people listening in to this debate, Kia Orana to you all also.   

</span></div><div><span>I support the views by the previous speaker, the Honourable Member from Manihiki, 

that  the  Bill  be  withdrawn  and  given  to  a  Select  Committee.    Because  as  we  go 

through  this  Bill  there  will  be  a  lot  of  differing  views  expressed.    Before  the 

Honourable Member had spoken, I already made up my mind that I will not support 

this  Bill  before  the  House.    I  believe  that  this  is  just  like  the  reform  process  that 

Government is associated with.  They reform here, they reform there and everywhere.  

I  feel  that  if  the  House  approves  this  Bill,  I  would  like  Rakahanga  to  be  exempt  as 

there  are  only  three  religions  there.    They  include  SDA,  CICC  and  the  Catholic 

churches.  The people are happy with the way things are.  I think that if this happens it 

would  have  an  impact  on  the  way  of  thinking  of  the  members  of  those  church 

denominations on Rakahanga.  

</span></div><div><span>Looking at this matter it seems that we are reverting back to the past, to the days of 

our forefathers where we did not get married or baptised. Before we know it, one man 

will  be  allowed  two  or  three  wives,  or  one  woman will have four husbands. This  is 

what will happen if we start tinkering with marriage rules. I can see that if we approve 

this  amendment,  it  would  cheapen  marriage.  In  fact,  the  license  of  a  marriage 

celebrant is cheaper than a housie license. All it requires is for an organisation of 10 

people  to  apply  for  a  marriage  celebrant  license,  whereas  for  housie  it  costs  $100.  I 

</span><span>don’t  understand  why  we  would  want  to  cause  our  present  religious  beliefs</span><span>  to  be 

eroded,  maybe  it  is  because  we  are  coming  to  the  end  of  time,  that  is  why  this  is 

</span><span>happening.  We are a Christian nation and I wish we would remain that way. I don’t 

</span><span>want us to move away from our Christian principles. If this amendment goes through, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>898 

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask that Rakahanga and Manihiki be left out of it. However, if it goes 

to the Select Committee first, I will support that. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Marine Resources, Tepure Tapaitau.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, to the Clerk of 

Parliament,  to  all  the  staff  of  Parliament,  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  my 

Cabinet colleagues, to Honourable Members on the Government side and to those on 

the seaside.  Kia Orana.  Kia Orana to our listening public who are listening in to our 

parliamentary broadcast this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  speak  on the Bill  before the House and although I support the 

merits  in  the  Bill  itself,  I  do  however  have  a  couple  of  reservations.    I  think  if  we 

listen to all the Members who spoke on the merits of the Bill some of those worrying 

concerns have been echoed in the House.  My first point of  reservation, Mr Speaker, 

is  that  the  Bill  in  itself,  gives  a  group  of  people  or  anybody  else  on  the  street,  the 

rights  to  perform  marriages.  Under  the  principal  Act  marriages  are  performed  by an 

officiating minister or a registrar or a deputy registrar of the High Court. To me, the 

Amendment    is  removing  the  holy  sanctity  the  holy  solemnity  of  marriage.  That 

private organisation conducting marriages, is to me, making a mockery of the whole 

sanctity and solemnity of marriage.  

</span></div><div><span>We  have  listened  to  our  Members  of  Parliament,  we  have  listened  to  our  leaders 

outside this House talking about our very culture, traditions and our changing lifestyle.  </span><span>Mr Speaker, my feeling is that this exercise removes the sanctity and solemnity shown 

in  the principal Act.  It  is  an encroachment on our very customs and traditions.  The 

Honourable Dr Robati, talked about Rakahanga and the beliefs of those people.  Like 

him, I am sure if I consulted with my people on this very matter, my advice from my 

people would be to oppose the Bill before this House. 

</span></div><div><span>My second reservation is in relation to Clause 3, Sub-Clause 8 of the Bill, which is the 

Approval of organisations.  If I could just read it out: 

</span></div><div><span>“Any  organisation  may  apply  to  the  Registrar</span><span>-General  in  the  manner  hereinafter 

provided  as  an  organisation  which  may,  pursuant  to  section  9  of  this  Act,  nominate 

persons to solemnise marriages, (therein and in this section referred to as an approved 

</span><span>organisation).”</span></div><div><span>I see “organisation” is not defined in the Interpretation Clause.  My view on this Sub</span><span>-

Clause,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  it  is  leaving  it  open  too  open  for  every  Tom  Dick  and 

Harry to come in and form an organisation or even every Tom Dick or Harry may call 

in  more  Toms,  Dicks  and  Harries  to  form  a  cult.    There  is  nothing,  Mr  Speaker,  to 

stop  them  from  calling  all  of  them  together  and  naming  their  organisation  as  the 

church of Satan.  Mr Speaker, this is the kind of possibility that will arise if we do not 

move  very  carefully  with  this  piece  of  legislation.      We  all  know,  Mr  Speaker,  that 

these cults are now strong in the United States.  They are strong in Australia where a 

lot  of  our  people  are  living,  they  are  now  becoming  strong  in  New  Zealand  and  we 

have  about  50,000  Cook  Islanders  living  there.  There  is  nothing  to  stop  a  group  of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>899 

</span></div><div><span>those  Cook  Islanders  coming  here  and  setting  up  this  kind  of  cult.    By  passing  this 

piece of legislation we are opening the way for these people to come here and make a 

mockery  of  our  traditions  and  the  culture  of  this  country.    I  consulted  with  the 

Minister  of  Justice,  who  no  doubt,  Mr  Speaker,  will  address  us  with  the  view  to 

referring this to a select committee.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MARSTERS:</span><span>  Thank you and Kia Orana to you and your staff this afternoon.  

Greetings to Honourable Members of the House on both sides of the House, greetings 

to our people who are listening to the broadcast this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all those people who 

participated  in  the  recently  completed  Tarekareka  Sports.    First  and  foremost,  Mr 

Speaker, to the organisers of the sports for a job well done.  Before I carry on in this 

respect, Mr Speaker, might I at this time pay homage to our sports delegations that are 

about to depart to participate in the Commonwealth Games overseas. To every single 

one of you travelling to represent the Cook Islands at the Games, our heartfelt thanks 

for your dedication and the time spent developing yourselves in your respective sports.  

We  feel  proud  about  you  and  wish  you  all  the  best  for  a  safe  journey  overseas  and 

back  home  again.    Whatever  the  outcome  of  your  individual  sports,  you  are  Cook 

Islands boys and girls and we will always look up to you proudly. Best of luck to all of 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>Getting  back  to  the  Tarekareka  sports,  Mr  Speaker,  now  that  I  have  congratulated 

everybody, can I direct my attention to two areas:  the overall winner of the sports - 

Arorangi, Puaikura. We are so proud of you Puaikura from Tuoro  to Toreaiva, all the 

boys  and  girls  and  all  the  mamas  and  papas,  not  forgetting  them  because  they 

participated in certain sports requiring skills of the veterans.  Congratulations to you 

all. Although we were not as prepared as we would have hoped to be, we still won all 

- most of the medals.  Imagine if we were better prepared.  Let me assure everybody 

else  today,  that  come  the  next  Games  in  two  years  time,  Arorangi  will  be  better 

</span><span>prepared and we’ll take more medals.</span></div><div><span>My  congratulations  also  to  my  little  island,  Palmerston.    I  must  also  express  my 

disappointment  that  the  ship  that  was  supposed  to  be  picking  up  the  team  from 

Palmerston did not call in to Palmerston to pick them up because they had allocated 

all the space to Pukapuka, Penrhyn, Rakahanga and Manihiki. A few got to Rarotonga 

on  earlier  boats.  Hey,  Mr  Speaker,  we  got  more  gold  medals  than  the  other  four.    I 

think,  Mr  Speaker,  we  even  got  more  gold  medals  than  Aitutaki,  Atiu  and  others.  

Never  mind  that,  Mr  Speaker,  to  all  of  you  who  participated,  all  my  brothers  and 

sisters  who  participated  on  behalf of Palmerston in  these Games, my heartfelt thank 

you and congratulations.  I am just juggling my time, when we are ready, I intend to 

call a get-together of all of you.  We will get together at my place one day, for a bit of 

a  barbecue  and  a  chitchat,  not  only  ourselves  -  those  who  participated,  but  all  our 

families, all the families.  We will get together one afternoon. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>900 

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  as  I  listened  to  the  debate  on  the  Bill  before  the  House,  I  feel  sad.  It 

</span><span>appears  to  me  that  there  wasn’t  enough  research  on  the  responses  expected  from 

</span><span>Members  of  this  House,  let  alone  the  response expected from  our people.  And as  I 

listened to the debate this afternoon, Mr Speaker, out of the twelve people who spoke 

this  afternoon,  only  two  were  in  full  support  of  the  Bill.    I  think  the  Honourable 

Member, Tepure Tapaitau left a message before he took his seat that the Minister now 

responsible  for  the  Bill,  namely  the  Minister  of  Justice,  is  contemplating  maybe  the 

withdrawal of this Bill in order for it to be given more time for it to be discussed. If 

that is the case, Mr Speaker, then I shall be very brief on the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>But  I  think  the  Minister  for  Marine  Resources  hit  the  nail  on  the  head  when  he 

</span><span>referred to the term “organisation” because as it is, Mr Speaker, it is ambiguous in that 

the definition of “organisation” is unclear. He rightly says that </span><span>any organisation, any 

organisation could apply for a licence and anybody in that organisation can be licensed 

as  a  marriage  celebrant  -  </span><span>anybody.  And it doesn’t matter whether the final  onus on 

</span><span>determining  who  gets  the  licence  rests  with  the  Registrar-General  and  the  Minister. 

One of these days a person who is not defined under the Principal Act could step in 

and get a licence.  And who knows what sort of organisation, what sort of principles 

</span><span>they  uphold,  they  represent,  especially  when  Clause  4,  sub-Clause  13  (d)  refers  to 

</span><span>“approved  organisations”.    What  is  the  definition  of  that,  Mr  Speaker?    I  pose  the 

</span><span>question  again,  in  addition  to  the  questions  raised  by  the  Minister  of  Marine 

</span><span>Resources.    I  think  the  term  “organisation”  is  a  dangerous  term  in  this  Bill.</span><span>It’s  a 

</span><span>dangerous term and that is why I mean by saying, Mr Speaker, it is ambiguous.  In this 

</span><span>context I don’t know what the definition of organisation is.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, that is really all I have to say on the Bill at this time, especially that there 

is  some  indication  that  maybe  the  matter  will  be  retired  for  further  consideration.  

Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second Time 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff this 

afternoon,  Kia  Orana  to  the  Honourable  Members  of  this  House,  Kia  Orana  to  the 

Ministers,  to  Government  Members,  to  the  Members  of  the  Opposition,  to  the  two 

Leaders in the Opposition, to our people listening in this afternoon - Kia Orana to you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>First  of  all,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Members  for  their 

views on the Bill before the House.  Maybe it was a blessing in disguise, Mr Speaker, 

when yesterday the transmission of our broadcast was interfered with because it gave 

the Honourable Members more time to study this Bill and come back today with the 

views  that  they  have  presented.    So,  now  I  would  like  to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  that  I 

sympathise with the views of some of the Honourable Members who spoke earlier. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>901 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  now  to  respond  to  some  of  the  views  presented  by 

Honourable Members on this Bill.  First of all, with regard to the views of the Leader 

of  the  Opposition  when  he  said  the  effect  of  this  Bill  may  be  to  make  it  easier  and 

quicker for people to get married. He also told us that he discussed this issue with the 

people of his constituency and there were three areas that they were worried about. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to now come back to the issue of marriage and we all know that there are 

two different  types of marriage, the civil  marriage and the religious  marriage.  Civil 

</span><span>marriages  are  those  held  in  the  Registrar’s  Office.  It  is  not  an  easy  procedure,  Mr 

Speaker. It’s  </span><span>not  as if you can just get a licence and get married. It is a requirement 

under the law that three days before you get married you must acquire a licence.  And 

when you go to the registrar to apply for a licence there are about four forms that you 

need to </span><span>fill in.  And this applies to whether you are Papa’a or Maori.  When you apply 

</span><span>certain checks are done, or criteria will have to be met. You will need to answer some 

of the queries of the registrar.  One of the questions is, who do you want to be married 

by -  a pastor of a church, or by the Registrar, or whoever?  If it is the Registrar, then 

three  days  before  you  apply  for  your  licence,  when  you  get  your  licence  you  get 

</span><span>married  in  the  Justice  Department.    Before  the  ceremony  is  conducted  the  Registrar  

</span><span>as</span><span>ks the couple that is getting married, “do you wish to start off with a prayer?”.  And 

</span><span>also, to close with a prayer.  It is a very brief ceremony, to have these people who do 

not choose to open a ceremony or close a ceremony with a prayer.  It is still happening 

today.   

</span></div><div><span>In  some  cases,  Mr  Speaker,  especially  with  tourists,  they  choose  to  be  married  by  a 

non-religious  person.  And  this  has  been  happening.    However,  if  it  concerns  people 

from overseas who come here intending to marry, even a screening process takes place 

and inquiries are made, investigation is made to find out exactly who they are, what 

they  are,  and  what  they  are  here  for.    If  one  of  them  has  been  married,  a  decree 

absolute must be produced, or a document to show that they are legally divorced.  If 

he  or  she  is  a  widow  then  they  need  a  death  certificate  to  prove  that  the  partner  or 

spouse  has  died.    When  these  questions  have  been  answered  and  cleared,  then  a 

licence to get married is given or approved by the Registrar.   

</span></div><div><span>Marriages  that  are  conducted by an Orometua cost  $20 fee for a licence, plus  VAT.  

For visitors it costs $50 for a licence, plus VAT.   

</span></div><div><span>Reference  was  made  to  the  doing  away  of  the  term  “officiating  minister”  and 

replacing  it  with  “marriage  celebrant”.    I  appreciate  the  view  </span><span>by  the  Honourable 

Minister, Vaine Tairea, and the views of the Mauke people.  I am sure that there are 

others who probably hold  the same view, Mr Speaker  - possibly other Outer Islands 

and  some  people  on  Rarotonga.    Mr  Speaker,  let  me  assure  you  that  it  is  not  the 

intention of this Bill to remove the title of an Orometua.  But as we will realise later 

on in the Clause that empowers a J.P and any other person to solemnise the wedding.  

</span><span>The  change  or  the  replacement  of  the  term  “officiating  minister”  with  “ma</span><span>rriage 

</span><span>celebrant”  is  really  to  accommodate  both  the  Orometua  and  a  non</span><span>-Orometua.    The 

</span><span>Religious Advisory Councils and other recognised church groups - it is a requirement 

under  the  law  that  they  must  supply  the  Registrar  with  the  names  of  the  Orometua 

within  that  denomination  to  conduct  weddings,  or  approved  by  them  to  conduct 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>902 

</span></div><div><span>                                                                                        26 August 1998 

</span></div><div><span>weddings, the normal being, Mr Speaker, all ekalesia - the Orometua - his name will 

</span><span>be in the Justice Department, in the Registrar’s Office, in the list of those who are to 

</span><span>conduct wedding ceremonies.  When the licence is obtained and he gets a copy of the 

licence, and even when signing a marriage certificate at the end of the wedding, he is 

</span><span>required to submit back to the Registrar, he’ll still have to sign that certificate as the 

</span><span>Orometua.  All his requirements under the principal Act still remains.   

</span></div><div><span>In regard to approval of organisations, Mr Speaker, again it was interesting to hear the 

views  of  the  Honourable  Members  who  spoke  on  it  and  expressed  their  concerns 

about  this Clause.   Mr Speaker, I can assure you that any Tom, Dick and Harry can 

apply.  And I gave mention of criteria of ten signatures and so forth.  Let me assure 

you, Mr Speaker, it was never the intention of this Clause for that to occur.  I suppose 

you could say that </span><span>any Tom, Dick and Harry can apply, but it doesn’t mean to say that 

</span><span>any Tom, Dick and Harry will get the approval.  So again, Mr Speaker, when you read 

in  the  first  paragraph  of  that  Clause,  it  is  of  concern.  But  following  on  from  that, 

reading all other Clauses as part of that, almost on that whole page, you will see how 

the procedure is carried out.    

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, now that the time is up, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  It is time to adjourn.  I’ll ask an 

</span><span>Honourable Member to close us with a prayer.   

</span></div><div><span>Prayer 

</span></div><div><span>This Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday the 27th of August 1998, 

at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting adjourned at 3.57 p.m.</span></div><div>Page: <a>1</a>, <a>2</a>, <a>3</a>, <a>4</a>, <a>5</a>, <a>6</a>, <a>7</a>, <a>8</a>, <a>9</a>, <a>10</a>, <a>11</a>, <a>12</a>, <a>13</a>, <a>14</a>, <a>15</a>, <a>16</a>, <a>17</a>, <a>18</a></div>
