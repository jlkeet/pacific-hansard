<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>MR T. VARU:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member for Tupapa for your question.  I am surprised at 

</span><span>your  question  and  it  is  a  good  question  because  I  am  aware  of  the  rusting  metals  that  you  are 

</span><span>referring to.  These metals existed since the time of the Honourable William Smiley Heather.  I 

</span><span>was part of the men that put these metal rods in place. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Maybe to respond to your question, I would like to request for a space of time for me to look into 

this issue and find ways to resolve this matter.  Thank you.
