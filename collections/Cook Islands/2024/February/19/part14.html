<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Minister of Finance for the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I move:</span></div><div><span>That the Appropriation Amendment Bill 2024  

be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you; you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Before I begin, let me also acknowledge and welcome our guests that are in 

</span><span>the  Public  Gallery  from  Australia  and  I  also  see  my  team  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and 

</span><span>Economic Management that are here for the delivery of our Budget Speech.  Queen Pa who have 

joined us, Kia Orana.  To the Honourable Members of the House and our people that are listening 

</span><span>in and watching in via the livestream. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today I want to highlight the continued and significant progress that this Government 

</span><span>has made in its response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as we continue to focus our 

efforts towards economic recovery and fiscal responsibility but also supporting the needs of our 

people.    Mr  Speaker,  as  Prime  Minister  and  also  as  Minister  of  Finance,  I  am  tabling  the 

Appropriation Amendment Bill, otherwise known as the Supplementary Budget.  I present this 

</span></div><div><span>477 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Amendment Bill with full confidence as we strive towards delivering on improving the lives of 

our people. 

</span></div><div><span>These are the sectors that will do well, that are doing well, include our agricultural sector, which 

feeds the additional people that come to the island.  This is a means of local exports with the market 

coming to us.  We do not need to export to the market, we bring the market here.  It also includes 

the financial services sector, which provides banking services to businesses across the board, it 

includes the contracting and construction sectors, the retail and the wholesale sectors.  So, when 

tourism does well, all of these sectors thrive.  This is the multiplier effect that turns that one dollar 

over and over again.   

</span></div><div><span>The government has also listened to the concerns raised around labour shortages as brought up by 

the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  we  have  responded  with  the  adjustments  to  Immigration 

</span><span>Regulations.  Some of which we have just tabled today and this should help people find work, help 

</span><span>businesses find workers and help our economy grow strongly. 

</span></div><div><span>This has been hard road through the last four years, Mr Speaker.  Four years of lost productivity 

and it is not over yet but the resilient of our Cook Islands people has shown through.  The ability 

of our people to respond and adapt and to look for opportunity in the face of adversity. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I am proud of our people both big and small.  And it is not just the businesses that keep things 

turning over.  Last week, a young man turned up to my house asking if he could cut my grass.  He 

was a casual worker and had no work that day from his boss.  So, he went looking for work and 

he came to my place with his grass cutter and I paid him for his work. 

</span></div><div><span>That money that he received will go to buy food or petrol or beer or whatever but 15 percent will 

be recovered in VAT.  That is the multiplier effect; that dollar will go around again.  That is our 

</span><span>economy at work.  So, it doesn’t matter if you</span><span> buy a big screen TV from CITC or buy a </span><span>“mā</span><span>roro 

</span><span>tunutunu” </span><span>from the hut at the market.  That dollar will travel to someone that will spend it, to pay 

someone; who will buy a school uniform, who will buy bread </span><span>–</span><span> that is the economy. 

</span></div><div><span>And we all play a part in keeping it turning.  That is why I am very proud to lead our government 

which has kept a steady hand to guide our recovery by growing our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the good management of our economy has allowed the government to respond to the 

</span><span>important needs from our people and to maintain the fiscal responsibility that keeps confidence 

</span><span>high.  The confidence in the Cook Islands is something that is reflected at regional and even at 

international levels.  And this confidence makes us stand out in the region.  This is displayed in 

the stronger outlook for the Cook Islands economy than for any other countries in the region in the 

most recent pacific economic monitor from the ADB.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Let me turn to expenditure Mr Speaker.  As we gather momentum and rebuilding and strengthening 

our economy, it is crucial that we pay attention to the finer details of our financial decisions.  As 

you may be aware, Mr Speaker, article 73(b) of the Constitution allows additional funding to be 

allocated  but  not  to  exceed  1.5  percent  of  that  total  amount  of  all  sums  appropriated  by  the 

Appropriation Act. 

</span></div><div><span>And as of the end of January 2024, a total $3.4million in Executive Order approvals were granted 

under this article.  Which enabled the government to support key funding initiatives during the 

financial year.  And I would like to mention a few of those. 

</span></div><div><span>And the first one of these, Mr Speaker, is the provision of inter-island shipping at a cost of $1.3 

million.    Mr  Speaker,  an  investment  of  $1.3  million  was  made  to  facilitate  travel  and  goods 

transportation for our overseas families wanting to travel to the Pa Enua during the festive season. 

</span><span>This was done in the chartering of the MV Lady Samoa IV vessel.  This action that we have done 

</span><span>brings connections and activity to our Pa Enua, maintaining important links with our diaspora. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, contract negotiations resulted in $675,000 being spent on this charter.  We manage to 

recover approximately $307,000 through fares from passengers and freight charges. 

</span></div><div><span>But  this  charger  was  a  game  changer  as  it  also  allowed  us  to  ship  goods  valued  at  about 

124thousand dollars to Nassau and Pukapuka, places that might have missed out otherwise.  A 

large  portion  of  those  goods,  Mr  Speaker,  worth  $94,000  comprised  of  dried  and  frozen  items 

bought right here in Rarotonga.  We also brought in personal items valued at $21,000 from New 

Zealand  and  parts  for  vehicles  and  boats,  valued  at  $8,000.    This  here  Mr  Speaker  is  a  prime 

example of our economy in action and the goal of our government to bring all of our islands into 

our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this initiative provides a template for future opportunities to strengthen cultural and 

economic linkages between Pa Enua communities and their diaspora living in New Zealand and 

Australia.  And with sufficient lead up time of up to 2 years, it is likely that charters of this nature 

</span><span>could be fully cost recoverable. 

</span></div><div><span>I turn to patient referrals, Mr Speaker, recognising the importance of healthcare, and the rising 

</span><span>needs  for  referrals  for  treatments,  both  to  Rarotonga  and  to  New  Zealand.    The  Government 

</span><span>increased funding by $1 million.  This ensured our patient referrals systems is robust, including 

</span><span>the recent changes to policy expanding the scope of services to cover private healthcare service 

</span><span>providers.  This funding has been further increased by $800,000 in the Supplementary Budget I 

present to you today.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to raise that over and above the decisions made through these approvals 

from  Executive  Council,  additional  priorities  were  identified  to  be  supported  through  this 

Appropriation Amendment Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Moving  on  Mr  Speaker,  Infrastructure  Cook  Islands  is  set  to  receive  $400,000  to  continue  the 

essential  road  and  drainage  maintenance  for  the  remainder  of  this  financial  year  2023/24  to 

improve the roads on Rarotonga.  Everyone I have spoken to has only good things to say about the 

beautiful main road from Nikao to Titikaveka.  And we know that this is what our people want.  

So, we will complete the asphalt road all the way around the island including through Puaikura. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, with the rising costs of pharmaceuticals across the world, it is necessary to increase 

the funding for this by $280,000 in the years to ensure our people have access to the medications 

they need.  

</span></div><div><span>And  on  that  note  Mr  Speaker,  with  the  recent  passing  of  the  Narcotics  and  Misuse  of  Drugs 

Amendment Act last year allowing for the importation of medicinal cannabis into the country. It 

is only right that government supports this initiative proposed by the Ministry of Health which 

cover  varies  activities  including  the  creation  of  new  regulations  and  policies,  the  provision  of 

training  for  health  personnel  and  border  and  law  enforcement  agencies.  And  to  put  in  place 

Standard Operating Procedures for health professionals to allow for easy and seamless prescription 

and application of medicinal cannabis. Government has allocated nearly $60,000 to support this 

work. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Seabed Minerals Authority will receive a $310,000 boost to enhance stakeholder 

engagement and advance our Seabed Minerals sector through legal and environmental expertise.  

This will allow the Authority to continue to support the precautionary approach that government 

has taken in the Exploration Phase of our Seabed Minerals program.  It is important that we keep 

our people informed about our journey there is  much misinformation and misrepresentation by 

that those that seek to stop our country from gaining the knowledge to harvest the wealth of our 

ocean in a responsible way.  We must continue with our program of awareness both here at home 

</span><span>and also internationally.  These minerals are the future of our world and we will play a role in 

</span><span>helping the world transition to green energy.  

</span></div><div><span>I move to Renewable Energy Mr Speaker.  Particularly renewable energy for our Pa Enua islands.  

</span><span>This  government  is  urgently  allocating  $220,000  to  replace  essential  components  of  the  solar 

</span><span>power systems while planning for the larger battery replacement program progresses.  The solar 

</span><span>systems lifted our people from 12 hour and 18 hours a day of power to 24 hours a day power.  We 

cannot  go  backwards  we  must  ensure  that  these  solar  systems  continue  to  provide  24  hour 

electricity  for  all  of  our  people.    This  funding  will  be  provided  through  the  Pa  Enua  Capital 

Distribution Fund to address these critical needs.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The government has also committed $280,000 to the Ministry of Agriculture to acquire machinery 

specifically for use in community projects on Rarotonga.   This initiative mirrors the successful 

efforts in the Southern group Pa Enua where with the help of our external partners we were able 

to enhance local agriculture through similar investments.  Times have changed, we now rely on 

machinery  rather  than  man  power  for  agriculture  and  community  work.    This  Appropriation 

strengthens  both  our  agriculture  capabilities  and  supports  our  communities  in  being  able  to 

progress  key  projects.    This  careful  and  considered  allocation  of  funds  reflects  government 

dedication  to  fostering  economic  growth,  ensuring  well-</span><span>being  and  strengthening  our  nation’s 

</span><span>infrastructure and services.        

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have covered our expenditure side, I turn now to our revenue side but I am having 

a look at our time.  Would you like me to continue?  I will help our Members digest their lunch I 

guess if I talk about the revenue that we are collecting to cover the expenditure that is going out.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Honourable Prime Minister, you may continue when we come back. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Okay, that sounds good to me. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Members, it is time for recess.  Sitting is suspended until 12.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.26 p.m</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 12.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please be seated.  Before our break, the Honourable Prime Minister had the 

Floor.  Honourable Prime Minister, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I will now return to the Supplementary Budget 

statement and when I left off, I was just about to start on the revenue side. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr </span><span>Speaker, I am here today to confirm that there will be no changes to our government’s revenue 

</span><span>strategies for the 2023/24 financial year.  However, it is my pleasure to report that we have seen a 

positive  adjustment  in  our  revenue  forecasts  for  this  period,  with  an  increase  of  $5.6  million 

</span><span>particularly in the form of tax receipts, a significant portion of which comes from the VAT paid 

</span><span>by tourists visiting our shores, again an example of our economy and the multiplier at work.  This 

</span><span>increase also includes some from the higher incomes our workers are experiencing as demand and 

</span><span>cost for their labour is at an all-time high.  

</span></div><div><span>This boost in revenue is a sign of our thriving tourism sector and our recovering economy across 

the board.  As we move forward, it is crucial that we use these additional funds wisely, investing 

</span></div><div><span>481 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>in  projects  and services  that will further strengthen the Cook  Islands’  economy, benefiting  </span><span>our 

people, our communities, and the tourism industry that plays such a pivotal role in our nation's 

prosperity.  I believe this Supplementary Budget is true to that goal, and continues to deliver for 

the country. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, Mr Speaker, to give you an overview of our financial landscape following recent updates 

to the 2023/24 Budget, the total Appropriation has increased from $325 million to $342 million.  

A total of nearly $17 million increase in Appropriation, which has been funded by a combination 

of  additional  tax  revenues  and  support  from  our  development  partners  for  which  we  are  very 

grateful for.  

</span></div><div><span>This increase in our budget is dedicated to enhancing the services we provide to our people and to 

strengthening the infrastructure of Rarotonga and the Pa Enua.  Specifically, $9.3 million of this 

</span><span>increase will assist various agencies in delivering better services, while $7.3 million is allocated 

</span><span>towards the implementation of infrastructure projects.  This adjustment reflects our commitment 

to improving the quality of life for our people and ensuring the sustainable development of our 

nation. 

</span></div><div><span>We have made commitments to  the people of the Cook  Islands, and we have done our best  to 

honour  those  commitments  whilst  at  the  same  time  upholding  fiscal  discipline.    In  the  face  of 

economic recovery and challenges, we have prioritised effectively, keeping our eyes on the goal 

of building a stronger, more thriving society for us all.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this a Government of action, look around me, this is a government of performance 

and  results,  but  we  are  also  a  government  who  cares  for  our  people,  this  is  a  government  of 

compassion one that listens to the voices of our people but also one that walks the talk.  I am sure 

that all members of the House can agree with me on this. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, it is my honour and privilege to table this Appropriation Amendment Bill 

before the house; Kia Orana and thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Minister  of  Finance.    I  call  for  a 

Seconder to the Motion?

</span></div><div><span>The next Bill on the Order of Business now is the Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill 2024. 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Prime Minister for the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill 2024  

be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister, Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill.  I 

</span><span>see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I wish to speak in regards to this Amendment Bill that 

</span><span>is before the House.  There are also other issues pertaining to this in regards to the payment to this 

office.  I was studying the Seabed Minerals Act that we have passed and in that Act Mr Speaker, 

</span></div><div><span>483 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>this is an area that we need to regard carefully with their allocation or funding.  The funding for 

the payment of experts that will come here to research the minerals in our ocean.  I believe Mr 

Speaker that this is one of the critical areas that we this House need to scrutinise carefully. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe the time is right for us to deliberate on the fundings to pay these research companies that 

are coming to study our deep-sea mineral.  In the Seabed Amendment Act under Section 4 is where 

we find the cost recovery part set out.  I have no issue in this matter and encourage us to support 

the Ministry for the payments of funds from these overseas companies. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, also looking at the regulations of the Seabed Mineral because here Regulation No. 

50, this is one of the critical areas that needs to be improved and for this to be included in the main 

Seabed Mineral Act.   And that  I believe  with  be a new inclusion, Section 13A.   I support this 

inclusion very strongly. 

</span></div><div><span>I refer to the Regulation 42 (2), this should also be included in the Main Seabed Mineral Act in 

Section 13A, sub-clause (2) (b).  Mr Speaker I just want to impress our Members of Parliament 

that these are all necessary requirements that is needed to improve the work of our Seabed Mineral 

Office. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when we the Members speak on his Bill, we must have a good understanding of the 

impact of the Act on the functions of this Office.  And that is the reason Mr Speaker I believe that 

these  recommendations  that  I  raised  should  be  incorporated  in  the  Main  Act  of  the  Seabed 

Minerals. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to the reports that have been tabled I have no problem with those submissions.  Also 

including the registration to the Office I have no problem with those registrations.  In the Main 

Seabed Minerals Act the registration section is No. 48 to 50.  That is in regards to the registration 

of the companies to take part in the research of minerals. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the other areas that needs for the House to look into is the changes of the names of the 

</span><span>names; this is in Section 9 - Change to Title Holders Name.  Mr Speaker, I strongly support this 

</span><span>part of the regulation and the Act.  Although, Mr Speaker I am not a lawyer, but I want the best 

for our people.  In the Regulations is where we get the work to be done but under the Act is where 

</span><span>you guided to what is legal and what is not to do. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, all these regulations and law are all important for our people in the work that this 

</span><span>ministry of government is tasked to do.  This will protect the ministry and the government and the 

people of our nation.

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have no problem with all these changes to the Act which will add more power to 

this Act.  Therefore, I give my strong support to this Amendment Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to give my comments on this 

Bill.  The policy document that has accompanied this Bill and to this House, I find very helpful. 

</span></div><div><span>It tells us that the Amendment to this Bill deals with two types of amendments the substantial ones 

and the minor ones.  And as I understand it the substantial amendments are really to improve the 

Acts effectiveness and administrative deficiency. 

</span></div><div><span>There  is  however,  Mr  Prime  Minister  a  lesson  to  be  learned.    When  we  rush  Bills  through 

Parliament this would be the result.  I am however please that the steps that have been taken to 

bridge  the  gaps  have  been  done  in  the  most  effective  way.    I  have  gone  through  the  policy 

document and understand the amendments that are being made. 

</span></div><div><span>And on behalf of the rest of my Members we support this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Prime 

Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  It is my pleasure Mr Speaker to present this Seabed 

Minerals Amendment Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we are building a world leading Seabed Minerals Sector based on best principles and 

practices with an effective robust legal framework to benefit the Cook Islands and our people.  We 

did  not  get  here  overnight  Mr  Speaker;  it  has  taken  us  many  years  of  careful  planning  and 

preparation to get where we are today. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of our laws, we have built a comprehensive Seabed Minerals Legislative Regime, one 

that is world leading.  One that is adaptive and responsive to the evolving knowledge and modern 

</span><span>practices so that it remains fit for purpose.  These amendments are not the result of previous rushed 

</span><span>legislation, Mr Speaker.  These amendments have been carefully plotted and step out, knowing 

</span><span>that we will gain  knowledge as time goes on  and amendments  will take place as we are doing 

</span><span>today. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it was nearly three years in 2021 that I spoke in this Parliament about the beginning 

of our new voyage of discovery for our country.  This is a voyage not across our ocean but rather

how it will allow for the collection of essential environmental data and information. This would 

then  allow  the  government  to  make  informed  decisions  about  whether  we  will  allow  minerals 

harvesting  in  the  future.    I  promise  that  our  exploration  minerals  program  would  lead  to  more 

knowledge  and  information  on  our  Marae  Moana.    It  would  lead  to  more  job  and  training 

opportunities for our people and would lead to the use of our local business to supply goods and 

services.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am pleased to report that this week Friday 23</span><span>rd</span><span> February will mark the second year 

of our exploration minerals program.  I am even more pleased to see our goals becoming reality 

and that more opportunities are being created.  One such example is the Anuanua Moana vessel 

which is based at Avatiu harbour and is owned by one of the exploration companies.  In addition 

to  its  exploration  activities,  the  Anuanua  Moana  has  been  chartered  to  assist  in  taking  cargo 

</span><span>including  for  the  200  year  celebrations  in  Nga-Pu-Toru  and  helping  to  conduct  independent 

</span><span>scientific expeditions.  As we continue with our exploration minerals program, the government 

will continue to proceed with caution taking actions on the best available science to both manage 

our seabed minerals resources while also ensuring the marine environment is protected.  We will 

continue to control all aspects of activities in our EEZ including the data and samples taken through 

exploration  in  our  waters.    We  will  also  continue  to  engage  with  our  own  Cook  Islands 

communities and stakeholders which I believe will lead to a sustainable long term and beneficial 

Seabed Minerals sector.  

</span></div><div><span>Fellow Members, let me be clear we are only allowing exploration to take place at this stage.  We 

are not contemplating harvesting at this stage as that decision is some time from now.  Anyone 

who says that the government is going ahead with harvesting is peddling misinformation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I now move on to discussing the Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill.  As mentioned 

by our previous speakers this is a short Bill.  There are no major policy changes.  Rather these 

amendments are intended to improve our overall Seabed Minerals regime.  Since the end of our 

exploration licensing process and two years into exploration, the Seabed Minerals Authority has 

</span><span>been reviewing our laws and processes to ensure they are fit for purpose.  They have identified the 

</span><span>areas for improvement which we are now addressing in this Bill and I will speak briefly to that.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  our  standards  and  guidelines.    These  support  the  implementation  of  our  Act  and 

</span><span>Regulations and they were previously set out in our Exploration Regulations.  These standards and 

</span><span>guidelines has now been elevated to the Seabed Minerals Act and the process for developing them 

</span><span>has been further refined and now also includes a requirement for Cabinet approval.  

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, the use of the terms mining and mineral harvesting. Mining is a broad term which ranges 

from extracting through to digging and cutting.   The clear feedback from our stakeholders and

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>communities is that they prefer to use a specific term when we are referring to collecting nodules 

from the floor.  So, we have introduced the term harvesting to reflect the actual activity that takes 

place.  

</span></div><div><span>Fourthly, in terms of due diligence and cost recovery.   The Authority undertakes due diligence 

checks whenever companies propose to  make management or  governance changes.   These due 

diligence checks are costly and currently the Authority does not charge fees for this service.  This 

Amendment will make clearer that the Authority can prescribe cost recovery fees. Next in terms 

of information management.  We have made some minor amendments to sections 18 and 18A to 

make the intentions of these sections clearer.   Other changes in  this Bill  include amending the 

Annual Reporting period to match the date from which the Licences are granted as opposed to 

following a calendar year.  We have also provided a process for a company that chooses to change 

its name.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before moving on I would like to thank and acknowledge the individuals within the 

Crown  Law  Office  and  also  the  New  Zealand  Parliamentary  Counsels  Office  and  the  Seabed 

Minerals Authority for their efforts in preparing this Bill.  

</span></div><div><span>In the next steps Mr Speaker, I expect that when the Bill is approved by this House and is passed 

it  will  apply  to  the  three  companies  currently  exploring  our  waters  and  will  include  some 

transitional provisions before some changes come into effect.  In summary this Seabed Minerals 

Amendment Bill is another step in our journey towards setting up a transformational future for our 

country.  This has been a long and careful process for us and this year 2024 is shaping up to be 

another exciting year f</span><span>or our country’s journey. </span><span> So, I invite my fellow Members of Parliament in 

this  House,  all  of  us  to  show  your  support  for  this  Seabed  Minerals  Amendment  towards  our 

journey,  realising  a  long  hill  aspiration  for  our  country  and  a  special  thank  you  for  o  the  two 

previous speakers who have given their support for this Bill.  Thank very much Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  to  the  Members  for  their 

contributions to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the Question.
