<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  My question is to the Prime Minister.  Mr Speaker, we are aware of the GDP and 

have heard that the GDP has sky-rocketed and our country is supported by the GDP. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My  question  is  in  regards  to  “inflation”.  </span><span>  Inflation  in  our  country  is  increasing.    What  is  the 

government doing to resolve this issue with the GDP and the inflation issue that we have today? 

</span></div>
<div><span>I am aware that there will be an increase in prices for all our imports into the country in the future, 

possibly in April, perhaps you can explain on these issues?  Thank you. 

</span></div>
