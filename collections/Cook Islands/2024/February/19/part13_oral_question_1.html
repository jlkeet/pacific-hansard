<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone in the Chamber 

this morning, our Members of Parliament and especially to our special guests in the Public Gallery. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question this morning is to the Honourable Member of Murienua and because he is not here 

today, I will direct the question to the Honourable Tim Varu.  Before I ask this question, I would 

like to give the background first so you will know about the context of the question I am going to 

ask. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now the question I am going to ask is in regards to the rocks of metals used for sealing the roads 

at Blackrock.  I am especially referring to the metal that are on the road that is rusting away in the 

public area, not a good sight especially for our tourists or visitors coming to our island. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question here is, will you be able to do something about these rusting metals near the roads 

and public area, if you would like my help I will come in and help you because this area is in your 

constituency.  This is not to criticise you but to help you keep our island clean and nice for our 

people and our visitors. 

</span></div>
