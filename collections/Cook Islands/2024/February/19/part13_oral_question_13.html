<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for 

that very good question.  Before I come back to you let me just echo my appreciation also to our 

friends from Western Australia for the gifts that you have provided.  As Minister of Foreign Affairs 

and Immigration, I am very pleased because this really reflects the closer ties between our country 

and your country.  And it reflects the ongoing commitment to support each other in everything that 

we do.  If I may say, Australia has always been there with the Cook Islands for over some years 

as  you would find out tomorrow with the Defence Policy which supports our Parliament.  The 

</span><span>changeable benefits that we see before our eyes clearly shows Australiaâ€™s commitment.  Unlike</span><span>

our other friends, there is too much hot air.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Referring back to the question before the House, as the question raises a lot of important issues 

and some legal matters that needs to be addressed, if I may ask for this House to allow me some 

time to talk with the staff responsible to try and resolve these issues.  As highlighted by the Leader 

of  the  Opposition,  there  is  a  need  to  clearly  articulate  and  identify  the  responsibilities  of  the 

primary employer verses the secondary employer. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To ensure the rights of the employers and the rights of the employees are recognised and protected.  

</span><span>If the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me, I will come back at the next Sitting, if not, I may 

</span><span>have to contact them so that we can both discuss these issues and have them resolved ourselves. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; 

</span><span>you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana everyone, staff of Parliament who 

have served our people, and our friends in the Public Gallery, good morning.

<div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, my question goes out to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, my dear Aunty 

Tina Browne.  Mr Speaker, I was just wondering if the Honourable Member can confirm to the 

House and to our people listening whether she as Leader of the Opposition, being a recipient of 

the new EV vehicles that the Government procured some time ago.
