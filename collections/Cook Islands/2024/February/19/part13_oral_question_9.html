<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you also to the Honourable Member of 

Matavera, the doctor for money on the Opposition side, for your question this morning. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The answer to your question will be open to you in our Supplementary Budget.  I also point out in 

</span><span>response to this question that we consider the prices of goods that are increasing.  We are well 

aware that inflation is impacting on our price of goods and the price of imported goods in particular 

</span><span>into our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Inflation into our country is important.  To service our 165,000 tourist that visit our country which 

</span><span>is close to 10 times our resident population.  Local companies, local people import up to two $200 

million worth of goods and services from New Zealand in particular.  These includes food, frozen 

foods, dry goods, timber, building materials, vehicles, tools and machinery.  All the things that 

help us live to a standard of living that our people now demand.

<div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, when the price of those things overseas goes up, the price goes up when we bring it into our 

country as well.  And the way to beat inflation is to make more money and you spoke about the 

GDP.  We have to keep our GDP moving up so we can afford to pay for these things that we bring 

into our country.  But there are some things we can do to avoid being impacted by GDP and these 

are things that many of us are very good at but maybe some of us has been a bit too lazy to do it 

and that is to grow our own food.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Our locally produced produce, food, meat, chicken, fish are products that do not attract the impacts 

of  inflation.    So,  one  of  the  things  to  do  is  eat  more  local  fruit  instead  of  going  and  buying 

something from the shop.  Plant taro, plant rukau, bananas, pawpaws and more, they produce all 

the time.  Our forefathers knew this life.  If we cannot afford to buy a can of corned beef, the pot 

will be filled with breadfruit.  When we were kids, we would have eight breadfruit in a pot and 

only one corned beef.  But it has changed, today it is the opposite.  But these are little things that 

</span><span>each household can do to help combat the impacts of inflation.  Inflation is a reality for us.  The 

</span><span>biggest one was in fuel that we saw just a couple of years ago.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, to answer the question from the Member from Matavera, our strategy is to grow the economy 

but not just to grow the economy but to also diversify the economy.  Not also to diversify but to 

also bring in all of our outer islands into the economy.   The over half a billion-dollar economy 

that we have today is largely generated on Rarotonga and to a lesser extent, Aitutaki.  We need to 

include  and  increase  the  contributions  from  islands  like  Mangaia  and  Nga-Pu-Toru  and  the 

Northern Group.   But  to do that, we need to  put the infrastructure in  place on these islands so 

transportation link is important.  Energy is important for power and access to labour or machinery 

on our islands is very important especially if we want to bring them in to be part of our economy.  

And that is how we look to grow our economy and help combat the impacts of inflation.  I was 

going  to  say  Climate  Change  Mr  Speaker  but  do  not  get  me  sided  on  that  we  will  be  here  for 

another half an hour.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
