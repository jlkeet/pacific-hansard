<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have come to Question Time for 30 minutes.  I now open the Floor to 

Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Minister George Angene. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone in the Chamber 

this morning, our Members of Parliament and especially to our special guests in the Public Gallery. 

</span></div><div><span>My question this morning is to the Honourable Member of Murienua and because he is not here 

today, I will direct the question to the Honourable Tim Varu.  Before I ask this question, I would 

like to give the background first so you will know about the context of the question I am going to 

ask. 

</span></div><div><span>Now the question I am going to ask is in regards to the rocks of metals used for sealing the roads 

at Blackrock.  I am especially referring to the metal that are on the road that is rusting away in the 

public area, not a good sight especially for our tourists or visitors coming to our island. 

</span></div><div><span>The question here is, will you be able to do something about these rusting metals near the roads 

and public area, if you would like my help I will come in and help you because this area is in your 

constituency.  This is not to criticise you but to help you keep our island clean and nice for our 

people and our visitors. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Timi Varu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member for Tupapa for your question.  I am surprised at 

</span><span>your  question  and  it  is  a  good  question  because  I  am  aware  of  the  rusting  metals  that  you  are 

</span><span>referring to.  These metals existed since the time of the Honourable William Smiley Heather.  I 

</span><span>was part of the men that put these metal rods in place. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe to respond to your question, I would like to request for a space of time for me to look into 

this issue and find ways to resolve this matter.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa and you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to ask for a short time to convey words of 

appreciation.  First of all, I wish to convey my congratulations to the Member of Pukapuka/Nassau 

because you have been honoured as a Cabinet Minister for our nation today.  I want to pledge my 

support to the Minister to work with him for our people of Pukapuka/Nassau. 

</span></div><div><span>My  second  thought  Mr  Speaker,  is  another  congratulations  to  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Avatiu/Ruatonga/Panama, Honourable Albert Nicholas for his appointment as the Deputy Prime 

Minister of our nation.  I also pledge my support to our new Deputy Prime Minister for all the 

work that government is doing for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, can you ask your question please? 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  My question is to the Prime Minister.  Mr Speaker, we are aware of the GDP and 

have heard that the GDP has sky-rocketed and our country is supported by the GDP. 

</span></div><div><span>My  question  is  in  regards  to  “inflation”.  </span><span>  Inflation  in  our  country  is  increasing.    What  is  the 

government doing to resolve this issue with the GDP and the inflation issue that we have today? 

</span></div><div><span>I am aware that there will be an increase in prices for all our imports into the country in the future, 

possibly in April, perhaps you can explain on these issues?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you also to the Honourable Member of 

Matavera, the doctor for money on the Opposition side, for your question this morning. 

</span></div><div><span>The answer to your question will be open to you in our Supplementary Budget.  I also point out in 

</span><span>response to this question that we consider the prices of goods that are increasing.  We are well 

aware that inflation is impacting on our price of goods and the price of imported goods in particular 

</span><span>into our country. 

</span></div><div><span>Inflation into our country is important.  To service our 165,000 tourist that visit our country which 

</span><span>is close to 10 times our resident population.  Local companies, local people import up to two $200 

million worth of goods and services from New Zealand in particular.  These includes food, frozen 

foods, dry goods, timber, building materials, vehicles, tools and machinery.  All the things that 

help us live to a standard of living that our people now demand.

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So, when the price of those things overseas goes up, the price goes up when we bring it into our 

country as well.  And the way to beat inflation is to make more money and you spoke about the 

GDP.  We have to keep our GDP moving up so we can afford to pay for these things that we bring 

into our country.  But there are some things we can do to avoid being impacted by GDP and these 

are things that many of us are very good at but maybe some of us has been a bit too lazy to do it 

and that is to grow our own food.  

</span></div><div><span>Our locally produced produce, food, meat, chicken, fish are products that do not attract the impacts 

of  inflation.    So,  one  of  the  things  to  do  is  eat  more  local  fruit  instead  of  going  and  buying 

something from the shop.  Plant taro, plant rukau, bananas, pawpaws and more, they produce all 

the time.  Our forefathers knew this life.  If we cannot afford to buy a can of corned beef, the pot 

will be filled with breadfruit.  When we were kids, we would have eight breadfruit in a pot and 

only one corned beef.  But it has changed, today it is the opposite.  But these are little things that 

</span><span>each household can do to help combat the impacts of inflation.  Inflation is a reality for us.  The 

</span><span>biggest one was in fuel that we saw just a couple of years ago.   

</span></div><div><span>So, to answer the question from the Member from Matavera, our strategy is to grow the economy 

but not just to grow the economy but to also diversify the economy.  Not also to diversify but to 

also bring in all of our outer islands into the economy.   The over half a billion-dollar economy 

that we have today is largely generated on Rarotonga and to a lesser extent, Aitutaki.  We need to 

include  and  increase  the  contributions  from  islands  like  Mangaia  and  Nga-Pu-Toru  and  the 

Northern Group.   But  to do that, we need to  put the infrastructure in  place on these islands so 

transportation link is important.  Energy is important for power and access to labour or machinery 

on our islands is very important especially if we want to bring them in to be part of our economy.  

And that is how we look to grow our economy and help combat the impacts of inflation.  I was 

going  to  say  Climate  Change  Mr  Speaker  but  do  not  get  me  sided  on  that  we  will  be  here  for 

another half an hour.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Leader of the Opposition, the 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker,  Prime  Minister  and  your  Cabinet, 

Members of Parliament of the House, Kia Orana to us all this morning.   Kia Orana also to the 

</span><span>Delegation from Australia and thank you for such a fine gift but you will notice the colour of those 

</span><span>tables and this one do not match.  So, you might make another trip soon to make these colours all 

</span><span>match.  I have a question for the Minister of Immigration, the new Minister of Immigration.  

</span></div><div><span>A few weeks back there was a Letter to the Editor by Elena Tavioni who was complaining about 

</span><span>foreign workers.  She was not complaining about the worker, in fact she was complaining about 

other employers that were cherry picking and taking advantage of workers and the reason why she 

</span></div><div><span>475 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>was  complaining  was  because  the  onus  is  on  the  main  employer  to  look  after,  to  pay  all  the 

expenses for foreign workers.  I had a reason to go to the Immigration Office about a week ago 

and to renew a two year contract not to renew, to pay the yearly amount for a two year contract.  I 

was advised by the Immigration Officer to change the terms of the contract between the employer 

and the employee.   

</span></div><div><span>I have two questions for you Minister.  One is, what are we doing to protect our local employer 

the  main  employer  of  foreign  workers?    My  second  question  is,  what  authority  does  the 

Immigration  Officer  have  to  make  an  employer  and  employee  amend  their  contractual 

relationship?  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the new Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for 

that very good question.  Before I come back to you let me just echo my appreciation also to our 

friends from Western Australia for the gifts that you have provided.  As Minister of Foreign Affairs 

and Immigration, I am very pleased because this really reflects the closer ties between our country 

and your country.  And it reflects the ongoing commitment to support each other in everything that 

we do.  If I may say, Australia has always been there with the Cook Islands for over some years 

as  you would find out tomorrow with the Defence Policy which supports our Parliament.  The 

</span><span>changeable benefits that we see before our eyes clearly shows Australia’s commitment.  Unlike</span><span>

our other friends, there is too much hot air.   

</span></div><div><span>Referring back to the question before the House, as the question raises a lot of important issues 

and some legal matters that needs to be addressed, if I may ask for this House to allow me some 

time to talk with the staff responsible to try and resolve these issues.  As highlighted by the Leader 

of  the  Opposition,  there  is  a  need  to  clearly  articulate  and  identify  the  responsibilities  of  the 

primary employer verses the secondary employer. 

</span></div><div><span>To ensure the rights of the employers and the rights of the employees are recognised and protected.  

</span><span>If the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me, I will come back at the next Sitting, if not, I may 

</span><span>have to contact them so that we can both discuss these issues and have them resolved ourselves. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; 

</span><span>you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana everyone, staff of Parliament who 

have served our people, and our friends in the Public Gallery, good morning.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my question goes out to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, my dear Aunty 

Tina Browne.  Mr Speaker, I was just wondering if the Honourable Member can confirm to the 

House and to our people listening whether she as Leader of the Opposition, being a recipient of 

the new EV vehicles that the Government procured some time ago. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, our time is up, however, you will receive 

your answer at our next Sitting. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Oh no my answer will be quick, either yes or no. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have come to the end of our Question Time, thank you so much. 

</span></div><div><span>Before we proceed, I would like to acknowledge one of our local Chiefs in the House, Chief Pa 

who is here with us, welcome to Parliament.  Additionally, the Secretary of Finance who is present 

in the Public Gallery including other members, welcome and thank you for joining us today.
