<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Clerk.  That completes the First, Second and Third Reading of the 

Seabed Minerals Amendment Bill 2024. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now move to our final Bill, the Cook Islands Immigration Amendment Bill 2024.  I call 

the Honourable Prime Minister for the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration, 

I am privileged and humbled to introduce and move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Cook Islands Immigration Amendment Bill 2024  

be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member, Tukaka Ama 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill.  I 

see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Firstly,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  new  Minister 

</span><span>Responsible  for  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Immigration.    I  can  see  the  Head  of 

</span><span>Department for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration in the Public Gallery.  On top of 

that, Mr Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the staff from the Seabed Mining department for 

being here with us to listen to their Bill that we had just passed.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, referring back to the Bill before us, I mean we do not have enough time because our 

women Parliamentarians will be leaving us very shortly for the airport.  They have about half an 

hour left before their check-in opens for their flight to New Zealand.   

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the Cook Islands Immigration Amendment Bill 2024, there is a Section inside this Bill 

that requires our support, and that is Sub Section 227.  Furthermore, there are also other sections 

that  requires  strengthening  in  the  Act  administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and 

Immigration.  There is a section in this Act that explains the work of Immigration when they are 

out monitoring for shipping vessels within our zone, which requires them to go out. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  Opposition  side  supports  these  implementations.    I  believe  that  the  ones 

responsible for this work should not be going without being paid.  I am speaking regarding Sections 

227 to 250.  We need to strengthen these Sections.  I will intend not to cover every single one of 

</span><span>these Sections because we are running out of time.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, all of us Members on this side, we support the Bill presented before this 

House.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see, Honourable Member that this is your 

third time commending the Honourable Minister; I can see that you two are friends now.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I also would like to thank the Members of the 

Opposition for their support for this Bill to go through this Parliament.  I understand that they have 

given their serious consideration and they all recognise the need and the importance of this very 

important Bill to proceed through this Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have a 100 page speech prepared for me by my staff and I feel sorry for our women 

members, they are going to miss their flight but in the spirit of cooperation and working together 

</span><span>as shown by the Members of the Opposition, I am going to limit it to two paragraphs. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as it is obvious to everybody in this House, the purpose of this Bill is to enable the 

</span><span>Crown  through  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Immigration  to  recover  from  international 

</span><span>carriers the cost of immigration officers attending to the arrival and departures of crafts.  As we all 

</span><span>know it is a necessity to have immigration officers at our airport and seaport to vet those entering 

</span><span>and departing from our shores. 

</span></div><div><span>And  also,  this  Amendment  Bill  will  support  the  modernisation  recapitulation  process  by 

empowering MFAI to recover from international carriers the cost of immigration officers attending

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>the arrival and departure of crafts; in the same manner that custom officers also recover under their 

own legislations.   

</span></div><div><span>I am thankful to the support of this House and also would like to thank the Secretary of the Ministry 

of  Foreign  Affairs,  Ms  Tepaeru  Herman,  who  is  present  in  this  House  and  also  the  Principal 

Immigration Officer, Ms Chere Arthur and also from the three of us to thank the Crown Law Office 

and the PCO office in New Zealand for their support in ensuring that this important Bill arrived 

into this House today. 

</span></div><div><span>I commend the Bill to the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister  and  all  the  Honourable  Members  for  your 

support to this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion for the Second Reading of the Bill be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK:  </span><span>Short Title: Cook Islands Immigration Amendment Bill 2024.
