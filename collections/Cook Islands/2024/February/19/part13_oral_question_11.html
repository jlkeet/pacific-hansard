<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker,  Prime  Minister  and  your  Cabinet, 

Members of Parliament of the House, Kia Orana to us all this morning.   Kia Orana also to the 

</span><span>Delegation from Australia and thank you for such a fine gift but you will notice the colour of those 

</span><span>tables and this one do not match.  So, you might make another trip soon to make these colours all 

</span><span>match.  I have a question for the Minister of Immigration, the new Minister of Immigration.

</span></div>
<div><span>was  complaining  was  because  the  onus  is  on  the  main  employer  to  look  after,  to  pay  all  the 

expenses for foreign workers.  I had a reason to go to the Immigration Office about a week ago 

and to renew a two year contract not to renew, to pay the yearly amount for a two year contract.  I 

was advised by the Immigration Officer to change the terms of the contract between the employer 

and the employee.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I have two questions for you Minister.  One is, what are we doing to protect our local employer 

the  main  employer  of  foreign  workers?    My  second  question  is,  what  authority  does  the 

Immigration  Officer  have  to  make  an  employer  and  employee  amend  their  contractual 

relationship?
