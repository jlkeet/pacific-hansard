<h3>Oral Question 17</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  My question will not go to the Deputy Prime 

Minister or to the Assistant to the Prime Minister, but to the Prime Minister himself.  Honourable 

Prime Minister, my question is, I will go straight to my question Mr Speaker.  Can you provide an 

update on the Avaroa Cable?  Honourable Prime Minister, you can see that Star-link is getting 

popular in our country, therefore my question is, what is the update with the Avaroa Cable?  Thank 

you very much. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  Prime Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member.  The Avaroa Cable 

as we all know is a subsidiary of the Manatua Cable.  Of course, we know the Manatua Cable is a 

consortium  owned  by  Cook  Islands/Samoa/French  Polynesia  and  Niue.    The  Avaroa  Cable  is 

operating  at  a  100  percent  capability,  in  fact  we  have  more  bandwidth  than  is  being  currently 

utilised.  But it is up to the service provider like Vodafone Cook Islands and any other business 

that would like to have access to the cable, it is up to them to purchase what they need from Avaroa 

</span><span>Cables.  It is not just Vodafone that now provides internet services since we passed our Telecoms 

Act a number of years ago, we have now different companies that now provide internet service 

and there is competition in the market.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Of course, we have new entrance for internet in the market like Star-link.  The good thing about 

</span><span>Avaroa Cable is the quality of connection and the speed of connection.  From what I have been 

told, it is still the preferred means of connection to the internet.  However, companies that are now 

buying the bandwidth from Avaroa and then passing it along to the consumers, it is up to them to 

determine what speed that the household or the consumer will receive that cable.  And that is the 

</span><span>nature of the competition Mr Speaker, is to have companies try to compete for customers, they 

</span><span>have to compete on quality, on price and on service.  If the companies providing a better service, 

then another company or better price than another company, then of course customers will move.
