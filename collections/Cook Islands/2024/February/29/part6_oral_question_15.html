<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in this Honourable House 

from the Leader of the nation extending to the workers in this House.  Mr Speaker, my question is 

directed  to  the  Prime  Minister  the  Honourable  Mark  Brown.    If  I  may  be  bold  to  give  a  brief 

overview before I ask my question.  

</span></div>
<div><span>As of today in New Zealand, the New Zealand Tyre Stewardship fee will be introduced.  All tyre 

imports into New Zealand will be taxed.  Exporters out of New Zealand who regularly export to 

the Pacific Islands has been trying to lobby the New Zealand government for exemptions or rebates 

but to no avail.  The problem here is we have just under 17,000 vehicles in the Cook Islands.  And 

increase for motor cycle tyres of 21 percent to the higher end of 51 percent for a bus, truck and 

loader  tyres.    So,  this  will  hugely  impact  not  just  government,  our  tourism  industry,  the  rental 

operators and private businesses.  So, there is two parts to my question.  If government aware of 

this  levy  and  secondly  is  there  a  way  that  government  can  lessen  the  impact  or  mitigating 

</span><span>circumstances regarding the importation of tyres?  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you to the Honourable Member.  The short answer is I am not aware 

of it but I am reading about it now on my computer and I believe the reason why the levy is being 

imposed by the government is to try and address the issue of the disposal of these tyres when they 

have reached the end of their life.  If what the Honourable Member says is correct that there is no 

</span><span>opportunity for rebate for tyres that are exported to the Cook Islands, it means those costs will be 

</span><span>passed onto the buyers of those tyres here.  I am looking here the assessment of the levy is based 

on the weight of the tyre.  So, the bigger the tyre, the more expensive the levy.

<div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our Ministry of Finance has been in the process Mr Speaker of looking at applying some sort of 

levy on goods that are imported into the country as a means of building up a small pool of funds 

to enable these waste products to be returned back to where they came from.  This includes things 

like cars, batteries, tyres, whiteware, computers and so forth.  This has not been implemented yet 

because  we  are  still  working  on  what  would  be  the  economic  implications  on  business  and 

consumers.  But this is I guess a law that is being passed by the New Zealand government.  The 

first step for our government to do is to approach the New Zealand government through our formal 

channels to see if there is a possibility of introducing a type of rebate similar to the exemption of 

VAT of products that are imported into our country on exports so that we are no applying the same 

tax twice on the same products.  

</span></div>
<div><span>This is a matter that has been brought to my attention, I thank the Member for that and it is certainly 

something that now we will have to take into consideration.  Thank you.
