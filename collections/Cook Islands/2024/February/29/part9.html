</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  I just want to thank the Prime Minister for clarifying that and of 

course I was alerted to this yesterday, when we sort clarification from the Chair and overnight, I 

have had the opportunity to go through page 9 and 11 of the Amendment booklets and was able to 

work out the carry forwards. 

</span></div><div><span>I  support  this  Vote  Item,  we  know  that  there  has  been  a  number  of  reviews,  reports  done  on 

Corrective Services and we know that some of those reports recommended some major structural 

</span><span>improvements to our facility.  And given our financial situation in the last four years that hasn’t 

</span><span>been possible.  And we have also heard that sometimes our inmates are not receiving nutritious 

meals.  And I am all in favour of providing funds to assist this Ministry to improve the standard of 

our facility and the delivering of its services.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That sum of $1,832,137 for the  

Ministry of Corrective Services stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
