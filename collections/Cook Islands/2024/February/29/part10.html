<div><span>CROWN LAW: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,662,167 for  

Crown Law stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  I take it Prime Minister; this is also a $50,000 carry forward.  

Mr Speaker, yesterday I mentioned a few ministries that I think that are really important to assist 

with their governance of our country.  Crown Law is one of them. 

</span></div><div><span>And why, because Crown Law is the one that drafts legislation that is then sent to Wellington and 

back.  And we know that Crown Law has been under resourced.  Not only under resourced but as 

we heard or the Public Accounts Committee hea</span><span>rd from the Solicitor General it hasnâ€™t been easy 

</span><span>to employ new lawyers. 

</span></div><div><span>And  so,  any  funding  that  goes  to  Crown  Law  office  will  have  my  support.    Yes,  the  Solicitor 

General did indicate to the Public Accounts Committee that they are functioning, if I recall on 11 

when in fact, they should be looking at 16 or something in that area.  And so, what it tells us, that 

</span><span>if we want the speed of legislation to be improved then we should resource the Crown Law, so that 

</span><span>they are able to carry out these duties. 

</span></div><div><span>And we support this Vote Item.

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Minister, Tingika 

Elikana and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I stand not as Minister of the Crown Law Office but I thought 

it is important that I make some comments on this Vote Item. 

I stand in agreement with the Leader of the Opposition with the comments she made regarding this 

very important  office.  As she allured to  as part of the PAC inquiries, we were advised by the 

Solicitor General of the difficulties that this office is facing. 

</span></div><div><span>Not only with its operations but also with the required human resources to deliver on their outputs.  

While we are discussing on a Supplementary Appropriation Bill I thought it is probably better to 

alert particularly our Ministers and Ministries in considering priorities for the next budget.  To be 

really focused to what are the necessary priorities for your Ministries and to enable the diversion 

of necessary  resources to this very important office so that they can be in a position to  recruit 

necessary skills required for it to function properly.  As we all know they are finding it difficult to 

recruit staff at the moment.  Because of that we are all aware of the difficulties of meeting our 

legislative programmes because of the lack of resources.  

</span></div><div><span>So, my plea to the Ministers and Ministries as we look into our next budget to please look carefully 

so that we do not tie down resources unnecessarily so that can be freed up and so it can be diverted 

to this very important office, also like the Audit and Parliamentary Services. With those comments 

Mr Speaker, I support the Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,662,167 for  

Crown Law stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
