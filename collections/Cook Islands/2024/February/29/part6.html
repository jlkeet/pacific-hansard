<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Members,  we  have  now  come  to  Question  Time  and  that  will  be  for  30  minutes.  

Before any of you raise any questions regarding this change, it has been sorted already between 

the Leaders of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I open the Floor to Honourable Members, there is one outstanding question from our last 

meeting  on  19  February.    The  question  is  from  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to 

Minister Tingika Elikana relating to foreign workers in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I can see that there are two questions and the first question is, what are we doing to protect the 

main employer of foreign workers?   

</span></div><div><span>The second question is, what authority does the Immigration Officer have to make an employer 

and employee amend their contractual relationship? 

</span></div><div><span>I  can  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Tingika  Elikana  and  I  believe  that  you  can  execute  both 

questions within one answer. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In response to the first question, the advice is that 

foreign employees come into this country either under sponsorship or direct sponsorship by their 

employer.  As a result of that their primary obligation is to their sponsor or their primary employer. 

</span></div><div><span>And the relationship between the employer and the foreign employee is govern by agreements or 

contract of employment between those two parties.  I think in respect of that part it is very clear 

that the employee is obliged to the sponsor or primary employer.   

</span></div><div><span>And since that relationship is govern by arrangements or contract of employment then it is up to 

both parties to exercise their rights under those agreements or contract of employment.   

</span></div><div><span>But  I take  from  the  Leader of the Opposition’s  question  </span><span>raised in  this House is  the concern as 

</span><span>raised  by  the  letter  writer  to  the  Cook  Islands  newspaper  is  where  the  foreign  employees  are 

employed by a secondary employer.  And what protections are afforded to the sponsor or primary 

employer. 

</span></div><div><span>The short answer to that is, it is up to the sponsor or the primary employer to see whether he or 

</span><span>she will allow the foreign worker to work for another person or a secondary employer.  And where 

that should occur, I implore on the sponsor or primary employer to relook at the agreements or 

contract of employment.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So, that new relationship is govern by some form of agreement or a new or variations of the original 

contract of employment. 

</span></div><div><span>The policy introduced by  the  Immigration Department  because of the shortage of  employee  of 

labour is to encourage employee to take up secondary employment but subject to the consent of 

their sponsor or primary employer. Because it is important for the sponsor or the primary employer 

to  protect  themselves  should  anything  happen  during  the  secondary  employment  relationship.  

Where there are injuries sustain as a result of the secondary employment relationship then the new 

agreement or varied contract of employment should address those issues. 

</span></div><div><span>In relations to the second question, whether it is the duty of the Immigration officers to advise 

employers and employees what terms to include in their contract of employment.  The short answer 

to that is, it is not the place for Immigration officers to advise employment relationship. 

</span></div><div><span>And I invite the Leader of the Opposition to contact the Principal Immigration Officer as I take 

this as a very serious matter.  That is the advice given from any Ministry should be in accordance 

with the legal framework.  As it involves staff of the Immigration Department, I invite the Leader 

</span><span>of the Opposition to talk to the Principal Immigration Officer.  So, that we don’t reveal the identity 

</span><span>of the officer involve which she has dealt with, I think that should be a private matter between her 

and the staff. 

</span></div><div><span>I hope that answers the question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>   Thank  you, Honourable Minister.  Yesterday the Honourable Minister Rose 

Brown  also  requested  for  additional  time  to  respond  to  the  question  raised  by  the  Honourable 

Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Clerk of 

Parliament  and  all  the  staff  of  Parliament  and  to  all  the  Honourable  Members  of  the  House.  

Greetings to all our people listening and watching live to this Sitting. 

</span></div><div><span>In a short response to the question raised by the Honourable Member from Matavera.  Whether a 

Committee has been appointed in accordance to the legislation for the Ministry of Agriculture that 

</span><span>was enacted in 2021? 

</span></div><div><span>Yes, a Committee was appointed in accordance with the legislation in 2022 and the Chair of the 

Committee is Lafala Turepu.  I believe that I have answered your question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Mokoroa, who is going to answer the question to the Member Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Good afternoon to you and to all your staff.  

</span><span>Before I can continue to respond to the question from the Member from Matavera may I take this 

</span><span>opportunity to congratulate all the 140 recipients </span><span>of their certificate and award in this morning’s 

</span><span>graduation.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Today,  the  graduates  have  received  certificate  in  15  distinct  vocational  programs,  which  range 

from  diploma  in  teaching,  sports  and  hospitality,  electrical  engineering,  building  construction, 

plumbing, business and management courses.  Our heartfelt congratulations to all 140 graduates. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the pass rate of 18 percent that was mentioned by the Member, I have received more 

clarification from the Ministry, yesterday evening.  This 18 percent is the aggregate total of New 

Zealand and all of its realm countries which includes us in the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. 

</span></div><div><span>Our statistic for 2023 from the Ministry indicated that in level 3 we have a 76 percent and in level 

2 we have a 75 percent and in level 1 we have a 62 percent pass.  If you remember I mentioned 

yesterday that the Prime Minister of New Zealand set his pass rate at 80 percent.  We would like 

to  set  our  pass  rate  to  achieve  80  percent  as  well.    Mr  Speaker,  having  addressed  these 

misconceptions  I  would  like  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  strategies  and  considerations  being 

undertaken by the Ministry of Education. Considering the long term strategies, the Ministry has 

embarked on developing a new Education Master Plan which is supported by ADB.  This Master 

Plan  aims  to  reset  the  education  system  placing  a  strong  emphasis  on  the  first  seven  years 

encompassing Early Child Education and the Early Primary years.  Extensive research underscores 

the  critical  importance  of  this  formative  year</span><span>s  in  a  child’s  educational  outcomes  and  brain 

</span><span>development.    This  will  lead  to  improved  educational  performance  in  the  longer  term  as  these 

students enter secondary education and NCEA. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKR:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  yesterday  you  reprimanded  the  Members  of 

Parliament with regard to question and answers.  The message that you delivered yesterday was 

that the question must be concise and similarly the answer must be concise.   When I heard the 

Minister Vaine Mokoroa, it is hard to interpret his answer as being concise.  And the Standing 

Order is 244. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you for  your Point of Order.  But to me, the answer provided by the 

Honourable Minister was concise; you may continue Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  If I have heard the question rightly the question 

from  the  Opposition  is what  strategies  is  the  Ministry  of  Education  trying  to  improve  from  18 

</span><span>percent to 80 percent?  The key term is strategies.  So, I have to list those strategies otherwise I 

would not have answered the question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You have to advise your new Secretary to make a booklet on all those strategies 

</span><span>and hand it over to all the Members of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker, I will ask him to do that.  So, in continuing Mr 

Speaker,  other  areas  that  the  Ministry  will  look  at  will  be  the  curriculum  which  is  embracing

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>technology for educational opportunities across the country.  This is improving data utilisation for 

monitoring student progress as key components of the Master Plan.  The Ministry further aims to 

improve pass rates across various NCEA levels by maintaining a closer relationship with NZQA 

and Ministry of Education of New Zealand by continuing professional development of upskilling 

of staff in secondary schools with changes in the programme. Mostly importantly improving the 

exposure for learners that they can efficiently complete their examinations on the NCEA digital 

platform. We will also encourage parental engagement and fostering a culture shift within schools 

is also essential. Remedial and catch up programmes along with coaching initiative for students 

will be considered. Immediate efforts are also being made to raise internet capability standards 

including the purchase of Star-link technology.   

</span></div><div><span>So,  Mr  Speaker  while  challenges  may  persist  these  strategies  collectively  aim  to  bring  about 

sustained improvement in the Cook Islands education system.  And I hope I have answered the 

</span><span>Member of Matavera’s question very clearly. Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Can I ask the Honourable Vaitoti to sit down 

please?  Yesterday I told the House that the Honourable Robert Heather should be given the first 

opportunity to raise his question.  But sadly and I apologise, I leave you to the end.  Honourable 

Member; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in this Honourable House 

from the Leader of the nation extending to the workers in this House.  Mr Speaker, my question is 

directed  to  the  Prime  Minister  the  Honourable  Mark  Brown.    If  I  may  be  bold  to  give  a  brief 

overview before I ask my question.  

</span></div><div><span>As of today in New Zealand, the New Zealand Tyre Stewardship fee will be introduced.  All tyre 

imports into New Zealand will be taxed.  Exporters out of New Zealand who regularly export to 

the Pacific Islands has been trying to lobby the New Zealand government for exemptions or rebates 

but to no avail.  The problem here is we have just under 17,000 vehicles in the Cook Islands.  And 

increase for motor cycle tyres of 21 percent to the higher end of 51 percent for a bus, truck and 

loader  tyres.    So,  this  will  hugely  impact  not  just  government,  our  tourism  industry,  the  rental 

operators and private businesses.  So, there is two parts to my question.  If government aware of 

this  levy  and  secondly  is  there  a  way  that  government  can  lessen  the  impact  or  mitigating 

</span><span>circumstances regarding the importation of tyres?  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you to the Honourable Member.  The short answer is I am not aware 

of it but I am reading about it now on my computer and I believe the reason why the levy is being 

imposed by the government is to try and address the issue of the disposal of these tyres when they 

have reached the end of their life.  If what the Honourable Member says is correct that there is no 

</span><span>opportunity for rebate for tyres that are exported to the Cook Islands, it means those costs will be 

</span><span>passed onto the buyers of those tyres here.  I am looking here the assessment of the levy is based 

on the weight of the tyre.  So, the bigger the tyre, the more expensive the levy.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our Ministry of Finance has been in the process Mr Speaker of looking at applying some sort of 

levy on goods that are imported into the country as a means of building up a small pool of funds 

to enable these waste products to be returned back to where they came from.  This includes things 

like cars, batteries, tyres, whiteware, computers and so forth.  This has not been implemented yet 

because  we  are  still  working  on  what  would  be  the  economic  implications  on  business  and 

consumers.  But this is I guess a law that is being passed by the New Zealand government.  The 

first step for our government to do is to approach the New Zealand government through our formal 

channels to see if there is a possibility of introducing a type of rebate similar to the exemption of 

VAT of products that are imported into our country on exports so that we are no applying the same 

tax twice on the same products.  

</span></div><div><span>This is a matter that has been brought to my attention, I thank the Member for that and it is certainly 

something that now we will have to take into consideration.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have four minutes.  If you go beyond that, that means that you will get your reply on 15</span><span>th</span><span> May 

2024.  

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  My question will not go to the Deputy Prime 

Minister or to the Assistant to the Prime Minister, but to the Prime Minister himself.  Honourable 

Prime Minister, my question is, I will go straight to my question Mr Speaker.  Can you provide an 

update on the Avaroa Cable?  Honourable Prime Minister, you can see that Star-link is getting 

popular in our country, therefore my question is, what is the update with the Avaroa Cable?  Thank 

you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  Prime Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member.  The Avaroa Cable 

as we all know is a subsidiary of the Manatua Cable.  Of course, we know the Manatua Cable is a 

consortium  owned  by  Cook  Islands/Samoa/French  Polynesia  and  Niue.    The  Avaroa  Cable  is 

operating  at  a  100  percent  capability,  in  fact  we  have  more  bandwidth  than  is  being  currently 

utilised.  But it is up to the service provider like Vodafone Cook Islands and any other business 

that would like to have access to the cable, it is up to them to purchase what they need from Avaroa 

</span><span>Cables.  It is not just Vodafone that now provides internet services since we passed our Telecoms 

Act a number of years ago, we have now different companies that now provide internet service 

and there is competition in the market.   

</span></div><div><span>Of course, we have new entrance for internet in the market like Star-link.  The good thing about 

</span><span>Avaroa Cable is the quality of connection and the speed of connection.  From what I have been 

told, it is still the preferred means of connection to the internet.  However, companies that are now 

buying the bandwidth from Avaroa and then passing it along to the consumers, it is up to them to 

determine what speed that the household or the consumer will receive that cable.  And that is the 

</span><span>nature of the competition Mr Speaker, is to have companies try to compete for customers, they 

</span><span>have to compete on quality, on price and on service.  If the companies providing a better service, 

then another company or better price than another company, then of course customers will move.

performance of our Avaroa Cable Company is doing very well.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I extended your time just to stop the 

thinking behind the operation of Star-link.
