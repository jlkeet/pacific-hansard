monitoring student progress as key components of the Master Plan.  The Ministry further aims to 

improve pass rates across various NCEA levels by maintaining a closer relationship with NZQA 

and Ministry of Education of New Zealand by continuing professional development of upskilling 

of staff in secondary schools with changes in the programme. Mostly importantly improving the 

exposure for learners that they can efficiently complete their examinations on the NCEA digital 

platform. We will also encourage parental engagement and fostering a culture shift within schools 

is also essential. Remedial and catch up programmes along with coaching initiative for students 

will be considered. Immediate efforts are also being made to raise internet capability standards 

including the purchase of Star-link technology.

<div><span>So,  Mr  Speaker  while  challenges  may  persist  these  strategies  collectively  aim  to  bring  about 

sustained improvement in the Cook Islands education system.  And I hope I have answered the 

</span><span>Member of Mataveraâ€™s question very clearly. Thank you.</span></div>
