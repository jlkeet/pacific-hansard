</span></div><div><span>MR.V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to give my support to the allocation give to the 

</span><span>Ministry  of  Culture  because  Mr  Speaker  this  amount  is  approved  from  Parliament  and  will  be 

</span><span>under the running of the Ministry of Culture.  That is the reason why I give my support because 

this allocation will also go and support the House of Ariki too.

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  George 

Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  To all of us in the House greetings.  The spirit of 

this  appropriation  Honourable  Speaker  is  to  go  in  support  the  cultural  development.    This 

allocation was requested to improve and to support the Maire Maeva Nui celebrations that is ahead 

of us.  On top of that is the troupe that I as the Minister will take to Hawaii in June of this year. I 

would also like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister for agreeing to accompany me on the trip 

because there  are  certain places where speeches  will be made and he is  the appropriate person 

because my english vocabulary is very limited.  But I have forgotten that this island speaks their 

own language and I the Honourable Prime Minister speaks Hawaiian too.  

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker and Members of the House, I stand in support of this appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $2,199,671 for the 

Ministry of Culture stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
