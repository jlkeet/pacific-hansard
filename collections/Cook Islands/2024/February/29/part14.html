</span></div><div><span>I put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $495,600 for  

</span><span>Financial Services Development Authority stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>I seek for some clarification because when we resumed this afternoon, we 

dealt with the Vote Item for PERCA, followed by Corrective Services.  If that is true, then I am 

just wondering when will we deal with BTIB and CIIC?  We seemed to have missed those two 

</span><span>Vote Items, unless I am looking at a different list. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Honourable  Minister,  we  are  just  debating  on  the  Vote  Items  that  has  an 

increase, rather than Vote Items with no changes.
