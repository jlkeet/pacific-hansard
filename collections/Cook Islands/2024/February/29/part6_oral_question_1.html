<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In response to the first question, the advice is that 

foreign employees come into this country either under sponsorship or direct sponsorship by their 

employer.  As a result of that their primary obligation is to their sponsor or their primary employer. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And the relationship between the employer and the foreign employee is govern by agreements or 

contract of employment between those two parties.  I think in respect of that part it is very clear 

that the employee is obliged to the sponsor or primary employer.   

</span></div>
<div><span>And since that relationship is govern by arrangements or contract of employment then it is up to 

both parties to exercise their rights under those agreements or contract of employment.   

</span></div>
<div><span>But  I take  from  the  Leader of the Opposition’s  question  </span><span>raised in  this House is  the concern as 

</span><span>raised  by  the  letter  writer  to  the  Cook  Islands  newspaper  is  where  the  foreign  employees  are 

employed by a secondary employer.  And what protections are afforded to the sponsor or primary 

employer. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The short answer to that is, it is up to the sponsor or the primary employer to see whether he or 

</span><span>she will allow the foreign worker to work for another person or a secondary employer.  And where 

that should occur, I implore on the sponsor or primary employer to relook at the agreements or 

contract of employment.

</span></div>
<div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, that new relationship is govern by some form of agreement or a new or variations of the original 

contract of employment. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The policy introduced by  the  Immigration Department  because of the shortage of  employee  of 

labour is to encourage employee to take up secondary employment but subject to the consent of 

their sponsor or primary employer. Because it is important for the sponsor or the primary employer 

to  protect  themselves  should  anything  happen  during  the  secondary  employment  relationship.  

Where there are injuries sustain as a result of the secondary employment relationship then the new 

agreement or varied contract of employment should address those issues. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In relations to the second question, whether it is the duty of the Immigration officers to advise 

employers and employees what terms to include in their contract of employment.  The short answer 

to that is, it is not the place for Immigration officers to advise employment relationship. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And I invite the Leader of the Opposition to contact the Principal Immigration Officer as I take 

this as a very serious matter.  That is the advice given from any Ministry should be in accordance 

with the legal framework.  As it involves staff of the Immigration Department, I invite the Leader 

</span><span>of the Opposition to talk to the Principal Immigration Officer.  So, that we don’t reveal the identity 

</span><span>of the officer involve which she has dealt with, I think that should be a private matter between her 

and the staff. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I hope that answers the question.
