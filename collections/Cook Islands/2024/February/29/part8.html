<div><span>AUDIT (PERCA): 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,418,197 for Audit (PERCA)  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>The  last  Member  speaking  on  this  Vote  Item  yesterday  was  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; you may continue Honourable Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to the staff of Parliament.  

Kia Orana to the Prime Minister and your Ministers and Members of Parliament on that side of 

this House.  Kia Orana to our side, and everyone listening in and watching us on livestream.   

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday, I was addressing this House on the Vote for Audit.  But before I continue my comment, 

I just want  to  firstly congratulate the  graduates this  morning and  I do  want  to  apologise to  the 

</span><span>Minister of Education that I was unable to attend this morningâ€™s session.  I normally attend these 

</span><span>functions and I just want to make it clear to him so that he will not delete my invites in the future.  

It is good to see, this is the sort of thing that we should also encourage, educating our own people.   

</span></div><div><span>Now,  going  back  to  my  comments  on  the  Audit,  I  mentioned  the  fact  that  I  had  attended  an 

Anticorruption form in Vanuatu about two weeks ago.  That is where I realised the importance of 

the  Ombudsman,  the  Audit  Office,  the  Members  of  Parliament  that  are  in  government.    In 

preparing for that forum however, I had a problem because the last review that was done was in 

2016, the last review of the Cook Islands position.  And then I came across some information that 

</span><span>we do have an Anticorruption Committee, and the Chair was Garth Henderson.  And so, I would 

like to thank Garth because I contacted him and he gave me a briefing as to where we are.  And I 

think this is what should happen on any delegation that leaves our country to go to any workshop 

and they should have the assistance of the Head of Ministry of that department.  The short and end 

</span><span>of it was that I started off with not knowing anything at all, and after reading the briefing from 

</span><span>Garth Henderson, I suddenly knew everything about Audit.   

And that also led me then to participate or to be invited on the Webinar that occurred last Thursday.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>And so, my mission now is to encourage government and the Members of Parliament to strengthen.  

I understand that they have some proposals  for legislative change, which is  good.  And how it 

relates to the Public Accounts Committee, because the ultimate objective of the Committee is for 

our people to have confidence in the Public Sector and public spending. 

</span></div><div><span>And to achieve this we require a culture of accountability, transparency and integrity across the 

organisations and individuals that make up the public sector.  And that is the relationship between 

Public Accounts Committee and the Audit office. 

</span></div><div><span>I support this Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I call upon the Minister, you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I will not be long, just to say that I fully support 

the comments made by the Honourable Tina Browne.  They are all well aware the Audit reports 

directly to the Parliament and we also understand that the Audit plays a major role in assisting the 

PAC Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the biggest problems within the Audit is employing and recruiting qualified accountant and 

financial  people  to  be  audit  officers.    Hence,  the  reason  for  the  extra  funds  that  are  being  sort 

through this Supplementary Budget and on that note, I strongly support this proposal.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,418,197 for  

Audit stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
