<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Good afternoon to you and to all your staff.  

</span><span>Before I can continue to respond to the question from the Member from Matavera may I take this 

</span><span>opportunity to congratulate all the 140 recipients </span><span>of their certificate and award in this morning’s 

</span><span>graduation.

</span></div>
<div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Today,  the  graduates  have  received  certificate  in  15  distinct  vocational  programs,  which  range 

from  diploma  in  teaching,  sports  and  hospitality,  electrical  engineering,  building  construction, 

plumbing, business and management courses.  Our heartfelt congratulations to all 140 graduates. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, the pass rate of 18 percent that was mentioned by the Member, I have received more 

clarification from the Ministry, yesterday evening.  This 18 percent is the aggregate total of New 

Zealand and all of its realm countries which includes us in the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our statistic for 2023 from the Ministry indicated that in level 3 we have a 76 percent and in level 

2 we have a 75 percent and in level 1 we have a 62 percent pass.  If you remember I mentioned 

yesterday that the Prime Minister of New Zealand set his pass rate at 80 percent.  We would like 

to  set  our  pass  rate  to  achieve  80  percent  as  well.    Mr  Speaker,  having  addressed  these 

misconceptions  I  would  like  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  strategies  and  considerations  being 

undertaken by the Ministry of Education. Considering the long term strategies, the Ministry has 

embarked on developing a new Education Master Plan which is supported by ADB.  This Master 

Plan  aims  to  reset  the  education  system  placing  a  strong  emphasis  on  the  first  seven  years 

encompassing Early Child Education and the Early Primary years.  Extensive research underscores 

the  critical  importance  of  this  formative  year</span><span>s  in  a  child’s  educational  outcomes  and  brain 

</span><span>development.    This  will  lead  to  improved  educational  performance  in  the  longer  term  as  these 

students enter secondary education and NCEA.
