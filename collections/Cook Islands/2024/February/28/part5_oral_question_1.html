<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR T. VARU:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and all the staff of Parliament.  I stand 

</span><span>to  respond  to  the  question  that  has  been  raised  by  the  Honourable  Minister  and  Member  for 

</span><span>Tupapa/Maraerenga.  Before I answer the question, I just want to inform the House that I have 

visited this place to see what has been asked for me to do.  And in my investigation to identify the 

</span><span>borders of my constituency, I was not sure whether this particular spot is in the Ruaau area or in 

</span><span>the Nikao area.  But I would like to praise the Honourable Minister for the question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In answer to your question Honourable Minister, I do agree that these rusted metal barriers do not 

</span><span>look nice.  And in these recent days we were able to go and cut these rusted metals and removed 

them.  And there are a few leftovers which you can remodel and make it beautiful.  And for the 

remaining area at Blackrock, we will investigate as to how we can improve it.
