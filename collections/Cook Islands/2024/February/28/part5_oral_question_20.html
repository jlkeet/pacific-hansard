<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, the time is up.  I think you can continue with your answers 

tomorrow.    There  is  also  an  outstanding  question  to  be  answered  by  the  Honourable  Minister 

Tingika Elikana and it was for the question raised by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, 

Tina Browne.   In that  case,  I will request  the Honourable Minister to  respond tomorrow.  The 

Honourable Tingika Elikana is due to arrive Rarotonga later this afternoon.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Again, I would like to bring to your notice Honourable Members, about our Oral Question.  We 

all know what Oral Question is but we go on and on before stating our questions.  And then when 

we respond to the questions raised, we go on and on again with our explanations before answering 

the questions.  Our European ways are different.  We ask our questions and then we answer the 

questions.  It is called questions with no explanation.  It is called open and closed questions. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, do not worry when someone exaggerate with his or her questions, you would do the 

same when you respond.  But let me remind those who asks questions, to bear in mind about the 

time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We have come to the end of Oral Question, thank you very much Honourable Members. 

</span></div>
