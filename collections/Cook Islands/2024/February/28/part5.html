<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>I understand that there are some outstanding questions from our last meeting on 19</span><span>th</span><span> February that 

Honourable Members have requested additional time to respond.  Additionally, a question directed 

to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition Tina Browne, was left unanswered, as question time 

had expired.  So, let me revisit these questions from the last Sitting.  The first question is from the 

Honourable  Minister  George  Angene  to  the  Honourable  Tim  Varu.    The  question  is  if  the 

Honourable Member can do something about the rusted barrier beside the road at Blackrock.  I 

call the Honourable Member Tim Varu; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and all the staff of Parliament.  I stand 

</span><span>to  respond  to  the  question  that  has  been  raised  by  the  Honourable  Minister  and  Member  for 

</span><span>Tupapa/Maraerenga.  Before I answer the question, I just want to inform the House that I have 

visited this place to see what has been asked for me to do.  And in my investigation to identify the 

</span><span>borders of my constituency, I was not sure whether this particular spot is in the Ruaau area or in 

</span><span>the Nikao area.  But I would like to praise the Honourable Minister for the question. 

</span></div><div><span>In answer to your question Honourable Minister, I do agree that these rusted metal barriers do not 

</span><span>look nice.  And in these recent days we were able to go and cut these rusted metals and removed 

them.  And there are a few leftovers which you can remodel and make it beautiful.  And for the 

remaining area at Blackrock, we will investigate as to how we can improve it.

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe I will go and talk to the Minister of ICI to ask for help in doing this work.  But I hope the 

Minister is happy with my answer to his question.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member for your answer.  And I do note that you are 

not sure of the boundary of this area whether it falls in the constituency of Ruaau or Nikao.  Above 

all, I see there are new homes that has been built around this area. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Albert Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and all your Parliament staff 

and of us in this Honourable House that have committed ourselves to be servants of our people.  

The two Arikis in our midst this afternoon and to all our people listening or watching our Sitting 

today, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I do not think that the Honourable Leader of the Opposition should answer the question I asked 

because I got the answer to the question the day after our last Sitting and I am happy with that.  

But if she decides to respond to the question that is all up to her.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.    

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Leader 

of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  all  your 

Parliamentary staff.  Kia Orana to the Prime Minister and all your Cabinet Ministers and all your 

Associate and Assistant Ministers plus all the Honourable Members on your side of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>I greet the Honourable Members of the United Party and the One Cook Islands, Member.  Not 

forgetting our Opposition Members on this side of the House.  Kia Orana also to the two Arikis in 

our Public Gallery today.   I was  not  sure of the reason of  your presence in  the House today;  I 

actually thought you came to represent the House of Ariki matters. 

</span></div><div><span>Because there is an allocation for the House of Ariki in the Supplementary Budget.  However, your 

</span><span>presence here to show support for your Honourable Member for Mitiaro is a very good cause. 

</span></div><div><span>Last Monday, the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister entered this House.  I then congratulated 

</span><span>him for his new appointment as Deputy Prime Minister because I believe that this post as Deputy 

</span><span>Prime Minister is a very high position.  I am also very proud that this position was given to him. 

</span></div><div><span>However, at the first Sitting of Parliament, his first question to me was, did I get a government car.  

</span><span>To me this is a feeble question because he personally knows I have a car.  One day I passed him 

in my car on the road, he waved to me and I waved to him.  Secondly, he should have asked the 

</span></div><div><span>498 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Minister of Finance who was sitting next to him here in the Chamber because the government cars 

are allocated by the Ministry of Finance.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to respond to this question because of his question, I went to the Ministry of Finance to ask 

how they allocated a car for the Opposition Leader because I did not put an application to their 

office for a vehicle for me.  And then, I also asked then as to how much the government spent on 

these  electrical  vehicles  and  how  many  of  these  vehicles  was  distributed  to  the  government 

ministries and how many was sold to private owners and how much for one vehicle. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to thank the Ministry of Finance for responding to all my queries.  There are 25 of these 

electrical vehicles that was ordered by government.  The cost was $1,700 million spent on these 

vehicles.  One vehicle was allocated to the Opposition office because at the last allocation it was 

determined  by  the  Capital  Expenditure  Fund  Committee  because  the  vehicle  given  to  the 

</span><span>Opposition in those days needed to be replaced. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>However,  the  new  government  vehicles  at  the  time  were  all 

distributed out to the government office and ministries.  The second-hand car of the Prime Minister 

at that time was given to the Office of the Opposition.  So, even though the Office of the Opposition 

did not ask for any vehicle it is this Committee responsible who gave this vehicle. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Yes Mr Speaker, not disrespecting my Aunty across the Floor but it is 

question  time  and  I  think  we  have  spent  the  last  five  minutes  listening  to  a  story  and  as  the 

Honourable Minister always says, it is not story time it is question time, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  And to complete my story, this car is parked at the office of the 

Opposition because it is not working.  One day, it was driven by me and the battery went flat.  It 

was taken to the Pickering Motors for them to look at the battery and they said they will contact 

Hyundai as to why this happened.  We were told if you need to recharge the car you have to take 

it to the office of the OPM.  We took the car there and we were told it is out of order.  The advice 

</span><span>given was return the car back to our office and it can be charged on an ordinary power outlet.  We 

charged the car for a whole day but the charging indicator needle never moved.  We were told the 

meter box phase is not suitable to charge the car.  I thought maybe that was the reason eighteen 

cars were distributed to the agencies and seven cars will be sold to the private sector.   

</span></div><div><span>As of this morning, none has been sold.  Nobody is </span><span>interested in buying these EVâ€™s and maybe 

</span><span>people hearing about this will be reluctant to buy an EV car because mine is still parked at the 

office.  So, that is the answer Deputy Prime Minister to your question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader.  That means you have a vehicle.  Thank you, I 

see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question.  Before I do 

so, if I may have time for a brief explanation? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> One minute. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the reason why I asked this question in the last Sitting is 

because I wanted to make sure that this Aunt of mine has a vehicle.  If she had confirmed me then 

that she did not have one, I would have went around and fought for her to have a vehicle because 

she is related to me. That was the intention for my question.  So, my Supplementary Question for 

now is if she wants me to find a replacement for her vehicle? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you for the offer Deputy Prime Minister.  No, I do not 

need  one  because  the  office  told  me  I  can  drive  the  car  while  we  are  waiting  for  advice  from 

Pickering Motors.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  have  six  questions  to  ask  to  the  six  Ministers  of 

government.  I noticed there is one Minister not here.  I have three Supplementary Questions to 

ask to the Associate Ministers of government.  

</span></div><div><span>The first question is directed to the Minister of Agriculture because under the Act of the Ministry 

of Agriculture, this Act was passed in this House in 2021.  Under Part 2 of this Act provides for 

the selection of a committee.  Those supposedly to be selected to be on this committee are people 

knowledgeable on agriculture and it is the responsibility of the Head of the Ministry to see to this.  

To shorten my explanation Mr Speaker, two weeks ago the growers held a meeting and would like 

to let you know that over two hundred people came to this meeting.  The meeting was chaired by 

Kiriau  Turepu  and  the  Kings  Representative.    I  was  sad  because  of  what  was  said  on  what  is 

happening with agriculture in our country.  So, the question to the Minister is, if there is such a 

committee appointed since the endorsement of the Act in 2021? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Minister  Responsible  for 

Agriculture; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  also  to  the  Honourable 

Member for the question.  Before I do so, I would like to acknowledge the two Chiefs who are 

present in the House and for the nomination of the name of Tuakeu Tangatapoto from Mitiaro to 

be Deputy Speaker.  This shows the close relationship of Nga-Pu-Toru and that is why I supported 

</span><span>the Motion.  Briefly, in response to the question if the Honourable Member can give me time and 

I will come back tomorrow with a reply.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you to the Minister for Agriculture.  The second question is to the Minister 

</span><span>of Education.  The question is regards to our students during the examination periods because since 

</span><span>last year up to this year, this is the standard of NCEA level.  I want to let you know Mr Speaker 

that the standard drastically dropped.  I would say that the drop is about 18 percent.  

</span></div><div><span>500 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The  question  to  the  Minister  of  Education  is  what  strategies  does  the  government  have  in 

implement to help improve the standards of our students in NCEA level? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member for Education; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:   </span><span>Thank  you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to  you and  your  good staff this 

afternoon.  To the Leader of the Opposition and your Members on your side, Kia Orana and good 

afternoon.  To the Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and colleagues, Kia Orana and more so to 

</span><span>our Arikiâ€™s </span><span>from Mitiaro, thank you for your presence.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the question from the Member from Matavera is crucial and a critical one for us as a 

nation.  If many of us has seen the new Prime Minister of New Zealand talk about the failure rate 

in  New  Zealand,  although  they  were  sitting  at  55  percent,  the  Prime  Minister  has  tasked  and 

instructed that he would like the NCEA result of New Zealand raised to 80 percent.  And over and 

above that, he had made a directive that all mobile phones in schools be removed.   

</span></div><div><span>But  when  we  come  to  ourselves,  we  know  that  our  curriculum  is  aligned  to  New  Zealandâ€™s 

</span><span>standards  and  criteria.    We  have  moved  from  New  Zealand  School  Certificate  or  University 

Entrance to NCEA.  I am also critical about this process because it seems that we are educating 

our  children  so  that  they  can  be  qualified,  graduated  and  good  enough  for  New  Zealand 

government or New Zealand and Australia to employ. 

</span></div><div><span>If we go to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, they have their own qualification criteria set by themselves.  

This is probably one of the main reason why our people are migrating because we are being highly 

educated to be accepted by both New Zealand and Australia or all over the world. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday  in  Cabinet,  we  were  also  discussing  this  issue  about  the  18  percent  pass.    It  is  a 

concerning result for us in Cabinet and if we look at what is happening inside our Education system 

now; we can see there is a lot of sports played within our schools.  But we are very supportive of 

sports.    I  made  a  passing  remark  to  the  Prime  Minister  that  maybe  it  is  time  that  we  start 

encouraging sports codes to take their practice and training back in the village.  This will revive 

</span><span>our sports in the clubs, and this will enable the codes to go and visit clubs and train our children in 

</span><span>the clubs.  This will also allow quality time and more time for our students to learn in classrooms.  

</span><span>In addition, our answers will be just to remain with our traditional sports, such as athletics, rugby 

and netball. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  issue  concerning  the  pass  rate  to  my  understanding  is  an  aggregated  overall 

</span><span>amount resulting from the whole of the countries that is working under the NCEA system.   It is 

</span><span>notable  that  not  only  New  Zealand  is  suffering  the  failure  rate,  but  it  is  a  global  result.    Now, 

</span><span>considering  the  long  term  strategies,  you  would  have  noted  that  we  have  brought  onboard  Mr 

</span><span>Owen Lewis.  We are well aware the history of Owenâ€™s dad, Papa David Lewis who have passed 

</span><span>away.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, the time is up.  I think you can continue with your answers 

tomorrow.    There  is  also  an  outstanding  question  to  be  answered  by  the  Honourable  Minister 

Tingika Elikana and it was for the question raised by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, 

Tina Browne.   In that  case,  I will request  the Honourable Minister to  respond tomorrow.  The 

Honourable Tingika Elikana is due to arrive Rarotonga later this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>Again, I would like to bring to your notice Honourable Members, about our Oral Question.  We 

all know what Oral Question is but we go on and on before stating our questions.  And then when 

we respond to the questions raised, we go on and on again with our explanations before answering 

the questions.  Our European ways are different.  We ask our questions and then we answer the 

questions.  It is called questions with no explanation.  It is called open and closed questions. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, do not worry when someone exaggerate with his or her questions, you would do the 

same when you respond.  But let me remind those who asks questions, to bear in mind about the 

time. 

</span></div><div><span>We have come to the end of Oral Question, thank you very much Honourable Members.
