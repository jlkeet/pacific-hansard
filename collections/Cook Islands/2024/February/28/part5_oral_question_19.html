<h3>Oral Question 19</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:   </span><span>Thank  you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to  you and  your  good staff this 

afternoon.  To the Leader of the Opposition and your Members on your side, Kia Orana and good 

afternoon.  To the Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and colleagues, Kia Orana and more so to 

</span><span>our Ariki’s </span><span>from Mitiaro, thank you for your presence.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, the question from the Member from Matavera is crucial and a critical one for us as a 

nation.  If many of us has seen the new Prime Minister of New Zealand talk about the failure rate 

in  New  Zealand,  although  they  were  sitting  at  55  percent,  the  Prime  Minister  has  tasked  and 

instructed that he would like the NCEA result of New Zealand raised to 80 percent.  And over and 

above that, he had made a directive that all mobile phones in schools be removed.   

</span></div>
<div><span>But  when  we  come  to  ourselves,  we  know  that  our  curriculum  is  aligned  to  New  Zealand’s 

</span><span>standards  and  criteria.    We  have  moved  from  New  Zealand  School  Certificate  or  University 

Entrance to NCEA.  I am also critical about this process because it seems that we are educating 

our  children  so  that  they  can  be  qualified,  graduated  and  good  enough  for  New  Zealand 

government or New Zealand and Australia to employ. 

</span></div>
<div><span>If we go to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, they have their own qualification criteria set by themselves.  

This is probably one of the main reason why our people are migrating because we are being highly 

educated to be accepted by both New Zealand and Australia or all over the world. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday  in  Cabinet,  we  were  also  discussing  this  issue  about  the  18  percent  pass.    It  is  a 

concerning result for us in Cabinet and if we look at what is happening inside our Education system 

now; we can see there is a lot of sports played within our schools.  But we are very supportive of 

sports.    I  made  a  passing  remark  to  the  Prime  Minister  that  maybe  it  is  time  that  we  start 

encouraging sports codes to take their practice and training back in the village.  This will revive 

</span><span>our sports in the clubs, and this will enable the codes to go and visit clubs and train our children in 

</span><span>the clubs.  This will also allow quality time and more time for our students to learn in classrooms.  

</span><span>In addition, our answers will be just to remain with our traditional sports, such as athletics, rugby 

and netball. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  issue  concerning  the  pass  rate  to  my  understanding  is  an  aggregated  overall 

</span><span>amount resulting from the whole of the countries that is working under the NCEA system.   It is 

</span><span>notable  that  not  only  New  Zealand  is  suffering  the  failure  rate,  but  it  is  a  global  result.    Now, 

</span><span>considering  the  long  term  strategies,  you  would  have  noted  that  we  have  brought  onboard  Mr 

</span><span>Owen Lewis.  We are well aware the history of Owen’s dad, Papa David Lewis who have passed 

</span><span>away.
