<div><span>CONSIDERATION OF BILL IN DETAIL 

</span></div><div><span>Pursuant to Standing Order 216 (2), the Clauses of the Appropriation Bill stand postponed until 

after the consideration of Schedules.  Please be reminded that the Minister in Charge of each Vote 

Item concludes the debate on those Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  announce  that  we  will  only  be  debating  the  modified  appropriations.    The 

unchanged ones will not be up for debate.  In accordance with Standing Order 215 (3), the time 

limit for debate imposed on all Vote Items subject to consideration is 30 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now begin with our first Vote Items: Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,501,202 for the  

Ministry of Agriculture stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is now open to Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I will be commenting on the allocation for the Ministry 

</span><span>of Agriculture.  Although there has been an allocation of $280,000 for Agriculture however these 

are earmarked to purchase machineries to assist Agriculture with its activities and work.  But this 

is not the only area we are looking at Mr Speaker rather other areas such as the allocations for 

2023/24.  

</span></div><div><span>I  have  spoken  to  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  recently  and  I  discussed  with  the  Minister  if  the 

Ministry of Agriculture can hold a Forum because this is a request by the growers as a result of a 

meeting they had just held.  The growers requested if the Ministry of Agriculture can arrange and 

run  the  Forum.    Hence  the  comment  I  made  earlier  that  under  the  Agriculture  Act  there  is  a 

provision which gives guidance to the selection of a committee.  And for this Forum the growers 

are asking that the Ministry of Agriculture should organise it.  To add strength to this Forum and 

to the committee the legislation prescribes the ways in which to improve agriculture.  Even though 

$280,000 has been allocated for the purchase of machinery, Mr Speaker my plea to the Minister

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>and Secretary of Agriculture to look at the request of the growers to hold a Forum.  So, Mr Speaker 

I give my support to this appropriation to improve agriculture and I believe my tractor in included 

in this. Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana everyone in the Name of our 

Lord.  Kia Orana Mr Speaker, Deputy Speaker and staff of Parliament.  To all of us Members and 

our Leaders and to our Deputy Prime Minister, our new Associate Ministers, Kia Orana.  A special 

greeting to all our staff in the Ministry of Agriculture, the Secretary and the staff both here on 

Rarotonga and the Pa Enua and extending to all growers in the country.  I would to thank all those 

who stood up to speak in support of and encourage the agriculture sector.  

</span></div><div><span>This allocation is not much but I believe this will go towards assisting with agricultural activities 

on Rarotonga.   I  would also  like to  acknowledge Papa Kiriau on the meeting he called  for the 

growers.  I appreciate and thank him for what he had done.  I was not present at the meeting but 

the Secretary of Agriculture attended and I believe some Members of Parliament also attended.  

We all know that this Papa held the portfolio of Agriculture when he was a Minister of Parliament 

during his time.  So, I was not weary of his spirit and strong will to call the meeting.  But I was 

downhearted  on  some  points  that  were  raised  because  he  inclined  to  criticise  and  accuse  the 

government.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like our people to know that when I became the Minister in 2018 just after Papa Kiriau, I 

met up with him and likewise, he came to see us and we had discussions.  However, the arrival of 

the COVID pandemic disrupted the plans that were to be implemented at the time.  In spite of that, 

the Ministry of Agriculture did not come to a halt.  We saw the support and programs that were 

extended to the households and including to our people in the Outer Islands during that time.  

</span></div><div><span>Fast forward to today the Ministry of Agriculture is still giving out support by growing and giving 

out  seedlings  to  the  growers  to  plant.    Because  there  is  an  increase  of  demand  by  growers  for 

fertilisers due to shortage and we know the government is distancing itself from selling fertilisers 

to make money.  This all started from the time Papa Kiriau was the Minister.  The intention of the 

</span><span>Governments is to encourage the private sectors to take but this did not eventuate. Therefore, it 

was back to Ministry of Agriculture to provide the service to place orders for the fertiliser, soil and 

even up to the seedlings.  Today Papa Kiriau is still a keen grower and supplies a lot of produce.  

There are burdens our  minor growers in  the Rarotonga community  and  extending to  the Outer 

Islands and the plea from the community for a rotavator, a motorised cultivator, it has arrived.  

</span><span>Unfortunately, this rotavator is not for Rarotonga, and definitely not for Members of Parliament.  

I am afraid that when it lands in the hands of Vaitoti, he will use it for himself and his supporters.  

It is with the Ministry of Agriculture, if you want to use it, just give the Ministry of Agriculture a 

call, there is a fee, and they will deliver it to your house. 

</span><span>Another point that I would like to comment on,</span><span>I have spoken to our Prime Minister about it that 

</span><span>the Outer Islands are no longer with our Department, perhaps it is time for them to be assigned 

again under the Government so that the plans set will prosper.
