<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  all  your 

Parliamentary staff.  Kia Orana to the Prime Minister and all your Cabinet Ministers and all your 

Associate and Assistant Ministers plus all the Honourable Members on your side of the House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I greet the Honourable Members of the United Party and the One Cook Islands, Member.  Not 

forgetting our Opposition Members on this side of the House.  Kia Orana also to the two Arikis in 

our Public Gallery today.   I was  not  sure of the reason of  your presence in  the House today;  I 

actually thought you came to represent the House of Ariki matters. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Because there is an allocation for the House of Ariki in the Supplementary Budget.  However, your 

</span><span>presence here to show support for your Honourable Member for Mitiaro is a very good cause. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Last Monday, the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister entered this House.  I then congratulated 

</span><span>him for his new appointment as Deputy Prime Minister because I believe that this post as Deputy 

</span><span>Prime Minister is a very high position.  I am also very proud that this position was given to him. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, at the first Sitting of Parliament, his first question to me was, did I get a government car.  

</span><span>To me this is a feeble question because he personally knows I have a car.  One day I passed him 

in my car on the road, he waved to me and I waved to him.  Secondly, he should have asked the

<div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Minister of Finance who was sitting next to him here in the Chamber because the government cars 

are allocated by the Ministry of Finance.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I stand to respond to this question because of his question, I went to the Ministry of Finance to ask 

how they allocated a car for the Opposition Leader because I did not put an application to their 

office for a vehicle for me.  And then, I also asked then as to how much the government spent on 

these  electrical  vehicles  and  how  many  of  these  vehicles  was  distributed  to  the  government 

ministries and how many was sold to private owners and how much for one vehicle. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank the Ministry of Finance for responding to all my queries.  There are 25 of these 

electrical vehicles that was ordered by government.  The cost was $1,700 million spent on these 

vehicles.  One vehicle was allocated to the Opposition office because at the last allocation it was 

determined  by  the  Capital  Expenditure  Fund  Committee  because  the  vehicle  given  to  the 

</span><span>Opposition in those days needed to be replaced.
