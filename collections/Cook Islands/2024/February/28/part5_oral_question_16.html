<h3>Oral Question 16</h3>
<div><span>HON.  V.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  also  to  the  Honourable 

Member for the question.  Before I do so, I would like to acknowledge the two Chiefs who are 

present in the House and for the nomination of the name of Tuakeu Tangatapoto from Mitiaro to 

be Deputy Speaker.  This shows the close relationship of Nga-Pu-Toru and that is why I supported 

</span><span>the Motion.  Briefly, in response to the question if the Honourable Member can give me time and 

I will come back tomorrow with a reply.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
