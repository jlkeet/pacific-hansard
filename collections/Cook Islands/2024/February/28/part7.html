</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  now  open  the  Floor  to  Honourable  Members  to  speak  on  the  principles  and  merits  of  the 

Appropriation  Amendment  Bill  2024.    Members  may  only  speak  to  those  Vote  Items  where 

increases are proposed in this Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>These include: 

</span></div><div><span>1.</span><span>16 Agency and nine Pa Enua Vote Items in Schedule 1; 

2.</span><span>Four Vote Items in Schedule 2; 

3.</span><span>One Vote Item in Schedule 3. 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open and I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, if I may acknowledge the two Chiefs inside 

this  House  from  Mitiaro.    I  know  Mr  Speaker  that  their  visit  today  is  not  for  their  Member.  

</span><span>However, I know that the purpose of their visit is to see if there is an increase in pay for the House 

</span><span>of Ariki.  Although there is an allocation for the House of Ariki from Parliament to the Ministry 

of Culture.  That is why we are here to speak on the merits and principles on this Bill.  I know that 

is their intention here, to check if there is an increase with the allocation appropriated for the House 

of Ariki.  Therefore, I would like to acknowledge the two Chiefs here today for visiting us. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, one part that I would like to clarify, the development process of our country.  There 

was a time when I asked the Honourable Prime Minister a question regarding our GDP.  However 

Mr Speaker, today we have realised an increase of 13 percent with our GDP.  And because of this 

reason, it has enabled us to improve some of our agencies.  Even though that part of the support 

comes from VAT.  According to the administration of our government, 15 percent has been used 

to improve our services.  This is very important for our people and our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the government and especially the way they are running the Ministry of ICI 

and the Minister Responsible for ICI and now he is the Deputy Prime Minister of our country.  

This is an important Ministry because they look after our roads and tar sealing in our country.  I 

noticed the new allocation given for them is about $400,000 and when I consider the next four 

</span><span>months for this amount  of money,  I do not believe that this is  sufficient.   If it is,  $1.2 million 

</span><span>allocated for ICI that will be sufficient.  I am proposing this amount because I personally looked 

</span><span>into this work and calculated the costs; I am not just suggesting this from air or top of my head. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe by giving ICI this amount will complete all the road sealing development on Rarotonga.  

</span><span>I speak also on the appropriation that has been given to the Ministry of Health. 

</span></div><div><span>On  the  $800,000  allocated  for  our  patient  referral  program  and  that  is  what  we  are  doing  this 

afternoon to debate on the principles and merits of this Appropriation Bill.  I believe the Minister 

for the Ministry of Health is monitoring our people who are on referral for overseas and if the 

Ministry of Health can improve their services for our people.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to come back to Parliament Services because in our Supplementary Budget, 

we have set aside our support for Parliament.  One of the things that I want us to seriously consider 

because in 2020, I asked if government is going to raise the salaries for our parliamentary staff.   

</span></div><div><span>I remember during that time we were considering the increase of salaries for the police, teachers 

and nurses.  In this appropriation today, it is for the parliament house because I believe what I have 

asked  three  years  ago  will  be  considered  today  especially  for  the  staff  working  here  in  our 

Parliament House. 

</span></div><div><span>Also, on all the issues that has been raised between us in the past and I believe I raised this issue 

last year.  That is for Parliament to administer their own budget allocation and for the institute to 

do all their administration work, the separation of powers.  I believe that the direction that we are 

heading today is following along those lines.  This will give support to the Honourable Members 

</span><span>of this House and for those that are serving in  this House.  This  is  the reason for my question 

</span><span>regarding payment for our Parliamentary employees.  I am not referring to this with no sense but 

we are talking about the principles and merits of this Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  a  pity  Mr  Speaker  that  these  people  that  came  to  my  home  at  7.00  p.m.,  to  deliver  the 

parliamentary papers to me so I can prepare myself for our Parliament Sitting.  Mr Speaker, these 

are my thoughts on the principles and merits of this Bill.  Later on, I will share my other thoughts 

for each of the allocations.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Honourable Members of this 

House, to the Prime Minister and your Cabinet Ministers and Honourable Members on that side 

of the House and that side and our side of the House and all the staff of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I speak on the principles and merits of this Bill, I would like to congratulate our Member 

</span><span>from Mitiaro for your appointment as Deputy Speaker of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to inform you on one of our Honourable Member, Mrs Agnes Armstrong 

</span><span>who will be arriving later on this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to share my thoughts on the Appropriation before this House.  Firstly, I believe that 

</span><span>what is written, like I do not see any issues with the Appropriation Amendment Bill, as reviewed 

by PAC.   

</span></div><div><span>504 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, on that note, I strongly support what the Committee has presented.  However, my first 

issue that  I would like to  raise on our Appropriation and that is  to  thank everyone in  advance.  

Although I can read from here that this appropriation is for ICI for the upgrading of the roads here 

in Rarotonga.  However, I thank the Minister of Infrastructure for this allocation and in the future, 

if there is a remaining amount, please do not forget the roads on my island of Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>That is what I am reading from the PAC report on this Appropriation and it may happen, but I 

would like to put forward my recommendation and thanks in advance. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  give  my  support  to  the  Appropriation  given  to  support  our  people  on  patient 

referrals because this is a problem for our people and we want to support this health program. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to give my support in the other allocations to the other government Ministries that 

they are required to provide the services for our people.  Because right nowm we are aware of the 

structural  needs  of  our  Ministry  of  Health.    We  are  aware  that  this  is  a  special  year  and  a  big 

celebration on the island of Mangaia and that is in regards to the 200-year anniversary of the gospel 

on Mangaia.  Maybe by doing this will help with the preparation for this major event. 

</span></div><div><span>We heard the report of the Minister of Education regarding the achievements of our students.  May 

I remind everyone that this is part of our responsibility, to support the education system in our 

country?  I am happy to hear the thinking that, we need to have our own Cook Islands curriculum 

instead of relying on New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order?  

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA: </span><span> The Member is insinuating that I have made a statement that we will 

change the curriculum.  I did not make that statement but I was just referring that other countries 

are doing their own curriculum such as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Honourable Member, can you rephrase that? 

</span></div><div><span>MRS. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you for that correction.  It is just a line of thought of referring to 

</span><span>other countries curriculum and where to for us in the Cook Islands?  So, Honourable Speaker those 

</span><span>are my thoughts, merits and principles of this allocation.  And may I be also given the opportunity 

</span><span>to greet my constituency?

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>To  Numangatini,  our  traditional  leaders  and  our  Christian  side,  greetings  to  you  all.    An 

acknowledgement  to  all  of  you  for  the  work  you  are  doing  for  the  upcoming  Bicentennial 

celebration for the arrival of Christianity onto our island.  May God bless us all.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Sonny 

Williams; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Thank you to the two traditional leaders that are 

present here in support of this Sitting.  Before I discuss the merits and principles of the Bill, may 

I be given the opportunity to greet our people who a grieving with the loss of family members.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, to Mama Norma Teava Iro, this is a big shady tree that have fallen in Temurimotia.  Many 

people  attended  her  funeral  service  and  this  showed  how  much  she  has  been  involved  in  the 

</span><span>community.    This  woman  has  been  very  strong  in  all  the  women  activities  in  our  country  and 

</span><span>secondly, the support she has given to the Seventh Day Adventist Church.   

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, to the family of our Papa Tiki Matapo in regards to the sister Moana.  She passed away 

overseas and her body has been returned to the Cook Islands for burial.  So, to the two families 

who are grieving for the loss of their loved ones, our condolences and sympathy to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  I would like to  return to  the Appropriation before this House.  We the PAC have 

looked through each allocations and as mentioned in the report there are no issues to discredit the 

allocations.  So, I rise to give my support to this Appropriation and on behalf of my constituency 

Temurimotia because it is for the benefit of our people.  Later on, we will be going through each 

vote  items  so  our  people  will  hear  and  understand  it.    I  would  like  to  dwell  on  Agriculture 

especially in relation to purchase of machineries to support growers in our communities.  I strongly 

give my support to this recommendation because growers are finding it very difficult to look for 

workers.  We need to have some machineries to assist with our work.  We say in Titikaveka that 

we  need to  mechanise.   Yes, we certainly need to mechanise our agriculture industry now and 

going forward.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the night for the growers meeting at the Islander that was organised by Kiriau Turepu 

and  Mama  Tua  as  previously  mentioned  by  the  Member  from  Matavera.    There  were  a  lot  of 

</span><span>growers who attended that meeting.  This is the first time that I have seen a growers meeting with 

</span><span>a lot of people in attendance.  The reason why I attended the meeting is because my uncle in-law 

</span><span>Kiriau asked me to be the MC.  That is one of the nights of its kind especially for growers to come 

</span><span>together because there are meetings that has been called by the Ministry of Agriculture but not as 

</span><span>well attended as this one.  And we have attended meetings that has been organised or called by the 

Ministry of Agriculture but this specific meeting called by Papa Kiriau had a different atmosphere.

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  one  of  the  observations  I  understood  that  night  is  that  there  are  a  lot  of  growers  on 

Rarotonga.  We have rukau planters, assorted banana planters, vanilla growers because you can 

export this product, there are also an increase of mamas and papas growing flowers and that is 

what I have realised that there are a lot of people planting all sorts of plants. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Honourable Member, I will interrupt you.  I think that is enough as it is time for 

us to take a recess.  Parliament will adjourn until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting adjourned at 2.27 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.16 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please be seated.  Our Sitting has resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>Before our lunch break, the Honourable Member had the Floor; you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I believe that those who ate </span><span>p</span><span>ā</span><span>ua </span><span>will be very 

active this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>When the Speaker interrupted my speech, I was speaking about a meeting that I attended that had 

a large number of growers.  I noticed how there were no new growers.  The youngest person in 

this meeting was the Honourable Member for Ngatangiia.  My question is how do we involve our 

youth in this field? 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have two queries, one query I have is one that I shared shared with the Minister of 

Education, a section to be given to Titikaveka College for agricultural activities.  The proposal 

here Mr Speaker is to portion a section to Titikaveka College focusing on agriculture.  The idea is, 

back in the days, our staff or people in Agriculture will have to travel overseas to Alafoa in Samoa 

or elsewhere to advance their agricultural planting experiences and qualifications.  However, I see 

that one of the areas that we need to bridge is between Primary, when we have our kids grow their 

</span><span>own little gardens in the schools, and then when they work in Agriculture, we will send them to a 

</span><span>University, Alafoa or Liston College in Christchurch.  Like Massey University who has a focus on 

</span><span>Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>For me, there is a gap missing of 10+ years between Primary and Tertiary.  We need to pluck the 

</span><span>gap at Secondary levels.  When I look at similar instances, we have a School of Tourism, we have 

</span><span>a School of Academics or Office or Secretarial Services, we have a Trade School for plumbing, 

carpentry and so forth.  But at that level, we do not have anything to do with Agriculture and yet, 

it plays a significant part of our way of life in our economy here in the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>507 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>After  hundreds  of  them  planting  at  Primary  level,  some  at  early  College  level  and  finally, 

workforce.  We lose a lot of those who have taken Agriculture at those levels.  My proposal is that 

we pick up those from Primary, advance into College, pick up those who are really interested to 

go into the Agriculture and Growing industry, you will not get all of them; a few or dozen or so 

will  suffice.    There  are  some  that  are  passionate  going  with  their  parents  or  grandparents  into 

planting because there is nothing offered at the Secondary level; they lose interest and there is no 

contribution to the whole industry agricultural foods.  I am sure there are some in the Outer Islands 

who grew up in agricultural, not only in planting, but also animal husbandry poultry and so forth.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, that is my proposal before the House, I will talk more with the Minister of Education 

and Agriculture now that she is aware of the idea, and we will try and proceed with this idea of a 

focus at secondary level, institution school on Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>To end, I would like to support the notion raised by the Member of Matavera for the Advisory 

Committee  maybe,  formed  under  the  Agricultural  Act  for  the  Minister  to  really  take  this  into 

serious consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>May I nominate some key people from Titikaveka, I mean this is a calibre and the range of people, 

we need business people from Wigmores, and Teva Iro with his compost as a new fertiliser for 

growing.  Of course, with the growers and on that night, I saw a lot of potential members for this 

Advisory Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  will  end  here  and  I  support  the  Bill  before  the  House  and  all  the  itemised 

appropriations within, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Toanui Isamaela; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker and your wife and family.  In addition, to your staff 

here at Parliament, Kia Orana to you all.  I would also like to acknowledge our Members from the 

</span><span>Government side for their new posts, praise the Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, if I may convey my regards to my Constituency.  To our people listening in from the 

</span><span>Northern Group and Southern Group, Kia Orana to you all in the Name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before I give my support, I would like to speak on the Bill.  Mr Speaker, when we 

</span><span>look at the allocations in this Bill, it has already been sorted.  Pursuant to our rules, as alluded 

earlier on, that this Bill is to be referred to PAC from Parliament, that they reviewed it at that time 

after the Bill was tabled.  But I wanted to see if there are any changes to the Bill, I did not see any. 

</span></div><div><span>508 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>However, pursuant to our rules, for this House to refer the Bill to PAC and for PAC to table the 

Bill back into the House, for discussion.  Mr Speaker, according to the Appropriation that was set 

for  2023/24,  we  have  agreed  to  over  $325  million.    Today,  there  is  a  new  total  amount  of 

$342,179,552.  Therefore, there is an increase of $116,569,081. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when the Parliamentary Papers on the Budget was given to me while I was here in 

Rarotonga, I did not have time to go through it and study it.  But when I went back to Aitutaki that 

was when I reviewed it carefully.   

</span></div><div><span>So,  therefore  I  have  questions  that  I  would  to  ask  the  government.    When  we  look  at  the 

Supplementary Budget for the Outer Islands and I can see the Members of Parliament for the Outer 

Islands do not seem to be worried at all, they are smiling happily about everything.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  when  I  look  at  this  Supplementary  Budget  there  has  been  an  increase  for  each 

individual island.  My question is, why was Aitutaki not included an allocation in this Budget list?   

Mr Speaker, one problem raised by the three Members from Aitutaki relates to water supply and 

electricity supply.  We believe that this Supplementary increase given to the island of Aitutaki will 

incorporate  to  cover  the  problems  with  our  water  and  power  supply  issues.    I  know  that  the 

Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  have  visited  Aitutaki  and  were 

involved in some discussions as to what government can do to improve the water and power supply 

for Aitutaki.   

</span></div><div><span>From these meetings and discussions with these able leaders, we came up with plans as to how we 

can address these issues.  I thought that this increase will assist most of the people on the island.  I 

would like to mention to this House that when one compares the number of people on the island 

of Aitutaki with the other Outer Islands, Aitutaki exceeds the populations of the other islands twice 

or thrice.  

</span></div><div><span>But  when  we  look  at  the  other  islands,  they  have  been  blessed  immensely  than  my  island  of 

Aitutaki.  I am not accusing anyone but thanking everyone for the good done.  My own thoughts 

</span><span>that the reason why this deficiency might be because of the development of our harbour and wharf 

</span><span>which could have affected the way the administrators appropriated the budget.  Because I believe 

</span><span>that there is a large amount of money appropriated for this development.  And maybe this is the 

</span><span>reason for this and I am only stating my reviews. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, one of the things that I want to raise is the labour force on the island, Business, Trade 

</span><span>and Investment Board because I want to comment how this authority contributes and supports my 

island.  I know a lot of my people and have reaped from BTIB in an endeavour of developing new 

local business projects.  So, I would like to thank this government agency for assisting my people. 

</span></div><div><span>509

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  noticed  how  the  government  keeps  an  eye  out  on  foreign  investors  because  these  are  capital 

investment for our country.  I believe that most of the work has been carried out by this agency, 

BTIB.  I would suggest for the government to observe this space and to provide more support for 

BTIB. 

</span></div><div><span>As  per  my  statement  earlier,  I  look  forward  to  working  together  in  collaboration  with  the  two 

Members from Aitutaki for the Appropriation Budget in June so that our island can reap some of 

the benefits of the budget.  I believe that if we do not put any request through for an increase in 

our budget allocation, all the outstanding work will not be completed.  Otherwise, some of our 

labour force will get mad but maybe is Aitutaki is good because we pay our employees well.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to suggest that we bring the next Appropriation in for the next financial year so that 

we can be involved in the discussions of the allocations of our capital. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker in closing, I strongly give my support to this Supplementary Budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Robert Heather; you 

have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in this Honourable House.  

I will not spend more time in greetings that has already been given before.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, may I be given a short time to give my words of condolences to Mama Ruta and the 

daughters for the passing of her husband Papa  Ben Mose.   We all know of his  position in  our 

community  especially  on  our  local  radio,  the  sports  and  his  political  involvement.    This  is  our 

Patron in our United Party.  Therefore, may the Lord provide you comfort in this time of sorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I give my support to this Supplementary Budget, I have a question in mind heading out to 

the Leader of our country.  I was slow in standing and the chance was taken by another Honourable 

Member.    The  reason  Mr  Speaker  I  wanted  to  ask  a  question,  that  maybe  when  he  comes  to 

</span><span>Parliament tomorrow, he will have the answer to my question. 

</span></div><div><span>Come 1</span><span>st</span><span> of March 2024, there is a new law that will be enforced in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, can you leave that question until tomorrow? 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>   Mr Speaker, I would like to request that  I be given the first opportunity 

tomorrow to ask my question.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to what the Member for Titikaveka had said about the growers which I fully support, I 

want the Honourable Members to know that I have about 30 young people under the age of 15 

years.  These young people are from our primary school, which they had talents in growing. 

</span></div><div><span>The intention here is to bring these young people who are idle at home so that they can be utilised 

to grow produces.  The intention is to train them and to prepare them for the future.  Our emphasis 

in our growing program at this time is to plant kumara, sweet potatoes and taro.  And maybe out 

of  these  30  young  individuals,  there  will  be  two  or  more  who  will  be  talented  in  growing  and 

planting.  But we would like to request support from the Minister of Agriculture in regards to these 

machines so that it can be used to help our growers. And so we would like to recommend for the 

committee to consider what I have stated before this House and may be one or two that might come 

through to help our growers in Arorangi.  

</span></div><div><span>Today, we are debating about this allocation of $800,000 for the Ministry of Health.  I strongly 

support this because for the last two years I have been crying out for us to support our sick people 

and our elderly.  A prime example is that recently this week a sick elderly relative of ours was 

medically transferred to New Zealand.  A big appreciation goes out to the government, Minister 

of Health, doctors, nurses who looked after our elder.  Not only our relative but also extends out 

to  our  elderly  parents.    The  only  shortcoming  Mr  Speaker  is  that  we  wait  until  the  illness  has 

worsen then we transfer these sick people.  My request to the doctors and the Health service is to 

look at improving this and for us not to wait until the illness has worsened before referring our 

elderly.  This gentleman that was referred is quite scared because to him when you are referred 

you come back in a casket.  So, I would like to recommend highly that we should look into this 

issue and not to wait until the illness is worse before we do something.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank government in regards to our welfare.  Here is a suggestion, that we should 

increase the </span><span>caregiver’s</span><span> allowance.  This has been a problematic area for us in the past and I do 

believe that government is now aware that support has recently been coming in.  

</span></div><div><span>I am hesitant to comment on this and that is especially on allowances for Members of Parliament.  

</span><span>I am looking at Travel Allowance and I will be affected by this personally so I will not criticise it 

</span><span>but leave it to all of us Members to look at reducing this as there are other important areas such as 

Health, Education and Police.  Those are my thoughts.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Herman; you 

</span><span>have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, to all of us in this Honourable House, the Government side, the 

</span><span>Opposition side and those in the Public Gallery.  Also to our people listening in, Kia Orana to all 

of us this afternoon.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my support to the Supplementary Budget.  I would like to comment on 

two issues being the Parliamentary Appropriation and the Support to the Outer islands programs.  

We Members do know that this Report was given to the PAC and we had an in-depth look at areas 

that we think are correct or incorrect.  But I would like the House and our people to know that the 

final decision comes from Cabinet.  What the PAC does is to consider whether these are proper 

allocations.  In regards to the Parliamentary Supplementary, this is not new Mr Speaker.  I am not 

criticising but I am suggesting changing the ways allocations are made to this House.  Because in 

the past years, the Clerk of Parliament has been raising some issues and it is truly correct for him 

to say it.  He does not know and understand the reason why a lot of times that Parliament will ask 

for  a  Supplementary  Budget  and  yet  the  people  allocating  the  budget  can  see  that  not  enough 

finance is given to Parliament Services.  I am sure all of us in this House will give support for 

more allocations for this House because this House belongs to all of us, to the Government side, 

</span><span>the Opposition side and to our people.  It is appropriate that this House to carry out its work without 

</span><span>any issues to think whether there is enough money.  That is firstly what I wanted to speak on Mr 

Speaker.  So when we come to the period of considering the appropriations for 2024-25, we should 

give an increase to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am looking at the allocation of $220,000 to the CDF in regards to the Renewable 

Energy because I am looking at this and it appears that it is not enough.  Just like my colleague the 

Member for Amuri/Ureia was talking about is that Aitutaki does not have an allocation in this.  

Maybe Aitutaki does have an allocation but it is not identified.  This is a good development Mr 

Speaker  because  when  we  look  back  in  the  last  10  years  that  is  how  the  government  started.  

Because 10 years ago it was the dream and wish of government that we should be dependent on 

renewable energy.  Today it still remains Rarotonga and Aitutaki to be covered.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  had  experience  in  the  Northern  islands  where  I  stayed  on  the  islands  of 

Manihiki and Rakahanga in the days where the power was supplied with diesel engines.  On those 

islands at 6.00 a.m. the power comes on until 11.00 a.m. it turns off.  Then at 6.00 p.m. it comes 

back on again until midnight.  Afterwards, I took government to the outer islands to change the 

</span><span>power to renewable energy and you will see the standard people living at the time improved Mr 

</span><span>Speaker.    But  in  spite  of  that,  renewable  energy  will  always  have  challenges  in  the  future.  

</span><span>Recently, there was big problems with the battery supplier or usage in the outer islands.  These 

</span><span>will have to be changed with tremendous costs in spite of that Mr Speaker that is the way forward. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the reason why this allocation was for the Outer Islands, for the Renewable Energy.  I hope 

</span><span>that this will drive some distance in terms of improvement.  I understand that Government have 

</span><span>something in mind for Aitutaki’s Renewable E</span><span>nergy, I hope though that it does not come after the 

Manihiki Airport project.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am supporting the Supplementary Budget with all support.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  It seems there is no one else to speak.  I see 

the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Kia Orana, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Kia Orana to everyone this afternoon.  I stand to share my views 

regarding the Supplementary Budget, and I want to talk about the merits of the Bill.  I have taken 

guidance  from  the  presentation  that  was  provided  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic 

Management, but first I am grateful that we were able to table the Reports by the Public Accounts 

</span><span>Committee.    But  I  want  to  also  make  a  statement  that  my  understanding  of  what  the  Public 

</span><span>Accounts  Committee  in  their  role  is  to  ensure  that  the  Bill  is  compliant with  Article  70  of  the 

Constitution.  The conclusion of the Committee is that it does, however, I will be talking about the 

principles and merits based on three categories.   

</span></div><div><span>First,  the  Economic  and  Fiscal  Assumptions,  second,  the  Gross  Domestic  Product  Update  and 

Forecast, and third, the Inflation Forecast, and the fourth point is the Medium Turn Fiscal Strategy.   

</span></div><div><span>When we go to the presentation from MFEM, we see that under Economic and Fiscal Assumptions, 

they rely on an optimistic tourism recovery, and my thinking in respect of that is given the global 

economic uncertainties, and the potential unforeseen events that could impact airline capacity, I 

wonder whether these assumptions and forecasts are robust enough to support the estimates.  They 

also made the assumption that there will not be any significant further debt drawdowns and that 

the interest rate will remain as the current assumptions.  And for the same reason meaning, the 

global climate out there is changing.  An example of that is we thought the war in Ukraine was 

going to be for one year.  Now it is two years, and it does not look like it is going to come to an 

end.  And we see the war in Gaza, Israel and Hamas, and all those other countries.  And these are 

</span><span>the factors that will affect what we import into the country because we do not have fuel, we do not 

</span><span>have oil, they come from outside the country.   

</span></div><div><span>I am pleased that there is an acceptance in the assumption that inflation will remain a challenge 

</span><span>for us, especially for our most vulnerable people.  I think they quoted that the consumer prices 

</span><span>rising to 13 percent in 2022/23.  Mr Speaker, I feel however that perhaps we are not doing enough 

</span><span>to combat inflation.  I say this because it depends which day of the paper you read, we see in the 

Cook  Islands  News,  some  of  the  products  in  the  shops  are  60  percent  higher  than  what  it  was 

before.  Some are even as high as 80 percent higher.  The question must be, are we, is government 

</span></div><div><span>513 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>taking any aggressive or active steps to try and control prices of goods in the store.  And are we 

looking at regulating competition?  Can we consider wiping that?   

</span></div><div><span>Then turn to the second session of the presentation from MFEM, they provide and give us some 

graphs to show the gross domestic update and the graph forecast.  There are two things, evident 

one is the nominal growth of GDP, and the other is the $500 million we lost during the Pandemic.   

</span></div><div><span>So, the question must be asked, is whether or not the government economic policies are in fact 

mitigating the impact of Pandemic.  And then, over the page, there is also a graph provided in the 

spent of inflation.  What is interesting is of course, is external.  But let me say again, we have to 

question whether we are doing enough for ourselves to combat inflation.  And then, when we come 

to the medium term fiscal strategy, again we base that on a very optimistic visitor arrival figures.  

I know and I am aware that we do talk, and I hear the Prime Minister and the Ministers on the 

</span><span>other  side  of  the  House  talk  about  diversity,  but  so  far,  it  is  talk  talk  talk.    I  think,  we  should 

</span><span>promote our tourism industry and at the same time, seriously look at diversity. 

</span></div><div><span>And the last topic for supporting the estimate is the revenue forecast, and I just want to point the 

heavy reliance that we placed on income tax, VAT and other levies or revenue.  And it is time that 

we should also be looking seriously at diversifying the revenue strategy.   

</span></div><div><span>That Mr Speaker are my comments on the principles of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Prime 

Minister you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  to  the  previous  speakers  for  their 

comments on the principles and merits of our Supplementary Budget today.  Many of you spoke 

on specific areas of interest that you would like to see additional resourcing and funding for.  And 

some spoke on the general economic overview of our country and maybe some ways to look at in 

improving our economic standing. 

</span></div><div><span>In June last year Mr Speaker when we passed our budget, I spoke about the need for this year to 

be a year of excel rated economic growth because we had a lot of loss ground to make up from the 

COVID years.   

</span></div><div><span>So, we focus on those things that our country does well, which is tourism.  Which brings in the 

bulk  of  our  economic  revenue.    I  also  spoke  about  the  importance  of  our  contracting  and 

construction companies.  We must find ways to keep these companies with pipelines of work to 

keep them working and to keep their workers employed.   

</span></div><div><span>So, my message to our Ministries particularly involved in fracture was do not try and spread your 

money out to last for a year of work, go out hard and do the job and if you run out of money during 

the year, then we will look at topping it up, through a Supplementary Budget.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We did the same with tourism, Mr Speaker with securing airline routes for flights to increase the 

number of visitors coming into our country.  And so far, our plan is working and we are able to 

put this Supplementary Budget together to ask for additional funding because we are in a good 

financial position due to the accelerated growth of our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>I note the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition on the assumptions by our economics 

team in preparing this Budget.  I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that these assumptions 

are robust and very strong.   

</span></div><div><span>In terms of the optimism of our tourism industry looking forward as mentioned in the economic 

report.  This is not just due to looking at the tea leaves and the tea cup and then looking at the stars.  

This is a solid optimistic prediction on the forward bookings that our industry has been able to 

demonstrate to us.  And I can say that the forward bookings are looking very, very optimistic. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of interest on debt that there is no at this stage expectation on more debt to be drawn 

down.  An interest rate from the national debt that we have taken out from the likes of the ADB 

and other multinational banking institute these are fixed rates for the terms  that we have taken 

</span><span>them out for up to 20 years.  So, the interest rate won’t change.  In fact, due to our hard work we 

</span><span>have managed to get even better concessional rate for borrowing in the event that we are looking 

to finance through borrowing things such as infrastructure development in the future. 

</span></div><div><span>I would advise the Leader of the Opposition to obtain a better economist to provide her with advice 

because the suggestion to wipe out VAT would be a disastrous for our country.  Any economist 

will tell you that VAT or GST, this type of consumption tax is the most fairest form of taxation 

and the most easiest to administer. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of inflation, Mr Speaker I was reading, listening to Warren Buffet who is one of the richest 

men in the world.  And he said that inflation is a natural part of the world, what things used to cost 

twenty years ago, today cost more money as a result of natural inflation. 

</span></div><div><span>But of course, within a shorter time period sometimes we see inflation accelerate and other times 

inflation is very low.  The only way to get ahead of inflation is to earn more money and that is 

what the focus of our Budget is about, our economic policy, our economic strategy, Mr Speaker; 

</span><span>is to accelerate the growth of our economy so that we can as a country earn more money to be able 

to afford these things that now cost more. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I commend this Supplementary Budget now that is before our House.  Thank you Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  also  thank  you  to  all  other 

Honourable Members who raised their contributions.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion for the Second Reading of the 

</span><span>Appropriation Amendment Bill 2024 be agreed to
