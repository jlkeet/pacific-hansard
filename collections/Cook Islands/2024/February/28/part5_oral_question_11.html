<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the reason why I asked this question in the last Sitting is 

because I wanted to make sure that this Aunt of mine has a vehicle.  If she had confirmed me then 

that she did not have one, I would have went around and fought for her to have a vehicle because 

she is related to me. That was the intention for my question.  So, my Supplementary Question for 

now is if she wants me to find a replacement for her vehicle?
