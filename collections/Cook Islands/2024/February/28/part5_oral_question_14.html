<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  have  six  questions  to  ask  to  the  six  Ministers  of 

government.  I noticed there is one Minister not here.  I have three Supplementary Questions to 

ask to the Associate Ministers of government.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The first question is directed to the Minister of Agriculture because under the Act of the Ministry 

of Agriculture, this Act was passed in this House in 2021.  Under Part 2 of this Act provides for 

the selection of a committee.  Those supposedly to be selected to be on this committee are people 

knowledgeable on agriculture and it is the responsibility of the Head of the Ministry to see to this.  

To shorten my explanation Mr Speaker, two weeks ago the growers held a meeting and would like 

to let you know that over two hundred people came to this meeting.  The meeting was chaired by 

Kiriau  Turepu  and  the  Kings  Representative.    I  was  sad  because  of  what  was  said  on  what  is 

happening with agriculture in our country.  So, the question to the Minister is, if there is such a 

committee appointed since the endorsement of the Act in 2021?
