<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and all your Parliament staff 

and of us in this Honourable House that have committed ourselves to be servants of our people.  

The two Arikis in our midst this afternoon and to all our people listening or watching our Sitting 

today, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I do not think that the Honourable Leader of the Opposition should answer the question I asked 

because I got the answer to the question the day after our last Sitting and I am happy with that.  

But if she decides to respond to the question that is all up to her.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.    

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Leader 

of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
