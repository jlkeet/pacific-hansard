<div><span>AUDIT (PERCA) 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,418,197 for Audit (PERCA)  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I actually rise just to ask a question of clarification.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You may do so. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>I thought  that  there would be no debate with  regard to  Vote 

Items  that  have  not  been  increased.    Audit  is  one  of  the  ones  with  no  increase.    Or  have  I 

misunderstood? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Leader, please give me a second. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, yes you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>To assist our Members in our Budget book here that we have received, page 

9 to page 12 outlines in detail each of the changes in the Supplementary Budget.  And if we look 

</span><span>at page 11, I believe there has been some adjustments in their operating expenditure to cover for 

recruitment and relocation costs and also for job sizing, retention and market premium payments. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister and thank you for the clarification. 

</span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Prime  Minister.    I  was  confused  because  in  the 

presentation that MFEM gave and also in the Report from PAC, we referred to the presentation 

</span></div><div><span>518 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 February 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Seventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>details that was given and Audit was not one of them, if you have a look at the PAC.  And that is 

what guided me and I did not go to page 11 of the Supplementary.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>If we are to debate on it, if I can make some comments on it if 

we are debating it.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>The Audit Office is one of the most important and vital offices 

in our country.  Since the establishment of the Public Accounts Committee, I for one have valued 

the advice coming out of our Audit Office.  We also very aware of the need of this office to be 

</span><span>truly independent.  This office, the Audit Office and the Ombudsmanâ€™s Office.  Why?  Because 

</span><span>we  want  the  Audit  Office  to  be  independent  on  government  so  that  when  they  are  reviewing 

government account, they can do that without any influence from anyone in government.  Do not 

get me wrong, I am suggesting that they are being influenced, I just think that it should be critical 

for that office to be seen independent.  I am aware that at the last interview we did for the Audit 

Office, they do have moves to put in place legislation that will end up making them independent.   

</span></div><div><span>I was very fortunate to have participated at an anti-corruption forum in Vanuatu two weeks ago.  

The  attendees  at  that  forum  were  Ombudsman,  Audit  Generals  and  Members  of  Parliament 

including  Ministers.    I  came  away  from  that  forum  with  the  staunch  belief  that  for  a  good 

government, we need to strengthen the Audit Office.  We know that for some years back, we were 

behind with Audit Reports or Annual Reports filed in Parliament.  The reasons for that were many 

including confusion between what they file with Public Service Commissioner and what they file 

with Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>But the forum in Vanuatu made me understand more the role that the Audit Office plays in any 

government.  I was also fortunate to have been asked to participate in a webinar and this webinar 

was  a  forum  on  zoom  where  there  were  a  panel  of  four  and  people  will  link  in  by  zoom  to 

participate in the discussions.  Again, the webinar was to look at the role of government and the 

role of the Audit Office and how the interaction between those two office should occur.  I found 

</span><span>that not every country in our region have a good relationship between the Audit Office and the 

Public Accounts Committee for example.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  I  have  to  disrupt  you.    Honourable 

Members, we have come to the end of our business for today.  When we come back tomorrow, the 

</span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition may continue with her comments. 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament will now adjourn until tomorrow, Thursday 29 February at 1.00 p.m.  May I ask an 

Honourable Member to say our Closing Prayer?
