<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  And to complete my story, this car is parked at the office of the 

Opposition because it is not working.  One day, it was driven by me and the battery went flat.  It 

was taken to the Pickering Motors for them to look at the battery and they said they will contact 

Hyundai as to why this happened.  We were told if you need to recharge the car you have to take 

it to the office of the OPM.  We took the car there and we were told it is out of order.  The advice 

</span><span>given was return the car back to our office and it can be charged on an ordinary power outlet.  We 

charged the car for a whole day but the charging indicator needle never moved.  We were told the 

meter box phase is not suitable to charge the car.  I thought maybe that was the reason eighteen 

cars were distributed to the agencies and seven cars will be sold to the private sector.   

</span></div>
<div><span>As of this morning, none has been sold.  Nobody is </span><span>interested in buying these EVâ€™s and maybe 

</span><span>people hearing about this will be reluctant to buy an EV car because mine is still parked at the 

office.  So, that is the answer Deputy Prime Minister to your question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader.  That means you have a vehicle.  Thank you, I 

see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.
