<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to everyone in the House 

today.  My question is directed to the Minister of Justice.  We will soon be discussing Parliament 

Paper  No.  155,  which  is  an  interim  report  from  the  Bills,  Petitions,  and  Papers  Committee.    I 

</span><span>understand there was a roadshow that visited New Zealand earlier this year, which we discussed 

in the House.  It was recommended that a report from this roadshow be submitted to Parliament, 

with a proposed submission date by the end of June this year.  I would like to ask the Minister if 

there is an update regarding this report.  During the roadshow, topics such as occupation rights and 

leases were discussed with our people.  I raise this matter because some of the issues addressed 

</span><span>with our people in New Zealand and Australia may be relevant to the review conducted by the 

Bills, Petitions, and Papers Committee.
