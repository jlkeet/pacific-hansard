<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the government side, including 

the Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, and your colleagues.  And to the Opposition, and myself 

standing between both the government and the Opposition. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Honourable Prime Minister.   Last year, on 22 June 

2023, we were discussing proposed changes to our tax laws that would impact the people in the 

Pa Enua.  During that discussion, I raised a question in this House regarding whether individuals 

receiving the New Zealand pension would be affected by these changes, and I also inquired about 

</span><span>the potential for this to pose future issues. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr Speaker, when I asked that question, I received confirmation from the Prime Minister 

that as of 1 July 2023, our people in the Outer Islands would not be required to pay tax due to

<div><span>protections under that law.  However, I am currently facing issues with my constituents in Aitutaki 

who are returning from New Zealand.  This is a big problem that is impacting our community.  My 

question  to  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  is  this:  Why  are  our  people  in  the  Outer  Islands, 

particularly in Aitutaki, being pursued by the Inland Revenue staff? 

</span></div>
<div><span>These are elderly pensioners who have come to see me in Aitutaki, but importantly, they are not 

from my constituency; they are from the villages of my two MP colleagues.  My question is this: 

I am aware that some of our people are being pursued by the Inland Revenue, and I want to know 

why this is happening to our pensioners today.  When we passed a law in this House to protect 

those returning to the Cook Islands, particularly on the island of Aitutaki, why are these elderly 

individuals, returning home from New Zealand, now being pursued over tax matters?
