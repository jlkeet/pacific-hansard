<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us this afternoon.  I stand 

to answer the question raised by the Member of Matavera yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I see in our Order of Paper today, that we are to establish a Special Select Committee 

to look into the Religious Registration Act and come up with recommendations for Parliament for 

consideration in due course.  We have discussed this matter at heart before coming into the House 

and we are all in support for this topic to be discussed in details on the best course for us.  With 

</span><span>those few words I hope that the Member of Matavera will be happy with the recommendations. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question for the Minister of 

Justice on the question posed to him yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>We have established an  organisation known as the Religious Advisory Council.   However, the 

issue I see with this organisation is that they lack a clear mandate for their establishment. 

</span></div><div><span>Concerning this organisation, I suggest that this is an opportune time for the government to address 

this matter by structuring the organisation and establishing a clear mandate.  This would enable 

the Council to effectively consider issues related to religious activities and potentially grant it the 

authority to review applications from those wishing to establish church organisations. 

</span></div><div><span>In  light  of  this,  I  would  like  to  urge  the  government  to  address  the  matter  by  designating  the 

Religious Advisory Council as the body responsible for reviewing applications, particularly from 

Christian Churches seeking to establish themselves here in the Cook Islands.  I would specifically 

like to highlight the Revival Church and the Apostolic Church, both of which should be given due 

consideration.  It is essential that this council reviews all such applications appropriately. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister Mokoroa. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, if I can refer to the Prime Minister to answer this, then I 

will make my answer. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  The Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the Member for Matavera for your 

request.  I would like to refer to the 1975 Act that established the recognised Churches here in the 

Cook Islands.  It has been 50 years since that legislation was enacted, and currently, I believe only 

four Churches are recognised under that Act.  However, as we know, many more Churches have 

been  established  in  our  country  since  then,  representing  a  variety  of  congregations  and 

denominations that actively preach the Gospel within our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>Next year as we celebrate the 60th year of the establishment of our country as a modern country 

we know that we have changed and the changes have been significant, Mr Speaker not just from 

</span><span>the  size  of  our  country  which  have  moved  from  250  square  kilometres  of  islands  to  now  two 

million square kilometres including oceans. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, the population of our country 60 years ago was about 30,000 people, but today it has 

grown to well over 100,000.  Our society has become more diverse, with many Cook Islanders 

</span><span>now having intermarried with individuals from other cultures, so we have Cook Islanders who are 

also part of other cultures. 

</span></div><div><span>This diversity invites not only a variety of cultures but also an array of religions.  As the Member 

</span><span>stated, I believe it is indeed timely for us to review our current Act and assess whether changes are 

</span><span>necessary.  However, we must also be mindful of our responsibilities, as highlighted by the Leader 

of the Opposition and others.  We are signatories to human rights agreements, including the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>770 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>of Rights, which upholds the principles of freedom of expression and freedom of worship, among 

other individual rights. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, it is crucial that any reviews of this nature are conducted with great care 

and consideration, ensuring that we protect the rights of all individuals involved. 

</span></div><div><span>One example I would like to share to illustrate how our country has evolved over the past 60 years, 

Mr Speaker, is this year, I was advised that the last horse in the Cook Islands has died.  There are 

no more horses in the Cook Islands, Mr Speaker; the final one has passed away.  This brings to 

mind the stories shared by Papa Dan Kamana, who lived into his 90s and often recounted that in 

his youth, owning a horse was a sign of being a man. 

</span></div><div><span>We  once  had  hundreds  of  horses  in  our  country,  Mr  Speaker,  which  were  essential  for  work 

purposes,  but  they  also  served  as  a  means  of  transportation,  even  taking  people  to  dances  in 

Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>However, the bicycle came along, and Papa Dan would often say that owning a push bike was 

even better.  </span><span>You didn’t have to worry</span><span> about feeding it; you just get on and go. 

</span></div><div><span>Then, of course, came the motorcycle, and nowadays, to meet someone, young people often just 

use  their  phones  to  connect,  rather  than  actually  being  there  in  person.    This  illustrates  the 

significant changes in our society and community, Mr Speaker, over the years.  As a people and 

as a country, we must consider how we will adapt to these changes.  The issue at hand is serious 

for many of our citizens, and it is one that we should deliberate with the proper consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>Let us strive to approach this matter with a level head and carefully consider the concerns raised 

by many of our people and fellow Members of this House.  I believe it is fitting, Mr Speaker, for 

us to  establish a Select  Committee to  evaluate the suggestions that have been put  forth by our 

Member from Matavera.  This would be a constructive first step in giving serious consideration to 

issues of significant importance to our community and our people.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Toanui 

Isamaela; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the government side, including 

the Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, and your colleagues.  And to the Opposition, and myself 

standing between both the government and the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Honourable Prime Minister.   Last year, on 22 June 

2023, we were discussing proposed changes to our tax laws that would impact the people in the 

Pa Enua.  During that discussion, I raised a question in this House regarding whether individuals 

receiving the New Zealand pension would be affected by these changes, and I also inquired about 

</span><span>the potential for this to pose future issues. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe, Mr Speaker, when I asked that question, I received confirmation from the Prime Minister 

that as of 1 July 2023, our people in the Outer Islands would not be required to pay tax due to 

</span></div><div><span>771 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>protections under that law.  However, I am currently facing issues with my constituents in Aitutaki 

who are returning from New Zealand.  This is a big problem that is impacting our community.  My 

question  to  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  is  this:  Why  are  our  people  in  the  Outer  Islands, 

particularly in Aitutaki, being pursued by the Inland Revenue staff? 

</span></div><div><span>These are elderly pensioners who have come to see me in Aitutaki, but importantly, they are not 

from my constituency; they are from the villages of my two MP colleagues.  My question is this: 

I am aware that some of our people are being pursued by the Inland Revenue, and I want to know 

why this is happening to our pensioners today.  When we passed a law in this House to protect 

those returning to the Cook Islands, particularly on the island of Aitutaki, why are these elderly 

individuals, returning home from New Zealand, now being pursued over tax matters? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thanks to the Member for Amuri-Ureia for 

bringing this issue in Araura to our attention.  From what I understand, our people returning from 

New Zealand who are receiving the New Zealand pension are exempt from paying tax under this 

law.    Specifically,  those  receiving  the  New  Zealand  pension  fall  under  the  Outer  Islands  tax 

guidelines, which allow for the first $60,000 to be tax-free.  I'm not clear on the specific tax issues 

that the Inland Revenue is pursuing concerning our elderly people. 

</span></div><div><span>However, I have had individuals approach me regarding their personal tax matters.  It is often more 

beneficial for these individuals to discuss their specific tax issues with us privately.  Their concerns 

may not necessarily relate to the tax-free threshold; they might involve other sources of income 

for which they owe taxes or cases where their income exceeds the $60,000 limit, making them 

liable for tax.  These are matters that would be better addressed outside of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; the Honourable Tina Browne; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to everyone in the House 

today.  My question is directed to the Minister of Justice.  We will soon be discussing Parliament 

Paper  No.  155,  which  is  an  interim  report  from  the  Bills,  Petitions,  and  Papers  Committee.    I 

</span><span>understand there was a roadshow that visited New Zealand earlier this year, which we discussed 

in the House.  It was recommended that a report from this roadshow be submitted to Parliament, 

with a proposed submission date by the end of June this year.  I would like to ask the Minister if 

there is an update regarding this report.  During the roadshow, topics such as occupation rights and 

leases were discussed with our people.  I raise this matter because some of the issues addressed 

</span><span>with our people in New Zealand and Australia may be relevant to the review conducted by the 

Bills, Petitions, and Papers Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister of Justice; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  In response to the question from the Leader of the Opposition, and with 

the sudden departure of the former Secretary of Justice, Mr Jonassen, and the introduction of our 

new Secretary of Justice, Mr Peter Graham.   Unfortunately,  the report that  was intended to be 

</span></div><div><span>772 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>tabled was not completed.  However, I have spoken with Secretary Peter Graham about reviewing 

the existing legislation under the Ministry of Justice and how we can effectively move forward on 

the issues you have raised in this House.  I will make every effort to ensure that a comprehensive 

report is finalised, reflecting the perspectives and concerns of our people in both Australia and 

New Zealand regarding these matters.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I wanted to ask a Supplementary Question to the Minister 

of Justice, but I will hold off until his report to Parliament is presented.  My question is directed to 

the Minister of Corrective Services.  While this isn't meant to be a praise, I have observed that the 

management of our Corrective Services is functioning effectively under your leadership.  It seems 

that you are handling the responsibilities well.  Given the challenges currently facing the Police 

Department, do you have any strategies or ideas for collaboration that could help improve their 

situation? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak.  I also want to thank 

the Honourable Member for Matavera for his question.  Regarding the Police Department and how 

it aligns with Corrective Services, I do.  However, I know that the Police fall under the jurisdiction 

of the Honourable Prime Minister, who brings far greater wisdom and expertise to this issue than 

I do. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge that our Honourable Prime Minister is a clever 

person.  Yesterday, we discussed the appointment of community police officers, and we proposed 

</span><span>that this initiative be integrated into the police structure under the Prime Minister’s oversight.</span></div><div><span>In response to your question, I want to highlight that the Prime Minister has agreed to enhance the 

Community Policing program in the districts.   As it is written in Ecclesiastes 3:1,  </span><span>"There is an 

appointed time for everything, and a time for every affair under the heavens." </span><span> We will await the 

Prime Minister's recommendation on when this initiative will take place.  Takitumu and Puaikura 

have submitted their requests, but we are still waiting on Te-Au-O-Tonga.  Therefore, my request, 

</span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister,  is  to  also  include  Avatiu  and  Tupapa  in  this  initiative;  for  now, 

Takuvaine can be managed as it is, and we will ensure its needs are met. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much Honourable Member for Matavera for your question.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, at the conclusion of our Sitting today, I suggest that you 

meet with the Member of Parliament for Matavera to address these issues and provide assistance 

regarding the police department case.  Thank you.
