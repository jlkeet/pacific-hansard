</span></div><div><span>To  all  our  public  servants  in  Titikaveka,  especially  those  supporting  community  work  in  our

</span></div><div><span>To my committee members who have stood by me, including our patron, Papa Tiki Matapo, Adrian 

Tehotahi,  our  chairman,  Tua  Russell,  my  campaign  manager,  and  all  the  committee  members, 

greetings to you all. Just a reminder to our committee members: we have a meeting scheduled for 

tomorrow at Te Atukura at 5 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Additionally,  I  want  to  announce  the  formation  of  a  new  organisation  in  the  compost  area  of 

</span><span>Titikaveka.  I’ve heard that the unicorn fish (ume) is in abundance and rich in fat.  Dyson and Pero, 

</span><span>please give me a call when it is cooked, I promise to keep it a secret! 

</span></div><div><span>There is a special event taking place at one of our schools in Titikaveka, the Papaaroa School's 

Prize Giving Day.  Following that, another special program is scheduled for the following week.  

I would like to invite you all to come out and support these wonderful events.  

</span></div><div><span>On behalf of my wife Gina Kenning Williams, and our children, we wish you all a joyful Christmas 

and a prosperous New Year.  Thank you very much! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I kindly ask that you refrain from campaigning within 

this Honourable House!  I see the Honourable Minister George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to your staff!  Merry Christmas and 

Happy New Year to you all.  Honourable Members of this House, Kia Orana to each of you.  To 

the Leader of our country, the Honourable Prime Minister Mark Brown, to those standing with 

him, including Deputy Prime Minister Albert Nicholas, and all Cabinet Ministers and Members, 

Kia Orana to you all.  Kia Orana to the Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne, and 

your team.  Kia Orana also to the Members of other parties, including the United Cook Islands 

Party and Independent Members. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to the people of Tupapa/Maraerenga, especially to those who have been entrusted with 

traditional responsibilities.  Kia Orana to our children as well!  Thank you to everyone across the 

Cook Islands who is tuning in to this live broadcast. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the government for the valuable work they have done for our people.  Since 

I joined this Parliament in 2010, I have witnessed many positive initiatives from the government.  

Today, we see improvements in our water supply, and as our Prime Minister has indicated, we will 

not have to pay for water.  I urge everyone not to create unnecessary concerns regarding this issue 

</span><span>since there will be no costs involved.  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister, for delivering that 

message. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding seabed minerals, I stand firmly with those who object to their extraction. I suggest that 

</span><span>while we can take our fair share, we leave yours in the ocean.

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge those who are criticising Mr George Angene.  While there may 

be complaints, I want to say to you, my friends, that I love you.  As the Word of God teaches us 

to "love one another," we must continue to show love, even in the face of criticism. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, I would like to thank Maru Isaia in the village of Tupapa, who is managing our community 

dome and making it available for our people to use.  As the president of this organisation, he allows 

various events to be held without charging any fees, and he ensures that it is not used for political 

advantage  or  gain.    He  is  also  supported  by  Tere  Strickland,  the  president  of  our  Sports 

Association. 

</span></div><div><span>On behalf of myself, my wife, my partner, and all our children, both by marriage and outside of it, 

here and abroad, I greet you all.  I am truly thankful to the Lord for transforming my life and, most 

importantly,  for  granting  me  the  ability  to  give  back  to  our  people  the  blessings  that  God  has 

bestowed upon me.  

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Minister cited a chant 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Agnes 

Armstrong; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  Tangike and Kia Orana to the people of Mangaia. Tangike in the Name 

of our Lord.  Kia Orana to Numangatini Ariki, our traditional leaders, the Mayor, the Executive 

Officer, all Ministers from various denominations, Island Council Members, and to all our people, 

both young and old. 

</span></div><div><span>To my people of Nga Ivi e Rua, Tangike to you all.  As your humble servant, I would like to take 

a moment to share my heartfelt greetings to you for the upcoming festive season.  Christmas is not 

only a time to celebrate the birth of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, but also a time for love, 

unity, and reflection.  It is a time to celebrate and share our thanks for the many blessings we have 

shared as a community and as a nation. 

</span></div><div><span>In Mangaia, we are known for our strength, resilience and generosity.  Let us carry those values 

into this special time remembering to care for one another, support our family and celebrate the 

</span><span>truth for it of Christmas - aroa and sharing. 

</span></div><div><span>To our elders, thank you for your wisdom and guidance.  To our young people, continue to dream 

big and work hard; you are the future of Mangaia.  To everyone near and far, may your homes be 

filled with laughter, your hearts at peace and your days with joy.  As we look ahead to the new 

</span><span>year, let us work together to build a brighter future for our beautiful island and all who calls it 

home.  Thank you all for your support and your love. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Speaker of the House and staff of Parliament, Prime Minister and your Cabinet Ministers, 

</span><span>Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  all  my  colleagues  in  this  House,  I  wish  you  all  a  very  Merry 

</span><span>Christmas and happy new year.  All the best for Christmas and new year, God bless you all.  Thank 

you.

working  in  this  Honourable  House.    Kia  Orana  to  our  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet 

Ministers,  and  all  Members  of  Parliament.    To  the  Opposition,  your  Leader,  and  Independent 

Members,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    Additionally,  I  want  to  include  every  family,  spouses,  and 

children.  May the blessings of the Lord extend to each and every one of you. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I would like to acknowledge the people of Atiu as we celebrate the festive season and the 

end of the year.  To the three pillars of the island, traditional leaders, the three Chiefs, and the four 

leading Mataiapo, who together are known as the Seven Black Standing Flowers of Koro Pava.  

Kia Orana also to all our people, including our children, and I look forward to meeting with you 

very soon.  To the leaders of our Churches, my regards to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to those who uphold the law, our Executive Council, the Island Council, and the Island 

Government.  I commend all of you who are tirelessly serving our people.  To our business people 

who contribute to our community, and to the elderly men and women, the young men and women, 

and all our children, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all.  We are grateful to God for 

His guidance and protection over each of you.  My thoughts especially go out to the families who 

have lost loved ones during this time.  I apologise for not mentioning this earlier, but I would like 

to share my deepest condolences to Aunty Melafi George, Mama Mina Paratainga, Aunty Akepapa 

Samuel, and Papa Rouru George.  Our deepest sympathy to you all during this difficult period. 

</span></div><div><span>We must not forget our children from the disabled association, and today, I wear a purple dress in 

their support.  Additionally, we are wearing white ribbons to honour and promote a message of 

non-violence, promoting an end to domestic violence in relationships throughout our country.  I 

call upon our leaders to encourage and take a stand against domestic violence in all its forms. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to our people residing on Rarotonga, throughout the Cook Islands, and overseas, Kia 

Orana to you all.  To our young people, please listen, as the saying goes: "Tread slowly, my child, 

so that you can clearly see where you are stepping."  

</span></div><div><span>As we enter this festive season, please be mindful of your actions and take care of your health to 

</span><span>minimise the risk of illness.  Remember, it is important to protect yourselves so that we do not 

place blame on the Ministry of Health or any other organisation. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, thank you to the Leader of our country for providing a bonus of $150 to our parents, 

children,  and  beneficiaries.    We  are  thankful  to  God  for  the  blessings  bestowed  upon  us,  even 

</span><span>during challenging times. 

</span></div><div><span>I will speak on behalf of the Member for Areora and Ngatiarua, and I will take this opportunity to 

use her time. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge all the Ministries under my oversight, Ministry of Health, the Ministry 

of Agriculture, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Cook Islands National Superannuation Fund.  To 

the dedicated men and women working within these Ministries, I want to remind you that you are

</span></div><div><span>our most valuable assets.  Your efforts in providing essential services are crucial, and I encourage 

you to continue working hard.  Please know that I am also committed to doing my part within the 

government to ensure that we direct the resources necessary to meet the needs of our people.  With 

God's help, together we will achieve our goals. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to highlight that we have new nurses graduating from their nursing studies.  They 

began their education here in the Cook Islands before continuing their studies in New Zealand, 

and next Friday they will receive their well-deserved recognition.  We look forward to seeing more 

of  our  children  take  on  the  challenge  of  pursuing  nursing,  starting  their  studies  here  and  then 

completing them in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to the young mothers who are expecting; you are a blessing to yourselves and, 

above all, to our nation.  If you are smoking, please consider stopping and focus on nurturing your 

child.  Additionally, we acknowledge those who care for our elderly parents and those who serve 

as caregivers.  You play an essential role in our communities, including looking after our disabled 

individuals. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to our people in prison and those in hospital beds.  As we go through this festive 

season in remembrance of our Christ and Saviour, may His right-hand lead, guide, and touch each 

of you so that you may not lose strength.   Kia Orana and best of luck. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Before I open the Floor to another Member, I want to acknowledge that some 

may  choose  not  to  speak  at  this  moment.    If  that  is  the  case,  you  will  have  the  opportunity  to 

address your constituents when you return to your individual constituencies.  Keep in mind that 

you will be meeting with them face-to-face, sharing  moments  together, and  providing for their 

needs as well.  I see the Honourable Member Tereapii Maki-Kavana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:</span><span>“Bless the Lord, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy 

</span><span>name! Bless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all His ben</span><span>efits.”</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to all in this Honourable House.  I would like to extend my 

greetings, first and foremost, to my people from Aitutaki.  From the Head of the island to the tail, 

Kia Orana to you all, and I am dedicated to providing assistance and support to the entire island.  

</span><span>Above  all,  Kia  Orana  to  my  constituents  in  Arutanga,  Reureu,  and  Nikaupara.    To  my  people 

listening to your Honourable Member, and to the six different Churches within our community, 

Kia Orana to you all.  To every Leader of each Church, may the Lord bless you as you guide and 

support your Congregations.  I thank you all for your continued prayers for our government; it is 

through your support that we remain stronger than ever.  Thank you once again. 

</span></div><div><span>To the two traditional chiefs within Are-Nikau, Tamatoa and Teurukura, as well as the family and 

traditional title holders within our constituency, Kia Orana and may God bless both of you.  I also 

want to acknowledge our young athletes involved in various sports.  Thank you for your consistent 

</span><span>victories in our competitions.  May the Lord bless you today and in the future.  Thank you once 

</span><span>again for representing our constituency with pride.

undertaken, such as cutting down trees to protect our homes during hurricane seasons. 

</span></div><div><span>I also want to remember our elders who are unwell.  May the Lord keep and guide you, my fellow 

elders.  May He provide the support you need and grant you long life.  I pray that the good Lord 

gives strength to your children as they care for you in your time of illness. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  to  my  dedicated  committee,  starting  with  my  patron,  Papa  Tunui  Mati.    If  you  are 

listening, Kia Orana to you, Papa. To my Chairman, Papa Tupuariki Puna, and his assistant, Papa 

Ngaa Upu (Jnr), who is currently in New Zealand for a medical referral, bless you both my elders.  

We  look  forward  to  reuniting  upon  your  return.    To  our  Treasurer,  Amiria  Karore,  and  your 

husband,  may  the  Lord  bless  you  for  your  care  of  our  constituency's  finances,  along  with  our

acknowledge  our  Assistant  Secretary,  Tuaine  Rota,  who  held  everything  together  during  your 

absence.  We are fortunate to have a strong and active committee, and I thank each and every one 

of you for your contributions. 

</span></div><div><span>As we enter the festive season, I encourage everyone to act responsibly and avoid any foolishness.  

As  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  the  Are-Nikau  constituency,  I  want  to  wish  you  all  a  joyful 

Christmas and a prosperous New Year.  On behalf of my wife, our children, our in-laws, and all

On behalf of the Mangaian people from the island of Mangaia, thank you to you all who visited us 

during the Mangaia 200 Gospel Celebration.  Thank you for your support and thank you for your 

generosity. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to share a Scripture from the Bible: </span><span>“Give, and it will be given</span><span> to you.  A good measure, 

</span><span>pressed  down,  shaken  together  and  running  over,  will  be  poured  into  your  lap.    For  with  the 

</span><span>measure you use, it will be measured to you.” (Luke 6:38).</span><span>  Based on this text, I send you my 

heartfelt love from Mangaia.

children, from the youngest to those yet to be born, as previously noted by the Honourable Minister 

for the Ministry of Health.  Tangike to everyone!

you for your hard work.  Today, we are called the </span><span>‘</span><span>Golden City.</span><span>’</span></div><div><span>791

people  of  Tamarua  living  in  New  Zealand.    To  his  wife,  Mama  Tauranga  Vaitapere,  and  your 

family, my condolences to you.  Your loss is deeply felt by all of us.  Tangike.

</span></div><div><span>Wishing you all a joyful giving experience this Christmas season, and may you be prepared for 

the  incoming  bills  in  the  new  year.    May  you  all  remain  strong  in  your  generosity  and  in  life.  

Amen.

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Kia Orana in the Name of the Lord.  There goes a Penrhyn song, </span><span>“Just the 

</span><span>scent of your delightful fragrance is all I need (kia songi uake au i to kakara, kua rava ua au i 

reira)</span><span>.”</span><span>  Oh! My Tongareva! 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to my people, to the three pillars of our island, the Church and the two villages of Tautua 

and Omoka, Kia Orana to you all in the Name of our Lord.  To the Catholic Church, Papa Kati, 

and your congregation, Kia Orana in the Name of the Lord.  To the island government and the 

Mayor, who is currently in New Zealand for medical reasons, we pray for your safe return home 

in good health, so that we can meet again in joy and togetherness.  To the island council, Kia Orana 

in the Name of the Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Island Government, our Executive Officer, and all the dedicated staff on our island, Kia 

Orana in the Name of God.  I truly believe we will be meeting soon, but for now, Merry Christmas 

and Happy New Year to you all.

</span><span>to  you  all  in  the  Name  of  God.    To  the  King’s  Representative,  Sir  Tom  Marsters,  and  Lady

government employees living and working in our village, may you continue your commendable 

efforts for the benefit of our country.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  acknowledge  our  business  community  in  Ngatangiia,  and  as  your  Member  of 

Parliament,  I  sincerely  appreciate  your  support  throughout  the  year  and  wish  you  and  your 

businesses  a  prosperous  Christmas  and  a  Happy  New  Year.    I  look  forward  to  your  continued 

support in our community and its projects.  As mentioned, I am committed to collaborating with 

our business community, recognising the strength of our tourism sector and its positive impact on 

the  economy  of  our  people  and  our  nation  as  a  whole.    Therefore,  Merry  Christmas  to  all  the 

business  owners in  Muri and Ngatangiia.   I would also  like to  acknowledge the various  ethnic 

groups in Ngatangiia, including the Filipinos, Indonesians, Fijians, Samoans, Tongans, and others 

I may not have mentioned.  On behalf of my wife and myself, I wish you all a Merry Christmas

you in the next general election. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you to everyone in Ngatangiia for your support.  Merry Christmas to all, especially to the 

elderly who are unwell, our children, and the different sports groups.  Kia Orana from my wife

</span></div><div><span>To families affected by loss, please know that if you are grieving, we share in your sorrow.  We 

remember those who have returned to Manihiki and those who have been laid to rest overseas.  

Kia Orana to those families, and may the Lord provide us all with comfort during these times. 

</span></div><div><span>We will not forget our children who are working diligently in service at Takamoa, as well as our 

former president and community leaders from Manihiki in New Zealand, Principal Akamura and 

others.  May God grant you the strength and wisdom as you strive to serve our people.  Merry 

Christmas and Happy New Year.  We hope you have a wonderful Christmas Day, filled with family 

togetherness, and take a moment to remember those who are not with us and those living overseas.   

</span></div><div><span>To our people living on and caring for our island of Manihiki, I look forward to meeting with you 

in the near future, possibly in the New Year.  Please be patient as we await the commencement of 

work on our airport.  Though progress may seem slow, we are steadily moving forward.  The Prime 

Minister has assured me with a smile that we are making headway.  Thank you, Honourable Prime 

Minister, and Merry Christmas to you! 

</span></div><div><span>In closing, thank you to our Chaplain for your diligent work in leading our daily services.  To you, 

Mr Speaker, and all parliamentary staff, including the kitchen ladies who take care of us until the 

end of our sessions, thank you for your commitment.  

</span></div><div><span>To everyone in this house, the Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, my colleagues in 

government, the Opposition, and all parties represented here, may the Lord guide and support us 

in the remaining days of this year.  In conclusion, I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy 

New Year and may God bless us all.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  I see the Honourable Steven Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. MATAPO:</span><span>  As you mentioned earlier, I will not be sharing my Season greetings to the 

families in Mauke, as they will be sending their greetings to Rarotonga instead; so please bear with 

me. 

</span></div><div><span>My first Christmas greetings go to the Speaker of the House, Honourable Tai Tura, the Clerk of 

the House, Tangata Vainerere, and your dedicated team. 

</span></div><div><span>Additionally,  I  would like to  extend a special thank you to  Garth Henderson and your team at 

MFEM,  Elizabeth  Wright-Koteka  and  your  team  at  ICI,  Bob  Williams  and  your  team  at  the 

Ministry of Health, Aaron Jansen and your team at CIIC, Mia Teaurima and your team at OPM,

</span><span>at the Ministry of Agriculture, Peter Graham and your team at the Ministry of Justice, Desmond 

Wilden at Audit, Teroro Totini and your team at BTIB, Jeremy Goodwin and your team at Cook 

Islands Tourism, as well as many others.  Your continuous support is truly appreciated.  Thank 

you all! 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the teams at Air Rarotonga, Taio Shipping, and Cook Islands 

General Transport.  Thank you very much for your ongoing support and excellent service to our 

passengers,  as  well  as  for  handling  cargo  and  cargo  airline  services  to  Mauke.    I  especially

</span></div><div><span>appreciate Taio Shipping and Cook Islands General Transport for their continuous sea-freighting 

services.  I also want to thank Island Hopper for providing Island Tours to Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Mauke  community  leaders  here  in  Rarotonga,  including  President  Tuaine  Manavaroa, 

Akaiti Purea, Laura Tauira, Harriot Raui, and your team, thank you for your invaluable support 

during the Cook Islands Games.  You have truly made us proud. 

</span></div><div><span>To the people of Mauke here in Rarotonga, as well as those in the outer islands, New Zealand, 

Australia, and around the world.  To my family, the Matapo Matapo family, the Tikitau Kokaua 

family,  Papa  Jake  and  Mama  Kate  Numanga's  family,  my  wife  Jenna  Numanga  Matapo,  our 

children, and the Tina &amp; Co. family, thank you.  We have come a long way this year; we have 

worked hard and achieved so much.  These accomplishments would not have been possible without 

your support, and the success of our efforts is rooted in our commitment to our Lord and Saviour, 

Jesus Christ.  As the word of God says in Proverbs 16:3: "Commit thy works unto the Lord, and 

thy thoughts shall be established." 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge and thank the key agencies that will continue to work, serve, or 

be on standby throughout the festive season to ensure our safety.  This includes the Cook Islands 

Police,  the  Ministry  of  Health,  Meteorological  Services,  Disaster  Management,  Fire  Brigades, 

Police Maritime, Air Rarotonga, and our Church leaders.  Thank you all for your dedicated service 

and your prayers. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  Mark  Brown  and  the  government  of  the  day,  Members  of 

Parliament,  and  all  Members  of  this  house,  on  behalf  of  the  RAC,  the  island  government, 

traditional leaders, the people of Mauke, my committee, and my family, Mauke sincerely thanks 

you for your support.    Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and may God bless us all.  Kia 

Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Member Tim Varu; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet 

Ministers, and Members of Parliament.  Kia Orana to the Opposition and every Member present.  

Kia Orana to the staff of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>First and foremost, I want to give praise to God for the opportunity to be here in this House.  I am 

grateful for the wisdom and knowledge He has bestowed upon me in fulfilling my role today.  I 

would also like to thank the two denominations in my constituency, the Catholic Church and the 

AOG in the Ruaau suburb.  Additionally, I want to acknowledge the two Government Agencies in 

</span><span>my area, starting with Infrastructure Cook Islands.  Kia Orana to you all!  I commend the work 

you are doing to repair our roads.  On my way to Parliament today, I passed by your team working 

diligently on the roads.  I suggested that hot-mixing the roads would be a more efficient approach 

instead of merely filling the potholes.  Thank you for your exceptional efforts! 

</span></div><div><span>We  also  have  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  and  I  would  like  to  thank  everyone  there  for  their 

outstanding work and for encouraging our people to engage in planting.  Agriculture is vital for 

</span><span>our community’s well</span><span>-being.  I want to thank the staff at Arorangi Prison for their courageous

</span></div><div><span>efforts,  as  well  as  those  in  the  Waste  Management  sector  who  diligently  manage  sewage  and 

rubbish.  Your hard work is greatly appreciated.  Regarding our Rarotonga Hospital, I am uncertain 

if  it  falls  within  my  constituency  or  under  the  constituency  of  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Nikao/Panama, but I still want to thank them for their excellent service.  Thank you all! 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to wish all the elderly members of my constituency a Merry Christmas 

and a Happy New Year.  May God bless you throughout this festive season.  Merry Christmas also 

to all our youth, both girls and boys, as well as to our little children, including our new born babies.  

May God bless you all.  Thank you to our Leader, the Honourable Member for Akaoa, for his 

dedicated hard work.  He is currently engaged in activities within our village, which is why I am 

here to represent us all. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, on behalf of my wife, my children, and my grandchildren, I would like to thank the people 

of  Ruaau.    We  wish  you  all  a  Merry  Christmas  and  a  Happy  New  Year.    Thank  you  to  my 

Committee Members for the wonderful work you do for our village.  Merry Christmas and Happy 

New Year to each of you.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member Toanui Isamaela. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the Bible tells us in Psalm 85:10, </span><span>“Love and faithfulness meet 

together; righteousness and peace kiss each other.”</span><span>  I want to wish you and your wife a Merry 

Christmas.    Merry  Christmas  to  our  current  government  for  leading  our  country,  and  to  the 

Opposition  as  well.    Merry  Christmas  to  your  staff  as  well,  Mr  Speaker.    In  addition,  Merry 

Christmas and a Happy New Year to all our people in both the Southern Group islands and the 

Northern Group islands. 

</span></div><div><span>To the people of Aitutaki, I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  To the three 

pillars of our island, Kia Orana to each of you.  A Merry Christmas as well to the constituents in 

my district, especially to my elders, who have shown great strength throughout the year.  As we 

reach the end of this year, I am grateful for your good health.  Let us not follow the example of the 

people of Are-Nikau, who have faced illness.  I see your strength; please prioritise your health 

during this festive season.  While I initially hesitated to share my festive greetings today, we have 

set a time to connect, and I will be back to see you very soon.  In fact, we will meet again on 18 

</span><span>December 2024, where I will bring food, ice cream, and drinks to share with you.  This is just one 

way we in this Honourable House can maintain our relationship with you all and to assure you that 

your Member of Parliament will be returning soon. 

</span></div><div><span>To  our  cultural  groups,  I  want  to  remind  you  that  our  celebrations  will  begin  next  week 

</span><span>Wednesday, 11 December 2024.  I ask that you all wait for my return so that we can come together 

to celebrate as a community.  To all my elders, youth members, children, and our babies, both born 

and unborn, please know that your Member will be coming back to bless you this Christmas and 

New  Year.      I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  all  the  business  owners  in  my  constituency, 

</span><span>especially those involved in tourism, such as our local shops and services.  Merry Christmas and 

</span><span>a Happy New Year to you all!

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>With  the  number  of  denominations  already  present  on  our  island,  we  kindly  request  that  no 

additional denominations be introduced to Aitutaki, as we currently have three.  We believe it may 

be best to reserve new denominations for Rarotonga.  Let us unite as one community during this 

festive season. 

</span></div><div><span>In closing, I would like to share a verse from the Bible, Isaiah 40:31: </span><span>“But those who hope in the 

</span><span>Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow 

</span><span>weary; they will walk and not be faint.”</span><span>Halleluiah, Amen. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, Tingika Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  ELIKANA:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  everyone.    Before  I  share  my  festive  greetings  with  my 

constituency  and  the  people  of  the  Cook  Islands,  I  initially  intended  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the 

Northern Group, as I am the only male representative from that side.  However, observing all the 

women Parliamentarians here today, and knowing the importance on gender equality, it seems they 

have all taken the opportunity to speak ahead of me.  As a result, I find that I have lost 11 minutes 

of my speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, before I share my views, I believe it is appropriate to make an announcement in this 

Parliament  for  our  people  who  are  listening.    Some  time  ago,  we  introduced  a  proposal  to  the 

Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to  support one of our Members' inclusion in  one of 

their  committees.    I  am  proud  to  announce  that  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable  Tina  Browne,  Member  of  Parliament  for  Rakahanga,  has  been  selected  as  an 

Executive Member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for the Pacific Ocean.  Please 

join me in giving a round of applause for the Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, I would now like to express my Christmas greetings to the people of my Constituency.  I 

will not take long because the phone line has not been fixed by Vodafone and the radio has not 

been hooked up in Pukapuka yet.  I believe that this message will be broadcasted on our livestream 

and hopefully they will hear my message.  First of all, Kia Orana in the Name of our Mighty God.  

Praise the Lord for this opportunity to speak to you live online.  To our Chief, Kia Orana in the 

Name of our Lord.  To the Mayor and Council Members, Kia Orana to you all in the Name of our 

Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Minister continued speaking in the Pukapuka language 

</span></div><div><span>To our Pukapuka people here in  Rarotonga, this is  a friendly reminder to all of us on our get-

together with our Tongareva people this coming Saturday, at the tennis court from 3 p.m.  Please 

</span><span>come.  Atawaiwolo. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member Tai Herman; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  First of all</span><span>, Kia Orana to our King’s Representative, Sir Tom Marsters, and 

</span><span>Lady Marsters; Merry Christmas to you both.  Merry Christmas also to you, Mr Speaker, and your

wish  them  a  Merry  Christmas.    To  my  people  in  Aitutaki,  Chiefs  Tamatoa,  Teurukura, 

Vaeruarangi, and Manarangi, Kia Orana to you all.  To the various denominations on the island, 

Church Ministers, your families, and all the different Churches, Kia Orana to you all.  

</span></div><div><span>To the Mayor and Island Council Members, and to all public servants and staff under the island 

government, Kia Orana to you all.  In my constituency, Kia Orana to the Chairman of the village, 

Committee Members, and everyone responsible for caring for our three villages: Vaipae, Vaipeka, 

and Tautu, Kia Orana to you all.  

</span></div><div><span>To all our people in Vai-Vai-Tau, including my supporters and those who wish to support me in 

the  future,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    Finally,  to  my  Committee  Members  of  Team  Tango,  our 

Chairperson, and all members, we have an exciting event coming up soon.  When I return, we will 

gather together to celebrate the Christmas festivities. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, God be wi</span><span>th you all and I hope that you will all enjoy your Christmas and New Year’s 

</span><span>break.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member Robert Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Kia Orana everyone.  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker, Honourable Prime Minister, 

Cabinet Ministers, and Members of Parliament on both sides of this Honourable House.  Kia Orana 

to  you all, as well as to your families and supporters in  your individual constituencies.   Merry 

Christmas and Happy New Year to each of you.  

</span></div><div><span>To the people of the Cook Islands, the three pillars,  our Chiefs, our Churches, and the various 

denominations, Church Ministers and all your Church Members: Kia Orana to you all!  Wishing 

you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and may God bless you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Chief Tinomana, your tribe, and your  families,  Christmas greetings to  you all.   To the various 

</span><span>denominations within our Vaka, from Tuoro to Toreaiva, Church Ministers, your partners, and all 

Church  Members,  Kia  Orana!    To  all  the  business  owners  in  our  village  of  Puaikura,  Merry 

Christmas and Happy New Year to you all.  We hope the coming year brings happiness for each 

of us.  To the two schools in our village, Rutaki School and Arorangi School, Principals, PTA 

members, teachers, and our schoolchildren, Kia Orana!  To our youth groups and cultural groups, 

</span><span>I wish you all the best.  As mentioned earlier, please take care of one another during this festive 

season.  And to our elderly and those in the hospital, may God bless you with many more years to 

come. 

</span></div><div><span>To everyone in my constituency of Akaoa, including my Chairman, Committee Members, and all 

</span><span>those involved, Kia Orana to you all.  I will not greet everyone individually due to time constraints, 

but  I  want  to  thank  every  family,  including  my  own,  for  your  support.    Despite  the  diverse 

personalities within our  various groups,  I hope  we can encourage better relationships  with  one

</span></div><div><span>another.  As stated in 2 Timothy 1:7, </span><span>“For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives 

</span><span>us power, love, and self-</span><span>discipline.”</span><span>  This is a vital message for us in Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span>In  light  of  the  challenges  we  have  faced  with  our  children  this  month,  I  want  to  encourage  all 

parents, who will look after our children?  We will!  We must not hand over our responsibility to 

others.  This is the core issue we are currently dealing with.  While we prefer not to discuss this 

publicly, we know we can address it ourselves.  Let this serve as a reminder to all parents that these 

are  our  children.    The  government  is  doing  a  lot  to  support  them,  but  we  cannot  rely  on  the 

government to fix everything.  We all have obligations for our Churches and those leading our 

activities also have responsibilities to uphold.  My request is simple, please look after our children.  

Do not give up on them.  While the issues may seem small now, this is the right time to resolve 

them.  This is my encouragement to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding our Police Officers, as confirmed by the Prime Minister, we are awaiting feedback from 

the review committee, which will provide us with a plan to help ourselves.   

</span></div><div><span>In closing, God bless you all.  May you enjoy your Christmas, and I look forward to seeing you 

again next year.  Kia Orana, and thank you!

</span></div><div><span>MR W. KAREROA:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker.  I had not planned to speak today, as I was hoping 

my two sisters here would represent our island of Mangaia.  However, I realised they overlooked 

acknowledging some of the most important individuals in their constituencies, and that is why I 

felt compelled to stand up and address you all. 

</span></div><div><span>First of all, Kia Orana to the Honourable Prime Minister, your Cabinet Ministers, and all Members 

on  your  side.    I  also  want  to  acknowledge  the  Honourable  Members  from  our  side,  including 

Honourable Teariki Heather and your two colleagues, as well as the Honourable Toanui Isamaela 

for his remarks from last night.  Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the leader of our side, 

Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne; Tangike. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to take a moment to acknowledge Ms Tangi Mataiti, who has just returned from New 

</span><span>Zealand and is currently unwell.  She is from the constituency of Honourable Member Tetangi 

Matapo, and it seems she had forgotten to acknowledge her.  I would also like to acknowledge our 

GR from the constituency of Honourable Agnes Armstrong, Mr Poroa Arokapiti, who was also 

not mentioned.  Christmas greetings to you, Poroa!  Additionally, I would like to share that I had 

the honour of being the best man for Poroa and was his father as well for giving him away, so my 

</span><span>warmest greetings to you all! 

</span></div><div><span>To my constituency, I find myself hesitant to acknowledge each individual for fear of forgetting 

someone and causing disappointment.  Nevertheless, I would like to start with the three pillars, the 

</span><span>various  denominations  within  my  constituency.    Kia  Orana  to  you  all!    Tangike  to  our  Chief 

</span><span>Numangatini and to our Executive Officer, Anthony, for your hard work over the years.  He is the 

only Executive Officer who listens to me, and it would be a significant loss if he were to retire.  I 

also  want  to  thank  our  new  Mayor,  Ngateina  Rangi,  who  recently  presided  over  a  meeting

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>regarding  a  potential  donation  from  a  millionaire  for  her  village.    That  was  the  focus  of  our 

discussions.  Thank you, Bruce, for your thoughtfulness in this matter. 

</span></div><div><span>To my Committee members, Chairperson, I cannot remember who they are because I terminated 

the first crew I had and now, I have appointed new committee members; Kia Orana to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>To the most important person in my life, my wife, who is home alone, bless you.  I consider myself 

incredibly lucky to have you and to share four wonderful children, despite any challenges we may 

face.  Thank you for everything, and I will see you on Friday, as Parliament will adjourn early 

today.  Lastly, I would like to acknowledge my daughter, who just returned to Dunedin.  She came 

to visit me out of her kindness, as I had not seen her in such a long time, and this was our first 

reunion in a while. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everyone here in the Cook Islands.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  Honourable Minister Vaine Mokoroa. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  On behalf of Nikao, I would like to wish you

Parliament,  as  well  as  everyone  in  this  Honourable  House  and  those  in  the  kitchen,  Merry 

Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all!  To our listeners tuning in on the radio, and to the 

</span><span>King’s Rep</span><span>resentative and his wife, as well as the Honourable Prime Minister and the Members 

of Parliament on both sides, from Toanui Isamaela to this end, I wish you all a Merry Christmas 

and a Happy New Year! 

</span></div><div><span>To our Churches, I do not have much to add at this time, as we have just formed a new Committee 

</span><span>to address the issues outlined in the Cook Islands News.  That said, I want to share my warmest 

wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all denominations in the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>To the House of Ariki and all those holding specific titles, especially to the new Teikamata Ariki, 

Mrs Mii Kauvai, I want to congratulate you on your recent anointment to this position last Friday.  

</span><span>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you and the entire Mitiaro community.  The Member

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I have plenty of great prizes here for the Democratic Party.  And to the staff of the Opposition 

Office, Merry Christmas to you all! 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly,  to  the  people  of  Rakahanga,  Raks-City,  Raka-Hard,  Merry  Christmas!    Our  Mayor  is 

currently  in  New  Zealand  due  to  illness.    I  want  to  convey  my  happiness  regarding  the  recent 

council elections, where only one council member was selected; it is wonderful to see the entire 

island  come  together  in  this  effort.    Merry  Christmas  to  all  council  members!    Our  Executive 

Officer returned to Rakahanga this morning, and I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.  A Merry 

Christmas as well to every staff member on the island.  

</span></div><div><span>To the three denominations on the island, the Seventh Day Adventist, Catholic, and CICC, Merry 

Christmas to  all of you!    To our elderly people,  although we may be few, I wish you a Merry 

Christmas and a Happy New Year.  I hope for the very best for you, and I look forward to wishing 

you Merry Christmas again next year.  To the President of Rakahanga, who is here in Rarotonga, 

and your Executive team, I encourage you all to continue your great work.  With our Constitution 

celebration approaching next year, we need to prepare for this significant event, including ensuring 

our hostel is ready.  Lastly, to the women's council on Rakahanga, on behalf of my family and 

myself, we wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  Thank you! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister, Mark Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  everyone,  especially  to  all  our 

listeners tuning in on the radio.  As I am the last speaker for today, I have the privilege of speaking 

without a time restriction, so I will share what I need to share.  However, since our people are 

accustomed to hearing me on the radio every Friday regarding our program, I will keep my remarks 

brief.  

</span></div><div><span>As we enter the festive season this year, many of us will be working, particularly our Police force, 

Doctors, Nurses caring for our hospital, and our prison guards.  Some Members of Parliament and 

Ministers will also be on duty around the clock during Christmas.  

</span></div><div><span>For those in our community who are struggling, I believe that the Christmas bonus announced by 

our Minister today will provide some relief for families this year.  This bonus will be distributed 

</span><span>this Christmas.  We understand that the cost of living has risen, and the government has decided 

to increase the bonus from $50 to $150 per person.  Thank you to everyone involved in putting 

this bonus together to support our families.  This bonus will be available for our elderly receiving 

the Old Age Pension, as well as for children on the Child Benefit, and those receiving Infirmed 

and Destitute Benefits.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this year has been significant for us, as we have collected an impressive amount of 

revenue.  I am confident that next year will be even greater, especially with our upcoming 60</span><span>th</span><span>

Celebration.  My Christmas message to everyone is to remain calm during the festive season.  If 

</span><span>we choose to celebrate and party, let us do it responsibly by taking care of each other and ensuring 

</span><span>that we prevent any issues or accidents.  I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  

I look forward to reuniting in the new year as we all get back into action following the Christmas 

break.

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>To my constituents in Takuvaine and Tutakimoa, commonly referred to as TKV and TKM, I want 

to let you know that Christmas presents will be delivered to your households later today.  While 

we will not be having a lunch this year due to our busy schedules, we are pleased to ensure that 

Christmas presents will reach you all.   

</span></div><div><span>When I first became the Member of Parliament for these two villages, I was young and focused on 

caring for my elders.  Now, I find myself as a pensioner collecting this pension.  Praise the Lord 

for  allowing  me  to  reach  this  age.    On  behalf  of  both  villages,  and  especially  on  behalf  of  the 

Government, Merry Christmas to everyone tuning in on the radio and online from New Zealand 

and Australia, as well as to those in the Outer Islands.  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 

to us all.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge 

everyone here today, including the Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament, for sharing your 

</span><span>Christmas and New Year’s greetings.</span><span>  I was particularly moved by the Honourable Minister Rose 

</span><span>Brown’s speech</span><span> acknowledging our pregnant women.  Praise to all our men for their dedication to 

supporting the growth of our population.  Let us encourage all our women and men to continue 

this important work during this Christmas and New Year season.  Keep it up! 

</span></div><div><span>Before we conclude, I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, especially 

to the staff of Parliament and your families here in Rarotonga and in the Outer Islands.   Merry 

Christmas to all, including our visitors in Parliament today and may God bless us all during this 

festive season.
