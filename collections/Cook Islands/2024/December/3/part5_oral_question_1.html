<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us this afternoon.  I stand 

to answer the question raised by the Member of Matavera yesterday. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I see in our Order of Paper today, that we are to establish a Special Select Committee 

to look into the Religious Registration Act and come up with recommendations for Parliament for 

consideration in due course.  We have discussed this matter at heart before coming into the House 

and we are all in support for this topic to be discussed in details on the best course for us.  With 

</span><span>those few words I hope that the Member of Matavera will be happy with the recommendations. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have the Floor.
