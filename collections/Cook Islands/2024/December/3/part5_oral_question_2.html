<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question for the Minister of 

Justice on the question posed to him yesterday. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We have established an  organisation known as the Religious Advisory Council.   However, the 

issue I see with this organisation is that they lack a clear mandate for their establishment. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Concerning this organisation, I suggest that this is an opportune time for the government to address 

this matter by structuring the organisation and establishing a clear mandate.  This would enable 

the Council to effectively consider issues related to religious activities and potentially grant it the 

authority to review applications from those wishing to establish church organisations. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In  light  of  this,  I  would  like  to  urge  the  government  to  address  the  matter  by  designating  the 

Religious Advisory Council as the body responsible for reviewing applications, particularly from 

Christian Churches seeking to establish themselves here in the Cook Islands.  I would specifically 

like to highlight the Revival Church and the Apostolic Church, both of which should be given due 

consideration.  It is essential that this council reviews all such applications appropriately. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister Mokoroa. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, if I can refer to the Prime Minister to answer this, then I 

will make my answer. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  The Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the Member for Matavera for your 

request.  I would like to refer to the 1975 Act that established the recognised Churches here in the 

Cook Islands.  It has been 50 years since that legislation was enacted, and currently, I believe only 

four Churches are recognised under that Act.  However, as we know, many more Churches have 

been  established  in  our  country  since  then,  representing  a  variety  of  congregations  and 

denominations that actively preach the Gospel within our nation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Next year as we celebrate the 60th year of the establishment of our country as a modern country 

we know that we have changed and the changes have been significant, Mr Speaker not just from 

</span><span>the  size  of  our  country  which  have  moved  from  250  square  kilometres  of  islands  to  now  two 

million square kilometres including oceans. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the population of our country 60 years ago was about 30,000 people, but today it has 

grown to well over 100,000.  Our society has become more diverse, with many Cook Islanders 

</span><span>now having intermarried with individuals from other cultures, so we have Cook Islanders who are 

also part of other cultures. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This diversity invites not only a variety of cultures but also an array of religions.  As the Member 

</span><span>stated, I believe it is indeed timely for us to review our current Act and assess whether changes are 

</span><span>necessary.  However, we must also be mindful of our responsibilities, as highlighted by the Leader 

of the Opposition and others.  We are signatories to human rights agreements, including the Bill 

</span></div>
<div><span>770

</span></div>
<div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>of Rights, which upholds the principles of freedom of expression and freedom of worship, among 

other individual rights. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, it is crucial that any reviews of this nature are conducted with great care 

and consideration, ensuring that we protect the rights of all individuals involved. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One example I would like to share to illustrate how our country has evolved over the past 60 years, 

Mr Speaker, is this year, I was advised that the last horse in the Cook Islands has died.  There are 

no more horses in the Cook Islands, Mr Speaker; the final one has passed away.  This brings to 

mind the stories shared by Papa Dan Kamana, who lived into his 90s and often recounted that in 

his youth, owning a horse was a sign of being a man. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We  once  had  hundreds  of  horses  in  our  country,  Mr  Speaker,  which  were  essential  for  work 

purposes,  but  they  also  served  as  a  means  of  transportation,  even  taking  people  to  dances  in 

Titikaveka. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, the bicycle came along, and Papa Dan would often say that owning a push bike was 

even better.  </span><span>You didnâ€™t have to worry</span><span> about feeding it; you just get on and go. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Then, of course, came the motorcycle, and nowadays, to meet someone, young people often just 

use  their  phones  to  connect,  rather  than  actually  being  there  in  person.    This  illustrates  the 

significant changes in our society and community, Mr Speaker, over the years.  As a people and 

as a country, we must consider how we will adapt to these changes.  The issue at hand is serious 

for many of our citizens, and it is one that we should deliberate with the proper consideration. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Let us strive to approach this matter with a level head and carefully consider the concerns raised 

by many of our people and fellow Members of this House.  I believe it is fitting, Mr Speaker, for 

us to  establish a Select  Committee to  evaluate the suggestions that have been put  forth by our 

Member from Matavera.  This would be a constructive first step in giving serious consideration to 

issues of significant importance to our community and our people.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.
