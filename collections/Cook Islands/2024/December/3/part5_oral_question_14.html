<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak.  I also want to thank 

the Honourable Member for Matavera for his question.  Regarding the Police Department and how 

it aligns with Corrective Services, I do.  However, I know that the Police fall under the jurisdiction 

of the Honourable Prime Minister, who brings far greater wisdom and expertise to this issue than 

I do. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge that our Honourable Prime Minister is a clever 

person.  Yesterday, we discussed the appointment of community police officers, and we proposed 

</span><span>that this initiative be integrated into the police structure under the Prime Ministerâ€™s oversight.</span></div>
<div><span>In response to your question, I want to highlight that the Prime Minister has agreed to enhance the 

Community Policing program in the districts.   As it is written in Ecclesiastes 3:1,  </span><span>"There is an 

appointed time for everything, and a time for every affair under the heavens." </span><span> We will await the 

Prime Minister's recommendation on when this initiative will take place.  Takitumu and Puaikura 

have submitted their requests, but we are still waiting on Te-Au-O-Tonga.  Therefore, my request, 

</span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister,  is  to  also  include  Avatiu  and  Tupapa  in  this  initiative;  for  now, 

Takuvaine can be managed as it is, and we will ensure its needs are met. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you very much Honourable Member for Matavera for your question.   

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, at the conclusion of our Sitting today, I suggest that you 

meet with the Member of Parliament for Matavera to address these issues and provide assistance 

regarding the police department case.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
