</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 155: 

</span></div><div><span>Bills, Petitions and Papers Committee </span><span>â€“</span><span> Review of the Cook  

Islands Amendment Bill 2023 &amp; Land (Facilitation of Dealings)  

Amendment Bill 2023: Interim Report 

</span></div><div><span>I  call  the  Honourable  Akaiti  Puna,  Chairperson  of  the  Bills,  Petitions  and  Papers  Review 

Committee.  

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In accordance with Standing Order 156 (1), I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament take note of the Bills, Petitions and Papers Committee on the Review of 

the Cook Islands Amendment Bill 2023 &amp; Land (Facilitation of Dealings) Amendment Bill 

2023: Interim Report 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, before I second the Motion, may I be permitted to 

comment on this Paper? 

</span></div><div><span>Listened from Report, seeks in extension to a date when everything is completed, when the Report 

is completed.  This extension was sought in September and the idea was that the Report will be 

finalised by this Sitting.  The timeline that was given if I recall is that the Sub-Committee was to 

report to the Committee by the 18th of November.  The 18th of November was specifically chosen 

so that the Committee will have sufficient time to complete its final report, so that it can be tabled 

for this Sitting.  We know, from the Papers that had been tabled that the Committee has not been 

able to table its final report.  

</span></div><div><span>What I am about to comment, Mr Speaker, will also affect consideration of other Papers.  The Bills 

were referred to the Sub-Committee in December 2023.  In fact, on the 14 of December 2023.  

Come next week, it will be a year.  I raised the delay with the Sub-Committee, not because I am 

critical of the Members on the Committee, but because I was concerned that maybe there are other 

options to speed things up.  It was explained by the Chairperson that there are challenges and lack 

</span><span>of resource, hence the reason why the Report were not filed in a timely manner.   

</span></div><div><span>The Sub-Committee are made up of the Solicitor General,  Secretary of Justice, and I think the 

President of the Law Society, the Lawyer that drafted the Bills, one other Lawyer and also a Land 

Researcher.  The reason for appointing this particular Sub-Committee, in my view, because we 

</span><span>have all the experts, the land lawyers, people practicing in the land court, and also other people on 

that Committee.   

</span></div><div><span>As a result of correspondence last week, we were then told that we would actually get the final 

</span><span>report of the Sub-Committee before tomorrow.  I would like to thank the Solicitor General who I 

</span><span>understand  has  been  working  overtime  in  the  weekend  to  try  and  hit  this  report  done.    But  of 

course, unbeknown to all of us, we are suspending Parliament today.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  raised  this  because,  when  we  come  to  considering  the  next  Paper  by  the  Public  Accounts 

Committee, we have the same theme running through the report, lack of resources, under staff, et 

cetera.  I make these comments because I do want to be constructive about moving Bills in an 

expedient manner, and should not take that long for a Bill to be considered.  It is not a lengthy Bill, 

it is a very short Bill, and it focus on certain aspects of our land law.  On that basis, I second the 

Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Pupuke Browne 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 157: 

</span></div><div><span>Public Accounts Committee Annual Review 2022-23 and Other  

Reviews. 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Tai Herman, Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In accordance with Standing Order 156 (1), I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament take note of the  

Public Accounts Committee Annual Review 2022-23 and Other Reviews 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion.  

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Before I lend my support to second the Motion, I would 

like to share a few thoughts with this House.  First, I want to thank the Committee Secretariat, 

Margret Numanga, for her diligent work.  I believe she went above and beyond to prepare for our 

meetings. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  advisor,  Desmond  Wildin,  for  his  guidance  and  support 

throughout the Committee's work. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to address the performance of certain Ministries, particularly the larger 

</span><span>ones under government management.  From 2019 to 2023, we have observed that some of their 

reports are not good.  According to our advisor, receiving a qualified or modified report indicates 

issues, but if a report is marked as disclaimed, it means, bad. 

</span></div><div><span>We, as the Committee, encourage these departments to strive for improved reports in the upcoming 

</span><span>years,  specifically  for  2023-24.    I  urge  the  Ministers  responsible  for  these  Ministries  to  take  a 

closer look at their respective Ministries.  I will not mention any names, I trust that each of you is 

well aware of the challenges within your own Ministry.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Committee,  the  Chairperson,  and  all  Members,  I  kindly  request  that  you,  the 

Ministers,  provide  assistance  to  those  responsible  within  these  Ministries  to  facilitate 

improvements in their reports for the year 2023-24. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Minister for Corrective Services because when you look at their reports 

from 2015 to 2023, their reports are all good.  I am not praising the Minister, but maybe the people 

doing the work are good and the Minister is also helping them.  So, Mr Speaker I stand to second 

the Motion.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Minister for Corrective Services.  Review of their reports from 2015 to 

2023 shows consistent positive outcomes.  I am not here to praise the Minister, it is clear that the 

individuals involved are performing well, and the Minister is likely providing them with support.  

Therefore, Mr Speaker, I stand to second the Motion.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Question is; Honourable Member, yes? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  S.  WILLIAMS:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  are  Members  of  the  PAC  allowed  to  speak  on  this  Report 

because according to the procedure notes, there is no time for Members to speak and I want this to 

be clarified? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I was advised that only the Seconder can speak.  I will 

have to refer to my Standing Orders.  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; yes? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, that might be a harsh ruling.  This is included under 

Papers for Consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I will refer that matter to my Clerk and Deputy Clerk for further clarification on 

the issue.  Please feel free to continue, and I will address it later. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Oh, after the vote, okay. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  Honourable Members, I apologise for any misunderstanding.  I was 

advised that Members would be permitted to speak on the Motion after the vote has taken place. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I call on the Honourable Tai Herman to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  It is appropriate that we discuss this report.  In this 

report we were able to review seven government entities plus two PERCA Investigation reports.  

</span></div><div><span>776 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as previously mentioned by the Member of Parliament for Matavera regarding the 

reports submitted to the Public Accounts Committee, it is evident that many of these reports do 

not meet the required standards.  Currently, only 13 out of 59 entities have reported to Parliament.  

This is why we are urging the Ministers to meet with their Heads of Ministries and encourage them 

to submit their reports to PAC. 

</span></div><div><span>As we noted yesterday, only eight entities submitted their reports, and we will review these reports 

with the hope of providing a comprehensive update to Parliament in February.  Therefore, I urge 

the Ministers to assist Parliament by ensuring that their Ministries report back to us, particularly 

regarding their expenditures of the allocated funds. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to address the PERCA investigation.  There are two reports regarding 

this investigation; the first pertains to the CIIC and highlights issues related to their overspending 

of the budget as well as staff travel that exceeds the permitted limits. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it is evident that over the past five years, they have been allocated $3 million.  This 

amount is in addition to what Parliament has appropriated, yet they have spent $2.7 million beyond 

the  approved  budget.    The  Public  Accounts  Committee  does  not  consider  this  behaviour  to  be 

acceptable, as our laws stipulate that any expenditure outside of the approved budget must receive 

prior approval from both the Financial Secretary and the Minister of Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it was revealed that CIIC has the capability to spend funds outside of the appropriated 

amount solely with the approval of its Board.  As the authority was granted by the Board, they 

have not technically violated the law in this regard. 

</span></div><div><span>We have proposed that a discussion be convened as soon as possible involving CIIC, MFEM, and 

Crown  Law  to  examine  the  revenue  received  from  subsidiaries  other  than  the  Cook  Islands 

Government Property Corporation.  This conversation will allow CIIC, MFEM, and Crown Law 

to further clarify whether CIIC has the sole authority to use any excess revenue. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, Mr Speaker, we are uncertain whether this meeting has taken place. We hope that in the 

near future, the Committee will have the opportunity to review this matter, and we encourage these 

three government agencies to make every effort to meet and discuss how they can address this 

</span><span>issue.  From what we understand within the Public Accounts Committee, it is only the Minister 

and the Secretary of Finance who possess the authority to make such decisions. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the reports reviewed by the PAC Committee concerns the discretionary expenditures of 

CIIC,  specifically  regarding  travel.  We  found  that  CIIC's  travel  policy  differs  from  that  of  the 

</span><span>Public Service. It is widely accepted that Ministers and the Leader of the Opposition are entitled 

to travel in business class, whereas ordinary Members and public service staff typically travel in 

economy class. During our inquiry, we discovered that the Chairperson of CIIC was travelling in 

business class, and it was indicated that this is a customary practice within CIIC. 

</span></div><div><span>The PAC Committee would like to make a recommendation, Mr Speaker.  We have been informed 

that CIIC is currently reviewing their travel policies.  We have requested the revised policy from 

them, but to date, we have not received this report.  Consequently, we have also asked CIIC to 

</span></div><div><span>777 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>provide us with a detailed outline of their travel costs incurred in 2022, 2023, and 2024.  As of 

today, we are still awaiting that report. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to assure this House that the PAC Committee is not here to penalise or smack 

the hands of our people.  Our goal is to ensure they understand that the funds they are utilising 

belong to the public and have been entrusted to them by this House in response to their requests 

for resources to carry out their work.  Mr Speaker, I will conclude my remarks here.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister Albert Nicholas. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  good  afternoon  to  all  Members  of  this 

House.  Mr Speaker, I rise to provide clarification on some of the points raised by the Chairperson 

of the PAC.  I am not sure as to why the representatives from CIIC did not respond to the questions 

that you should have asked in the deliberations. 

</span></div><div><span>For clarification, Mr Speaker, it is important to note that CIIC is a government agency established 

by law, which means it derives its authority from the Act that governs it.  This Act outlines how 

the agency manages its operations and allocates the dividends received from various SOEs.  The 

expenditure of these dividends is somewhat different from the expenditures allocated through the 

annual government budget that Parliament appropriates to the agency. 

</span></div><div><span>The  annual  appropriation  for  CIIC  is  approved  by  Parliament  in  accordance  with  their  annual 

business plan and the requests submitted to the Finance Committee during the budget process.  We 

are  all  aware  that  the  budget  allocated  to  CIIC  was  approved  by  this  House.    However,  it  is 

important to clarify that the dividends collected by CIIC are managed under the authority of the 

Board, based on the work directed by the CIIC CEO and the agency.  I want to ensure that our 

people understands that the dividends received by CIIC lies with the Board, as stipulated by the 

Act. 

</span></div><div><span>We want our people and this House to understand that the dividends collected by CIIC are being 

used to help improve our schools, buildings, hospitals, and other government properties for the 

benefit of our people.  These funds are directed towards public renovations and improvements in 

government assets.  For instance, a portion of the dividends has been allocated to support the power 

</span><span>supply on Aitutaki.  Additionally, some of these funds are being used to improve the island's water 

system, as well as to improve the harbour of Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the key point I wish to convey to all of us, as well as to our people listening in and 

the Chairperson and Committee Members for the PAC, is that there is a difference between the 

</span><span>appropriations allocated by Parliament for CIIC and the dividends collected by the agency.  This 

distinction is crucial in understanding how these funds are managed and expended. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the process for financial expenditure is governed by the CIIC Act.  Furthermore, I 

want to make it clear that I do not support any form of travel expenditure.  In fact, if I were ever 

to become Prime Minister, my first action would be to implement a ban on all overseas travel.  I 

assure you, Mr Speaker, that both  I and the Honourable Member from Tupapa/Maraerenga  are 

setting an example by refraining from any travel at all.</span></div><div><span>778 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  regarding  the  issue  of  travel,  I  would  like  to  address  the  Chairperson's  comments 

about the distinction between the travel of Parliamentarians, Public Servants, and members of the 

CIIC Board.  It is important to note that Board members, Board Directors, and those associated 

with any State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) under the CIIC are not classified as Public Servants.</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, there is a policy within CIIC that establishes criteria which state that Public 

Servants are not eligible to serve as Board Directors in CIIC or any of its agencies.  As I previously 

mentioned, I do not support unnecessary travel or, to be honest, any travel at all.  This distinction 

clarifies the difference in travel policies between Public Servants and Board Directors within CIIC.  

While Public Servants are bound by certain regulations, Board Directors are considered private 

individuals  and  operate  under  different  guidelines,  allowing  for  slight  flexibility  in  their  travel 

arrangements.</span></div><div><span>In closing, Mr Speaker, I want to assure the Chairperson of the PAC that I will communicate with 

our team.  In fact, I have already issued a directive to ensure that all relevant information requested 

by the PAC is made available otherwise we will never hear the end of the PAC.  On that note Mr 

Chairperson, thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Members, before I invite the Honourable Leader of the Opposition 

to speak, I would like to inform you all that our lunch break scheduled for 2.30 p.m. is postponed 

until we conclude todayâ€™s session of Parliament.  Given our active discussions on these Papers, we 

will address the lunch break after the Sitting has finished.</span></div><div><span>I call the Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor.</span></div><div><span>HON T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Yesterday, on our Order Paper, we had 

a few Papers that has now been referred back to PAC and these are Papers 113 on todayâ€™s Order 

Paper, 115, 116,  117, 122,126,128 and 130.  The Motion was put  by Minister Elikana  which I 

seconded.  I think the basis on which he moved the Motion was because of Paper 130.  I heard the 

Minister say that he wanted to have available the PACâ€™s report before we will debate the issue in 

Parliament. </span></div><div><span>Parliament Paper 157, which is the one that we are discussing now, in fact, includes Paper 130.  

</span><span>So, there was no reason for referring that back to PAC because it is already part of Part 157 and 

</span><span>should be discussed.  Earlier when I was talking about the Bills Committee Paper, I was talking 

about the delay in getting reports done.  </span></div><div><span>Todayâ€™s  Order  Paper  is  very  helpful  I  found  because  it  also  provides  the  dates  on  which  these 

Papers were Tabled in Parliament and if you look at the first lot of Papers, they were Tabled or 

presented to Parliament on 13 December 2023.  Then, there is a next lot on 19 February, the next 

in June and next in September. </span></div><div><span>I will come to the point that I am trying to make.  If we look at Paper 157, it makes quite a number 

of recommendations.  It also includes the committeeâ€™s findings and one of the findings that caught 

my eye was the finding on page 14 of the Report which says, there has been no improvement in 

the submission of Annual Performance Reports; 13 out of 59 government entities have reported to 

</span></div><div><span>779 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament  and  this  is  for  the  2022/23  year.    I  have  heard  the  Chairperson  to  be  asking  some 

assistance from the Ministries because of the lack of filing reports. </span></div><div><span>My understanding of the responsibilities and duties of the PAC does give the PAC more authority 

than it uses to before.  In the next Report from  PAC, I would like to  read the consequences of 

failure.  I do not know that it takes us ahead by complaining about failure particularly if matters 

have not improved.  We also see in the Report the recommendations in regards to Parliament and 

we know what the problems are.  We have lack of resources; we have lack of personnel and PAC 

is  suggesting  or  recommending  to  Parliament  to  address  these  long-standing  vacancies.    My 

question is how does Parliament do that without a budget?</span></div><div><span>Is there a connection between PAC and the Budget Committee to say, we have done a review; this 

is what we have found; there should be more money given for Parliament?  Under the new Standing 

Orders, we see Papers to do with finance being referred to PAC and we see all the Bills, not all, 

most of the Bills being referred to the Bills Committee. But our Secretariat for all Committees is 

the one and the same Secretariat. 

</span></div><div><span>I do not want to be critical of the Committees or the Chairpersons, most of us are not trained to 

write reports.  The Secretariat should be well equipped to assist each Committee to do its work.  I 

will give you an example.  In the old days when I was still on PAC, as part of the team that went 

to  Wellington,  we  sat  in  a  Committee  questioning  where  the  Committee  summon  people  as 

witnesses. 

</span></div><div><span>Behind the Committee was a row of personnel; I remember it might have been three or four.  The 

session was going on and they were recording, taking notes so that they capture all the discussions 

of the Committee and then they put it through.  Next minute, out comes the report. 

</span></div><div><span>I am not suggesting that we should go that far but I am suggesting that we need some very skilled 

people to assist our sub-committees because otherwise the quality of the reports will not be of the 

required standard and I think my message is that there is no point in directing Ministries to fill in 

vacancies if there is no link between that report and the people who decide how much money a 

Ministry should have in its budget.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in my view, our reports going forward, we will continue complaining about the lack 

of reporting by Ministries.  We will keep complaining about the lack of resources in the Ministries 

but offer no constructive solution or options to fix it.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Sonny Williams; you 

</span><span>have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I have just a few points to address.  First, greetings 

to everyone in this House, as well as to all our people listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>I  stand  to  give  my  support  for  the  recommendations  outlined  in  this  report,  as  clarified  by  the 

Leader  of  the  Opposition,  specifically  regarding  the  support  that  should  be  provided  to  the 

Secretariat of the Committee in Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>780 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 03 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, during our discussions with the Clerk, I made a suggestion regarding the challenges 

of filling support positions for the Secretary and the prospect of the Secretary to the Committees. 

I proposed that we consider contracting the necessary skills for report writing to assist her in this 

area. 

</span></div><div><span>This approach is similar to some of the contractual arrangements currently in place in Parliament, 

such as those for our Sergeant at Arms.  I believe this was also the case during my time as the 

Interpreter for the House.  As confirmed by the Clerk, there is indeed an opportunity to contract 

the necessary Secretarial skills to support our Secretariat for the Committees as needed.  I believe 

the funds for this are available within the operational budget of Parliament Services. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for highlighting this important issue.  We can 

clearly see the considerable demands placed on our Secretary, particularly given the increasing 

workload of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the growing number of Committees that 

she  must  support.    Therefore,  I  strongly  encourage  both  the  Clerk  and  the  Secretary  to  take 

proactive steps in this matter.  As the Leader of the Opposition mentioned, this is to enhance the 

writing and presentation of reports from the PAC and all other Committees to the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to highlight two recommendations by PAC in this report, which can be 

found on Page 12.  

</span></div><div><span>Recommendation No. 1 states: "The Committee reiterates the obligations and responsibilities of 

Heads of Ministries and Chief Executive Officers under the MFEM Act  1995/96 regarding the 

expenditure of public funds.  It is their duty to ensure that strong controls and careful judgment are 

applied to public spending. Expenditures of public funds that do not meet the standards of propriety 

and financial prudence should not be authorised."  That is Recommendation No. 1. 

</span></div><div><span>Recommendation No. 2, from the same report, states: "The Committee reiterates the importance 

for heads of Ministries and the respective Chief Executive Officers of Ministerial Support Offices 

to be well versed with the MFEM Act 1995/96 and the Cook Islands, this is the policy on financial 

management  -  this  is  to  ensure  that  they  are  able  to  provide  sound  advice  and  support  to  their 

respective Ministers". 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to elaborate further on these two points.   The PAC has observed that 

some Heads of Ministries may not fully understand their obligations under this Act, tending to 

delegate financial responsibilities to their Finance Officers or Financial Controllers.  However, we 

want to emphasise that Heads of Ministries and CEOs are ultimately responsible for the financial 

reports.  It is their responsibility to ensure that these reports are submitted to Parliament in a timely 

</span><span>manner. 

</span></div><div><span>Point wo is that we strongly encourage Heads of Ministries and Chief Executives of Ministerial 

Offices to familiarise themselves thoroughly with the MFEM Act 1995/96, as well as the Cook 

</span><span>Islands  Government  Financial  Procedures  Manual  and  financial  policies.    Understanding  these 

</span><span>frameworks is important because one of their primary responsibilities is to provide sound advice 

and support to their Ministers.  We have observed instances where the advice provided has not 

been sound, and the support given to Ministers has also been lacking.

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our  primary  goal  is  to  ensure  that  our  ministerial  officers  and  agencies  adhere  to  government 

regulations,  which  would  prevent  any  issues  from  arising.    This  is  especially  important  in  the 

context of new HOMs, as there is often turnover in these positions, as well as in CEOs and newly 

appointed staff within ministerial offices.  It is important for them to understand the established 

rules.  I also encourage everyone to take advantage of the training programs offered by MFEM for 

all public service staff.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me the time to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister Elikana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker,  I will keep my  comments  brief.    It  is pleasing to  hear the 

insights shared by previous speakers regarding this report.  However, I would like to offer a word 

of caution: we are currently navigating the implementation of our new Standing Orders, and we 

are still finding our ways in this regard.  As you may recall from past sessions, many reports were 

tabled  without  taking  much  interest.    However,  as  we  adapt  to  the  new  Standing  Orders,  it  is 

pleasing to see that we are beginning to recognise the importance of these reports. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, we must ensure that more attention is given when Papers are called for consideration, 

allowing us to raise them and have them thoroughly examined by Parliament.  As I mentioned 

yesterday, Mr Speaker, it is important for Parliament to examine the relationship between the PAC 

report  and  the  Ministerial  report  as  a  unified  body.    By  incorporating  insights  from  the  Audit 

Office's reports, the performance reports from the public service office, and the findings from the 

PAC report, we can gain a clearer understanding  of how public funds are being utilised by the 

relevant ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>In  my  view,  Mr  Speaker,  analysing  all  of  these  reports  provides  us  with  a  comprehensive 

understanding of how the ministries are performing.  I would like to add a couple of comments 

regarding the PAC report we are discussing.  While it effectively identifies areas of concern, it 

should also recognise the achievements that these ministries have accomplished throughout the 

year.  

</span></div><div><span>Specifically, I want to address the section of the report related to Parliamentary Services where I 

</span><span>am  a  Minister  Responsible  for.    It  is  good  to  see  that  the  PAC  report  has  acknowledged  the 

challenges we face, particularly concerning resources and personnel within Parliament Services. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for highlighting an area of concern that I share, 

given my  experience as a former PAC  Chairperson, specifically regarding the Secretary of our 

</span><span>Committees.  I am pleased to report to Parliament that, as a result of the recommendations from 

the PAC and the findings from the Audit, we have successfully met with the Budget Support Group 

for the preparations of the upcoming budget.  They have assured us that they will seriously consider 

the inclusion of additional support staff, including a research assistant for our secretary, as well as 

</span><span>someone with the requisite knowledge to assist the Secretary of the Committees. 

</span></div><div><span>I  wanted  to  bring  this  to  Parliament's  attention  to  highlight  the  importance  of  having  the  PAC 

committee  reports,  ministerial  reports,  and  public  service  reports  as  tools  for  evaluating  the

</span></div><div><span>performance of ministries.  These documents are important when we present our case to the Budget 

Committee, as they can help us make more compelling arguments to the Budget Support Group.  

Those are my comments, Mr Speaker, and thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Members.   

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 166: 

</span></div><div><span>Constitutional  Review  Special  Committee  Interim  Report  on  the 

revies of the Constitution Amendment Bill, 30, 32. and 32, 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Minister Tingika Elikana, Chairperson of the Constitutional Review Special 

Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  As I mentioned yesterday, although there is a 

desire to have these reports tabled in this session, we are facing logistical and technical challenges 

that have made this difficult.  However, I want to emphasise that this is not due to a lack of effort 

from those involved in striving to present the reports before Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, in accordance with Standing Order 156 (1), I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament take note of the Constitutional Review Special Committee Interim Report 

on the review of the Constitutional Amendment Billss, 30, 31, and 32 2023 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  This is an excellent interim report.  I 

second this report without comment.

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament take note of the Bills, Petitions and Papers Committee Final Report on the 

review of the Companies Amendment Bill 10-1, 2024 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, this is another excellent report, and I just wanted 

to  comment  on  the  actual  recommendation.    The  sub-committee  that  was  appointed  by  the 

Committee filed a report which was stated I think on the 14th of November.  The sub-committee 

was tasked with three responsibilities.  First, to review the Companies Amendment Bill.  Second, 

to determine that the Bill as drafted, addresses the problem.  Third, that the sub-committee look at 

any unintended consequences if the Bill was passed.   

</span></div><div><span>The sub-committee came back and answered Question 1, "yes, we have reviewed the Bill, yes, it 

addresses the problem that was identified, but recommended that the third question be referred to 

the New Zealand Parliamentary Council Office to determine whether there was any unintended 

consequences.  So, the Committee adopted the report by the sub-committee and also agreed with 

the recommendation that the Bill be referred to the New Zealand Parliamentary Office to deal with 

the third question.  There is also a request that we ask the Office in New Zealand nicely to look at 

this  question  in  a  speedily  manner  so  that  we  can  get  a  answer  back.    Of  course,  if  we  get  an 

affirmative answer, that is, there are no unintended consequences, then I assume we then come 

back to Parliament and continue to the Third Reading.   

</span></div><div><span>That is why this report is a final report because the two questions had been answered and we are 

simply seeking the advice from the New Zealand Parliamentary Office.  I second the Motion to 

adopt this excellent report. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Pupuke Browne
