<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I wanted to ask a Supplementary Question to the Minister 

of Justice, but I will hold off until his report to Parliament is presented.  My question is directed to 

the Minister of Corrective Services.  While this isn't meant to be a praise, I have observed that the 

management of our Corrective Services is functioning effectively under your leadership.  It seems 

that you are handling the responsibilities well.  Given the challenges currently facing the Police 

Department, do you have any strategies or ideas for collaboration that could help improve their 

situation?
