<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thanks to the Member for Amuri-Ureia for 

bringing this issue in Araura to our attention.  From what I understand, our people returning from 

New Zealand who are receiving the New Zealand pension are exempt from paying tax under this 

law.    Specifically,  those  receiving  the  New  Zealand  pension  fall  under  the  Outer  Islands  tax 

guidelines, which allow for the first $60,000 to be tax-free.  I'm not clear on the specific tax issues 

that the Inland Revenue is pursuing concerning our elderly people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, I have had individuals approach me regarding their personal tax matters.  It is often more 

beneficial for these individuals to discuss their specific tax issues with us privately.  Their concerns 

may not necessarily relate to the tax-free threshold; they might involve other sources of income 

for which they owe taxes or cases where their income exceeds the $60,000 limit, making them 

liable for tax.  These are matters that would be better addressed outside of this House.
