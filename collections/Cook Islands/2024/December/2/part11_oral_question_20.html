<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  After hearing what the Prime Minister 

has discussed, I would like to make a request on behalf of Vaka Puaikura.  We are facing significant 

challenges in our district, especially as we approach the festive season.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I urge the Prime Minister, who is also the Minister of Police, to make community policing a reality 

for us in Puaikura.  This initiative was very successful during Aporo Miria's tenure.  Therefore, I 

kindly  ask  for  your  consideration  in  allocating  a  police  officer  to  ensure  the  protection  of  our 

community and tourists.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
