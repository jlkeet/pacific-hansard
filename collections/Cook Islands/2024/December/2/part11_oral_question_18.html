<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone this afternoon.  I see we 

have the news reporter present in our House who covered this topic in the Cook Islands Newspaper.  

Welcome,  madam,  to  our  Parliament.    Mr  Speaker,  I  have  received  questions  from  the  news 

reporter regarding the establishment of a mosque in our country.  I have forwarded those questions 

to the Secretary of Justice and the Crown Law Office to seek further clarification.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I have informed the Cook Islands News that there are currently three pending applications for new 

faith  denominations  to  be  registered  in  the  Cook  Islands.    However,  concerning  the  Muslim 

Mosque, there is no application at this time.  I will be happy to share additional information with 

this House once I receive further clarification from Crown Law.  Thank you very much.
