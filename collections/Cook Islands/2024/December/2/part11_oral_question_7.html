<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you to the Member for Murienua for asking about the update on our 

vessel.  I have good news: just a few weeks ago, I received an update regarding the vessel that will 

be  funded  by  the  government  of  Japan.    We  have  now  identified  the  vessel,  which  has  been 

</span><span>modified to carry more cargo and to accommodate a small number of passengers. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks to our strong relationship with the government of Japan, this funded project has taken some 

time to come to fruition.  The previous vessel identified did not meet our requirements; however, 

</span><span>we have now found one that is more suitable.  The great news is that the government of Japan will 

</span><span>also cover the costs for the necessary modifications to bring the vessel up to our desired standards.  

Once these modifications are complete, we anticipate that our vessel will arrive by July.  That is 

the latest update for our Members and everyone here today.
