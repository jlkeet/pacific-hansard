</span></div><div><span>Apologies,  I  have  just  received  an  apology  for  the  Honourable  Tuakeu  Tangatapoto,  who  is 

currently in Mitiaro and unable to attend due to the lack of flights this week.  Additionally, the 

Honourable Minister Rose Brown is occupied with other official duties but will be joining us later 

in the week.  Thank you all for your understanding. 

</span></div><div><span>Pursuant to Standing Order 231, I have the honour to present the Business Committee’s report on 

</span><span>the recommended Sitting Calendar for 2025.  

</span></div><div><span>I lay this on the Table.

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Chairperson for the Constitutional Review Special Committee to present the Committee’s 

</span><span>report. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  ELIKANA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.  While  the  Constitutional  Review  Special 

Committee  made  every  effort  to  prepare  a  final  report  for  this  Sitting,  it  unfortunately  proved 

logistically and technically impossible to do so.  I would like to thank the staff of Parliament for 

their  dedicated  efforts  to  accommodate  the  Committee's  request  in  order  to  have  a  final  report 

ready for presentation today.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am now presenting to Parliament the Interim Report, which outlines the challenges 

we faced in providing a final report.  I also wish to thank the Business Committee for passing a 

resolution that allows additional time for the Constitutional Review Special Committee to continue 

its important work in the future.  I hereby table this report in Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister Elikana.
