<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members 

in the House today.  My question is directed to the Prime Minister, as you mentioned community 

policing in your previous response.  A few weeks ago, the Cook Islands newspaper reported on 

various troubling behaviours exhibited by our youth in the community, including breaking into 

private  homes  and  damaging  people's  property.    I  recall  discussions  in  previous  parliamentary 

sittings about encouraging policing efforts in our communities.  Could you provide an update on 

how the government plans to address these issues through community policing initiatives? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps the Honourable Prime Minister could provide specific details on the government's plan 

regarding  community  policing.    Additionally,  I  would  like  to  ask  whether  the  government  is 

considering revisiting our legislation concerning juvenile delinquency.  The reason for my inquiry 

is that we all know that minors cannot be legally prosecuted or convicted.  Given the increase in 

juvenile offenses, it may be time for us to consider legislation addressing this issue within this 

</span><span>House. 

</span></div>
