<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for 

</span><span>your question.  The community policing initiative, Mr Speaker, aims to involve our community in 

enhancing  the  police  presence  in  our  neighbourhoods.  We  have  received  feedback  from  the 

community expressing a desire for a dedicated office where police can be stationed.  Members in

<div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Takitumu are already working on identifying suitable locations for police operations, and I know 

similar efforts are underway in Puaikura as well. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In  the  past,  there  was  a  police  office  at  the  Aroa  Hall,  and  this  is  a  sentiment  echoed  by  our 

communities.  They desire not just for police to drive around, but to be visibly present and engaged 

within  the  community.    We  are  working  closely,  Mr  Speaker,  with  the  police  to  address  their 

financial needs, ensuring that we can implement this initiative effectively in the coming year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  reality  is  that  addressing  juvenile  delinquency  requires  more  than  just  police 

involvement.  Many of these children, particularly young boys, need programs that will engage 

them  and  direct  them  towards  a  positive  path,  preventing  them  from  becoming  juvenile 

delinquents.   In the past, we have seen success  with  programs  that utilise sports to engage our 

youth, helping them to become productive members of the community.  We must build on these 

successful initiatives to provide our young people with the support and opportunities they need. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When we examine our current scholarship recipients pursuing advanced studies, we see that the 

majority are young girls.  This raises the question of whether we need to create more opportunities 

to  engage  young  boys  who  may  be  missing  out.    It  is  important  to  involve  all  sectors  of  our 

community to guide and support the development of our youth.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Schools, Church groups, sporting organisations, and various community groups all play vital roles 

in guiding our youth.  However, the most significant influence comes from parents.  I'm sure, Mr 

Speaker, you remember a time when the police officer was a figure of authority in the community, 

and children were afraid of them.  But they were even more afraid of that Mama with a kikau 

broom, a jandal, or a branch from the hedge ready to discipline them.  That kind of discipline kept 

many children in line.  Today, the dynamic seems to have changed; we are more scared in hurting 

our children, and many children are no longer scared of anything. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the juvenile case under the Ministry of Justice, I know the Ministry of Justice has been 

active  in  ensuring  the  re-establishment  of  the  Juvenile  Crimes  Prevention  Committee.    And  of 

course, today measures a taking to use restorative of justices as a means of identifying these kids 

that are causing problems and making sure that, yes, they do face the consequences of any crimes 

that they may commit but do it in a way that they appreciate the impact that it had on their victims.  

</span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Today, efforts are being made to implement restorative justice measures as a means of addressing 

issues involving troubled youth.  These approaches ensure that while children face consequences 

for  any  crimes  they  commit,  they  also  come  to  understand  the  impact  of  their  actions  on  their 

</span><span>victims.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.
