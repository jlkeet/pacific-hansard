<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON.  G.  ANGENE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  for  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  question 

raised by the Honourable Member for Matavera.  The inquiry is about the ownership of a machine.  

However, I am  uncertain which machine the Member is  referencing,  as I have six  machines at 

home, including eight blowers, eight hedge trimmers, eight grass cutters, and two excavators.  I 

believe the machine the Member of Parliament is referring to is the digger. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  digger  that  I  am  utilising  does  not  belong  to  the  government,  nor  is  it  owned  by  George 

Maggie.  It belongs to the community and is intended to assist the people in their work without 

any charge.  That is the answer to your question, Honourable Member for Matavera. 

</span></div>
