<h3>Oral Question 24</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  This question is directed to the Minister for 

Justice.  I recently read an article in the newspaper regarding an Act from 1975, which states that 

only four religious denominations are recognised in the Cook Islands: the CICC, Catholic, LDS, 

and SDA.  These are the only denominations permitted under this Act.  

</span></div>
<div><span>My  question  is  whether  you  have  the  capacity  to  review  this  Act  and  potentially  limit  the 

introduction  of  other  religions  into  our  country.    Our  Constitution  identifies  this  nation  as  a 

Christian country, which leads me to suggest that we reconsider this Act to maintain a limitation
