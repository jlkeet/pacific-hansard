<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Minister Albert Nicholas for the Second Reading of the Solid and Hazardous 

Waste Bill 2024. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Solid and Hazardous Waste Bill 2024  

be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I have a request to make, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can I have your Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor for Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill.  I 

see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  rise  to  formally  request  that  the  Minister  who 

introduced this Bill to the House consider referring it to the Bills Committee.  In light of Standing 

Order 182, clause 6, I believe this request is supported by the Members of the Opposition as well.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I note the request from across the Floor but I 

</span><span>also note that this document has been outstanding for many, many years and I believe itâ€™s been in 

</span><span>its process long before many of us even became Members of Parliament and I believe, Mr Speaker 

it goes as far back as during the Honourable Member's tenure as CEO of Environment. 

</span></div><div><span>The Bill before the House, Mr Speaker, is a culmination of many, many years of hard work of the 

current HOM of ICI also previous HOMs of ICI as well. 

</span></div><div><span>I am mindful of taking us too much time on this particular Bill but I am also mindful of the request 

</span><span>from across the Floor and also my colleagues on this side of the House do not have a problem if 

that is the request from the other side of the Floor.  I am on behalf of our side and our team am 

happy to oblige at the request.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Carry on Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  In saying that, Mr Speaker, I rise to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill before the House be referred to the Bills Committee 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I ask for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Teariki Heather 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We now move to the second Bill on the Order Paper, Financial Transaction Reporting Amendment 

Bill 2024. 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Minister, Vaine Mokoroa to move for the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Financial Transaction Reporting Amendment Bill 2024  

be now read a Second time

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Prime Minister, Mark Brown 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  This Bill is a very useful Bill.  We 

know how we are trying to  stay above water in  the finance sector because this is  also  revenue 

earning  for  us.    The  Bill  includes  amendments  in  response  to  a  review  of  our  Cook  Islands 

legislative framework by the global forum on transparency.  And the objective is to ensure that the 

</span><span>Cook Islands maintains a positive rating around the international standard.  And to achieve that we 

</span><span>see that we have the Financial Transactions Reporting Act being amended.

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We see the Companies Act recently passed in 2017 being amended.  We see the Banking Act 2011 

being amended and the Financial Transaction Reporting Regulations 2017 being amended.  My 

colleagues and I on this side of the House support this, Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I will interrupt our business.  It is time for a break.  Once 

we reconvene, we will continue our discussions. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.26 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.14 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, we will continue the debate on the principles and merits 

on  the  Financial  Transactions  Reporting  Amendment  Bill  2024.    I  call  for  speakers.    I  see  the 

Honourable Minister Vaine Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON  V.  MOKOROA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  good  afternoon  to  everyone.    I  stand  in 

support of the Bill.  I apologise if I have interrupted others from speaking, but I felt it was important 

to express my thoughts before I lose my notes.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the FSDA, the FSC, and all of our offshore financial services 

companies for their collaboration and consultation in bringing about the amendments we see before 

us today.  The key concern here is to ensure that the Cook Islands continues to be a leader in the 

Trust Industry. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our International Trust Act has been at the forefront of the Cook Islands Offshore 

Financial Services Industry since its enactment 40 years ago, establishing the Cook Islands as a 

leader in wealth protection and preservation.  At that time, these laws were seen as innovative and 

groundbreaking, and their success is evident in the growth and development of the sector, as well 

as in the number of jurisdictions that have copied them, either in whole or in part.  

</span></div><div><span>Our Cabinet, along with my Minister, is pleased to see that our members in the offshore banking 

industry are committed to remaining competitive and leading in this niche market.  Over the years, 

they  have  consistently  reviewed,  assessed,  and  revised  our  frameworks  to  address  relevant 

</span><span>developments  in  common  law,  while  also  evaluating  legislative  amendments  adopted  by 

competitors.    This  ongoing  effort  ensures  that  the  process  of  establishing  and  administering 

international trusts becomes efficient and cost-effective. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our objective today is to update the amendments with targeted changes.  In this regard, 

</span><span>our  Cook  Islands  Trust  Companies  Association,  which  comprises  seven  Trustee  Companies 

licensed under the Trustee Companies Act, along with our Financial Supervisory Commission, has 

conducted a thorough review of our International Trust Act and recommended necessary changes. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the proposed changes encompass both administrative and substantive adjustments, 

</span><span>along with certain amendments for clarification.  The aim of these administrative changes is to 

enhance efficiency, ease of administration, and compliance with international standards.  These 

</span></div><div><span>761

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 02 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>amendments seek to ensure the International Trust Act remains relevant, keeping it at the forefront 

of the asset protection market and providing a competitive edge over international counterpart. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  all  the  drafters  involved,  particularly  our  local 

contributors  such  as  Tony  Manarangi  and  many  others  who  played  a  role  in  this  amendment 

process.  With those brief remarks, thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Minister Elikana; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  ELIKANA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  was  one  of  those  individuals  the  Minister 

referred to, who wanted to speak before he lost his train of thought; he chose to deliver his remarks 

before  I  had  the  chance  to  rise.    Given  my  previous  experience  working  in  this  area  and  my 

involvement in some aspects of the trust industry, I would be remiss not to share my thoughts on 

this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I  believe,  Mr  Speaker,  that  both  the  Minister  responsible  for  this  Bill  and  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition have emphasised the urgency of passing this legislation through the House as quickly 

as possible.  They have both articulated the reasons why this important Bill must be enacted.  I am 

confident that everyone in this House understands the urgency we should attach to this matter in 

order for it to move forward promptly.  The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out the Bill's 

significance in generating revenue, particularly within our trust industry, especially considering 

our past experiences of being blacklisted, which made access to financing exceedingly difficult. 

</span></div><div><span>I take my hat off to those in the trust industry who have taken a proactive approach in providing 

guidance and support to ensure this Bill is presented before the House.  The Honourable Minister 

has acknowledged some of these individuals in his remarks.  As both the Minister and the Leader 

of the Opposition have pointed out, this Bill is crucial and deserves our collective support.  It is 

essential not only for maintaining our competitive edge but also for demonstrating our commitment 

to compliance with international regulations. 

</span></div><div><span>As you may recall, Mr  Speaker, the Bill  primarily  addresses minor but  significant  adjustments 

necessary for ensuring consistency within the legislative framework governing our trust industry.  

</span><span>This  involves  approximately  four  pieces  of  legislation,  and  the  proposed  amendments  aim  to 

clarify  the  interpretation  of  the  term  "ultimate  principal"  throughout  this  Bill.    Adhering  to 

international standards is critical if we wish to remain competitive in the global market.  

</span></div><div><span>With that in mind, Mr Speaker, I support this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  stand  to  support  the  Financial  Transactions 

</span><span>Reporting Amendment Bill.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to implement the recommended 

</span><span>actions put forth by the Global Forum on Transparency and the Exchange of Information for Tax 

Purposes.  This Forum conducts peer reviews and assessments across over 130 jurisdictions, and 

we are proud to be a member of this group that upholds international best practices.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 02 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The aim of these reviews, Mr Speaker, is to evaluate our country's ability to cooperate effectively 

with  established  standards.    Our  initial  peer  reviews  took  place  in  2017,  and  the  Cook  Islands 

received a very positive rating for its capacity to exchange information.  In light of the subsequent 

growth and improvements in both the quality and quantity of information exchanges, as well as 

enhancements to the standards themselves, a second round of assessment was initiated just last 

year. 

</span></div><div><span>This latest round includes a legal framework assessment and peer reviews that also cover technical, 

operational,  and  information  security  aspects.    During  this  process,  several  gaps  in  our  legal 

framework were identified, and the Global Forum provided recommendations aimed at helping us 

maintain  our  positive  rating.    Our  country  is  required  to  address  these  recommendations  by 

implementing  the  necessary  legislative  amendments  by  31</span><span>st</span><span>  December  of  this  year.    This  is 

essential to qualify for another round of onsite assessments and reviews in 2025. 

</span></div><div><span>To provide our Members and the public with a better understanding of this review, the security of 

information  is  very  important  and  the  security  of  tax  information  in  particular  is  of  significant 

importance to the Global Forum. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, some of the areas identified for improvement extend beyond legislative requirements, 

it is also in the basic operations.  For example, all doors in the RMD office that hold tax information 

must have security codes.  The staff that work there must have proper identification cards with ID 

cards to swipe and allow access to these rooms.   

</span></div><div><span>It is a big change from how our public service has operated for many years and maybe we do not 

see  the  actual  need  for  this  level  of  security.    However,  the  Global  Forum  has  its  standards  to 

maintain and we are obligated to maintain those standards, so we must follow suit. 

</span></div><div><span>Not  only  that  but  now  there's  also  a  requirement  for  proper  due  diligence  to  be  conducted  on 

employees or people who will work inside these departments. 

</span></div><div><span>It is these sorts of requirements, Mr Speaker that compels us in our Government Agencies, many 

of them now to change the way we do things and to be mindful of increased security measures that 

are being imposed on our country. 

</span></div><div><span>It  was  just  a  few  weeks  ago,  Mr  Speaker,  that  there  was  a  significant  attempt  to  hack  into  the 

</span><span>governmentâ€™s central network. However, thanks to the robust firewall security systems we have in 

</span><span>place, we  were able to  fend off these  attempts to  hack our system  from  overseas.   However, a 

couple of our local companies in the hospitality industry, their systems were compromised, Mr 

</span><span>Speaker and we were able to provide support to reduce any damage caused by these cyber security 

threats. 

</span></div><div><span>The financial transactions reporting requirements that our country have signed up to, Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>is  an  example  of  the  increasing  collaboration  among  international  jurisdictions  to  share 

</span><span>information.  Additionally, the need to protect the integrity of our financial centres and enhance 

our  cybersecurity  measures  will  only  intensify  as  the  world  increasingly  moves  toward  digital 

currencies.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 02 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to highlight a couple of key aspects of this Bill.  Firstly, it will eliminate 

the technical requirements for identifying beneficial owners, which are referred to as the ultimate 

principle.    These  requirements  will  be  incorporated  into  the  Financial  Transactions  Reporting 

Regulations.  These requirements are outlined in the Schedule of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Additionally, as previously mentioned, the Bill will align the definition of beneficial ownership in 

the  Companies  Act  2017  with  the  definition  in  the  Financial  Transactions  Reporting  Act  as 

amended in this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Moreover, the Bill will grant the Commission the authority to direct certain individuals to retain a 

bank record in situations where that bank is being wound up. 

</span></div><div><span>The Schedule of the Bill introduces changes to the Financial Transactions Reporting Regulations, 

which include definitions of "control."  This encompasses any individual who controls, whether 

acting  directly  or  indirectly,  and  either  individually  or  jointly.    Furthermore,  the  definition  of 

control also includes any person occupying a senior managerial position when the beneficial owner 

cannot be clearly identified. 

</span></div><div><span>In essence, Mr Speaker, the purpose is to ensure accountability within the company, specifically 

among  senior  management,  if  the  company  is  structured  to  conceal  the  true  identity  of  the 

beneficial  owner.    Additionally,  the  Bill  includes  provisions  that  exempt  professional  service 

providers,  such  as  lawyers,  advisors,  and  trust  companies,  from  being  classified  as  beneficial 

owners of a legal entity. 

</span></div><div><span>As you can see, Mr Speaker, the amendments involve a great deal of fine-tuning to ensure their 

</span><span>relevance in todayâ€™s co</span><span>ntext.  The consultations surrounding this Bill with the finance sector have 

demonstrated  strong  support  for  aligning  our  practices  with  international  standards,  which  is 

crucial for achieving positive outcomes in next year's review.  It is my honour, Mr Speaker, to 

support this Bill  in  the House, as  I am  confident  it will significantly contribute to  our positive 

results.  Furthermore, it is essential for maintaining the competitiveness of our financial sector on 

a global scale and ensuring its continued contribution to our economy in the future.  Thank you 

very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Members.  I will now put the Question.  The Question 

is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion for the Second Reading of the Financial Transaction Reporting 

Amendment Act 2024 be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Clerk for the Second Reading of the Bill.
