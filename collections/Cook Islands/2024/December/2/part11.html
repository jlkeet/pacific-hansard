<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>We have now come to Question Time, and that will be for 30 minutes, and I am opening the Floor 

to anyone for questions.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  First, Kia Orana to everyone here this afternoon.  I have 

a question that I would like to direct to the Honourable George Angene, and it may also pertain to 

Minister Albert Nicholas.  However, I would prefer that Minister George Angene respond to my 

inquiry. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I would like to pose a question to Minister Angene concerning a machine being utilised in 

Tupapa,  Matavera,  and  Ngatangiia.    Specifically,  I  would  like  to  know  if  the  government 

purchased this machine and whether it is generating revenue through its use. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  G.  ANGENE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  for  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  question 

raised by the Honourable Member for Matavera.  The inquiry is about the ownership of a machine.  

However, I am  uncertain which machine the Member is  referencing,  as I have six  machines at 

home, including eight blowers, eight hedge trimmers, eight grass cutters, and two excavators.  I 

believe the machine the Member of Parliament is referring to is the digger. 

</span></div><div><span>The  digger  that  I  am  utilising  does  not  belong  to  the  government,  nor  is  it  owned  by  George 

Maggie.  It belongs to the community and is intended to assist the people in their work without 

any charge.  That is the answer to your question, Honourable Member for Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  have  a  question  for  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister.    Could  you  please  provide  an  update  to  Parliament  regarding  the  status  of  the  boat? 

Previously, you mentioned that it might arrive in December.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Floor is yours, Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you to the Member for Murienua for asking about the update on our 

vessel.  I have good news: just a few weeks ago, I received an update regarding the vessel that will 

be  funded  by  the  government  of  Japan.    We  have  now  identified  the  vessel,  which  has  been 

</span><span>modified to carry more cargo and to accommodate a small number of passengers. 

</span></div><div><span>Thanks to our strong relationship with the government of Japan, this funded project has taken some 

time to come to fruition.  The previous vessel identified did not meet our requirements; however, 

</span><span>we have now found one that is more suitable.  The great news is that the government of Japan will 

</span><span>also cover the costs for the necessary modifications to bring the vessel up to our desired standards.  

Once these modifications are complete, we anticipate that our vessel will arrive by July.  That is 

the latest update for our Members and everyone here today.

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  My second question is directed to the Honourable Prime 

Minister.  It concerns the authority of the Vaka Councils in Rarotonga.  I have received inquiries 

from  the  public  regarding  the  Vaka  Councils,  and  my  question  is  whether  the  government  is 

considering reinstating them in Rarotonga.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Matavera for your question regarding the Vaka Council.  I have been reminded by my government 

colleagues  that  it  was  your  democratic  party,  while  in  government,  that  was  responsible  for 

abolishing the Vaka Council.  As such, we have not given any consideration to the re-establishment 

of the Vaka Council here in Rarotonga at this time. 

</span></div><div><span>At this moment, our primary focus is on supporting the Rarotonga community through various 

initiatives, such as community policing and programs led by Members of Parliament who are more 

directly involved with their constituencies.  Therefore, to provide a brief answer to your question, 

we have not given any consideration to the re-establishment of the Vaka Council. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members 

in the House today.  My question is directed to the Prime Minister, as you mentioned community 

policing in your previous response.  A few weeks ago, the Cook Islands newspaper reported on 

various troubling behaviours exhibited by our youth in the community, including breaking into 

private  homes  and  damaging  people's  property.    I  recall  discussions  in  previous  parliamentary 

sittings about encouraging policing efforts in our communities.  Could you provide an update on 

how the government plans to address these issues through community policing initiatives? 

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps the Honourable Prime Minister could provide specific details on the government's plan 

regarding  community  policing.    Additionally,  I  would  like  to  ask  whether  the  government  is 

considering revisiting our legislation concerning juvenile delinquency.  The reason for my inquiry 

is that we all know that minors cannot be legally prosecuted or convicted.  Given the increase in 

juvenile offenses, it may be time for us to consider legislation addressing this issue within this 

</span><span>House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for 

</span><span>your question.  The community policing initiative, Mr Speaker, aims to involve our community in 

enhancing  the  police  presence  in  our  neighbourhoods.  We  have  received  feedback  from  the 

community expressing a desire for a dedicated office where police can be stationed.  Members in

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 02 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Takitumu are already working on identifying suitable locations for police operations, and I know 

similar efforts are underway in Puaikura as well. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  past,  there  was  a  police  office  at  the  Aroa  Hall,  and  this  is  a  sentiment  echoed  by  our 

communities.  They desire not just for police to drive around, but to be visibly present and engaged 

within  the  community.    We  are  working  closely,  Mr  Speaker,  with  the  police  to  address  their 

financial needs, ensuring that we can implement this initiative effectively in the coming year. 

</span></div><div><span>However,  the  reality  is  that  addressing  juvenile  delinquency  requires  more  than  just  police 

involvement.  Many of these children, particularly young boys, need programs that will engage 

them  and  direct  them  towards  a  positive  path,  preventing  them  from  becoming  juvenile 

delinquents.   In the past, we have seen success  with  programs  that utilise sports to engage our 

youth, helping them to become productive members of the community.  We must build on these 

successful initiatives to provide our young people with the support and opportunities they need. 

</span></div><div><span>When we examine our current scholarship recipients pursuing advanced studies, we see that the 

majority are young girls.  This raises the question of whether we need to create more opportunities 

to  engage  young  boys  who  may  be  missing  out.    It  is  important  to  involve  all  sectors  of  our 

community to guide and support the development of our youth.  

</span></div><div><span>Schools, Church groups, sporting organisations, and various community groups all play vital roles 

in guiding our youth.  However, the most significant influence comes from parents.  I'm sure, Mr 

Speaker, you remember a time when the police officer was a figure of authority in the community, 

and children were afraid of them.  But they were even more afraid of that Mama with a kikau 

broom, a jandal, or a branch from the hedge ready to discipline them.  That kind of discipline kept 

many children in line.  Today, the dynamic seems to have changed; we are more scared in hurting 

our children, and many children are no longer scared of anything. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of the juvenile case under the Ministry of Justice, I know the Ministry of Justice has been 

active  in  ensuring  the  re-establishment  of  the  Juvenile  Crimes  Prevention  Committee.    And  of 

course, today measures a taking to use restorative of justices as a means of identifying these kids 

that are causing problems and making sure that, yes, they do face the consequences of any crimes 

that they may commit but do it in a way that they appreciate the impact that it had on their victims.  

</span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, efforts are being made to implement restorative justice measures as a means of addressing 

issues involving troubled youth.  These approaches ensure that while children face consequences 

for  any  crimes  they  commit,  they  also  come  to  understand  the  impact  of  their  actions  on  their 

</span><span>victims.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Prime Minister, for your response.  In your remarks, 

you referenced the Minister for Justice, which brings to mind a question I would like to pose to 

the Minister for Justice.

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Last week, you were the main actor in the Cook Islands News.  Could you please provide this 

Parliament House with an update on the mosque issue in Titikaveka? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone this afternoon.  I see we 

have the news reporter present in our House who covered this topic in the Cook Islands Newspaper.  

Welcome,  madam,  to  our  Parliament.    Mr  Speaker,  I  have  received  questions  from  the  news 

reporter regarding the establishment of a mosque in our country.  I have forwarded those questions 

to the Secretary of Justice and the Crown Law Office to seek further clarification.  

</span></div><div><span>I have informed the Cook Islands News that there are currently three pending applications for new 

faith  denominations  to  be  registered  in  the  Cook  Islands.    However,  concerning  the  Muslim 

Mosque, there is no application at this time.  I will be happy to share additional information with 

this House once I receive further clarification from Crown Law.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  After hearing what the Prime Minister 

has discussed, I would like to make a request on behalf of Vaka Puaikura.  We are facing significant 

challenges in our district, especially as we approach the festive season.  

</span></div><div><span>I urge the Prime Minister, who is also the Minister of Police, to make community policing a reality 

for us in Puaikura.  This initiative was very successful during Aporo Miria's tenure.  Therefore, I 

kindly  ask  for  your  consideration  in  allocating  a  police  officer  to  ensure  the  protection  of  our 

community and tourists.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you very much, Member.  That is a commendable suggestion and I 

believe it marks the beginning of our Community Policing program.  Already, Mr Speaker, we 

have  had  police  officers  visit  various  Vakas,  offering  their  services  to  implement  Community 

Policing  and  support  our  communities.    We  look  forward  to  the  prompt  commencement  and 

implementation of this program. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I believe the Honourable Member is 

eager  for  this  to  happen  as  soon  as  possible.    Honourable  Vaitoti  Tupa,  you  now  have  three 

minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  This question is directed to the Minister for 

Justice.  I recently read an article in the newspaper regarding an Act from 1975, which states that 

only four religious denominations are recognised in the Cook Islands: the CICC, Catholic, LDS, 

and SDA.  These are the only denominations permitted under this Act.  

</span></div><div><span>My  question  is  whether  you  have  the  capacity  to  review  this  Act  and  potentially  limit  the 

introduction  of  other  religions  into  our  country.    Our  Constitution  identifies  this  nation  as  a 

Christian country, which leads me to suggest that we reconsider this Act to maintain a limitation

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 02 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>of just these four denominations while we await further guidance from the Ministry of Justice or 

the Crown Law Office. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Just clarified that I am seeking Crown Laws 

advice on this because it is a very sensitive topic.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  I would like to provide a brief supplementary response to the Minister of 

Justice's  comments.    As  you  know,  Mr  Speaker,  Article  64  of  our  Constitution  guarantees 

fundamental principles and rights.  These rights emerged after the 1975 Act was enacted, which is 

why the law remains valid; it has not been amended and is recognised as valid under Article 64 of 

the Constitution.  If we consider changing or amending that Act, we must ensure compliance with 

Article 64, which guarantees equality and freedom of religion for everyone in the Cook Islands.  

This is just a short note to inform the Member from Matavera before any action is taken regarding 

that Act. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Members for our Question Time.
