<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  First, Kia Orana to everyone here this afternoon.  I have 

a question that I would like to direct to the Honourable George Angene, and it may also pertain to 

Minister Albert Nicholas.  However, I would prefer that Minister George Angene respond to my 

inquiry. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I would like to pose a question to Minister Angene concerning a machine being utilised in 

Tupapa,  Matavera,  and  Ngatangiia.    Specifically,  I  would  like  to  know  if  the  government 

purchased this machine and whether it is generating revenue through its use.
