<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Matavera for your question regarding the Vaka Council.  I have been reminded by my government 

colleagues  that  it  was  your  democratic  party,  while  in  government,  that  was  responsible  for 

abolishing the Vaka Council.  As such, we have not given any consideration to the re-establishment 

of the Vaka Council here in Rarotonga at this time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>At this moment, our primary focus is on supporting the Rarotonga community through various 

initiatives, such as community policing and programs led by Members of Parliament who are more 

directly involved with their constituencies.  Therefore, to provide a brief answer to your question, 

we have not given any consideration to the re-establishment of the Vaka Council. 

</span></div>
