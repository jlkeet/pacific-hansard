</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Clerk.  Honourable Members, that completes the First, Second and

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members we will now go to our third and last Bill on the Order Paper. 

</span></div><div><span>Utilities Regulations (Electricity, Water and Sewerage Services) Bill 2024.  I call the Honourable

</span></div><div><span>HON M. BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Utilities Regulations (Electricity, Water and Sewerage Services) Bill 2024  

</span><span>be now read for the Second time 

</span></div><div><span>766 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 02 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I call a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I will move very shortly that this Bill be referred 

to the Bills, Petitions, and Papers Committee, but first, I would like to provide some context about 

this Bill for the Members of the House and the public.  This Bill has been in development for some 

time and is part of our key plans for the recovery of the Cook Islands economy, especially in the 

wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

</span></div><div><span>We  understand,  Mr  Speaker,  that  our  utility  infrastructure,  specifically  electricity  and  water 

networks, plays a vital role in supporting a competitive and growing economy by ensuring that 

both individuals and businesses have reliable access to these essential services.  As a government, 

we are committed to ensuring that our investments in critical infrastructure and utilities are of the 

highest  quality.    It  is  equally  important  that  our  investments  in  water  and  electricity  networks 

promote sustainability and maintain quality over the long term. 

</span></div><div><span>Currently, our electricity and water providers, Te Aponga Uira, To Tatou Vai, and Te Mana Uira 

o  Araura,  are  not  regulated  and  do  not  operate  in  a  competitive  environment.    With the  recent 

establishment of the Competition and Regulatory Authority to regulate telecommunications, we 

are now well-positioned to include water and electricity sectors under this responsibility. 

</span></div><div><span>The objective of this Bill, Mr Speaker, is to ensure that electricity and water services are provided 

efficiently, safely, and reliably, while also being offered at fair prices for the long-term benefit of 

our  customers.    The  Bill  allows  for  regulations  that  are  predictable,  clear,  and  transparent, 

promoting consumer welfare effectively.  It will encourage efficient investment and will deliver 

high-quality, safe, sustainable, and reliable water and electricity networks. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore,  this  Bill  aligns  with  our  National  Development  Goals,  including  the  provision  of 

resilient  infrastructure  and  improving  access  to  affordable,  reliable,  sustainable,  and  modern 

energy.   Therefore, I am happy for this Bill Mr Speaker to go to our Bills, Petitions and Papers 

</span><span>Committee for further consultation and comments.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; 

you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to give my support for the Prime Minister's 

Motion to refer this Bill to the Bills Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Seconded by the Honourable Member, Teariki Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>HON T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to seek clarification on the Bill and also offer a 

comment regarding it before it proceeds to the Bills Select Committee.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 02 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to draw the Committee's attention to a typo-error in the Bill concerning the definition 

of 'transitional period' in the Interpretation section.  The Bill currently refers to the definition as 

outlined in section 81; however, section 81 pertains to a different subject.  The correct reference 

should be section 82, which defines 'transitional period.'  I wanted to raise this issue to ensure that 

the Bills Committee is aware of it, so that when the Bill returns, this amendment can be considered. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister, the correction was made earlier today. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Bill now stands referred to the Bills, Petitions and Papers Committee.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have now reached the conclusion of our Sitting for today.  Parliament 

is adjourned until tomorrow, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> December 2024, at 1 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>CLOSING PRAYER 

by Mr T. Maki-Kavana. 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament adjourned at 4.14 p.m.
