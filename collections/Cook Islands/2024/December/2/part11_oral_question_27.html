<h3>Oral Question 27</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  I would like to provide a brief supplementary response to the Minister of 

Justice's  comments.    As  you  know,  Mr  Speaker,  Article  64  of  our  Constitution  guarantees 

fundamental principles and rights.  These rights emerged after the 1975 Act was enacted, which is 

why the law remains valid; it has not been amended and is recognised as valid under Article 64 of 

the Constitution.  If we consider changing or amending that Act, we must ensure compliance with 

Article 64, which guarantees equality and freedom of religion for everyone in the Cook Islands.  

This is just a short note to inform the Member from Matavera before any action is taken regarding 

that Act.
