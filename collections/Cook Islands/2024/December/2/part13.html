</span></div><div><span>Monday, 02 December 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eleventh Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Members of this House, Kia Orana this afternoon.  Mr Speaker, 

as notice to the House that all these Papers 113, 115, 116, 117, 122, 126, 128, 130 and 140 are still 

with the Public Accounts Committee and still under review.  Mr Speaker, it is the hope of the PAC 

that we will be able to finalise the report on these Agencies and to be tabled in the next Parliament 

Sitting in February. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Chairperson.  I see the Honourable Minister Tingika 

Elikana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, following on from the comments made by the Chair of the 

PAC Committee and the fact they haven't reached any conclusions of their reviews of these Papers 

and in particular Paper No. 130 with regard to the Public Service which I moved for consideration 

and the need to draw comparisons between the reports from the Ministries and the decisions of 

PAC or the findings of PAC. I would like to move a Motion - 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in light of the comments made by the Chairperson of the PAC Committee, and the 

fact  that  they  have  not  yet  reached  any  conclusions  regarding  their  review  of  these  Papers, 

particularly  Paper  No.  130  related  to  the  Public  Service,  which  I  previously  moved  for 

consideration. It is essential to draw comparisons between the reports from the Ministries and the 

decisions or findings of the PAC.  Therefore, I would like to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>That all these Papers be deferred until the next sitting of Parliament when the PAC Report 

on these Papers are completed so we can really draw comparisons between the Papers from 

the Ministries and the findings of PAC 

</span></div><div><span>As  you  will  understand,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  also  like  to  address  the  other  Papers  to  draw 

comparisons between the reports from the Ministries and the findings of the PAC.  It is important 

to assess the actual work being done and whether we are receiving a return on our investments in 

these Ministries.  This is the main reason behind my Motion to defer all Papers until the next sitting 

of Parliament.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can I call for a Seconder to the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Before I second the Motion, I wanted to make a comment.  I 

think we will note that most of these Papers are 2022/23.  We should make an effort to stay current 

with these reports because once the reports that have been tabled today are referred to the PAC, 

we will have another load. 

</span></div><div><span>While I support the Motion, I second the Motion, we should be mindful, I'd ask if we be mindful 

that each report should be relevant.  We should not be discussing reports that are two years old. 

Those are my comments, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Pupuke Browne 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is:
