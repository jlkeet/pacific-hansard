</span></div><div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Tuk</span><span>aka Ama to present the, ‘Keep our Water Free’ Petition.</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Pursuant to Standing Order 236 (3), I hereby present to 

</span><span>Parliament the ‘Keep our Water Free’ Petition and with you</span><span>r indulgence Mr Speaker, to make a 

brief statement. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Honourable Members of this House, and our guests in the Gallery, 

Kia Orana in the Name of the Lord.  For my opening address to the House this afternoon is to bring 

the Word of God before us in saying that everything on earth belongs to the Lord.  To further 

support the Scripture, there is a song known by our people as </span><span>“</span><span>when I was hungry you fed me, and 

when I was thirsty you gave me water to drink.</span><span>”</span><span>  I do not want to sing as it might take us a while. 

</span></div><div><span>What is the most important thing in life?  The answer is water from God.  As per the To Tatou Vai 

Act established in 2021, the Water Authority is required to be financially independent and use a 

user  pay  funding  model.    In  my  opinion,  this  group  should  initiate  a  dialogue  with  the  Water 

Authority to reach an agreement.  There are alternate ways to obtain water and financial support, 

and we must work together to ensure that taxes are imposed fairly on all individuals based on their 

income.    This  will  ensure  that  everyone  has  access  to  water  and  we  can  work  towards  the 

betterment of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>A total of 3,407 people have signed the 'Keep our Water Free Petition', which I have the honour 

of presenting today on behalf of my constituents.  This petition highlights their concerns over water 

and deserves our attention and action.  As elected representatives, it is our responsibility to listen 

to our people and take their concerns seriously. 

</span></div><div><span>To  conclude,  I  strongly  advocate  for  the  continuation  of  water  collection,  treatment,  and 

distribution without imposing any ongoing charges or tariffs on users.  I firmly believe that our 

Maori culture, practices, and way of life will suffer if we start paying for water.  I pray that God 

blesses our nation and all of us. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  Pursuant to Standing Order 236(4), I now 

order the Petition to be laid on the Table without debate.  

</span></div><div><span>I call the Clerk to read the Petition. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK (T. VAINERERE):</span><span>In the matter of ‘Keep our Water Free Petition’, the To Tatou Vai 

</span><span>Act  2021  sets  that  the  Water  Authority  be  financially  independent,  and  mandates  a  user-pays 

funding model.  The Petition respectfully requests that the collection, treatment and reticulation of 

</span><span>water continue without tariffs and ongoing charges to users. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Clerk.

</span></div><div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Pursuant to Standing Order 237(1), the Petition now stand referred to the Bills, Petitions and Papers 

Committee. 

I now call the Honourable Prime Minister on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker and to every Member of this House.  Kia Orana to 

our friends Te Vai Ora Maori group in th</span><span>e visitors’ Gallery. </span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to speak on the request of Motion for an adjournment until tomorrow to allow 

Members  to  be  able  to  attend  the  Opening  Ceremony  of  the  World  Youth  Netball  Qualifying 

Tournament which will begin at 3.00 p.m.  I know we had Members of the House that will be 

involved in this Opening Ceremony.  The Leader of the Opposition herself is a long-time member 

of the executive of Oceania Netball but also Cook Islands Netball, will be a special guest.  And of 

course,  the  Government  representative  who  will  be  delivering  our  address  to  this  qualifying 

tournament herself is no stranger to netball organisation representative of our country.  Mrs Akaiti 

Puna will be delivering on behalf of the Government.  

</span></div><div><span>Of course, Members of the House, I know some of them have an interest in netball, some of them 

</span><span>has been playing netball when they were trying to play rugby.  That’s beside the point, they will 

</span><span>also be interested in attending this very important tournament. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact,  I think Mr Speaker  and  I stand to  be corrected the last time particular tournament was 

hosted in our country might have been back in 2009.  So, 14 years ago since that was last hosted 

here in our country.  

</span></div><div><span>So, with those words Mr Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 47 (1), I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament do now adjourn to until tomorrow  

Tuesday 17 September at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Leader of the Opposition, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWN:</span><span> Mr Speaker, this is  one rare occasion  where  I  would Second a 

Motion by the Prime Minister, but I second this Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Pupuke Browne 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow Tuesday 17 September 2024 at 1.00 p.m.
