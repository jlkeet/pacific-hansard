<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you, to our Leader of the Opposition on 

this  question.    It  has  been  something  that  has  been  released  before  and  I  have  heard  the  same 

response given that our sporting needs particularly in the netball program was anticipated that New 

</span><span>Zealand would be supporting our netball program. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This reminds me also of Australiaâ€™s support for the rugby league program through the p</span><span>acific and 

</span><span>this  program  was  to  be  disbursed  through  the  NRL.    Unfortunately,  again  through  that 

</span><span>disbursement our Cook Islands did not feature in that support. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One of the other areas that we know that has led to a difficulty for us in being part of the original 

</span><span>sporting program is our graduation.  Because of our graduation the classification is of high-income 

</span><span>country  grant  funding  for  certain  program  we  are  not  eligible  for  them.    And  there  have  been 

programs that has been funded by Australia through regional organisation that some of them we 

have no longer qualified for it so we had to look at alternative ways to keep some of these programs 

funded and keep them going.

</span></div>
<div><span>But Australia is a great sporting nation and I know they can see the benefit in a sports program and 

the support that they give out through the pacific region.  Perhaps we just need to make sure that 

our sporting programs are structured or programmed in a way that would be able to fit within the 

program of support that Australia provides across the pacific region. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, something to discuss with the Australia High Commissioner while we are sitting watching 

the netball later on this evening tonight.  Thank you.
