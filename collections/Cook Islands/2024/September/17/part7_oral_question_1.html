<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, may I seek your permission to direct my question to the Honourable 

Prime Minister?  Before I do so, I kindly request your consent to clarify the context of my question.  

This request stems from a statement made by the Member of Tupapa during which he announced 

that  he  will  not  be  standing  in  the  next  election.    Consequently,  he  suggested  that  it  may  be 

appropriate to allocate two seats for the village of Tupapa/Maraerenga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The rationale behind this proposal is that the Te Au o Tonga constituency has the largest number 

of registered voters, totaling 1,249 when compared to other Vakas.  As a result, it is the largest 

constituency. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Te Au o Tonga constituency has a total of over 3,900 registered voters, out of which 1,249 

voters  belong  to  the  Tupapa/Maraerenga  tapere.    This  makes  Tupapa/Maraerenga  the  largest 

Tapere on Rarotonga in  terms of registered voters.   Additionally, the distance from one end of 

Tupapa/Maraerenga  to  the  other  is  approximately  five  kilometres.    I  hope  this  background 

information clarifies the basis of my inquiry.  For any further details, please feel free to approach 

me. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister,  if  I  may,  I  kindly  request  a  direct  response  to  my  inquiry.    Is  it 

</span><span>appropriate to have two Members for Tupapa/Maraerenga constituency? 

</span></div>
