</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 116; No 117 … sorry I did not see you.</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I have request for a little clarification.  I understand 

that at the top of the Procedure Note that the reason why we are going through these Papers is 

because they have been referred to PAC and have been dealt with.   

</span></div><div><span>When I look at the Report by PAC at Part 2 on the table, they list the Papers or Reports that they 

</span><span>have dealt with and it doesn’t include all of these. </span><span> So, please clarify if all of these Papers that we 

are going through have been dealt with by PAC because the Report that we are looking at that was 

tabled today does not include all of these Reports. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition. I will be seeking advice from 

the Clerk. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, this is the explanation that has been given to me. These Reports has already 

been discussed by the PAC. The recommendations that have been given will be given in their main 

Final Report because they have already debated it. If you need further clarification to come and 

see me after the adjournment.  

</span></div><div><span>I think Honourable Members while we are in discussions for this, can we have a break? Parliament 

is now suspended until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.40 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please be seated.  Our Parliament has resumed.  We are still under Standing 

Order 230.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am aware that Parliament Paper No. 113, which pertains 

</span><span>to  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  Annual  Performance  report,  has  already  been  read  and  passed.  

</span><span>However, I would like to propose that this paper be reintroduced to the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.
