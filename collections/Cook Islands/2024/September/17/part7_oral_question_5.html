<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff today.  

Greetings to the Prime Minister and the Members on that side of the House.  Also, greetings to us 

on this side.  To all those who are listening to the radio and those watching livestream greeting to 

you all.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I ask my question Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his Motion 

yesterday for an adjournment so that we who were affiliated with netball in the past were able to 

go to the TSA for the Opening Ceremony of the Under 21 World Netball Qualifying Tournament.  

</span><span>Because to qualify and Fiji had already qualified, so the other four teams Tonga, Samoa, PNG and 

the Cook Islands, we need to get the best three out of the four.  Should the Cook Islands get into 

the top three then we get to play in the World Youth Tournament in Gibraltar next year.  I am very 

proud because even though we are a small country but we are always putting up our hands to host 

events such as this.  

</span></div>
<div><span>It is also beneficial for us that these countries are visiting to be part of this qualifier.  Because our 

tourism business is blooming again, then apart from one team staying in a motel the rest are staying 

in hostels and the CIFA complex in Matavera.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Manihiki  because  she  represented 

government at the Opening Ceremony.  It is appropriate because she had been involved in netball 

activities in the past.  The only downfall Mr Prime Minister is that maybe the other Members did

</span></div>
<div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>not hear the reason for the adjournment yesterday because I and the Member for Manihiki were 

the only ones in the VIP area where 20 seats were allocated.  Maybe the Members did not listen 

properly that the reason for the adjournment is that so we can participate in the Opening Ceremony. 

But never mind the Member for Manihiki and I represented us.  Thankfully, our local Tonga and 

Samoa population filled the auditorium.  They were so vocally supportive during the game between 

Samoa and Tonga.  When it came to the game between the Cook Islands and PNG I am pleased to 

say that although there were a few of us, the vocal support increased as the game went on.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The Speaker is signaling to me to ask my question and before I do so, I have a request to ask us to 

come and give your support.  Our girls won their game against PNG by about 20 points difference.  

We will be playing against Tonga today and your support is needed.  There are three players from 

Takuvaine, two from Titikaveka/Ngatangiia so this gives you an incentive to come and support. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is the question I wanted to ask the Prime Minister.  However, I truly believe that the question 

should be directed to the Minister of Sports but I know he is not here.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The Australian Government provides funding to the Oceania Netball.  For some reason however, 

that funding only goes to Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea.  Apparently, the claim is that we 

get funding from New Zealand; our netball gets funding from New Zealand.  Of course, that is not 

correct. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So,  this  is  my  question,  whether  there  will  be  funding  available  through  our  government  to 

communicate to the Australian High Commission as to why we are not included in that funding, 

and yet our netball does not receive funding from New Zealand.
