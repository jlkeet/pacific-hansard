<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  from 

Matavera  for  the  question  in  relation  to  the  suggestion  on  the  high  number  of  voters  in  this 

constituent.  Maybe it is about time for us to split this area so that they can have two members.  

But if you look Mr Speaker, should we increase the number of Members of Parliament, then rightly 

so we should be looking at a cut in some areas.  I am looking at constituencies with a low number 

of  voters  then  we  should  cancel  that  constituency  out.    So,  if  we  cut  down  the  Mangaia  and 

Rakahanga seats then there is less representative from their party in the House.

<div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is a wonderful idea to me Mr Speaker, maybe if we can then combine Matavera and Tupapa 

then we can justify in having two members.  This is not a new concept Mr Speaker.  Maybe it is 

about time we carefully look at the number of voters in the constituencies then maybe it is about 

time to make adjustments to suit our situation today.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In 1965 when the constituencies were established in the Cook Islands, there were a lot of people 

in  our  country.    The  allocations  were  appropriated  based  on  the  number  of  voters  such  as  in 

Aitutaki at the time.  However, nowadays we can see a lot of our population from the Pa Enua 

have relocated onto Rarotonga.  The number of people in the Pa Enua has decreased.  So, I think 

it is the appropriate time to look at these seats whether to reduce them and increase others where 

there are a lot of voters.  Not only Tupapa with 1049 voters but Nikao/Panama had 1220 voters. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I know this is a problem area with some Members when we talk about Social Responsibility Fund 

which  we  usually  refer  to  as  the  SRF.    The  SRF  amount  for  the  constituencies  is  $20,000  per 

annum.  Regardless whether there are over 1000 people or only 80 people in your constituency, 

the entitlement is still $20,000.  Maybe it is about time we need to look at an Electoral Reform on 

these matters.  So, thank you to the Member from Matavera for this question although you did not 

mention anything on your constituency.
