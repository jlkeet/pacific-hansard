<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am pretty sure that I will take all of the remaining 

time for Question Time because the time were used by the many questions before.  My question 

Mr Speaker is to the Prime Minister or the Minister Responsible for Health. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My inquiry pertains to the individuals who return to the Cook Islands after being referred overseas 

for medical treatment or those who have been discharged from hospitals and require long-term 

care.  It has been brought to our attention that many of our elderly and sick people returning from 

New Zealand are not being admitted to hospitals upon their return.  Instead, they are sent directly 

to their homes, where their families are expected to provide care for them, even though they may 

not have received proper training on how to do so. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  97-year-old  grandmother  in  our  constituency  who  comes  from  the  family  of  Papa 

Arapati Henry, and they are highly respected in the community.  She has a son who was referred 

to New Zealand and returned with health issues, and both individuals require medical attention.  

We  are  grateful  to  their  family  for  taking  up  the  responsibility  to  provide  care  for  this  elderly 

mother and son, despite their own health conditions. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is evident that in the past, our hospitals have taken care of our sick and elderly people.  However, 

</span><span>over the past decade, we have observed a decline in the healthcare services provided by our health 

</span><span>systems.  Therefore, I would like to request, Honourable Prime Minister, that you pay particular 

</span><span>attention to the needs of our community members who are struggling with such health conditions.  

</span><span>While you may not have personally experienced these issues, there are some households in our 

</span><span>community that are currently facing them. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As we think about the 97-year-old sick grandmother who has connections to Papa Arapati Henry, 

</span><span>I must pose the question - where is the Cook Islands Party in this matter and what support are they 

</span><span>providing to ensure her proper care?

<div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister and you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Personal tragedy should not be politicised.  Care 

for our elderly is not a matter for a political party to be accused of not caring.  Many of us has been 

through situations like this where our elderly either very old and they are not sick but they are old 

but they need care. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And for most of us for our history of our country that care is provided by the family and it continues 

to this day because we do not have a facility that looks after our aging people for geriatric care.  

As a country that has developed and grown over the years, Mr Speaker we have had to build and 

</span><span>established needs that previously we didnâ€™t have</span><span> in our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It was only a couple of years ago, Mr Speaker we opened our mental health ward at the hospital to 

care for those who have a mental illness in a facility that is suitable.  In the past because some of 

these people can be violent and it is difficult for the home to care for these people and its difficult 

for a hospital to care for these people in the past, we had mental health cases being referred to the 

prison to be able to be catered for. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, in terms of those reaching end of life care, Mr Speaker, our hospital provides service to some 

who are reaching the end of life, so that they can receive palliative care, that is pain relief before 

they pass on.  But for others, Mr Speaker who needs 24 hours care that has been provided in the 

past in the home.  And in fact, the advice received to the government over those years that it is 

best for elderly people to be kept as long as possible in their home before needing to swift them 

into a specialised facility. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Which is why the government does as much as it can through providing pay for caregivers who 

are able to stay home and look after their elderly.  Which is why the government provides funding 

to help households improve their facilities for toilet, bedrooms so that infirm and elderly people 

can be catered for in bathing them and in helping them in their homes.  We know it is a challenge 

</span><span>on families to be able to devote 24-hour care to look after their elderly and many of our people 

</span><span>will now employ and hire full time care givers from places like the Philippines or from Fiji and 

</span><span>other countries because they need to continue working and many of us in this House have had to 

</span><span>personally live through that and provide care for our elderly parents when they reach end of life. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, this is a question not to ask the Cook Island Party what you can do for this lady, this is the 

question that we ask our Ministries and our departments, what is the help we can provide to this 

household to make the life of this elderly lady and her son much more comfortable.  Thank you, 

Mr Speaker.
