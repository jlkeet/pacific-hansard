<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, may I seek your permission to direct my question to the Honourable 

Prime Minister?  Before I do so, I kindly request your consent to clarify the context of my question.  

This request stems from a statement made by the Member of Tupapa during which he announced 

that  he  will  not  be  standing  in  the  next  election.    Consequently,  he  suggested  that  it  may  be 

appropriate to allocate two seats for the village of Tupapa/Maraerenga. 

</span></div><div><span>The rationale behind this proposal is that the Te Au o Tonga constituency has the largest number 

of registered voters, totaling 1,249 when compared to other Vakas.  As a result, it is the largest 

constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>The Te Au o Tonga constituency has a total of over 3,900 registered voters, out of which 1,249 

voters  belong  to  the  Tupapa/Maraerenga  tapere.    This  makes  Tupapa/Maraerenga  the  largest 

Tapere on Rarotonga in  terms of registered voters.   Additionally, the distance from one end of 

Tupapa/Maraerenga  to  the  other  is  approximately  five  kilometres.    I  hope  this  background 

information clarifies the basis of my inquiry.  For any further details, please feel free to approach 

me. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister,  if  I  may,  I  kindly  request  a  direct  response  to  my  inquiry.    Is  it 

</span><span>appropriate to have two Members for Tupapa/Maraerenga constituency? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  from 

Matavera  for  the  question  in  relation  to  the  suggestion  on  the  high  number  of  voters  in  this 

constituent.  Maybe it is about time for us to split this area so that they can have two members.  

But if you look Mr Speaker, should we increase the number of Members of Parliament, then rightly 

so we should be looking at a cut in some areas.  I am looking at constituencies with a low number 

of  voters  then  we  should  cancel  that  constituency  out.    So,  if  we  cut  down  the  Mangaia  and 

Rakahanga seats then there is less representative from their party in the House.

</span></div><div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>This is a wonderful idea to me Mr Speaker, maybe if we can then combine Matavera and Tupapa 

then we can justify in having two members.  This is not a new concept Mr Speaker.  Maybe it is 

about time we carefully look at the number of voters in the constituencies then maybe it is about 

time to make adjustments to suit our situation today.  

</span></div><div><span>In 1965 when the constituencies were established in the Cook Islands, there were a lot of people 

in  our  country.    The  allocations  were  appropriated  based  on  the  number  of  voters  such  as  in 

Aitutaki at the time.  However, nowadays we can see a lot of our population from the Pa Enua 

have relocated onto Rarotonga.  The number of people in the Pa Enua has decreased.  So, I think 

it is the appropriate time to look at these seats whether to reduce them and increase others where 

there are a lot of voters.  Not only Tupapa with 1049 voters but Nikao/Panama had 1220 voters. 

</span></div><div><span>I know this is a problem area with some Members when we talk about Social Responsibility Fund 

which  we  usually  refer  to  as  the  SRF.    The  SRF  amount  for  the  constituencies  is  $20,000  per 

annum.  Regardless whether there are over 1000 people or only 80 people in your constituency, 

the entitlement is still $20,000.  Maybe it is about time we need to look at an Electoral Reform on 

these matters.  So, thank you to the Member from Matavera for this question although you did not 

mention anything on your constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I would like to remind you to beware of your questions 

and answers because most of the people in Tupapa is from Rakahanga and Ivirua.  And in Nikao 

from Mauke.  

</span></div><div><span>I now give the Floor to the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE-BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff today.  

Greetings to the Prime Minister and the Members on that side of the House.  Also, greetings to us 

on this side.  To all those who are listening to the radio and those watching livestream greeting to 

you all.   

</span></div><div><span>Before I ask my question Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his Motion 

yesterday for an adjournment so that we who were affiliated with netball in the past were able to 

go to the TSA for the Opening Ceremony of the Under 21 World Netball Qualifying Tournament.  

</span><span>Because to qualify and Fiji had already qualified, so the other four teams Tonga, Samoa, PNG and 

the Cook Islands, we need to get the best three out of the four.  Should the Cook Islands get into 

the top three then we get to play in the World Youth Tournament in Gibraltar next year.  I am very 

proud because even though we are a small country but we are always putting up our hands to host 

events such as this.  

</span></div><div><span>It is also beneficial for us that these countries are visiting to be part of this qualifier.  Because our 

tourism business is blooming again, then apart from one team staying in a motel the rest are staying 

in hostels and the CIFA complex in Matavera.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Manihiki  because  she  represented 

government at the Opening Ceremony.  It is appropriate because she had been involved in netball 

activities in the past.  The only downfall Mr Prime Minister is that maybe the other Members did 

</span></div><div><span>739 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 16 September 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>not hear the reason for the adjournment yesterday because I and the Member for Manihiki were 

the only ones in the VIP area where 20 seats were allocated.  Maybe the Members did not listen 

properly that the reason for the adjournment is that so we can participate in the Opening Ceremony. 

But never mind the Member for Manihiki and I represented us.  Thankfully, our local Tonga and 

Samoa population filled the auditorium.  They were so vocally supportive during the game between 

Samoa and Tonga.  When it came to the game between the Cook Islands and PNG I am pleased to 

say that although there were a few of us, the vocal support increased as the game went on.  

</span></div><div><span>The Speaker is signaling to me to ask my question and before I do so, I have a request to ask us to 

come and give your support.  Our girls won their game against PNG by about 20 points difference.  

We will be playing against Tonga today and your support is needed.  There are three players from 

Takuvaine, two from Titikaveka/Ngatangiia so this gives you an incentive to come and support. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the question I wanted to ask the Prime Minister.  However, I truly believe that the question 

should be directed to the Minister of Sports but I know he is not here.  

</span></div><div><span>The Australian Government provides funding to the Oceania Netball.  For some reason however, 

that funding only goes to Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea.  Apparently, the claim is that we 

get funding from New Zealand; our netball gets funding from New Zealand.  Of course, that is not 

correct. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  this  is  my  question,  whether  there  will  be  funding  available  through  our  government  to 

communicate to the Australian High Commission as to why we are not included in that funding, 

and yet our netball does not receive funding from New Zealand.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister and you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you, to our Leader of the Opposition on 

this  question.    It  has  been  something  that  has  been  released  before  and  I  have  heard  the  same 

response given that our sporting needs particularly in the netball program was anticipated that New 

</span><span>Zealand would be supporting our netball program. 

</span></div><div><span>This reminds me also of Australiaâ€™s support for the rugby league program through the p</span><span>acific and 

</span><span>this  program  was  to  be  disbursed  through  the  NRL.    Unfortunately,  again  through  that 

</span><span>disbursement our Cook Islands did not feature in that support. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the other areas that we know that has led to a difficulty for us in being part of the original 

</span><span>sporting program is our graduation.  Because of our graduation the classification is of high-income 

</span><span>country  grant  funding  for  certain  program  we  are  not  eligible  for  them.    And  there  have  been 

programs that has been funded by Australia through regional organisation that some of them we 

have no longer qualified for it so we had to look at alternative ways to keep some of these programs 

funded and keep them going.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 16 September 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>But Australia is a great sporting nation and I know they can see the benefit in a sports program and 

the support that they give out through the pacific region.  Perhaps we just need to make sure that 

our sporting programs are structured or programmed in a way that would be able to fit within the 

program of support that Australia provides across the pacific region. 

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps, something to discuss with the Australia High Commissioner while we are sitting watching 

the netball later on this evening tonight.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Teariki 

Heather and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am pretty sure that I will take all of the remaining 

time for Question Time because the time were used by the many questions before.  My question 

Mr Speaker is to the Prime Minister or the Minister Responsible for Health. 

</span></div><div><span>My inquiry pertains to the individuals who return to the Cook Islands after being referred overseas 

for medical treatment or those who have been discharged from hospitals and require long-term 

care.  It has been brought to our attention that many of our elderly and sick people returning from 

New Zealand are not being admitted to hospitals upon their return.  Instead, they are sent directly 

to their homes, where their families are expected to provide care for them, even though they may 

not have received proper training on how to do so. 

</span></div><div><span>There  is  a  97-year-old  grandmother  in  our  constituency  who  comes  from  the  family  of  Papa 

Arapati Henry, and they are highly respected in the community.  She has a son who was referred 

to New Zealand and returned with health issues, and both individuals require medical attention.  

We  are  grateful  to  their  family  for  taking  up  the  responsibility  to  provide  care  for  this  elderly 

mother and son, despite their own health conditions. 

</span></div><div><span>It is evident that in the past, our hospitals have taken care of our sick and elderly people.  However, 

</span><span>over the past decade, we have observed a decline in the healthcare services provided by our health 

</span><span>systems.  Therefore, I would like to request, Honourable Prime Minister, that you pay particular 

</span><span>attention to the needs of our community members who are struggling with such health conditions.  

</span><span>While you may not have personally experienced these issues, there are some households in our 

</span><span>community that are currently facing them. 

</span></div><div><span>As we think about the 97-year-old sick grandmother who has connections to Papa Arapati Henry, 

</span><span>I must pose the question - where is the Cook Islands Party in this matter and what support are they 

</span><span>providing to ensure her proper care?

</span></div><div><span>Tenth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister and you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Personal tragedy should not be politicised.  Care 

for our elderly is not a matter for a political party to be accused of not caring.  Many of us has been 

through situations like this where our elderly either very old and they are not sick but they are old 

but they need care. 

</span></div><div><span>And for most of us for our history of our country that care is provided by the family and it continues 

to this day because we do not have a facility that looks after our aging people for geriatric care.  

As a country that has developed and grown over the years, Mr Speaker we have had to build and 

</span><span>established needs that previously we didnâ€™t have</span><span> in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>It was only a couple of years ago, Mr Speaker we opened our mental health ward at the hospital to 

care for those who have a mental illness in a facility that is suitable.  In the past because some of 

these people can be violent and it is difficult for the home to care for these people and its difficult 

for a hospital to care for these people in the past, we had mental health cases being referred to the 

prison to be able to be catered for. 

</span></div><div><span>So, in terms of those reaching end of life care, Mr Speaker, our hospital provides service to some 

who are reaching the end of life, so that they can receive palliative care, that is pain relief before 

they pass on.  But for others, Mr Speaker who needs 24 hours care that has been provided in the 

past in the home.  And in fact, the advice received to the government over those years that it is 

best for elderly people to be kept as long as possible in their home before needing to swift them 

into a specialised facility. 

</span></div><div><span>Which is why the government does as much as it can through providing pay for caregivers who 

are able to stay home and look after their elderly.  Which is why the government provides funding 

to help households improve their facilities for toilet, bedrooms so that infirm and elderly people 

can be catered for in bathing them and in helping them in their homes.  We know it is a challenge 

</span><span>on families to be able to devote 24-hour care to look after their elderly and many of our people 

</span><span>will now employ and hire full time care givers from places like the Philippines or from Fiji and 

</span><span>other countries because they need to continue working and many of us in this House have had to 

</span><span>personally live through that and provide care for our elderly parents when they reach end of life. 

</span></div><div><span>So, this is a question not to ask the Cook Island Party what you can do for this lady, this is the 

question that we ask our Ministries and our departments, what is the help we can provide to this 

household to make the life of this elderly lady and her son much more comfortable.  Thank you, 

Mr Speaker.

time.  I have a request to make to Members of this House to please support our netball girls.  I 

know that you all attended the seabed conference yesterday.  I myself went to support the netball 

girls.
