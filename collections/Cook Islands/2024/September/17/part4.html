in the Northern Group, the Committee has been unable to travel and conduct consultations with 

the  people  in  that  area.    I  am  pleased  to  inform  you  that  the  fuel  delivery  boat  has  arrived  in 

Rakahanga or Manihiki and will facilitate the travel of the Committee to the Northern Group soon.  

The Committee is working diligently to complete the consultation process and prepare the report 

for presentation in the next sitting of Parliament.  Thank you.
