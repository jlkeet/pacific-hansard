<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you very much to the Honourable Member for Matavera for your 

excellent question.  As we both have connections to Manihiki, I will address your inquiry.  Thank 

you, Mr Speaker, for the chance to respond. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There  are  two  Ministers  who  oversee  Punanga  Nui.  The  first  is  myself,  Honourable  Member 

George  Angene,  and  the  second  is  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Honourable  Albert  Nicholas.  

Nevertheless, I am uncertain if your question is intended for me or the Deputy Prime Minister.  

Regardless, I will do my best to provide a response. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the  coastal area of the market,  I had  extensive plans for this  region  when  I was the 

Minister.  Nonetheless, because I did not have control over the finances for this area previously, I 

could not implement my ideas.  If I were the Minister in charge of Punanganui Market's budget, I 

would have already constructed buildings and an Olympic-sized swimming pool for the children.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you to the Deputy Prime Minister Abert Nicholas for affirming the construction of a large 

farmers'  market  complex  for  the  farmers'  benefit  and  utilisation.    The  current  area  where  the 

Maroro hut is situated, and fried fish is sold and consumed, and the public toilet will be moved 

further down to the coast.  Additionally, we will construct vending shelters further down the coast 

and move the playground area to the Tupapa end near the Terevete Park. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, when the New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister visited, he granted some money for 

this development project, and the current government has also provided funding for this initiative.  

Thank you to the Prime Minister and your department for your assistance in progressing this plan.  

Our target is to conclude the project by the end of the year.  That is my response to the Member 

from Matavera's question.
