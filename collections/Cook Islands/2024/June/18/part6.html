<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>We have come to Question Time, and that will be for 30 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  Question  Time  expired  yesterday,  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  was  on  the  Floor  to 

answer  the  question  put  forward  by  the  Honourable  Teariki  Heather.    I  give  the  Floor  to  the 

Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all this afternoon.  In response to the 

question raised by the Honourable Member for Murienua, the status of our Police, like many of 

our Agencies and Ministries, we can be attributed it to finance and financial management.  We 

recognised that retention of staff has been a challenge, not just in the Police, but in some of our 

key Ministries as well, as we try to be competitive with our salaries that we can offer to some of 

</span><span>our  people.    The  attraction  being  provided  by  other  organisations  and  from  overseas  is  a  real 

</span><span>challenge.  So, in the medium term, the ability to be able to increase salaries for our workers needs 

to be hand in hand with the growth of our economy.  We need to grow our economies so we can 

afford to pay people more.   

</span></div><div><span>In terms of the Police department with the retirement of  our Police Commissioner, we have an 

opportunity now to reset, if you would like the strategy for the Police department.  I would be 

seeking  more  meetings  with  our  current  Deputy  Police  Commissioner,  who  is  the  Acting 

Commissioner at the moment, to look at how we can address the immediate concerns.   

</span></div><div><span>The first step is to engage with the Ministry of Finance for their shared financial services that they 

provide to a number of Agencies, to take the Police on as one of their clients now to manage the 

finances  of  the  Police  department.    This  will  allow  the  Police  to  concentrate  their  efforts  on 

policing matters rather than looking at ways to find money or to save money.  Using the Ministry 

of Finance shared services also allows for better budget management so that the appropriations 

that had been given to the Police goes to where it is intended for.  We have heard the comments 

about the levels of underspent within the Ministry in their Personnel of up to $200,000 - $400,000.  

</span><span>Much of this is not money that has been underspent.  This is money that is being accrued under 

</span><span>accumulated annual leave.  In particular, annual leave accrued by members of our Police Force in 

</span><span>the Outer Islands, where have not used up their leave.   

</span></div><div><span>So, this accrues in the balance sheet as unspent funds.  But with better budget management of the 

</span><span>Police Force, we believe that we can improve that situation to ensure money that is appropriated 

</span><span>for certain things in the Police Force are actually spent in these areas.  And it is through this much 

better  improved  financial  management  that  we  are  looking  at,  that  we  can  improve  the 

remuneration of Police Officers up to a more appropriate level.  And in the forward years, I will 

be looking to sit with the Police Commissioner to review the Policing strategy moving forward to

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>identify the areas that we need to put money in to fund so that they can operate effectively as a 

Police Department. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the new initiatives in the region that has been announced recently is, Australia who have 

set  up  a  new  Regional  Policing  Centre  for  training  police  officers  in  the  Pacific  and  they  are 

looking  to  establish  the  centre  in  Melbourne  which  will  be  catering  specifically  Pacific  Police 

Officers in order to train them up and upskill in their facility that they will cover the cost of. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I believe, Mr Speaker that these initial moves that we are looking at, improving the financial 

management of the Police, allowing their funds to be utilised appropriately, remunerating Police 

to a more appropriate level, will go a long way towards addressing the current problems. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the new initiatives that we are looking to implement in this financial year, Mr Speaker is 

the  re-establishment  of  our  Community  Policing.    We  are  looking  to  re-establish  Community 

Policing in Puaikura and in Takitumu to have more of a Police presence in these communities.   

</span></div><div><span>So, with the collaboration of the Ministry of Finance and likely the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as 

well, working with the Police Department we should get better results and better staff retention of 

our Police Officers.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to ask a Supplementary Question to the Prime 

Minister and also Minister for Police.  I appreciate the response given by the Honourable Prime 

Minister, but my concern, as well as the concern of the people, is the current situation.  We are 

faced with a major issue in our country.  Thieves are rampant in the Arorangi and town areas, and 

there has been an increase in accidents.  Therefore, I would like to ask the Prime Minister what 

measures the government plans to take to address this problem.  The safety of our people is at risk, 

not only on the roads but also in their homes and businesses.  This problem is escalating, and we 

</span><span>need swift action.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you again for the Supplementary Question.  Yes, we are well aware 

</span><span>of what we are seeing, hooligan drivers on the road now, young kids seeming to speed along the 

</span><span>road, cross over to the road without any concern about being caught. 

</span></div><div><span>Certainly, the request is going to the Police to have more of a presence on the roads to apprehend 

these  hooligan  drivers,  to  deter  them  from  doing  what  they  are  doing  and  also  to  work  with 

</span></div><div><span>635

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>businesses that are being targeted by the thieves to find ways to try and reduce and eliminate this 

occurrence that we are seeing happening in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>There seems to be a thinking that this type of behaviour that we are seeing is being brought in from 

outside, from people coming from New Zealand and Australia, Cook Islanders who are carrying 

out this activity here in our country.  So, the call is out to our Police Department to strengthen our 

Policing capability, strengthen our policing presence in our community to deter these actions that 

we are seeing now.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker,  Kia  Orana  Prime  Minister  and  all 

Ministers and Honourable Members on the government side and to our side, Kia Orana everyone.  

Kia Orana also to the staff of this House, as well as our people listening in to the radio as well as 

those watching on livestream, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>My question I would like to raise this with the Minister for the Ombudsman.  My question also is 

relevant to the question raised by the Leader of the United Party towards the Prime Minister.  I 

would like to ask the Honourable Minister if he can find out what is happening to the complaints 

that have been lodged with the Ombudsman regarding the status of the Police. 

</span></div><div><span>I have received some complaints and I have tried to find the answer but I did not get any satisfaction 

so that is why I have brought this question to this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to all.  Regarding the question, I 

will endeavour to provide answers by tomorrow.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Vaitoti 

</span><span>Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to direct my question to the Minister for 

</span><span>Punanga Nui.  It is a crucial matter that needs clarification.  As a participant in the meeting of 

</span><span>Punanga  Nui  vendors,  there  was  considerable  discussion  concerning  renovating  and  upgrading 

</span><span>Punanga Nui.  I believe the Minister is spearheading this initiative.  Therefore, I need to inquire 

</span><span>whether the said upgrading work extends to the coastal area of Punanga Nui and the old buildings 

in its vicinity.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you very much to the Honourable Member for Matavera for your 

excellent question.  As we both have connections to Manihiki, I will address your inquiry.  Thank 

you, Mr Speaker, for the chance to respond. 

</span></div><div><span>There  are  two  Ministers  who  oversee  Punanga  Nui.  The  first  is  myself,  Honourable  Member 

George  Angene,  and  the  second  is  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Honourable  Albert  Nicholas.  

Nevertheless, I am uncertain if your question is intended for me or the Deputy Prime Minister.  

Regardless, I will do my best to provide a response. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the  coastal area of the market,  I had  extensive plans for this  region  when  I was the 

Minister.  Nonetheless, because I did not have control over the finances for this area previously, I 

could not implement my ideas.  If I were the Minister in charge of Punanganui Market's budget, I 

would have already constructed buildings and an Olympic-sized swimming pool for the children.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you to the Deputy Prime Minister Abert Nicholas for affirming the construction of a large 

farmers'  market  complex  for  the  farmers'  benefit  and  utilisation.    The  current  area  where  the 

Maroro hut is situated, and fried fish is sold and consumed, and the public toilet will be moved 

further down to the coast.  Additionally, we will construct vending shelters further down the coast 

and move the playground area to the Tupapa end near the Terevete Park. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when the New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister visited, he granted some money for 

this development project, and the current government has also provided funding for this initiative.  

Thank you to the Prime Minister and your department for your assistance in progressing this plan.  

Our target is to conclude the project by the end of the year.  That is my response to the Member 

from Matavera's question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa, any Supplementary Questions? 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Member from 

Ngatangiia.  I also believe this is an important question because this in regards to some projects 

</span><span>that was done in Ngatangiia in the past years.  This project is concerning sanitation.  I heard that 

</span><span>there are plans in place to reinforce and improve this hence my question to the Member.  Are there 

</span><span>discussions yet on this project in the Ngatangiia community? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Honourable Member, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:</span><span>  Thank you to the Member from Matavera for the question.  Yes, it is in the pipeline.  

</span><span>It is under the ICI with the Waste Management project and also with the Prime Minister’s Office 

</span><span>responsible for the development of this project that has been set for Muri, Ngatangiia. And there 

are business owners who had come to see me and they have great concern about waste that is going

</span></div><div><span>into the water system into the sea that is polluting our beaches and environment.  The good thing 

about this is that it is the nature itself who are contributing to the cleansing of our lagoon.  The 

answer is yes, this project is in the pipeline and the holdup is funding.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you very much.  I see the Honourable Member Timi Varu; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Members of this House.  As I have 

observed that Question Time is running short, I request that you consider extending the allotted 

time.  My inquiry is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>Last  Saturday,  I,  along  with  several  Members  of  Parliament,  visited  Mangaia  for  the  closing 

celebration of the 200th  anniversary  of the  arrival  of the Gospel.  During the  event,  Mr Taoro 

</span><span>Brown donated a sum of money from the Airport Authority to support the occasion. I genuinely 

</span><span>believe that this is a significant donation.  My question is whether the same donation has been 

given to other islands such as Aitutaki, Mauke, Mitiaro, and Atiu for a comparable amount as that 

given to Mangaia.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Can  I  ask  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  to 

answer the question tomorrow? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I rise that I did not really hear the question that had been 

asked but I will answer it tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister.  Honourable Members we have come to the 

end of our Question Time.  I ensure you all Honourable Members that the Deputy Prime Minister 

will answer the question tomorrow.
