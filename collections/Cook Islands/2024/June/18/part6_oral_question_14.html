<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Member from 

Ngatangiia.  I also believe this is an important question because this in regards to some projects 

</span><span>that was done in Ngatangiia in the past years.  This project is concerning sanitation.  I heard that 

</span><span>there are plans in place to reinforce and improve this hence my question to the Member.  Are there 

</span><span>discussions yet on this project in the Ngatangiia community? 

</span></div>
