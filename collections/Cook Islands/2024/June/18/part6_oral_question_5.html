<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you again for the Supplementary Question.  Yes, we are well aware 

</span><span>of what we are seeing, hooligan drivers on the road now, young kids seeming to speed along the 

</span><span>road, cross over to the road without any concern about being caught. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Certainly, the request is going to the Police to have more of a presence on the roads to apprehend 

these  hooligan  drivers,  to  deter  them  from  doing  what  they  are  doing  and  also  to  work  with

</span></div>
<div><span>businesses that are being targeted by the thieves to find ways to try and reduce and eliminate this 

occurrence that we are seeing happening in our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There seems to be a thinking that this type of behaviour that we are seeing is being brought in from 

outside, from people coming from New Zealand and Australia, Cook Islanders who are carrying 

out this activity here in our country.  So, the call is out to our Police Department to strengthen our 

Policing capability, strengthen our policing presence in our community to deter these actions that 

we are seeing now.  Thank you very much.
