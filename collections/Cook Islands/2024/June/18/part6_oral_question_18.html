<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>MR T. VARU: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Members of this House.  As I have 

observed that Question Time is running short, I request that you consider extending the allotted 

time.  My inquiry is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Last  Saturday,  I,  along  with  several  Members  of  Parliament,  visited  Mangaia  for  the  closing 

celebration of the 200th  anniversary  of the  arrival  of the Gospel.  During the  event,  Mr Taoro 

</span><span>Brown donated a sum of money from the Airport Authority to support the occasion. I genuinely 

</span><span>believe that this is a significant donation.  My question is whether the same donation has been 

given to other islands such as Aitutaki, Mauke, Mitiaro, and Atiu for a comparable amount as that 

given to Mangaia.  Thank you.
