<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to ask a Supplementary Question to the Prime 

Minister and also Minister for Police.  I appreciate the response given by the Honourable Prime 

Minister, but my concern, as well as the concern of the people, is the current situation.  We are 

faced with a major issue in our country.  Thieves are rampant in the Arorangi and town areas, and 

there has been an increase in accidents.  Therefore, I would like to ask the Prime Minister what 

measures the government plans to take to address this problem.  The safety of our people is at risk, 

not only on the roads but also in their homes and businesses.  This problem is escalating, and we 

</span><span>need swift action.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.
