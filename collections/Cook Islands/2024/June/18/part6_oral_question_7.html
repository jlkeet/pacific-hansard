<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>

Ministers and Honourable Members on the government side and to our side, Kia Orana everyone.  

Kia Orana also to the staff of this House, as well as our people listening in to the radio as well as 

those watching on livestream, Kia Orana. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question I would like to raise this with the Minister for the Ombudsman.  My question also is 

relevant to the question raised by the Leader of the United Party towards the Prime Minister.  I 

would like to ask the Honourable Minister if he can find out what is happening to the complaints 

that have been lodged with the Ombudsman regarding the status of the Police. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I have received some complaints and I have tried to find the answer but I did not get any satisfaction 

so that is why I have brought this question to this House.
