</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, as I mentioned yesterday, it is now the appropriate time for obituary notices. 

If any Member wishes to share any notices, please feel free to do so. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  Today, I rise to inform you all about the 

recent loss of a remarkable individual in our community, Papa Tuakana Toeta.  This Papa worked 

</span><span>tirelessly in various areas of our village, such as the church and sports, and was a respected member 

</span><span>of our society.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to convey our deepest condolences to his family, who are 

</span><span>fervent supporters of the United Party.  Papa Tuakana's funeral is scheduled for Friday, and we 

</span><span>will miss his presence dearly.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  It has been observed that we have received 

only one obituary notice for today.  Therefore, in addition to the notice shared earlier, I would like 

to express our heartfelt condolences to the family of Papa mentioned previously, on behalf of all 

Members in this House.  Their loss is greatly felt, and we offer our sincere sympathies.
