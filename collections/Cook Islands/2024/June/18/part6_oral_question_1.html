<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all this afternoon.  In response to the 

question raised by the Honourable Member for Murienua, the status of our Police, like many of 

our Agencies and Ministries, we can be attributed it to finance and financial management.  We 

recognised that retention of staff has been a challenge, not just in the Police, but in some of our 

key Ministries as well, as we try to be competitive with our salaries that we can offer to some of 

</span><span>our  people.    The  attraction  being  provided  by  other  organisations  and  from  overseas  is  a  real 

</span><span>challenge.  So, in the medium term, the ability to be able to increase salaries for our workers needs 

to be hand in hand with the growth of our economy.  We need to grow our economies so we can 

afford to pay people more.   

</span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Police department with the retirement of  our Police Commissioner, we have an 

opportunity now to reset, if you would like the strategy for the Police department.  I would be 

seeking  more  meetings  with  our  current  Deputy  Police  Commissioner,  who  is  the  Acting 

Commissioner at the moment, to look at how we can address the immediate concerns.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The first step is to engage with the Ministry of Finance for their shared financial services that they 

provide to a number of Agencies, to take the Police on as one of their clients now to manage the 

finances  of  the  Police  department.    This  will  allow  the  Police  to  concentrate  their  efforts  on 

policing matters rather than looking at ways to find money or to save money.  Using the Ministry 

of Finance shared services also allows for better budget management so that the appropriations 

that had been given to the Police goes to where it is intended for.  We have heard the comments 

about the levels of underspent within the Ministry in their Personnel of up to $200,000 - $400,000.  

</span><span>Much of this is not money that has been underspent.  This is money that is being accrued under 

</span><span>accumulated annual leave.  In particular, annual leave accrued by members of our Police Force in 

</span><span>the Outer Islands, where have not used up their leave.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, this accrues in the balance sheet as unspent funds.  But with better budget management of the 

</span><span>Police Force, we believe that we can improve that situation to ensure money that is appropriated 

</span><span>for certain things in the Police Force are actually spent in these areas.  And it is through this much 

better  improved  financial  management  that  we  are  looking  at,  that  we  can  improve  the 

remuneration of Police Officers up to a more appropriate level.  And in the forward years, I will 

be looking to sit with the Police Commissioner to review the Policing strategy moving forward to

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>identify the areas that we need to put money in to fund so that they can operate effectively as a 

Police Department. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One of the new initiatives in the region that has been announced recently is, Australia who have 

set  up  a  new  Regional  Policing  Centre  for  training  police  officers  in  the  Pacific  and  they  are 

looking  to  establish  the  centre  in  Melbourne  which  will  be  catering  specifically  Pacific  Police 

Officers in order to train them up and upskill in their facility that they will cover the cost of. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I believe, Mr Speaker that these initial moves that we are looking at, improving the financial 

management of the Police, allowing their funds to be utilised appropriately, remunerating Police 

to a more appropriate level, will go a long way towards addressing the current problems. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One of the new initiatives that we are looking to implement in this financial year, Mr Speaker is 

the  re-establishment  of  our  Community  Policing.    We  are  looking  to  re-establish  Community 

Policing in Puaikura and in Takitumu to have more of a Police presence in these communities.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, with the collaboration of the Ministry of Finance and likely the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as 

well, working with the Police Department we should get better results and better staff retention of 

our Police Officers.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.
