<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted  debate  on  the  principles  and  merits  of  the  Appropriation  Bill  2024/25.    Before  we 

</span><span>adjourned yesterday, the Honourable Minister Tingika Elikana had the Floor when I interrupted 

him for adjournment.  I now call the Honourable Minister Elikana to continue speaking on the 

</span><span>principles and merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, before I express my thoughts on the 

</span><span>budget, if I could be given some time to express a few words.  The first one Mr Speaker is to the 

new invested High Chief for the island of Pukapuka and Nassau, my Uncle Pepeu Ariki.  I think 

his title is to be called Pepeu Henry Makirai Henry Ariki.  I understand all proceedings went in 

accordance with customs and traditions of the people of Pukapuka and Nassau.  I understand there

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>were no objections or dramas regarding the investiture.  Which clearly shows that the people of 

Pukapuka  and  Nassau  recognising  and  applauded  his  ascension  to  be  the  new  High  Chief  for 

Pukapuka and Nassau. 

</span></div><div><span>Initially,  when  the  event  was  scheduled,  I  was  occupied  with  national  business  in  Singapore.  

However, when it was postponed by a week, I still could not attend due to the unavailability of 

flights caused by the ongoing situation on the island of Mangaia. Nonetheless, Uncle, I extend my 

congratulations to you for taking on this crucial position and look forward to collaborating with 

you in directing the people of Pukapuka and Nassau. 

</span></div><div><span>To all the people of Pukapuka and Nassau who are listening, I wish to say… (Honourable Minister 

</span><span>spoke in Pukapuka).  I look forward to meeting with you all in August.   

</span></div><div><span>Moving  on,  I  want  to  thank  the  people  of  Mangaia.  As  you  know,  I  led  a  delegation  from  the 

Government  and Parliament Members to  attend the Closing Ceremony  of the festivities on the 

island. The residents of Mangaia treated us with hospitality and kindness, particularly their Chief, 

Numangatini.  I mentioned to Numangatini our regret at not extending our stay longer due to the 

unavailability  of  accommodation.    I  must  also  commend  the  Member  for  Ivirua  for  her 

instrumental  role  in  arranging  the  logistics  for  our  visit.    On  behalf  of  the  Government  and 

Parliament, thank you to the people of Mangaia for taking care of us on your beautiful island. 

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, I need to thank the Minister for CIIC, our Deputy Prime Minister, for his diligent effort 

to ensure our meeting could take place yesterday and throughout the week.  He spared no effort to 

ensure the electricity in this building was functioning correctly for our Parliament Sitting.  The 

previous week saw some concerns regarding whether we could hold the meeting here or in another 

venue due to this building's electrical issues.  I thank the Deputy Prime Minister on behalf of the 

Speaker,  Clerk,  and  staff  of  Parliament,  and  myself  as  Minister  Responsible  for  Parliamentary 

Services for his efforts to enable us to meet in this magnificent building. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, let me discuss the budget before this Parliament.  The Prime Minister accurately labelled 

</span><span>it the "Budget of Perseverance."  It continues the excellent work of previous budgets and reflects 

</span><span>the hard decisions undertaken.  Our government has had to make some tough choices in previous 

budgets like closing our borders and utilizing our reserves and taking on funds to maintain our 

</span><span>operations.    This  budget  shows  that  we  are  resilient  and  can  move  forward.    The  tourism  and 

</span><span>economic sectors are yielding the rewards of those decisions.  Although anyone might spend the 

</span><span>funds  recklessly,  we  decided  to  be  prudent  to  repay  our  debts  since  our  loans  mature,  and  our 

</span><span>repayment obligations consequently increase.  The budget reserves funds to ensure we meet those 

</span><span>obligations orderly.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  essential  aspects  of  this  budget  is  the  Prime  Minister's  decision  to  look  beyond 

Rarotonga for our economic growth.  If we purely assess this action economically, in conclusion, 

we would say it is wasting funds.  However, we view it differently.  The Government's allocation 

of resources to the Manihiki Airport is a vital economic development initiative.  The returns on 

this investment will be realised over time, enabling us to broaden our tourism industry. 

</span></div><div><span>The sealing and improvement of the airport will undoubtedly result in a reduction in airfares.  This, 

in turn, will make it more affordable to access the Northern Group.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  this  reflects  the  government's  decisions  in  ensuring  that  everyone  shares  in  the 

prosperity of our nation.  Furthermore, the government intends to seal the airports in Penrhyn and 

Pukapuka  following  Manihiki  airport's  completion.    Such  efforts  will  expand  our  capacity  and 

bolster our country's attractiveness as a tourist destination.  

</span></div><div><span>I also note the passage for Nassau in this Report.  While some may argue that it is a waste of money 

from an economic standpoint, I believe it is money well spent and long overdue.  I am mentioning 

this so that the Deputy Prime Minister can take note of my remarks.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe my time may have run out, but I was waiting for the Member from Matavera 

to grant me more time.  Therefore, I will conclude my statement and take my seat. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister and I see the  Honourable Member Tereapii 

Maki-Kavana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  KAVANA:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  request  that  the  Minister  be  given  an  extension  of 

speaking time because he is making some comments. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I put the Question…</span></div><div><span>MR T. KAVANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Minister’s speaking time be extended</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member, Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>640 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue, Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I was referring to the passage in Nassau.  I know 

people have been referring to it as a harbour but I prefer it as a passage because it is deliverable 

and  will  be  suitable  for  the  people  of  Nassau.    But  the  important  thing  with  that  passage,  Mr 

Speaker, is to enable connectivity between the people of Pukapuka and also the people of Nassau.   

</span></div><div><span>In fact, as I speak now, Mr Speaker the ferry from Pukapuka will be reaching Nassau in about 20 

minutes.  But the key thing when we talk about that ferry and that passage also, not only to provide 

opportunities  for  tourists  to  access  our  remote  island  of  Nassau  but  it  allows  for  trading 

opportunities  between  the  people  of  Pukapuka  and  Nassau  and  also  with  visitors  and  also  for 

</span><span>medical evacuations when it arises. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker I am fully supportive of this Budget and listening to previous speakers, Mr Speaker 

I am happy to hear that our PAC Committee will be taking a keen interest in ensuring that the 

monies appropriated from this Appropriation Budget will be used accordingly.  My advice to the 

PAC  Committee  will  be  not  only  to  look  at  over-expenditure  but  most  importantly  under-

expenditure. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, looking at the Pukapuka Budget profile, Ministries have put some money allocated 

from Pukapuka and to those Ministries I will be keeping a close eye on how that money was spent 

and ensure that they reach Pukapuka </span><span>–</span><span>in particular the BTIB $8,875.  I haven’t seen them visit 

</span><span>Pukapuka since I became a Member of Parliament.  So, I am hoping that the PAC Committee will 

hold our Ministries to ensure that the monies appropriated by this government is spent accordingly.  

To ensure also that when they bid and say they will deliver, they do deliver.  When they ask for 

those  monies,  if  it  is  not  available,  if  they  canno</span><span>t  deliver  it,  then  it’s  made  available  because 

</span><span>government has other plans to use those funds. 

</span></div><div><span>But  overall,  Mr  Speaker  I  must  congratulate  the  Prime  Minister  as  Minister  of  Finance,  the 

</span><span>Secretary of Finance and his finance team, the Budget Support Group elected from individuals that 

supported the collating of information and the scrutinising of the information provided for ensuring 

</span><span>that we have as the PAC Committee has found a fiscally  responsible Budget,  compliance with 

</span><span>Article 70 of our Constitution.  I look forward to the debate on the individual items, Mr Speaker. 

</span><span>Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister and I see the Minister George Angene; you 

</span><span>have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Appropriation 

Bill and its principles that will benefit our people.  Before I continue, may I request time to address 

my constituency of Tupapa?  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to my constituents of Tupapa Nui o Au and Maraerenga.  It is an honour to serve you, 

and I have always tried to meet your requests and needs without charge.  I have been available to 

you, even at late hours, and will continue to assist you throughout my term.  I extend my greetings 

to both Pu Tapere of Tupapa and Maraerenga, as well as Vakatini Ariki, whom I have served.  I 

thank my two assistants and the government for their support in improving our village.  To all in 

Tupapa, from the oldest to the youngest, male and female, I extend my greetings.  Lastly, I wish 

our cultural team the best of luck in the upcoming Constitution Celebrations.  

</span></div><div><span>Returning to the Appropriation Bill, I wish to express my gratitude to the Prime Minister, who is 

also the Minister of Finance, and his team for crafting this budget to benefit our people.   I am 

pleased that everyone employed by our country will receive payment.  To those who criticise the 

government, I remind them that the government still supports them.  As the Minister responsible 

for some Ministries, I understand their concerns, but today we must focus on the appropriation.  

</span></div><div><span>Before I became a Minister, I earned $150 a week, and now that I am a Minister, my earnings 

support my constituents.  However, the Constituency Fund allocated for Tupapa is not enough, 

given our sizeable population. If Tupapa had two Members of Parliament, our allocation would 

suffice.  Therefore, I request that the Prime Minister consider adding a second MP for Tupapa. 

While I support the principles and merits of this Bill, I request that the Prime Minister allocate $5 

million for the upcoming Maeva Nui Festival. As a builder, I have calculated this amount.  

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, I strongly support the Appropriation Bill and the benefits it will bring.  Thank you, 

Mr Speaker.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I know the Prime Minister will help you and 

I have the formula for that.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Members,  Parliament  will  now  be  suspended  and  will  reconvene  shortly  when  we 

come back. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.26 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Parliament has now resumed.  We are still in debate on the principles and merits 

of the Appropriation Bill 2024/25.  The Floor is still open to any Members who wishes to speak.  

If there are no speakers </span><span>–</span><span> oh I see the Honourable Member for Mitiaro; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TANGATAPOTO:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff, 

including  us  Members  of  Parliament,  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Honourable  Ministers,  both 

Leaders of both  Parties,  the Honourable  Leader  of the Opposition,  Kia  Orana to  you all in  the 

Name of our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>Before I present my comments and my support for the Appropriation Bill 2024/25, I would like to 

convey my regards to the people of my island.  To the three Chiefs of our island that currently 

resides here in Rarotonga, Chief Tou who is the current President of the House of Ariki, also Chief 

Te Mau o te Rangi Te Ika Mata, Kia Orana to you all.  To the people on the island, I am quite 

</span><span>concerned  because  as  I  am  speaking,  no  one  on  the  island  is  listening  to  what  I  am  saying.  

</span><span>However, I believe that there are some people who can see us via Facebook, Kia Orana to you all.    

</span></div><div><span>If I may redirect my comments to the island of Mangaia, firstly, Kia Orana to Chief Numangatini, 

and to the Governor of the area we stayed at.  His name is Pange Miro.  Thank you very much for 

your  hospitality  and  for  taking  care  of  us  the  people  of  Mitiaro  who  came  to  your  island,  for 

bringing us food, and for providing us with exceptional services.  On behalf of the people of our 

island,  thank  you  for  everything  and  for  looking  after  us  during  our  short  stay  on  your  island, 

especially in Ivirua.   

</span></div><div><span>As I currently speak, our Church Leaders from the three different Churches is still currently in 

Mangaia,  including  our  Mayor,  Governor  and  many  more,  especially  those  who  went  to  the 

bicentennial celebration in Mitiaro.  There were 36 of us who went to Mangaia from Mitiaro, I 

think on Friday, they will return back to Mitiaro.   

</span></div><div><span>When I came back to Rarotonga, there were some people from our island who were referred here 

on medical grounds, and other various reasons, my sincere regards to you all, especially those in 

</span><span>hospital.    I  pray  that  God  protects  and  guide  you  safely  wherever  you  may  be,  either  here  in 

</span><span>Rarotonga or in New Zealand and I hope that He brings you back to our homeland so that we may 

</span><span>mingle again happily.   

</span></div><div><span>In  closing,  I  wish  to  address  a  matter  that  arose  yesterday  when  the  Prime  Minister  and  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Minister  for  the  Ministry  of  Cultural  Development  travelled  to  Hawaii.    I  listened 

</span><span>keenly, but I did not hear any acknowledgment of the three young boys from Mitiaro who were 

selected  by  the  Cook  Islands  Voyaging  Society  to  travel  on  the  </span><span>vaka</span><span>  (canoe)  to  Hawaii.  

Unfortunately, two of the boys are still in Rarotonga, waiting for a flight to take them back home.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  cannot  even  begin  to  imagine  how  difficult  it  has  been  for  them  to  be  separated  from  their 

families, wives, and children for such a long time.  

</span></div><div><span>I wish to commend these young men for representing our island on the </span><span>vaka</span><span> and completing the 

journey,  even  when  faced  with  strong  winds  and  massive  waves  that  could  have  capsized  the 

canoe. Those who traveled on the plane may have had it easier, but the </span><span>vaka</span><span> sailors are heroes in 

my book.  In light of their commendable performance, I feel that they deserve recognition from 

the government.  If there are any surplus funds available, it would only be fair to deposit some 

money into their bank accounts for the time they spent away from their families.  

</span></div><div><span>Even just a small amount would be an appropriate gesture of appreciation for their efforts.  It is 

worth noting that one of the boys traveled to Hawaii and is among the sailors bringing the </span><span>vaka</span><span>

back to  Rarotonga.   In my opinion, the  </span><span>vaka</span><span> sailors should be celebrated for their bravery  and 

efforts, as the </span><span>vaka</span><span> was  like a husked coconut  on the sea.  I would like to  extend my heartfelt 

gratitude to these young men for representing Mitiaro and the Cook Islands, and I hope that their 

achievements will inspire other young people to pursue their passions and strive for excellence.  

</span></div><div><span>As the Member of Parliament for Mitiaro, I reiterate the importance of workers being paid for their 

labour as we discuss the Appropriation Bill.  It is crucial that their salaries are not reduced, and 

they are being paid on time to provide for their households.  

</span></div><div><span>I remember when I first joined Parliament and advocated for employees in Mangaia to be paid $10 

per hour.  I am pleased that the minimum wage has since reached that rate, including taxes. 

</span></div><div><span>However, despite subsidies from the government for inter-island cargo boats, the outer islands still 

struggle with high fees for boat transportation and costly goods in shops.  One of the significant 

challenges we face is the inconsistency of boat arrival times.  The government's plan to improve 

the speed of boat transportation is essential, considering the struggles of the outer islands.  Those 

here in Rarotonga may not feel the impact, but it is us in the outer islands who experience the 

difficulties firsthand. 

</span></div><div><span>We only have two flights a week to our island, on Mondays and Tuesdays, and while I cannot fault 

the airline, I recognize the limits of our financial resources to increase capacity compared to other 

</span><span>islands.  

</span></div><div><span>It  is  noteworthy  that  a  six-hour Jetstar  flight  from  here  to  Sydney  costs  $249  one  way</span><span>—</span><span>much 

</span><span>cheaper  than  the  $299  40-minute  flight  to  Mitiaro.    Unfortunately,  this  is  beyond  our  control.  

Perhaps with the new ship that will provide service to the outer islands, we will have regular visits 

and alternative means of traveling to our island.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Despite the challenges we faced during COVID, we were able to allocate funds wisely to help our 

people survive.  Looking at the allocation for my island, I can see increases in personnel each year.  

I commend the government and finance managers for their efforts in looking after the people, even 

in difficult times. 

</span></div><div><span>I am happy to say that nobody on our island goes hungry, and people are managing their daily 

lives despite the current  circumstances.  Therefore, I support our Budget, and thank  you to the 

Minister  of  Finance,  Prime  Minister,  and  staff  for  presenting  a  good  budget  that  will  help  our 

people for another year.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  for  Mitiaro  for  your  contribution  to  the 

discussion.  I would like to acknowledge four brave warriors from Mauke who travelled with the 

Vaka.  The Member of Parliament for Mauke has also generously contributed to their accounts.   

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Teariki Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to begin by greeting the Prime Minister, Ministers, 

Honourable  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House,  staff  of  Parliament,  and  everyone  present, 

extending  these  same  greetings  to  those  in  the  Northern  Group,  Southern  Group,  and  here  in 

Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to request permission to extend my greetings to my constituency and 

Vaka Puaikura.  I wish to greet everyone in the Vaka from Tuoro to Toreaiva and all those in the 

village this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  extend  my  greetings  to  my  constituency  and  Vaka  Puaikura.    My  special 

greetings go out to all the families who have lost loved ones recently, including Papa Tapi Taio, 

who persevered through many challenges to start businesses in both Hastings, New Zealand, and 

the Cook Islands.  Despite criticisms, he persevered in helping people throughout the Northern and 

Southern Group.  His son, Josh, and entire family deserve blessings for their continuation of his 

</span><span>legacy.  We praise Papa Tapi Taio for his service as Finance Minister and regret that he received 

</span><span>no recognition from the King's Representative. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge two more individuals who have served this nation selflessly.  Firstly, 

</span><span>Papa Tuakana Toeta, a skilled carpenter who devoted his life to serving his country, choosing to 

</span><span>stay and work locally rather than seek better opportunities elsewhere.  May God bless his surviving 

</span><span>family. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  Papa  Iro  Rangi,  who  served  for  many  years  at  Cable  and  Wireless  and  afterward 

continued to  serve as  an effective member of  various non-governmental  organisations.  For 40 

</span></div><div><span>645

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>years, he served as a Deacon for the village of Ruaau in the Arorangi CICC and later became an 

Elder in the Church.  Papa Iro Rangi was also known as a prominent figure in Arorangi sports and 

supported  Mama  Ruta  Tinomana  Ariki  during  her  reign.    Along  with  his  wife,  Nono,  he  also 

supported Arorangi School.  May God bless him and his family also. 

</span></div><div><span>I  return  to  the  current  discussion  in  the  House  regarding  the  principles  and  merits  of  the 

Appropriation Bill.  As I mentioned yesterday, we are obliged to support the bill as it is our own.  

However, Mr Speaker, we would like to offer some comments to contribute to the debate.  Thank 

you to the PAC committee and its members.  It is worth noting that under this administration, there 

has been a thorough review of the appropriation of the nation's funds, ensuring proper usage.  For 

example,  CIIC's  report  indicates  that  over  $2  million  were  expended  despite  guidelines  and 

processes in place to prevent overspending by all Ministries.  We appreciate this information and 

agree that compliance is necessary.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to bring forth some examples that demonstrate the need for the PAC committee to 

carefully investigate circumstances and incidents to determine if funds were properly expended.  

For  instance,  during  Minister  Mac  Mokoroa's  leadership  at  ICI,  he  was  suspended  due  to 

overspending.  At that time, I was the Minister for ICI and had knowledge of the situation.  The 

overspending occurred on the Pukapuka airport after a cyclone, which was not authorised by the 

Parliament.  Another illustration would be the Clerk of Parliament overspending on the renovation 

of this very Parliament House.  Therefore, I urge the PAC committee to investigate thoroughly to 

determine whether the funds were intentionally or appropriately expended. 

Mr Speaker, I would like to address the exemption of PAYE for Pa Enua public servants earning 

up to $60,000.  We commend those who have not yet reached the salary limit.  It has come to my 

attention that we used to collect $2.8 million annually, but we are no longer receiving these funds.  

The  Honourable  Minister  Tingika  Elikana  has  also  raised  concerns  regarding  the  allocation  of 

funds to the Outer Islands.  While I support his views, we must consider the recovery period. It 

may  not  be  possible  to  reach  a  multi-million-dollar  target  within  the  expected  timeframe.    Mr 

Speaker,  I would like to know what  the  recovery  period  for these payments  would be.   I  fully 

support this budget, and I request that the Minister for Finance clarify some of these points during 

</span><span>his wrap-up.  

</span></div><div><span>Moreover, there have been numerous accidents on our roads resulting in damage to power poles. 

</span><span>We also recall past arsonist incidents, with business owners having to rebuild their enterprises only 

</span><span>to suffer from thefts.  Parents must take responsibility for their children's behaviour and ensure 

</span><span>that they are not causing problems.  To businesses, I urge caution and vigilance.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  now  see  the  Honourable  Member  for 

</span><span>Tongareva, the opportunity is yours.

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>Kia Orana</span><span>Honourable Speaker and staff of this Honourable House.  Kia 

Orana also to the Honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, and all 

Members of the Government and the Opposition.  To every individual present in this House, from 

the highest to the lowest position, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To  our  Cook  Islands  people  listening  in  to  our  Session  -  whether  here  in  Rarotonga  or  living 

abroad, Kia Orana to you all in the Name of our Lord.  To the people of my island, Tongareva, the 

three pillars, our Churches and the two Church Ministers on both villages of Tetautua and Omoka, 

our  Mama  Assistant  Church  Minister  and  also  our  Catholic  Church,  from  the  biggest  to  the 

smallest, and those who do not hold any positions within our Churches, Kia Orana in the Mighty 

Name and Love of God.   

</span></div><div><span>My prayers to our leaders on the island - the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, and Council Members </span><span>–</span><span> may 

God bestow upon you and your families the wisdom and knowledge needed to serve His people.  

To  the  Island  Government,  the  Executive  Officer,  every  Government  department,  and  every 

employee on the island, Kia Orana in the Name of our Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>Lastly,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  our  new  GR  (Government  Representative)  and  offer  my 

blessings.  May God provide you with the necessary wisdom, knowledge, and skills to serve His 

people with your works. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding our country's budget, thank you to those who were involved in its preparation.  Before 

I extend my support for the budget, I would like to request some assistance from the government 

for our plans regarding the Mission House Beula, which is scheduled next year.  

</span></div><div><span>Upon  reviewing  the  allocation  for  Penrhyn,  I  noticed  that  the  increase  was  only  minimal.  

Nevertheless, we acknowledge and accept its allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>I have noticed a significant zero under the Capital Project, and I must say, "Eiaue Tongareva e..." 

(Oh Tongareva!).  Can the Government please consider this particular area and review it for future 

</span><span>budget plans?  

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to our airport.  I agree with the Member for Pukapuka's 

</span><span>earlier statement about prioritising the Tongareva airport over the Pukapuka airport. 

</span></div><div><span>To conclude, I support the Appropriation Bill, also known as the "Budget of Perseverance".  At 

</span><span>the beginning of our Session today, our Chaplain spoke of "Faith in Healing" Yes! Yes!  For this 

reason, I support this Appropriation Bill.  In the wise words of my people, </span><span>"Kia mau te serenga, 

kia mau te napenga, kia mau".</span><span>  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member of Tongareva.  I see the Honourable Member 

for Manihiki; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. PUNA:  </span><span>Kia Orana to everyone here today.  To the Honourable Speaker and your staff, 

Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  government,  Opposition  side  and  all  other  Members,  Kia 

Orana to you all in the Name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to extend my regards to those listening and watching our Session via livestream, 

especially our people in the Northern Group islands.  I apologise for any inconveniences caused if 

your radio is not working, and I hope that you can bear with us. 

</span></div><div><span>My deepest sympathies to the families who have lost their loved ones.  I stand in support of the 

condolences conveyed earlier by previous speakers, for Papa Tapi Taio, Papa Te, Papa Iro Rangi 

in Arorangi, and many others who have passed away.  May they rest in peace and my heartfelt 

condolences to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you also to Chief Numangatini and the entire people of Mangaia for taking good care of us.  

Moreover, I want to extend my warm congratulations to the people of Mangaia for a successful 

closing celebration. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  want  to  acknowledge my beloved Manihiki  people, including the  three main pillars, our 

Churches, the Island Government and traditional leaders.  Kia Orana to all the people back home 

in Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>I  believe  that  now  is  an  opportune  moment  to  discuss  the  principles  and  advantages  of  the 

Appropriation  Bill.    This  year's  budget  is  truly  magnificent,  in  my  opinion.    It  is  magnificent 

because it has allocated funds for the Manihiki Airport, which has been a long-standing priority 

for  the  Northern  Group.    The  road  to  acquiring  the  allocation  for  the  airport  was  fraught  with 

difficulties, but the Honourable Prime Minister's tireless effort prevailed. 

</span></div><div><span>I commend your hard work, Honourable Prime Minister, and express my heartfelt gratitude for the 

</span><span>allocation that will significantly benefit our Northern Group.  The people of Manihiki have been 

eagerly anticipating this project for years, and their patience is admirable.  This project was a vision 

</span><span>of my husband, the former Member of Parliament, who recently retired and continues serving our 

</span><span>community  without  pay.    I  am  here  to  endorse  this  vision,  not  just  for  Manihiki,  but  also  for 

</span><span>Rakahanga.  

</span></div><div><span>I firmly believe that the renovation and development of our Manihiki Airport will be advantageous 

</span><span>for both islands.  Furthermore, I would like to express  my appreciation to the landowners who 

</span></div><div><span>648

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>have provided their land without charge for the benefit of our nation, both those who are still with 

us and those who have sadly passed away.  

</span></div><div><span>Lastly,  I  want  to  acknowledge  the  government  of  the  day  for  their  foresight  in  beginning  the 

renovation of the airports across the Northern Group.  Their efforts to uplift not just Manihiki, but 

also Rakahanga, Pukapuka, and Tongareva, are greatly appreciated. 

</span></div><div><span>Based on the allocated funds, I am confident that we can accomplish our essential objectives.  On 

that note, I support this budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister, Rose Toki-

Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Speaker and Kia Orana to you and also to 

our Clerk who is unwell, perhaps he had too much clams (paua) in Mangaia.  Kia Orana to our 

Deputy Clerk and staff of Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Speaker and Kia Orana to you, as well as our Clerk who unfortunately is 

unwell, potentially due to consuming too many clams (paua) while in Mangaia.  Kia Orana to our 

Deputy Clerk and the rest of the Parliament staff.  Kia Orana to all Cook Islands individuals tuning 

in  to  our Session, whether they  are in  Rarotonga, the Outer  Islands, or overseas.   To everyone 

present  in  this  Honourable  House,  including  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime 

Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Assistant  Ministers,  as  well  as  both  Leaders  &amp;  Members  of  the 

Opposition, our partners and families, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  to  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Government  Members, 

Opposition Members, and Independent Members, as well as your families. I would like to take this 

opportunity to greet the people of Enuamanu, including the three pillars on our island. Some may 

argue that we spend too much time on greetings, but I believe it is crucial for us to reach out and 

acknowledge our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to  all the Ariki,  Ui Mataiapo, and Mataiapo Tutara on Enuamanu, as well as to  the 

Pastors  and  all  Ekalesia  on  the  island,  the  Mayor,  Council  Members,  EO,  and  all  government 

</span><span>workers, Kia Orana in the Name of our Lord.  Kia Orana to our elderly, youth, and children, Kia 

</span><span>Orana to you all.  Additionally, Kia Orana also to the group who recently travelled to Mangaia and 

</span><span>have safely returned to our island, and also, my heartfelt thank you to Numangatini Ariki and your 

</span><span>people for your hospitality and for providing us with the shell eis and koatu Mangaia eis before 

</span><span>we departed the island.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, thank you to Papa Kavana Tangi Moeauri, the AOG Pastor, your wife, and the people in 

Puna Vaitatei, including Mama Veia and Papa Tua and their children, Aunty Tekea and Papa Nga 

Kareroa, Papa Alan and Tuaine Tuara, and all the family.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the staff members of Te Marae Ora, the person in charge, and the dedicated 

nurses  who  travelled  to  Mangaia.    Your  exceptional  work  in  ensuring  the  overall  health  and 

wellbeing of our people is greatly appreciated.  During the celebrations, there were no significant 

health concerns, except for an emergency flight that had to be arranged on a Sunday to transport a 

patient to Rarotonga Hospital.  Apart from this, the healthcare service was efficiently managed, 

and our people were taken care of with utmost care and dedication. 

</span></div><div><span>The Budget Committee from MFEM has put together a detailed breakdown of the allocations for 

each Agency.  Although we recognise that some of us may not be satisfied with the allocation for 

</span><span>certain  agencies,  we  have  placed  our  trust  in  the  PAC  Committee  to  review  and  finalise  these 

</span><span>allocations, as the theme of our Budget is perseverance. 

</span></div><div><span>We  extend  our  heartfelt  appreciation  to  the  Committee  for  their  dedication  and  hard  work  in 

preparing this report, and we fully support the Budget as recommended by them. 

</span></div><div><span>I would now like to shift the focus to the allocation for the island of Atiu.  As the Member for 

Penrhyn mentioned, the Capital Vote for Atiu is zero.  I want to highlight that while we understand 

the challenges faced by our people in the northern group islands, we will be patient with the airport 

and harbour developments on Atiu.  Unlike the southern group islands, the northern islands are 

particularly  far  away,  making  medical  emergencies  particularly  challenging.  Regardless,  we 

remain committed to providing the necessary support to our people in the northern group islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps, it may not be necessary to develop all islands in the northern group simultaneously.  We 

can explore the possibility of developing one island in the north, and then an island in the south 

and so on.  In light of the upcoming 50-year anniversary of the Enuamanu wharf and harbour, I 

have discussed with the Prime Minister regarding the timing of these developments. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  extend  my  gratitude  to  Minister  Elikana  for  his  assistance  on  our  trip  to  New 

Zealand to meet with the Deputy Prime Minister.  He has supported my request to the New Zealand 

</span><span>Government for assistance in repairing the Enuamanu wharf, which was initially built by the New 

</span><span>Zealand Government in 1974/75.  Maintenance of the wharf is necessary, and I am grateful for the 

</span><span>support provided by both governments to address this issue. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  express  my  sincere  appreciation  to  our  Ministry  of  Finance  for  providing  the 

</span><span>necessary allocation to compensate our hardworking people and contribute towards the welfare of 

our elderly population, as well as their caregivers.  As I have often emphasised, even in the midst 

</span></div><div><span>650 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>of the pandemic, our  government  has remained  steadfast  in  our commitment  to  supporting  our 

people.  Additionally, when an elderly person passes away, we have allocated funds to support 

their family during this difficult time. 

</span></div><div><span>I am pleased to inform the House that we have increased the minimum wage from $9 to $9.50, and 

thank you to all Members for their support in allocating funds towards assisting our people.  We 

are committed to providing our people with fair compensation, something that many countries in 

the Pacific cannot do. 

</span></div><div><span>We prioritise taking care of our people that are ill, and accordingly, the allocation for referrals 

from the outer islands to New Zealand has been increased.  I extend my thanks to the Honourable 

Prime Minister for approving this allocation and supporting our people's medical needs overseas.  

Despite the significant number of illnesses affecting our people, I would like to thank the Secretary 

</span><span>of Health, divisional leaders, and the Ministries under my leadership for their unwavering support. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to express my appreciation to the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Internal Affairs, 

and other Ministries for their continuous support in improving the quality of life in our country.  

The Ministry of Health is focusing on improving the lifestyles of our children and youths, such as 

cracking down on vaping and discouraging smoking while promoting home garden cultivation of 

vegetables and root crops.  Although changes cannot occur overnight, they will materialize in the 

next five years or more. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Heads of Health, Agriculture, Internal Affairs, Superannuation, and all 

the hardworking staff.  I am aware that you are all working tirelessly, and I appreciate your efforts.  

In particular, I would like to extend a big thank you to the doctors and nurses for taking care of 

our people that are sick on Rarotonga and the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, I offer my support to the allocations that have been assigned to each Vote Item.  

Additionally,  I  would  like  to  make  a  greeting  comment  that  I  overlooked  earlier.    Tomorrow, 

Bishop Ray and outgoing Bishop Paul will be visiting Atiu to check on the diocese.  This event 

</span><span>marks both an introduction and a farewell by the Catholic members in Atiu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you. Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Tehani Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:</span><span>  Sorry, Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>To extend the time for the Minister to finish her speech 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  Motion granted.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN: </span><span> I will not take long.  To our people on Atiu, we the two Members 

of Parliament believe that  you will be happy to meet our two Bishops who will be visiting the 

island.  We have also observed the cheerful way in how we meet and treat out families and friends 

when visiting the Pa Enua.  A very big thank you to the Island Government for the support provided 

to the events on the island and for permitting the workers to come and assist with the community 

works on the island.  A big greetings and thank you to the NGO for playing your parts in society.  

There is also an allocation from government to assist in supporting your causes.  

</span></div><div><span>I give my support to this Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Tehani Brown; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker.  I will be brief as the Minister has already spoken for 

the island of Atiu.  However, it is my duty as the Member for Tengatangi, Areora and Ngatiarua 

to voice my thoughts.  Firstly, Kia Orana to you, your staff, and all House Members.  Additionally, 

I would like to greet my constituency and my beloved island of Enuamanu. 

</span></div><div><span>Although  it  has  been  a  while  since  my  last  return  to  Enuamanu,  I  have  been  away  on  crucial 

missions representing our country.  Through my experiences away from home, I have realised how 

much I appreciate our standard of living.  I would like to recognise the three pillars of our society: 

the Island Government, Papa Mayor, his staff, all the chieftains, and their supporters, as well as 

the Church Ministers of the six Denominations on the island. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  new  Church  Minister  for  the  CICC  Church, 

Reverend Saitu Saitu and Mama Orometua Makirau Saitu.  This  exceptional  Reverend  and his 

wife  have  played  a  pivotal  role  in  bringing  our  mapu  back  to  Church.    They  have  done  so  by 

allowing them to lead themselves.  As we prepare for the Youth Convention in September, I pray 

</span><span>that this momentum continues and does not subside once the convention ends. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank the island of Mangaia and my fellow Ariki Numangatini, the Governor, 

</span><span>the  Island  Government,  and  the  Bicentennial  Committee  of  Mangaia  for  their  exceptional 

</span><span>celebrations marking 200 years. I was fortunate to follow the Parliament charter to Mangaia on 

</span><span>Saturday, which marks a fitting occasion for 200 years ago, Numangatini had to select one wife, 

</span><span>who happens to be my great-great-great-great-grandmother, according to my genealogy. 

</span></div><div><span>Back  in  this  House,  I  would  like  to  officially  congratulate  our  new  Member,  Mrs.  Sarakura 

Tapaitau. It is fantastic to see another woman in this House, and we have the ambitious goal of 

</span></div><div><span>652 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>reaching a 50 percent female representation, which I think we can achieve. As a Member of the 

PAC, Mr Speaker, I can confidently say that this is a fiscally responsible budget. I would also like 

to thank our advisor, our secretary, the Clerk, and everyone who contributed to this report. 

</span></div><div><span>However, my PAC colleagues did fail to mention that, due to being four of us left, the quorum was 

also  four.    As  a  result,  none  of  us  could  leave  to  take  an  essential  phone  call  during  our  PAC 

meetings.  During the meeting, one of us attempted to use the bathroom, which resulted in the 

meeting having to be paused. 

</span></div><div><span>Referring back to this Budget of Perseverance, there are no significant changes to Atiu's Budget 

except for a minor personnel increase, which is acceptable.  The crucial factor is that we receive 

the  same  Budget  as  last  year,  but  with  a  slight  increase.    Additionally,  as  mentioned  by  the 

Minister, we anticipate support for the 50th anniversary of our harbour.  Mr Speaker, this 50-year 

</span><span>milestone signifies the length of time since significant work has been done on our harbour. 

</span></div><div><span>However, our brothers and sisters in the North are facing more significant challenges.  Hence, we 

understand we must wait, and hopefully, the next Budget will bring relief.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Seeing  there  are  no  other  further  speakers,  I  call  the  Honourable  Minister 

Honourable Mark Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I see we have little time left however, I will begin 

my speech today and will finish tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to greet the people of Auau Enua as they commemorate the 

bi-centennial in Mangaia.  Our three Members for Mangaia are unable to be with us this afternoon 

as they are still present there, taking care of the people and joining in the festivities.  However, we 

have received their unwavering support for this Appropriation Bill that is currently before us. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to  express  my sincere apologies to  the island residents  for my absence during the 

</span><span>closing ceremony.  Although some have expressed frustration over my lack of attendance, I must 

</span><span>explain,  Mr  Speaker.    My  daughter  fell  ill,  and  she  required  surgery,  which  we  arranged  in 

Auckland.  This unfortunate event made it impossible for me to join the festivities on Saturday.  

</span><span>My wife is currently with my daughter on the island, while I rushed back to attend the meeting on 

</span><span>Sunday.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I wish to share some delightful news.  The Brown family from Mangaia managed to 

attend the event, and it was undoubtedly a joyous occasion.  Please note that it was not the Browne 

family  from  the other side of the House, but  the highly Super  Brown's family.   Despite that,  I 

</span></div><div><span>653

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 18 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>would  like  to  thank  the  Members  led  by  Minister  Tingika  Elikana,  who  represented  us  at  this 

auspicious gathering in Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>I have been informed that the Airport Authority made a donation on the day.  Regarding the query 

from the Honourable Member from Ruaau on the amount given, let me clarify that the government 

does not hold any funds.  The money comes from the taxes paid by the tax-payers.  As a result, 

people  often  ask  how  much  money  the  government  is  providing,  when  the  essential  question 

should be, how much money are the people contributing towards the cause? 

</span></div><div><span>I want to emphasise that all the funds being utilised do not belong to the government; they belong 

to the people towards the betterment of our community's well-being.  Later on, I will discuss in 

detail about the public's finances.  As I reflect on the fantastic celebration in Mangaia, one of the 

notable elements that stood out was the sheer number of individuals present on the island.  The 

</span><span>attendance figures were astonishing, with almost two thousand people being present on the island, 

</span><span>which called for over 50 flights by Air Raro to ferry people across. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this highlights the significance of crucial infrastructure such as airports.  Had Mangaia 

possessed a sealed runway capable of accommodating the Saab, it would have only taken 18 flights 

to transport all the individuals present on the island, rather than the 55 flights as indicated earlier.  

Therefore, when we contemplate investing the government's financial resources, it is important to 

recall that the funds do not solely belong to the government, but instead belong to the public.  The 

primary objective is to support the people's livelihoods and foster business expansion.  This is why 

the maiden airport project for the Northern Group, Manihiki, is critical.  It serves as a prototype 

for all the other airport ventures that require sealing to provide essential infrastructure. 

</span></div><div><span>The  initial  infrastructure  developments  on  our  islands  were  the  harbours  and  the  ports.    Every 

island had the backing of ships that transported a variety of goods, such as food, machinery, and 

building materials.  This slowly but surely enhanced the lifestyle and raised the standards of living 

for our community.  Instead of residing in </span><span>kikau huts</span><span>, people began to live in houses, and the entire 

manpower  for  performing  tasks  transformed  as  machines  took  over.    The  quality  of  food  also 

</span><span>improved remarkably. 

</span></div><div><span>The introduction of airstrips played a significant role in enabling quick and reliable transportation 

</span><span>between the islands.  However, to further enhance our transportation system, the next logical phase 

</span><span>is to seal our runways.  This will permit us to acquire better quality aircraft at a more affordable 

</span><span>cost, which will ultimately lead to reduced fares and increased flights to our islands. 

</span></div><div><span>In Rarotonga, when Air New Zealand raises ticket prices to Auckland, we complain.  Nevertheless, 

</span><span>the fares to the Northern Group are exorbitant </span><span>–</span><span> ranging from $1,500 to $1,800 for a one-way trip.

</span></div><div><span>When the ships are delayed, we run short on vital supplies such as rice, flour, and Stein, which 

further exacerbates the situation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Excuse me, Prime Minister, I would like to interject.  I noticed you uttered what 

seemed to be your final statement, leading me to believe you were concluding for today.
