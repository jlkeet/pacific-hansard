<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to direct my question to the Minister for 

</span><span>Punanga Nui.  It is a crucial matter that needs clarification.  As a participant in the meeting of 

</span><span>Punanga  Nui  vendors,  there  was  considerable  discussion  concerning  renovating  and  upgrading 

</span><span>Punanga Nui.  I believe the Minister is spearheading this initiative.  Therefore, I need to inquire 

</span><span>whether the said upgrading work extends to the coastal area of Punanga Nui and the old buildings 

in its vicinity.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, you have the Floor.
