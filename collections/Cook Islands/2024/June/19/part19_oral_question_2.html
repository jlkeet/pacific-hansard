<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I put the Question.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Question is that the sum of $1,485,081 for Agriculture 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div>
<div><span>AUDIT (PERCA) for 30 minutes. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $1,132,654 for Audit (PERCA) 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Floor is open.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor.

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, while there is no notable difference in the increase for this Vote Item, 

I would like to voice my support for the budget allocated towards Audit.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I am aware that a Bill is currently being reviewed to strengthen our Audit Office.  I 

strongly feel that this is a Vote Item that requires our attention, and I anxiously wait for the Bill to 

be  presented  before  this  House.    Once  implemented,  I  believe  that  this  Bill  will  significantly 

alleviate the workload and responsibilities of the Head of Audit and their staff. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  I  am  convinced  that  this  Bill  will  not  only  provide  assistance  to  Ministries  and 

Departments that subscribe to this Honourable House, but also empower them to adhere to their 

respective Reports.  While the Audit Office currently has the ability to  address Ministries who 

have failed to fulfill their Reports, there is a dire need to strengthen the process of requesting their 

compliance.  I am confident that this Bill will ensure that the Heads of Ministries will comply with 

</span><span>their budgets without hesitation.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to highlight an important aspect to consider when reviewing the financial 

reports provided to us by the Audit Office and PAC.  In the Mangaian dialect, a report deemed 

"QUALIFIED" denotes  a satisfactory report.  Conversely, a "MODIFIED"  report suggests that 

there are issues with the work.  Lastly, a "DISCLAIMED" report signals a severe problem.  As 

such, I am in full support of this Bill and eagerly anticipate its presentation to this House at the 

earliest opportunity.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of Desmond 

Wildin.  Desmond has been an integral part of the PAC committee from the time of my joining in 

2018 until my resignation.  His intelligence and work ethic are quite remarkable.  Fortunately, he 

was a member of the team during my tenure on the committee.  However, I understand that his 

current employment contract is set to expire in November of this year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to make a formal request to the Minister responsible for Audit, and I urge that my 

statement be recorded in Hansard.  My humble request to the Honourable Minister is to consider 

</span><span>re-engaging Desmond for another term with the Audit Office.  In addition to this, I propose that 

</span><span>he  be  given  the  opportunity  to  train  another  individual  who  can  take  on  his  role.    Given  the 

</span><span>demanding nature of his job, I believe this arrangement would ensure that the Audit Office will 

</span><span>continue to function effectively.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, in the event that the relevant Minister is 

</span><span>listening, I implore them to consider my request and take suitable action accordingly.   

</span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, I support this budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to take this opportunity 

to share my thoughts on the allocation at hand.  As part of our visit to the New Zealand Parliament 

in  Wellington,  we  had  the  privilege  of  meeting  with  the  Auditor  General  of  New  Zealand.  

Personally, the meeting has enlightened me on the significance of the Audit Office.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Despite the fact that our Director of Audit was appointed as an advisor for the Public Accounts 

Committee,  I  was not  fully aware of the magnitude of this Office until  our encounter with  the 

Auditor General of New Zealand in Wellington.  

</span></div>
<div><span>My understanding is that the Audit Office should operate with independence, which implies that 

in the event it becomes independent, the allocation for this Office will not be part of the Budget 

presented to us today.  An independent Audit Office would only be accountable to the Speaker of 

</span><span>Parliament.  The appointment of the Director for Audit would no longer be made by a Minister but 

</span><span>rather  by  the  Speaker.    Furthermore,  if  the  Director  of  Audit  were  to  be  removed  from  their 

position, only the Speaker of Parliament would have the authority to do so, not a Minister.   

</span></div>
<div><span>It was explained to us that the rationale behind such operations is to provide independence to the 

Audit Office.  This way, during their investigations, the Office would not have any hesitation to 

present their findings and recommendations to the government.  As humans, we may hesitate to 

show  everything  during  investigations  that  involve  our  bosses  as  it  may  lead  to  unfavourable 

consequences. 

</span></div>
<div><span>What I discovered next was that the New Zealand Audit Office is aiding our Audit Office and their 

legal  representative  stationed  in  Wellington  is  currently  working  on  drafting  laws  that  will  be 

passed on to our Office to help us realise this goal.  Given this, Mr Speaker, I firmly support this 

initiative.   

</span></div>
<div><span>In my view, two Ministries that should operate independently are the Audit Office and the Office 

of the Ombudsman.  I believe that if we enforce legislation to establish complete independence for 

</span><span>the Audit Office, we can eliminate concerns that people may have regarding the efficiency of the 

</span><span>Audit Office in carrying out its duties.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Despite there being minimal adjustments made to the allocation for this Office, I support this Vote 

</span><span>Item.  Moreover, I urge the Minister responsible for this Ministry to expedite the process as we are 

</span><span>aware that it often takes significant time to draft legislation for Parliament's consideration.  

</span></div>
<div><span>During our meeting with the Auditor General in New Zealand, he assured us that he would assist 

</span><span>to the best of his ability.  Additionally, I had the opportunity to attend a PASAI meeting, which 

comprises  the  Auditors  of  countries  within  our  region.    Fortunately,  we  have  an  excellent

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>reputation within this organisation, specifically the Cook Islands, owing to our active involvement 

in the PASAI meetings.  They were impressed with the collaboration between the Public Accounts 

Committee and the Director of Audit.  In light of this, I support this endeavour and request that the 

Minister  responsible  expedites  the  legislative  process  so  that  we  can  utilise  our  Audit  Office 

effectively.  Thank you.   

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  It would have been ideal if you had included 

the Speaker on your trip.  Moving on, I see the Honourable Member Sonny Williams; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and the Members of this House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I would like to remind you that you are required to split the allotted 13 minutes 

with the Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  S.  WILLIAMS:    </span><span>Yes,  I  have  worked  with  my  Minister.    Previous  speakers  have  already 

extended greetings to us all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker,  I  wish to  draw  your attention to Book 2, Appropriation for  Audit,  with  particular 

focus on Output 5.  This outline concerns the funding for the Public Accounts Committee Advisor.  

As per the records, the budget allocation for this financial year and the next three years is set at 

$19,403.  However, I would like to express my concern that the budget is inadequate as per the 

requirements  of  the  Auditor  General,  who  shoulders  the  responsibility  of  advising  the  PAC 

Committee. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In our review of documents such as reports and statements referenced in PAC, we find it necessary 

for the Director of Audit to attend meetings and provide written opinions and reports to guide us 

in  decision-making.    The  significant  number  of  documents  we  </span><span>examine requires  the  Director’s 

</span><span>attention  more  often.    The  current  Chairperson  has  already  alerted  us  to  expect  an  increase  in 

workload this year.  For these reasons, we intend to propose to Parliament in the future to upscale 

</span><span>the funding for Audits.  This will enable the Director continue to advise the PAC Committee in 

</span><span>carrying out our responsibilities according to Parliamentary rules.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I wish to bring to your attention that the audit investigations and report reviews will be shifted to 

</span><span>the Pa Enua this year, resulting in a substantial increase in the workload of this Office.  In this 

</span><span>regard, I support the current budget allocation and anticipate any future well-deserved increases 

</span><span>for this Office from Parliament.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, I would like to speak on the comments made by two Opposition Members concerning PAC 

and Audit.  It seems to me that they feel regretful about our existence on the PAC.  Thank you.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Thank you to all colleagues for your thoughts 

on this Vote Item.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, we all know that the main function of the Cook Islands Audit Office is to provide an 

independent  assurance  to  this  very  House,  the  Parliament,  and  the  public  on  the  government's 

accountability and stewardship of public resources.  They conduct financial audits, performance 

audits, and compliance audits.  We have heard their involvement in assisting our PAC members to 

provide some insights, some guidance to our PAC members as to who is complying and to who is 

abusing these very appropriations that we are discussing in this House.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, we have heard the compliments and acknowledgement from both the Leader of the 

Opposition  and  the  Members  that  the  Audit  has  contributed  to  them.    Since  taking  up  the 

</span><span>Ministership for Audit, I have never been on any of Audit’s meetings and I am very happy to hear 

</span><span>that the Leader of the Opposition has been to two Audit conferences and meetings which makes 

me very very proud.  

</span></div>
<div><span>It is also good to sit from the government side and hear that the Opposition is the main people that 

are promoting and praising the Audit Office rather than the Minister himself.  So, to reiterate Papa 

</span><span>Vai Peua’s statement, “</span><span>t</span><span>ei mua rai te Kuki Airani.” </span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, this office is operating at 68 percent staff occupancy so out of 22 staff, there is only 

15  currently  employed  now.    And  this  office  has  completed  auditing  all  of  2019  Cook  Islands 

Government financial statements.  So, the main challenge for this office now is to complete three 

</span><span>years’ worth of audit from 2020 to 2022 and to get it done by the end of 2026. </span></div>
<div><span>This office is required to carry out Annual Audits for 59 individual government entities, 14 Outer 

</span><span>Island Administrations, 15 State Owned Enterprise, seven Ministerial support office, 13 Crown 

</span><span>and Statutory entities.  I have been assured by the Audit Office that they will continue to work 

</span><span>with MFEM to complete three years’ worth of audit. </span></div>
<div><span>I am very grateful and thankful for all the Members of Parliament that have supported the increase 

</span><span>and the increment required for this particular office. We all know that the Audit Office plays a 

</span><span>crucial role in promoting good governance and helping improve the effectiveness and efficiency 

of government operations in the Cook Islands.  

</span></div>
<div><span>With those few comments, thank you very much, Mr Speaker.
