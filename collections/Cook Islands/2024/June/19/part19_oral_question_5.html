<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I put the Question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $645,056 for Business Trade and Investment Board 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to</span></div>
<div><span>COOK ISLANDS INVESTMENT CORPORATION for 30 minutes.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $4,481,000 for the Cook Islands Investment Corporation 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I think it is appropriate that we review the budget for 

CIIC.  Nonetheless, I give my full support for this Vote Item and the changes that has occurred in 

the  allocation  for  this  department.    Mr  Speaker,  when  you  refer  to  page  73,  it  entails  all  the 

requirements needed to be implemented and for this reason, I give my support.  The arrangement 

is, to reduce the allocation for this </span><span>budget and to relocate it for next year’s budget.  An allocation 

of $200,000 in this year’s budget should be reconsidered for the budget of 2025/26.  The purpose 

</span><span>of this allocation is to help with salaries for the staff.  The same allocation has also been allocated 

</span><span>for  2025/26.    Also,  $500,000  has  also  been  allocated  for  next  year’s  budget  for  housing 

</span><span>maintenances that falls under CIIC.  This is why I support this budget.  The reason why I support 

this Vote Item Mr Speaker, when you look at their financial report, their status is not good.  There 

</span><span>goes a Mangaian saying, “the disclaim is so hard and very difficult with the work they do, it is 

very poor.”</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I know that some of the staff in this department are being investigated, but I do believe 

that  when  the  investigation  is  carried  out,  to  ensure  that  it  is  consistent  especially  with  staff 

</span><span>investigated in the past on how they got terminated.  I believe that when everything is followed 

</span><span>accordingly with MFEM in regards to CIIC, Honourable Minister, and this Vote Item will improve 

</span><span>tremendously.  When they got summoned by PAC in regards to their financial report, I was the 

</span><span>one  who  said  to  them  that  by  2023/24,  your  Report  will  be  reported  as  UNQUALIFIED  or 

</span><span>UNMODIFIED.  From 2014-2022, their Reports were MODIFIED.  Which basically means that 

the work being carried out by this department did not perform well.
