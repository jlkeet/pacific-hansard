<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the principles and merits of the Appropriation Bill 2024/25. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  we  adjourned  yesterday,  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  was  on  the  Floor  to  close  the 

</span><span>debate on the principles and merits but was interrupted by the adjournment.   

</span></div><div><span>I now call the Honourable Prime Minister to continue with his speech.    

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Kia Orana to all this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when I finished off speaking yesterday, I was referring to the 200 years in Mangaia 

</span><span>and the close to two thousand people that travelled to Mangaia for the celebration.  I was explaining 

that if Mangaia had a sealed runway that could land a Saab aircraft, instead of 55 flights, taking 

</span></div><div><span>659 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>the people to Mangaia, that same number could have been accommodated with 18 flights from the 

Saab.  Which highlights the importance of a significant key piece of infrastructure if we want to 

lift the standard of living in our Pa Enua islands.  And this is the rationale, Mr Speaker, behind the 

amount of money that we are looking at to seal firstly, the airport in Manihiki.  

</span></div><div><span>As the Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated, there is no economic formula that would justify an 

expense  of  that  amount,  there  is  no  financial  formula  that  would  convince  somebody,  some 

</span><span>economist, that this would be a worthwhile investment.  That’s because, Mr Speaker, they only 

</span><span>look at one thing and that is the bottom line and they look at it from a very narrow finance and 

banking term perspective.  We know the investment in a project like that, Mr Speaker, the return 

and the payback period is in much longer terms.  

</span></div><div><span>It took that long, Mr Speaker, for those economies to build to take advantage of this investment in 

infrastructure.  To today we now have an economy that generates 600 million dollars a year.  That 

of  course  is  generated  from  the  economies  of  Rarotonga  and  also  from  Aitutaki  </span><span>–</span><span>  very  small 

contributions from the rest of our islands and it will remain small, unless and until we make the 

investment that enables them to join our economy.  Therefore, this investment in Manihiki airport 

is not just a political promise, it's a reality that we have to put in place.  

</span></div><div><span>We have to understand that investment of this nature, any infrastructure investment is very, very 

expensive for a country with a small economy like ours.   

</span></div><div><span>We recently completed the 10-year Te Mato Vai Project at a cost of close to a hundred million 

dollars.  That was the biggest infrastructure investment that we have made since the project to open 

our international airport in 1975.  Yesterday, a question was asked about the sanitation project for 

</span><span>Takitumu.  That’s another project,</span><span> Mr Speaker, that will cost in excess of a hundred million dollars.  

Our  country  simply  does  not  have  that  sort  of  money  sitting  around  yet  and,  because  of  our 

graduation to high-income status, the only avenue of access available to us is through borrowing. 

</span></div><div><span>We have to be innovative, Mr Speaker.  We have to go out, we have to look at options where we 

</span><span>can  find  financing  for  key  critical  infrastructure  but  also  financing  at  the  same  time  to  build 

</span><span>resilience against the impacts of climate change.  Our voice has been very loud at the International 

forums at the Asian Development Bank and other International forums that we have attended over 

</span><span>the years and as a result of our advocacy, Mr Speaker I am happy to announce to us that the Asian 

</span><span>Development  Bank  just  late  last  year  and  in  February  confirmed  this  year,  a  new  financing 

</span><span>instrument available to countries like us that currently who offer terms of financing at 20 years, 

</span><span>now will offer terms of financing for up to 40 years at one percent interest with a ten year grace 

</span><span>period.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So, we have to be innovative, Mr Speaker.  We have to go out, we have to look at options where 

we can find financing for key critical infrastructure but also financing at the same time to build 

resilience against the impacts of climate change.  Our voice has been very loud at the International 

forums at the Asian Development Bank and other International forums that we have attended over 

the years and as a result of our advocacy, Mr Speaker I am happy to announce to us that the Asian 

Development  Bank  just  late  last  year  and  in  February  confirmed  this  year,  a  new  financing 

instrument available to countries like us that currently who offer terms of financing at 20 years, 

now will offer terms of financing for up to 40 years at one percent interest with a ten year grace 

period. 

</span></div><div><span>Just four years ago in 2020, Mr Speaker, our GDP was $600 million, a record for us and it dropped 

by 30 percent due to COVID and only today, four years later are we back at that same spot we 

were in 2020 and while our earnings and purchasing power decreased over time, the cost of goods, 

the cost of food increased over that time.  So, we are in a period of catch up, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>The  question  was  asked  just  earlier  about  why  we  are  not  engaging  our  key  private  sectors  in 

certain projects and as much as possible the government policy is to engage our private sector and 

even more so if it is a competition between our private sector and an international company, we 

will defer for our private sector to carry out the work.  There are times however, Mr Speaker, if 

the private sector cost exceeds what we have available, then we have to look at different ways of 

trying to deliver the same project and that is what we are doing right now with the Manihiki project.  

This is what we call a public sector model, if you like or the public works model, the old way of 

doing things where the project is led by the Ministry but engages private sector as needed and that 

way, we can manage to keep the cost at a level that we can afford to deliver this project.  

</span></div><div><span>Manihiki will be the template for how we will carry out this work, and we will look to roll out the 

sealing of the runways right around our islands but the northern group is the priority because that 

is the most expensive place to fly to at $1,500 - $1,700 for a one-way fare.  Because when the fares 

drop and the cargo capacity increases, we will start to see a little economy starting to develop on 

these  islands.    We  have  seen  it  in  Aitutaki.    We  have  starting  to  see  it  in  Atiu  with  the  small 

</span><span>developments of accommodation there.  

</span></div><div><span>I know that if we have the airfares dropped to at least even half for flying up to the north many of 

</span><span>our own people will want to go and visit their islands in the northern group if there is a regular 

</span><span>service and if you can go at an affordable price.  Then you will see someone opening up a little 

</span><span>shop. We will see people sending products  to  the market.   Then  you will see small  economies 

</span><span>taking shape  and it does not  happen overnight.    It  takes time Mr Speaker as  we have seen the 

example of both Rarotonga and Aitutaki.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Recently,  Mr  Speaker,  I  just  returned  back  from  a  country  in  the  Caribbean  called  Antiqa  and 

Babuda two islands.  This country depends heavily on tourism like us.  They have a GDP of $1.6 

billion.  The advantage that they have is that they are very close to the source market of the United 

States who has a population of 260 million people.  We live in a part of the world that is quite 

isolated and source markets are much less than what America has.  But despite these differences 

and the challenges that we have, I still firmly believe Mr Speaker that our country already in the 

region leads the way.  

</span></div><div><span>And I firmly believe Mr Speaker that with the investments that we have made over the years and 

the investments we </span><span>see in this year’s budget and moving forward we are setting our country on a 

</span><span>pathway that will provide the prosperity and the standards of living that our people deserve.  And 

I speak not just of the tourism potential that we have but also of our mineral resource which I have 

not spoken about at this session.  But already in the area of seabed our country is seen as one of 

the world leaders.  

</span></div><div><span>World leaders in the sense of ensuring the protection of our ocean. World leaders in the sense of 

our approach to exploration being of the higher standards of integrity and transparency.  We are 

now gathering such a wide body of data and information from our exploration that Pacific leaders 

has agreed at the last Forum for the establishment of a Pacific Centre of Excellence on Deep Ocean 

Science to be based here in Rarotonga.  

</span></div><div><span>This  is  knowledge  and  information  and  data  Mr  Speaker  that  we  own,  the  country  owns.    It’s 

</span><span>knowledge about our ocean that we own and its knowledge that we should protect.  There is a 

value to this knowledge and information Mr Speaker and it is important that we understand that 

but it is also important that we let the rest of the world know that this knowledge is ours but we 

are willing to share it.  

</span></div><div><span>Next week I will be receiving a report on the valuation of the mineral resource that we have in our 

EEZ as a result of the exploration that has been conducted to date.  Next month we will begin 

public  consultations  on  the  development  of  a  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund  to  ensure  the  protection 

</span><span>revenues that our country may  receive from  our mineral  resource.  This  is a fund that is being 

</span><span>established  to  ensure  the  responsible  management  of  resources  but  also  the  disbursement  of 

</span><span>revenues to help build our country up.  It is important we have a discussion with our people to let 

</span><span>them know what we are looking at and also to hear their views on what they think revenues that 

</span><span>we earn in the future from mineral resource where they should think it should be going to. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, I am very happy with this Appropriation Bill that is before the House and 

I look forward to continuing our discussion with the Members of Parliament on the appropriations 

across our Ministries.  I would like to really acknowledge my team at Ministry of Finance, the
