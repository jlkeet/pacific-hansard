<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  directed  towards  the  Member  for 

</span><span>Titikaveka;  however,  I  currently see him occupied with  his  mobile phone.  Fortunately,  I have 

</span><span>multiple inquiries to make.  Firstly, I would like to address the Minister responsible for sports by 

inquiring  about  the  current  status  of  our  sports  individuals.    The  Olympics  in  France  will 

commence in approximately two months, and many of our people are concerned about the athletes 

representing our nation.  Can the Minister please provide an update regarding this matter?
