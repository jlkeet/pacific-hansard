<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am uncertain if you have already conveyed this, 

but  it  is  critical  to  remind  Members  not  to  share  stories  during  Question  Time  as  it  is 

counterproductive.  With that said, I would like to direct my question to the Minister for CIIC.  As 

</span><span>we  are  aware,  some  contract  workers,  particularly  carpenters,  are  departing  due  to  the  lack  of 

</span><span>available work.  We understand that CIIC is accountable for renovating the MFEM building and 

Tupapa Outpatient facility.  My question to the Honourable Minister is, why were these projects 

not tendered out to contractors to provide work to these individuals and prevent them from leaving 

the country, for instance, to Land Holdings Ltd?
