<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  First, Kia Orana to you and your staff.  Kia 

Orana to our Members of Parliament who are in attendance today.  Kia Orana also to our people 

who are listening, and I hope the blessings of the Lord are with you all.  Mr Speaker, I am here to 

address the question posed by the Member from Ruaau yesterday. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, I experienced hearing difficulties and did not fully comprehend the question.  So, if I 

understood the Member's question correctly, they were wondering whether each island received 

the same amount of money donated by the Airport Authority.  In response to the Member's inquiry, 

the answer is yes.  Each island that marked the arrival of the gospel to Aitutaki, the islands of Nga-

Pu-Toru, and most recently, Mangaia, received a donation of $10,000 from the Airport Authority.  

These donations were made on behalf of the Crown and all taxpayers of our nation.  Additionally, 

if I may add, Mr Speaker, I believe the Honourable Member intends to donate all of his SRF for 

the next fiscal year to the next island celebrating 200 years.  The Member can correct me if I am 

wrong, but we will wait for his confirmation.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr  Speaker,  this  information  is  accessible  to  anyone,  especially  to  Members  of 

Parliament.  As a Member of Parliament, you have the right to request any information from an 

</span><span>agency of the Crown, unless it is confidential.  However, there may be difficulties obtaining such 

</span><span>information due to its confidentiality.  Nonetheless, as a Member of Parliament, all you have to do 

</span><span>is  send  an  email  to  the  relevant  agency  requesting  the  desired  information.    Alternatively,  you 

</span><span>could arrange an appointment by driving there on your bike and personally make your inquiry.  

</span><span>The  officials  of  the  agency  in  question  have  the  authority  to  release  information  to  you  upon 

request, and this applies to any agency or HOM.

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, you may be curious as to where I am headed with this.  What I wish to convey is that 

there  is  no  need  for  Members  of  Parliament  to  come  to  Parliament  to  request  information.  

Although,  I do understand that it is  more advantageous to  seek information in  Parliament as it 

presents the opportunity to broadcast your proactiveness and your fulfillment of the duties set forth 

as a Member of Parliament.  In conclusion, I have provided my perspective and hope that I have 

answered the question at hand.
