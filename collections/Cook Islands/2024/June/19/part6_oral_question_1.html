<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON.  V.  MOKOROA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  all  your  staff  this 

morning.  Salutations have already been conveyed to us this morning.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I stand to provide a response to the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday.  The 

question pertained to the complaints that were submitted to the Office of the Ombudsman.  I have 

since received a response from the Ombudswoman. 

</span></div>
<div><span>According to the report, the Office of the Ombudsman received eight complaints from the Police 

Office between 2017 to 2024.  Out of the eight complaints, only two have been resolved, while the 

remaining six are awaiting a report from the Police Office detailing the actions taken.  The delay 

in the resolution of these complaints is attributed to the extended time taken by the Police to furnish 

the results of investigations to the Office of the Ombudsman. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  lack  of  response  from  the  Police  to  requests  for  information  from  the  Ombudsman  is  a 

significant concern.  This issue, unfortunately, is not limited to the Police and is also prevalent in 

other Ministries within the Government.  Although we cannot provide specific details regarding 

the nature of the complaints, we are willing to address any complaints that have been submitted to 

us through the Ombudsman's office.  I hope my responses have been satisfactory.  Thank you.
