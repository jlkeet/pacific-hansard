Ombudsman regarding the Police's lack of response to the 2021 complaint.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I have gone through the Annual Report mentioned regarding the Ombudsman's Office, and I am 

familiar  with  its  contents.    Nonetheless,  I  must  clarify  that  the  complaint,  in  this  case,  is  not 

featured within the report.  The reason being that it was forwarded to  the Ombudsman's office 

earlier this year because the Police failed to provide any response regarding the matter.
