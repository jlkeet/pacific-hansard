<div><span>SUMMARY 

</span></div><div><span>No debate 

</span></div><div><span>That will be a total of 13 hours and 30 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now begin with our first Vote Item and that is, </span><span>Agriculture </span><span>for 40 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,485,081 for 

Agriculture stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  First of all, I wanted to welcome the Head of the Ministry 

of Agriculture, who is  here with  us in this Honourable House;  I just wanted to  ensure that our 

people know it.  Madam, welcome. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, because you have allocated specific speaking times to the different Vote Items, 40 

minutes for this House to debate on the Vote Item for Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>That is correct! 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:   </span><span>I fully support the Appropriation Bill 2024/25 and would like to make a brief 

comment on this Vote Item.  However, I will not go through each Vote Item as I have already read 

all the details in my book.  That being said, I am in favour of the slight budget increase of $30,000 

for the purchase of new machinery and the proposal of $50,000 for next year's budget in 2025/26.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to draw attention to the funds received from overseas.  These funds were allocated 

under ODA, specifically for the Ministry of Agriculture.  As an example, the Chinese government 

</span><span>has contributed $107,640 for the purchase of tractors.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that Matavera's tractor 

</span><span>is included in this list.  Moreover, the FAO, under ODA, has granted an allocation of $15,000 to 

</span><span>further support the Ministry of Agriculture in developing our agricultural and growing industry in 

</span><span>the country. 

</span></div><div><span>Additionally,  the  FAO,  under  ODA,  has  granted  an  allocation  of  $57,500  to  support  the  taro 

plantation and aid the development of the agricultural industry in our country.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a request.  I have previously requested a tractor, and now, I 

have another concern.  The Ministry of Agriculture has run out of manure, which they purchased 

a few months ago.  Additionally, Papa Kiriau's order has been sold out as well.  Therefore, I kindly 

request that the Minister of Finance allocate additional funds for the purchase of more manure. 

</span></div><div><span>My second request is directed towards the Ministry of Agriculture.  I have noticed that some of 

our growers in the Cook Islands purchase fertilisers from overseas.  It would be greatly appreciated 

if the Ministry could exempt levies or reduce VAT to facilitate the importation of these products 

for their use.  Furthermore, I appeal for assistance to be extended to Papa Kiriau in his agricultural 

requirements, especially for his produce. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, I will have to interrupt you.  It is time for a break and you 

may continue when we return. 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is now suspended until 3.15 p.m.  Sitting is now suspended. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.29 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>May I have your attention, please?  I hereby call this Parliament session to order, 

and I would like to remind all Members that the allotted time for each Vote Items includes the 

Minister's time.  Therefore, may I request all Honourable Members to keep their speeches brief, 

so that we can share the time limit equally among all Members?  I prefer not to resort to publicly 

requesting a Member to sit down due to time constraints.  I seek your cooperation in adhering to 

the time limit so that we may commence.  Lastly, before we adjourned, the Member for Matavera 

had the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to discuss the Agriculture Vote Item.  In 

</span><span>particular, I would like to draw attention to the allocation ODA as some Members have requested 

</span><span>clarification of its meaning.  ODA stands for Official Development Assistance.  This funding is 

provided by international organisations outside of our country to support our growers and aid in 

</span><span>their development.  

</span></div><div><span>As previously mentioned, the FAO has provided a grant of $57,500 specifically intended to aid in 

</span><span>taro growing and facilitate the introduction of new varieties into our country.  This is why I felt it 

was necessary to comment on the assistance offered by the ODA.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I have a request to make of the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister.  I understand that 

MFEM is in possession of funds allocated for agriculture.  I am requesting that these funds be used 

to purchase fertilisers and chemicals to aid our growers.   

</span></div><div><span>I  support  the  allocation  for  this  Ministry,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  the  amount  of  money 

allocated for the purchase of chemicals and fertilisers through MFEM.  Upon approval from this 

House, I urge that these funds be utilised towards buying fertilisers as there is currently a shortage 

of it on the island.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Teariki Heather, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Kia Orana to all present </span><span>–</span><span> our time running out.  Currently, there is a shortage 

of  bananas,  kumara,  arrowroot,  and  taro.    I  recall  the  Minister  responsible  for  Punanga  Nui 

mentioning the construction of a facility to benefit growers.  However, we must prioritise planting 

and harvesting these crops before establishing a market for them. 

</span></div><div><span>I strongly believe that our growers are currently facing difficulties in producing crops due to a lack 

of affordable fertilisers, chemicals, and seeds.  In light of this situation, I recommend that we invest 

in purchasing excavators to aid in digging our taro patches.  It is unnecessary to buy additional 

tractors as they were last procured in 2014, and currently, only one remains operational.  

</span></div><div><span>The issue at hand is the lack of skilled mechanics available to repair these machines.  The tractor 

owned  by  the  Airport  Authority,  for  instance,  has  been  inoperable  for  over  a  year,  with  no 

knowledge  of  when  it  will  be  repaired.    Hence,  Mr  Speaker,  I  strongly  support  and  request 

additional funding for agriculture to support growers in their planting endeavours, particularly in 

the cultivation of taro and other produce. 

</span></div><div><span>In the past, we had a surplus of taro patches on the island, but regrettably, they no longer exist.  

There  exists  a  prominent  scarcity  of  taro  shoots  on  Rarotonga.    To  illustrate,  I  would  like  to 

acknowledge the Prison's previous administration's efforts to cultivate arrowroot, taru</span><span>ā</span><span>, bananas, 

</span><span>and other crops.  However, with the present Minister, only weeds seem to flourish.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, what is your point of order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>The statement that has been made is not correct.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, just two days ago I raised a point of order </span><span>–</span><span> the 

ruling there was, the Speaker may  continue  until  you find the actual provision in  the Standing 

Orders.  I am going to be asking you, Mr Speaker to apply the same ruling across the board. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Leader.  Honourable Minister I have taken your point 

of order; you may sit down.  You may continue, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank  you, Mr Speaker.  I firmly believe it is no longer prudent  for the 

government to invest in machinery as they cannot maintain or repair these machines.  Instead, I 

urge  the  allocation  of  funds  to  support  growers,  crucial  at  a  time  where  agricultural  practices 

become arduous.</span></div><div><span>Today,  Mr  Speaker,  many  determined  growers  are  procuring  their  machinery.    I  would  like  to 

make reference to Iro, a grower from Matavera, who has purchased his equipment.  It would have 

been wise for the elected Member of Matavera to do the same and aid his people during these 

trying times.  

</span></div><div><span>Although  we  have  an  adequate  number  of  tractors  and  machines,  the  challenge  is  finding 

experienced drivers.  I have additional insights on this topic, Mr Speaker, but I will reserve them 

so my fellow Members will have the opportunity to express their views. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to everyone present.  I 

would like to express my opinion on the allocation of funds for this Ministry, which I believe has 

been neglected for many years.  As members of this Parliament, we often discuss the importance 

of diversifying our economy, and while we recognise that tourism is a valuable asset, we must also 

consider  the  need  to  support  agriculture  in  the  event  of  another  crisis  such  as  the  COVID-19 

pandemic, which highlighted the vulnerability of our economy due to overreliance on tourism.</span></div><div><span>I acknowledge that the Budget needs to be distributed fairly across all Ministries.  However, upon 

reviewing  Book  1  specifically  pertaining  to  Agriculture,  I  am  disheartened  by  the  meager 

</span><span>allocation given to this Ministry.  Considering that we regard agriculture as a critical sector and a 

</span><span>fallback option, it is disconcerting to note that only three-quarters of a page is dedicated to it.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to direct my message to the Secretary of Agriculture, who is present here today.  I 

understand that it may be challenging, but with the current allocation, I urge you to explore ways 

to  increase  local  food  production  before  we  focus  on  exporting.    My  concern  stems  from  the 

significant  contrast  between  export  and  import  figures  stated  in  the  Budget  book,  where  the 

</span></div><div><span>668 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>projected figure for export in 2023 is only $2.3 million, whereas the import figure is close to $212 

million.  This drastic difference illustrates the urgent need for us to prioritise local food production.   

</span></div><div><span>The remarks made by the Leader for the United Party remain pertinent, as evident when we visit 

the local markets where half a cabbage is priced at $12.00.  Despite our relatively high salaries, 

purchasing imported tomatoes from New Zealand is also deemed unaffordable.  This is indicative 

of inadequate support provided to the Ministry of Agriculture, as demonstrated by the $212 million 

import expenditure projected for 2023.  Simply discussing the need for economic diversification 

is insufficient - we must proactively explore means of diversifying our economy.  

</span></div><div><span>A classic example is looking at Arama Wigmore as well as Agnes Armstrong in Mangaia and Paul 

Lynch  here  on  Rarotonga  who  produces  hot  chilli  sauce.    When  we  look  at  the  tomato  and 

cucumber season, we understand that there is mass production of that in one season.  Perhaps the 

</span><span>Ministry of Agriculture can encourage the private sectors and others to preserve these crops for 

</span><span>the  off-season  time.    If  the  private  sectors  can  produce  these  sauces,  perhaps  the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture can consider giving incentives in the promotion of these products. 

</span></div><div><span>My message to the Secretary of Agriculture is this: Despite the limitations of the allocated budget, 

I strongly urge you and your Minister to explore other potential sources of funding.  Additionally, 

the projected plateau of trading revenue growth, with only a $70,000 increase predicted for the 

next financial year, is far from ideal.  We should strive to excel beyond any charts and continue to 

increase our revenue, which will undoubtedly be motivating for all stakeholders involved.  Thank 

you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader.  I see the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to express my support for the allocation to 

the Ministry of Agriculture.  First of all, Kia Orana to the Secretary of Agriculture and thank you 

for taking the time to join us today and listen to our debates.  Kia Orana also to the Honourable 

Minister Rose Toki-Brown and I must thank her and the Secretary of Agriculture for their support 

</span><span>in my work.  

</span></div><div><span>To begin, thank you for providing a tractor for the Ministry of Corrective Services.   The Ministry 

</span><span>has not had any machinery for a considerable amount of time, and during my and the Minister's 

</span><span>terms, we were finally able to secure one.  Moreover, I would like to commend the Ministry for 

</span><span>continuously providing training to inmates on how to cultivate the produce required for planting. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in light of the Member for Murienua's recent comments  regarding the state of the 

</span><span>prison,  I  want  to  clarify  my  own  experience  there.    During  my  time,  the  grounds  were  well-

maintained, and the crops grown by the inmates were bountiful.  Even today, the cultivation of 

</span></div><div><span>669

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>crops remains a priority, as evidenced by the abundance of produce that could be mistaken for 

weeds in the yard.  Notably, members of the public come to the prison to purchase some of these 

items.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Minister,  I  will  grant  you  two  more  minutes  to  conclude  your 

speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  G.  ANGENE:  </span><span>  Concluding  my  remarks,  I  would  like  to  express  my  support  for  the 

allocation of the Vote Item.  Thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister for Agriculture, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you to all Honourable Members for your thoughts and for 

providing  supportive  comments  on  the  Vote  Item.    A  special  welcome  and  appreciation  to 

Secretary Marama Anguna and her staff in Rarotonga and throughout the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>On behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, I would like to thank the government for increasing the 

Vote  Item,  although  we  understand  that  it  may  not  be  sufficient,  as  mentioned  previously.  

However,  we  are  optimistic  that  more  funding  is  available,  as  well  as  donor  assistance  from 

overseas.  I commend Secretary of Agriculture and her team for their hard work over the past few 

years. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to all the growers on Rarotonga and the Outer Islands, especially those who do not rely 

on agriculture for assistance, but rather manage their crops through their own investments.  I would 

also like to acknowledge the efforts of Papa Kiriau Turepu and Willie Kauvai for their assistance 

in importing fertilisers and chemicals for the growers.  Despite facing some challenging times, we 

have managed to overcome these issues.   

</span></div><div><span>We  have  experienced  some  difficulties  with  bringing  in  fertilisers,  however,  we  managed  to 

address these issues. One of the intentions in this is to encourage our people or business owners to 

</span><span>enable them to bring their agricultural products such as fertilisers and soil, especially products that 

</span><span>are needed by our people for agricultural purposes.  This is the intention of our government, to 

</span><span>support our private sectors.  However, it has been noticed that our people are still facing difficulties 

</span><span>in importing these products for the need of our people.  It was also noted that the containers of 

</span><span>fertilisers that are ordered, usually they are ordered to last for three months.  Last few months, the 

</span><span>containers of fertilisers that arrived did not last long, it only lasted for about two months. Another 

</span><span>order has been placed for our use and for your use.  I can confirm that to bring these fertilisers into 

</span><span>our country, our people will not face any more difficulties or issues.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>There was also a mention of tractors to help support our agricultural industry, yes this is to confirm 

that  a  request  has  been  submitted  to  some  of  our  donors  outside  of  our  country,  for  some 

excavators, diggers, and many more. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, the building at the airport that was utilised by catering companies for the airlines that 

building  is  now  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.  The  plan  for  this  building  is  to  be  used  for 

processing  as  stated  by  the  Member  for  Rakahanga.  PACER  Plus  will  also  be  able  to  provide 

support of necessities in utilising this building. 

</span></div><div><span>There are other services that is required for carrying out research for parasites and insects.  Next 

month, there will be some people coming into our country to carry out some surveys on parasites 

and insects here in the Cook Islands. Samoa will also be part of this research group, including 

Tonga.  Thankfully, we have x-ray machines available at the airport and at the wharf for screening 

</span><span>purposes for everything that comes into our country.  Therefore, regardless of the allocation given 

</span><span>to the Ministry of Agriculture of $1.4 million, if we were to put together all the funds received 

from overseas into this allocation, it will surely exceed $2 million. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, I give my support for this budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is that the sum of $1,485,081 for Agriculture 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>AUDIT (PERCA) for 30 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,132,654 for Audit (PERCA) 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, while there is no notable difference in the increase for this Vote Item, 

I would like to voice my support for the budget allocated towards Audit.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am aware that a Bill is currently being reviewed to strengthen our Audit Office.  I 

strongly feel that this is a Vote Item that requires our attention, and I anxiously wait for the Bill to 

be  presented  before  this  House.    Once  implemented,  I  believe  that  this  Bill  will  significantly 

alleviate the workload and responsibilities of the Head of Audit and their staff. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore,  I  am  convinced  that  this  Bill  will  not  only  provide  assistance  to  Ministries  and 

Departments that subscribe to this Honourable House, but also empower them to adhere to their 

respective Reports.  While the Audit Office currently has the ability to  address Ministries who 

have failed to fulfill their Reports, there is a dire need to strengthen the process of requesting their 

compliance.  I am confident that this Bill will ensure that the Heads of Ministries will comply with 

</span><span>their budgets without hesitation.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to highlight an important aspect to consider when reviewing the financial 

reports provided to us by the Audit Office and PAC.  In the Mangaian dialect, a report deemed 

"QUALIFIED" denotes  a satisfactory report.  Conversely, a "MODIFIED"  report suggests that 

there are issues with the work.  Lastly, a "DISCLAIMED" report signals a severe problem.  As 

such, I am in full support of this Bill and eagerly anticipate its presentation to this House at the 

earliest opportunity.   

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of Desmond 

Wildin.  Desmond has been an integral part of the PAC committee from the time of my joining in 

2018 until my resignation.  His intelligence and work ethic are quite remarkable.  Fortunately, he 

was a member of the team during my tenure on the committee.  However, I understand that his 

current employment contract is set to expire in November of this year. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to make a formal request to the Minister responsible for Audit, and I urge that my 

statement be recorded in Hansard.  My humble request to the Honourable Minister is to consider 

</span><span>re-engaging Desmond for another term with the Audit Office.  In addition to this, I propose that 

</span><span>he  be  given  the  opportunity  to  train  another  individual  who  can  take  on  his  role.    Given  the 

</span><span>demanding nature of his job, I believe this arrangement would ensure that the Audit Office will 

</span><span>continue to function effectively.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, in the event that the relevant Minister is 

</span><span>listening, I implore them to consider my request and take suitable action accordingly.   

</span></div><div><span>To conclude, I support this budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to take this opportunity 

to share my thoughts on the allocation at hand.  As part of our visit to the New Zealand Parliament 

in  Wellington,  we  had  the  privilege  of  meeting  with  the  Auditor  General  of  New  Zealand.  

Personally, the meeting has enlightened me on the significance of the Audit Office.   

</span></div><div><span>Despite the fact that our Director of Audit was appointed as an advisor for the Public Accounts 

Committee,  I  was not  fully aware of the magnitude of this Office until  our encounter with  the 

Auditor General of New Zealand in Wellington.  

</span></div><div><span>My understanding is that the Audit Office should operate with independence, which implies that 

in the event it becomes independent, the allocation for this Office will not be part of the Budget 

presented to us today.  An independent Audit Office would only be accountable to the Speaker of 

</span><span>Parliament.  The appointment of the Director for Audit would no longer be made by a Minister but 

</span><span>rather  by  the  Speaker.    Furthermore,  if  the  Director  of  Audit  were  to  be  removed  from  their 

position, only the Speaker of Parliament would have the authority to do so, not a Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>It was explained to us that the rationale behind such operations is to provide independence to the 

Audit Office.  This way, during their investigations, the Office would not have any hesitation to 

present their findings and recommendations to the government.  As humans, we may hesitate to 

show  everything  during  investigations  that  involve  our  bosses  as  it  may  lead  to  unfavourable 

consequences. 

</span></div><div><span>What I discovered next was that the New Zealand Audit Office is aiding our Audit Office and their 

legal  representative  stationed  in  Wellington  is  currently  working  on  drafting  laws  that  will  be 

passed on to our Office to help us realise this goal.  Given this, Mr Speaker, I firmly support this 

initiative.   

</span></div><div><span>In my view, two Ministries that should operate independently are the Audit Office and the Office 

of the Ombudsman.  I believe that if we enforce legislation to establish complete independence for 

</span><span>the Audit Office, we can eliminate concerns that people may have regarding the efficiency of the 

</span><span>Audit Office in carrying out its duties.   

</span></div><div><span>Despite there being minimal adjustments made to the allocation for this Office, I support this Vote 

</span><span>Item.  Moreover, I urge the Minister responsible for this Ministry to expedite the process as we are 

</span><span>aware that it often takes significant time to draft legislation for Parliament's consideration.  

</span></div><div><span>During our meeting with the Auditor General in New Zealand, he assured us that he would assist 

</span><span>to the best of his ability.  Additionally, I had the opportunity to attend a PASAI meeting, which 

comprises  the  Auditors  of  countries  within  our  region.    Fortunately,  we  have  an  excellent

in the PASAI meetings.  They were impressed with the collaboration between the Public Accounts 

Committee and the Director of Audit.  In light of this, I support this endeavour and request that the 

Minister  responsible  expedites  the  legislative  process  so  that  we  can  utilise  our  Audit  Office 

effectively.  Thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  It would have been ideal if you had included 

the Speaker on your trip.  Moving on, I see the Honourable Member Sonny Williams; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and the Members of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I would like to remind you that you are required to split the allotted 13 minutes 

with the Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  S.  WILLIAMS:    </span><span>Yes,  I  have  worked  with  my  Minister.    Previous  speakers  have  already 

extended greetings to us all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  I  wish to  draw  your attention to Book 2, Appropriation for  Audit,  with  particular 

focus on Output 5.  This outline concerns the funding for the Public Accounts Committee Advisor.  

As per the records, the budget allocation for this financial year and the next three years is set at 

$19,403.  However, I would like to express my concern that the budget is inadequate as per the 

requirements  of  the  Auditor  General,  who  shoulders  the  responsibility  of  advising  the  PAC 

Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>In our review of documents such as reports and statements referenced in PAC, we find it necessary 

for the Director of Audit to attend meetings and provide written opinions and reports to guide us 

in  decision-making.    The  significant  number  of  documents  we  </span><span>examine requires  the  Director’s 

</span><span>attention  more  often.    The  current  Chairperson  has  already  alerted  us  to  expect  an  increase  in 

workload this year.  For these reasons, we intend to propose to Parliament in the future to upscale 

</span><span>the funding for Audits.  This will enable the Director continue to advise the PAC Committee in 

</span><span>carrying out our responsibilities according to Parliamentary rules.   

</span></div><div><span>I wish to bring to your attention that the audit investigations and report reviews will be shifted to 

</span><span>the Pa Enua this year, resulting in a substantial increase in the workload of this Office.  In this 

</span><span>regard, I support the current budget allocation and anticipate any future well-deserved increases 

</span><span>for this Office from Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, I would like to speak on the comments made by two Opposition Members concerning PAC 

and Audit.  It seems to me that they feel regretful about our existence on the PAC.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Thank you to all colleagues for your thoughts 

on this Vote Item.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we all know that the main function of the Cook Islands Audit Office is to provide an 

independent  assurance  to  this  very  House,  the  Parliament,  and  the  public  on  the  government's 

accountability and stewardship of public resources.  They conduct financial audits, performance 

audits, and compliance audits.  We have heard their involvement in assisting our PAC members to 

provide some insights, some guidance to our PAC members as to who is complying and to who is 

abusing these very appropriations that we are discussing in this House.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we have heard the compliments and acknowledgement from both the Leader of the 

Opposition  and  the  Members  that  the  Audit  has  contributed  to  them.    Since  taking  up  the 

</span><span>Ministership for Audit, I have never been on any of Audit’s meetings and I am very happy to hear 

</span><span>that the Leader of the Opposition has been to two Audit conferences and meetings which makes 

me very very proud.  

</span></div><div><span>It is also good to sit from the government side and hear that the Opposition is the main people that 

are promoting and praising the Audit Office rather than the Minister himself.  So, to reiterate Papa 

</span><span>Vai Peua’s statement, “</span><span>t</span><span>ei mua rai te Kuki Airani.” </span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this office is operating at 68 percent staff occupancy so out of 22 staff, there is only 

15  currently  employed  now.    And  this  office  has  completed  auditing  all  of  2019  Cook  Islands 

Government financial statements.  So, the main challenge for this office now is to complete three 

</span><span>years’ worth of audit from 2020 to 2022 and to get it done by the end of 2026. </span></div><div><span>This office is required to carry out Annual Audits for 59 individual government entities, 14 Outer 

</span><span>Island Administrations, 15 State Owned Enterprise, seven Ministerial support office, 13 Crown 

</span><span>and Statutory entities.  I have been assured by the Audit Office that they will continue to work 

</span><span>with MFEM to complete three years’ worth of audit. </span></div><div><span>I am very grateful and thankful for all the Members of Parliament that have supported the increase 

</span><span>and the increment required for this particular office. We all know that the Audit Office plays a 

</span><span>crucial role in promoting good governance and helping improve the effectiveness and efficiency 

of government operations in the Cook Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>With those few comments, thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,132,654 for Audit (PERCA)  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to</span></div><div><span>BUSINESS TRADE AND INVESTMENT BOARD for 15 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $645,056 for Business Trade and Investment Board 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>   Mr Speaker,  I  would like to  comment  briefly on the appropriation  for BTIB.  

Firstly, I would like to express my support for their allocation.  However, I want to draw attention 

to their Output 3 - Foreign Investment.  I urge the Minister responsible to reconsider this and strive 

for  improvement.    It  is  vital,  especially  for  those  in  the  business  sector  and  foreign  investors 

seeking to enter the country.  I believe that we can make Output 3 better if we review it again, and 

I strongly support this proposal. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  Seeing there is no other Members, can I ask 

the Minister Responsible? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  As I see that there is only one speaker on this 

</span><span>Vote Item, I would like to commend him for exhibiting his support.  At BTIB, we appreciate your 

input, thoughts, and comments for this financial year.  

</span></div><div><span>Regarding  the  Budget  Book,  everything  is  detailed  there,  and  as  public  servants,  we  have  the 

</span><span>responsibility to read and understand it thoroughly.  Therefore, I do not have much to add, and I 

</span><span>would like to conclude my remarks by thanking everyone for your support and your words.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $645,056 for Business Trade and Investment Board 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to</span></div><div><span>COOK ISLANDS INVESTMENT CORPORATION for 30 minutes.  

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $4,481,000 for the Cook Islands Investment Corporation 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I think it is appropriate that we review the budget for 

CIIC.  Nonetheless, I give my full support for this Vote Item and the changes that has occurred in 

the  allocation  for  this  department.    Mr  Speaker,  when  you  refer  to  page  73,  it  entails  all  the 

requirements needed to be implemented and for this reason, I give my support.  The arrangement 

is, to reduce the allocation for this </span><span>budget and to relocate it for next year’s budget.  An allocation 

of $200,000 in this year’s budget should be reconsidered for the budget of 2025/26.  The purpose 

</span><span>of this allocation is to help with salaries for the staff.  The same allocation has also been allocated 

</span><span>for  2025/26.    Also,  $500,000  has  also  been  allocated  for  next  year’s  budget  for  housing 

</span><span>maintenances that falls under CIIC.  This is why I support this budget.  The reason why I support 

this Vote Item Mr Speaker, when you look at their financial report, their status is not good.  There 

</span><span>goes a Mangaian saying, “the disclaim is so hard and very difficult with the work they do, it is 

very poor.”</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I know that some of the staff in this department are being investigated, but I do believe 

that  when  the  investigation  is  carried  out,  to  ensure  that  it  is  consistent  especially  with  staff 

</span><span>investigated in the past on how they got terminated.  I believe that when everything is followed 

</span><span>accordingly with MFEM in regards to CIIC, Honourable Minister, and this Vote Item will improve 

</span><span>tremendously.  When they got summoned by PAC in regards to their financial report, I was the 

</span><span>one  who  said  to  them  that  by  2023/24,  your  Report  will  be  reported  as  UNQUALIFIED  or 

</span><span>UNMODIFIED.  From 2014-2022, their Reports were MODIFIED.  Which basically means that 

the work being carried out by this department did not perform well.   

</span></div><div><span>677 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>However, to be brief, the allocation that is being allocated for CIIC, I fully support. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I stand to express my perspective on 

the allocation for Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  My stance differs from others since this 

Ministry was given a warning by PAC.  The warning stated that if they neglect to comply with the 

reporting  requirements,  their  budget  will  be  put  on  hold,  last  year.    The  cause  of  this  was  the 

absence of Reports from 2014-2023, there was NONE.  

</span></div><div><span>Subsequently, a warning was issued to the Ministry and in response, they began filing Reports for 

the  years  2014-2022.  This  is  a  positive  step,  as  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  requires  these 

</span><span>reports to fulfill their obligations outlined in our Standing Orders.  Up to 2022, the adoption of the 

</span><span>new Standing Orders, the Ministries and Agencies had a very poor reporting record. A table was 

formulated where we saw 59 in total, and only less than quarter was compliance.    

</span></div><div><span>And so, in giving my approval to this allocation, I want to send a message that once you receive 

your budget, you have an obligation to report back to Parliament as to what you use your money 

for. And that you spend is in accordance with your business plan.  And in your Report, you then 

tell Parliament that you have achieved the targets that are set out in your business plan.  And for 

an agency of this size, it should be easy enough.  And so, I rise to raise those comments and hope 

they will be taken not as adverse criticism but as constructive criticism.  

</span></div><div><span>This is an agency that seems to be attracting media attention once or twice a month.  The most 

recent media was the business class travels not authorised.  And I am going to ask the Minister to 

take all these in as constructive criticism because at the end of the day, I think our objectives are 

the same.  And of course, the biggest problem for people that are reporting about their financials 

</span><span>way back to 2014 is, what do you do about it today?  Nothing!  You can’t!  It’s gone! </span></div><div><span>And I do believe that the Public Accounts Committee, even the current Committee will be insisting 

</span><span>that the Ministries keep on time with their reporting.  

</span></div><div><span>There was only one other matter that I wanted to comment on, and that is the $500,000 for the 

</span><span>program increase of the building repairs and maintenance.  I know the Honourable Minister for 

</span><span>CIIC that there is an ongoing program to maintain the government houses.  I am not sure whether 

</span><span>the rental of those houses are being kept up to date.  I assume they are </span><span>not, otherwise; you wouldn’t 

</span><span>be asking for this much money to maintain the government houses.  

</span></div><div><span>And with those thoughts, Mr Speaker, I support the allocation.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition and I see the Deputy Prime 

Minister and Minister Responsible; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>Thank  you  once  again,  Mr  Speaker  and  may  I  cross  the  Floor  to  the 

Leader of the Opposition, concur with you that your remarks are exactly what my thoughts are.  

My only issue, Mr Speaker is the timing of those views and those remarks because these are views 

and opinions that I feel would have been best served during the PAC process because I am pretty 

sure the Chair of the PAC Committee will concur with me that as a PAC Member you have the 

right and the ability and the power to summon certain individuals from within this Ministry to face 

the PAC Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>It is at that point, Mr Speaker that we can fix this sort of nonsense.  Because, Mr Speaker once 

PAC passes it and endorses the Budget and hands the report to Parliament, it is what they say, a 

missed  opportunity  because  when  it  gets  to  Parliament  and  we  start  debating  it,  it  cannot  be 

changed, Mr Speaker.  So, like I said, Mr Speaker being a PAC Member is very important.  But 

when  one  decid</span><span>es  to  remove  oneself  from  a  PAC  Committee,  from  one’s  duty  as  a  PAC 

</span><span>Committee, what can I say, I am pretty sure we can all make up our minds. 

</span></div><div><span>In commenting again, Mr Speaker I do concur with the Leader of the Opposition’s views and why 

</span><span>I do because we owe it to the tax payer because we need to report truthfully as required under the 

law of the land.  On that note, thank you for those comments from the Opposition from across the 

Floor and may I close with some advice, please get back on the PAC Committee.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:   </span><span>Thank  you, Honourable Minister.   I  share the same sentiment as  you,  and  I 

implore one of them to rejoin the PAC Committee.  Your presence in the Committee is of immense 

value.  Thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $4,481,000 for the Cook Islands Investment Corporation  

</span><span>stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CORRECTIVE SERVICES for 30 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,804,287 for Corrective Services 

</span><span>stands part of the Schedule

</span></div><div><span>This will be for 30 minutes, thank you.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  It seems that I will be the only one from this side taking 

a  stand  on  this  Vote  Item.    I  support  the  Vote  Item  for  the  Ministry  of  Corrective  Services, 

including the proposed increase in employee salaries from 2026/27.  I am aware that the Minister 

has collaborated with the Head of Corrective Services to raise employee salaries by a significant 

amount of $213,943, which will be of tremendous benefit to these workers.  Thus, I fully support 

this move, Mr Speaker.  Thank you 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister and you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am just looking at our time, mindful that I know 

</span><span>when the Minister will get up to speak, he will have one strong message to give and I don’t want 

</span><span>it to be interrupted by the ending of our meeting so I will spend the next few minutes talking about 

the Corrective Services. 

</span></div><div><span>The one thing I can say in this Appropriation, Mr Speaker that it’s not reflected in the Budget is 

the way that our Corrective Service has been run and we’ve heard from the Minister, when he took 

</span><span>on this role as the Minister, the roll in the Prison Service of inmates was over sixty and today that 

number is down below thirty. 

</span></div><div><span>In addition to that, Mr Speaker during his time as the Minister, we have not had one inmate escape 

</span><span>from prison.  What it doesn’t show in the Budget is what t</span><span>he Minister does.  He teaches these 

</span><span>inmates, he works with them, he’s with them in the morning for their Prayer, he’s with them in the 

</span><span>evening for their evening Prayer and he rehabilitates them. 

</span></div><div><span>As he has told us before many times, he knows the ins and the outs of the Prison system.  His own 

personal experience allows him to talk to our inmates and to provide them a guiding path way to 

</span><span>a better way so they don’t come back into prison.  I recognise the attire that he is wearing the 

</span><span>uniform of the Commissioner of Prison.  All he requires now is a hat.  I wanted to praise and thank 

</span><span>the Minister for the way that he is running the prison and I support the allocation for the Corrective 

</span><span>Service. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister for your support.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, our Session for today has come to an end.  Before I adjourn the Session, I 

</span><span>would like to remind all Members to refer to Standing Orders 238, 239, and 240 up to 245 for
