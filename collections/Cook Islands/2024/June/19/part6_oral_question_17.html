<h3>Oral Question 17</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Allow me a moment to remove my reading glasses.  

</span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the chance to respond to the question brought up by the 

</span><span>Member for Matavera concerning our prison, its staff, and our youth. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Back in 2018, I was appointed as the Minister responsible for this particular Ministry.  During that 

</span><span>time, there were 68 prisoners being held.  Today, however, that number has reduced significantly, 

and there are only 28 prisoners remaining.  That is the present status of our prison, Honourable 

</span></div>
<div><span>658

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Member, and it is worth noting that this Ministry has seen tremendous improvements under my 

leadership.   

</span></div>
<div><span>During my time as a prisoner, none of the Ministers visited our facility.  However, today, I make 

an effort to speak to our inmates every morning, afternoon, and evening about my experiences 

both inside and outside of prison.  The correctional facility aided me in improving my literacy 

skills in English, and now, I am the one teaching our inmates.  Thank you to the government for 

their continuous financial support towards the department since my appointment as the Minister.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  you  and  other  Members  may  recall  that  I  previously  referred  to  the  facility  as  an 

"earthquake" place.  During my time, when a few inmates attempted to escape, it created a tense 

atmosphere similar to an earthquake, which invoked fear amongst our people.  Today, however, 

visitors are pleased to see our inmates because they are actively employed and contribute to various 

projects deemed necessary within our community.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, I firmly believe that the Finance Ministry and yourself can allocate 

further funding in future budgets to facilitate additional improvements required by the department.  

Our inmates work tirelessly throughout the night, indicating the most efficient utilisation of time 

spent inside the facility.  As their Minister, I regard them as my children because their life inside 

prison is similar to those outside.
