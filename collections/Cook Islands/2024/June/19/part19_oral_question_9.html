<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:   </span><span>Thank  you, Honourable Minister.   I  share the same sentiment as  you,  and  I 

implore one of them to rejoin the PAC Committee.  Your presence in the Committee is of immense 

value.  Thank you.

<div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $4,481,000 for the Cook Islands Investment Corporation  

</span><span>stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div>
<div><span>CORRECTIVE SERVICES for 30 minutes. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $1,804,287 for Corrective Services

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>This will be for 30 minutes, thank you.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  It seems that I will be the only one from this side taking 

a  stand  on  this  Vote  Item.    I  support  the  Vote  Item  for  the  Ministry  of  Corrective  Services, 

including the proposed increase in employee salaries from 2026/27.  I am aware that the Minister 

has collaborated with the Head of Corrective Services to raise employee salaries by a significant 

amount of $213,943, which will be of tremendous benefit to these workers.  Thus, I fully support 

this move, Mr Speaker.  Thank you 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister and you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am just looking at our time, mindful that I know 

</span><span>when the Minister will get up to speak, he will have one strong message to give and I don’t want 

</span><span>it to be interrupted by the ending of our meeting so I will spend the next few minutes talking about 

the Corrective Services. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The one thing I can say in this Appropriation, Mr Speaker that it’s not reflected in the Budget is 

the way that our Corrective Service has been run and we’ve heard from the Minister, when he took 

</span><span>on this role as the Minister, the roll in the Prison Service of inmates was over sixty and today that 

number is down below thirty. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, Mr Speaker during his time as the Minister, we have not had one inmate escape 

</span><span>from prison.  What it doesn’t show in the Budget is what t</span><span>he Minister does.  He teaches these 

</span><span>inmates, he works with them, he’s with them in the morning for their Prayer, he’s with them in the 

</span><span>evening for their evening Prayer and he rehabilitates them. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As he has told us before many times, he knows the ins and the outs of the Prison system.  His own 

personal experience allows him to talk to our inmates and to provide them a guiding path way to 

</span><span>a better way so they don’t come back into prison.  I recognise the attire that he is wearing the 

</span><span>uniform of the Commissioner of Prison.  All he requires now is a hat.  I wanted to praise and thank 

</span><span>the Minister for the way that he is running the prison and I support the allocation for the Corrective 

</span><span>Service. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister for your support.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, our Session for today has come to an end.  Before I adjourn the Session, I 

</span><span>would like to remind all Members to refer to Standing Orders 238, 239, and 240 up to 245 for
