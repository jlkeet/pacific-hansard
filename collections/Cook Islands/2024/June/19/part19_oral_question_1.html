<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, just two days ago I raised a point of order </span><span>â€“</span><span> the 

ruling there was, the Speaker may  continue  until  you find the actual provision in  the Standing 

Orders.  I am going to be asking you, Mr Speaker to apply the same ruling across the board. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Leader.  Honourable Minister I have taken your point 

of order; you may sit down.  You may continue, Honourable Member. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank  you, Mr Speaker.  I firmly believe it is no longer prudent  for the 

government to invest in machinery as they cannot maintain or repair these machines.  Instead, I 

urge  the  allocation  of  funds  to  support  growers,  crucial  at  a  time  where  agricultural  practices 

become arduous.</span></div>
<div><span>Today,  Mr  Speaker,  many  determined  growers  are  procuring  their  machinery.    I  would  like  to 

make reference to Iro, a grower from Matavera, who has purchased his equipment.  It would have 

been wise for the elected Member of Matavera to do the same and aid his people during these 

trying times.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Although  we  have  an  adequate  number  of  tractors  and  machines,  the  challenge  is  finding 

experienced drivers.  I have additional insights on this topic, Mr Speaker, but I will reserve them 

so my fellow Members will have the opportunity to express their views. Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to everyone present.  I 

would like to express my opinion on the allocation of funds for this Ministry, which I believe has 

been neglected for many years.  As members of this Parliament, we often discuss the importance 

of diversifying our economy, and while we recognise that tourism is a valuable asset, we must also 

consider  the  need  to  support  agriculture  in  the  event  of  another  crisis  such  as  the  COVID-19 

pandemic, which highlighted the vulnerability of our economy due to overreliance on tourism.</span></div>
<div><span>I acknowledge that the Budget needs to be distributed fairly across all Ministries.  However, upon 

reviewing  Book  1  specifically  pertaining  to  Agriculture,  I  am  disheartened  by  the  meager 

</span><span>allocation given to this Ministry.  Considering that we regard agriculture as a critical sector and a 

</span><span>fallback option, it is disconcerting to note that only three-quarters of a page is dedicated to it.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to direct my message to the Secretary of Agriculture, who is present here today.  I 

understand that it may be challenging, but with the current allocation, I urge you to explore ways 

to  increase  local  food  production  before  we  focus  on  exporting.    My  concern  stems  from  the 

significant  contrast  between  export  and  import  figures  stated  in  the  Budget  book,  where  the

</span></div>
<div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>projected figure for export in 2023 is only $2.3 million, whereas the import figure is close to $212 

million.  This drastic difference illustrates the urgent need for us to prioritise local food production.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The remarks made by the Leader for the United Party remain pertinent, as evident when we visit 

the local markets where half a cabbage is priced at $12.00.  Despite our relatively high salaries, 

purchasing imported tomatoes from New Zealand is also deemed unaffordable.  This is indicative 

of inadequate support provided to the Ministry of Agriculture, as demonstrated by the $212 million 

import expenditure projected for 2023.  Simply discussing the need for economic diversification 

is insufficient - we must proactively explore means of diversifying our economy.  

</span></div>
<div><span>A classic example is looking at Arama Wigmore as well as Agnes Armstrong in Mangaia and Paul 

Lynch  here  on  Rarotonga  who  produces  hot  chilli  sauce.    When  we  look  at  the  tomato  and 

cucumber season, we understand that there is mass production of that in one season.  Perhaps the 

</span><span>Ministry of Agriculture can encourage the private sectors and others to preserve these crops for 

</span><span>the  off-season  time.    If  the  private  sectors  can  produce  these  sauces,  perhaps  the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture can consider giving incentives in the promotion of these products. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My message to the Secretary of Agriculture is this: Despite the limitations of the allocated budget, 

I strongly urge you and your Minister to explore other potential sources of funding.  Additionally, 

the projected plateau of trading revenue growth, with only a $70,000 increase predicted for the 

next financial year, is far from ideal.  We should strive to excel beyond any charts and continue to 

increase our revenue, which will undoubtedly be motivating for all stakeholders involved.  Thank 

you.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader.  I see the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to express my support for the allocation to 

the Ministry of Agriculture.  First of all, Kia Orana to the Secretary of Agriculture and thank you 

for taking the time to join us today and listen to our debates.  Kia Orana also to the Honourable 

Minister Rose Toki-Brown and I must thank her and the Secretary of Agriculture for their support 

</span><span>in my work.  

</span></div>
<div><span>To begin, thank you for providing a tractor for the Ministry of Corrective Services.   The Ministry 

</span><span>has not had any machinery for a considerable amount of time, and during my and the Minister's 

</span><span>terms, we were finally able to secure one.  Moreover, I would like to commend the Ministry for 

</span><span>continuously providing training to inmates on how to cultivate the produce required for planting. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, in light of the Member for Murienua's recent comments  regarding the state of the 

</span><span>prison,  I  want  to  clarify  my  own  experience  there.    During  my  time,  the  grounds  were  well-

maintained, and the crops grown by the inmates were bountiful.  Even today, the cultivation of

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>crops remains a priority, as evidenced by the abundance of produce that could be mistaken for 

weeds in the yard.  Notably, members of the public come to the prison to purchase some of these 

items.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Minister,  I  will  grant  you  two  more  minutes  to  conclude  your 

speech. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.  ANGENE:  </span><span>  Concluding  my  remarks,  I  would  like  to  express  my  support  for  the 

allocation of the Vote Item.  Thank you.   

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister for Agriculture, you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you to all Honourable Members for your thoughts and for 

providing  supportive  comments  on  the  Vote  Item.    A  special  welcome  and  appreciation  to 

Secretary Marama Anguna and her staff in Rarotonga and throughout the Outer Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, I would like to thank the government for increasing the 

Vote  Item,  although  we  understand  that  it  may  not  be  sufficient,  as  mentioned  previously.  

However,  we  are  optimistic  that  more  funding  is  available,  as  well  as  donor  assistance  from 

overseas.  I commend Secretary of Agriculture and her team for their hard work over the past few 

years. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Kia Orana to all the growers on Rarotonga and the Outer Islands, especially those who do not rely 

on agriculture for assistance, but rather manage their crops through their own investments.  I would 

also like to acknowledge the efforts of Papa Kiriau Turepu and Willie Kauvai for their assistance 

in importing fertilisers and chemicals for the growers.  Despite facing some challenging times, we 

have managed to overcome these issues.   

</span></div>
<div><span>We  have  experienced  some  difficulties  with  bringing  in  fertilisers,  however,  we  managed  to 

address these issues. One of the intentions in this is to encourage our people or business owners to 

</span><span>enable them to bring their agricultural products such as fertilisers and soil, especially products that 

</span><span>are needed by our people for agricultural purposes.  This is the intention of our government, to 

</span><span>support our private sectors.  However, it has been noticed that our people are still facing difficulties 

</span><span>in importing these products for the need of our people.  It was also noted that the containers of 

</span><span>fertilisers that are ordered, usually they are ordered to last for three months.  Last few months, the 

</span><span>containers of fertilisers that arrived did not last long, it only lasted for about two months. Another 

</span><span>order has been placed for our use and for your use.  I can confirm that to bring these fertilisers into 

</span><span>our country, our people will not face any more difficulties or issues.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>There was also a mention of tractors to help support our agricultural industry, yes this is to confirm 

that  a  request  has  been  submitted  to  some  of  our  donors  outside  of  our  country,  for  some 

excavators, diggers, and many more. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the building at the airport that was utilised by catering companies for the airlines that 

building  is  now  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.  The  plan  for  this  building  is  to  be  used  for 

processing  as  stated  by  the  Member  for  Rakahanga.  PACER  Plus  will  also  be  able  to  provide 

support of necessities in utilising this building. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There are other services that is required for carrying out research for parasites and insects.  Next 

month, there will be some people coming into our country to carry out some surveys on parasites 

and insects here in the Cook Islands. Samoa will also be part of this research group, including 

Tonga.  Thankfully, we have x-ray machines available at the airport and at the wharf for screening 

</span><span>purposes for everything that comes into our country.  Therefore, regardless of the allocation given 

</span><span>to the Ministry of Agriculture of $1.4 million, if we were to put together all the funds received 

from overseas into this allocation, it will surely exceed $2 million. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, I give my support for this budget.  Thank you.
