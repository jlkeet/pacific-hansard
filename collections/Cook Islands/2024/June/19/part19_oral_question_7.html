<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I stand to express my perspective on 

the allocation for Cook Islands Investment Corporation.  My stance differs from others since this 

Ministry was given a warning by PAC.  The warning stated that if they neglect to comply with the 

reporting  requirements,  their  budget  will  be  put  on  hold,  last  year.    The  cause  of  this  was  the 

absence of Reports from 2014-2023, there was NONE.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Subsequently, a warning was issued to the Ministry and in response, they began filing Reports for 

the  years  2014-2022.  This  is  a  positive  step,  as  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  requires  these 

</span><span>reports to fulfill their obligations outlined in our Standing Orders.  Up to 2022, the adoption of the 

</span><span>new Standing Orders, the Ministries and Agencies had a very poor reporting record. A table was 

formulated where we saw 59 in total, and only less than quarter was compliance.    

</span></div>
<div><span>And so, in giving my approval to this allocation, I want to send a message that once you receive 

your budget, you have an obligation to report back to Parliament as to what you use your money 

for. And that you spend is in accordance with your business plan.  And in your Report, you then 

tell Parliament that you have achieved the targets that are set out in your business plan.  And for 

an agency of this size, it should be easy enough.  And so, I rise to raise those comments and hope 

they will be taken not as adverse criticism but as constructive criticism.  

</span></div>
<div><span>This is an agency that seems to be attracting media attention once or twice a month.  The most 

recent media was the business class travels not authorised.  And I am going to ask the Minister to 

take all these in as constructive criticism because at the end of the day, I think our objectives are 

the same.  And of course, the biggest problem for people that are reporting about their financials 

</span><span>way back to 2014 is, what do you do about it today?  Nothing!  You can’t!  It’s gone! </span></div>
<div><span>And I do believe that the Public Accounts Committee, even the current Committee will be insisting 

</span><span>that the Ministries keep on time with their reporting.  

</span></div>
<div><span>There was only one other matter that I wanted to comment on, and that is the $500,000 for the 

</span><span>program increase of the building repairs and maintenance.  I know the Honourable Minister for 

</span><span>CIIC that there is an ongoing program to maintain the government houses.  I am not sure whether 

</span><span>the rental of those houses are being kept up to date.  I assume they are </span><span>not, otherwise; you wouldn’t 

</span><span>be asking for this much money to maintain the government houses.  

</span></div>
<div><span>And with those thoughts, Mr Speaker, I support the allocation.
