<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>   Mr Speaker,  I  would like to  comment  briefly on the appropriation  for BTIB.  

Firstly, I would like to express my support for their allocation.  However, I want to draw attention 

to their Output 3 - Foreign Investment.  I urge the Minister responsible to reconsider this and strive 

for  improvement.    It  is  vital,  especially  for  those  in  the  business  sector  and  foreign  investors 

seeking to enter the country.  I believe that we can make Output 3 better if we review it again, and 

I strongly support this proposal.
