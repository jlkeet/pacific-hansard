<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you to the Honourable Member from Murienua for your question.  

You are correct that some companies are experiencing a lack of work and, as a result, have laid off 

employees.    Regarding  the  question  of  why  CIIC  has  undertaken  these  projects,  it  is  due  to 

financial considerations, Mr Speaker.  During project planning, costings were taken into account.  

However,  after  discussing  the  allocated  funding  with  contractors,  it  became  apparent  that  the 

funding was insufficient to complete the project.   

</span></div>
<div><span>To summarise, Mr Speaker, I would like to share a recent example.  We had a budget of $60,000 

for tarsealing work on the Ports Authority parking area, and we sent out an RFQ.  Unfortunately, 

the lowest quote we received was $200,000.  As a result, we are unable to pay the contractor as we 

only had $60,000 allocated for the project.  In short, Mr Speaker, it comes down to costs and what 

</span><span>we can or cannot afford.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
