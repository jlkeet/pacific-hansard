<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>Thank  you  once  again,  Mr  Speaker  and  may  I  cross  the  Floor  to  the 

Leader of the Opposition, concur with you that your remarks are exactly what my thoughts are.  

My only issue, Mr Speaker is the timing of those views and those remarks because these are views 

and opinions that I feel would have been best served during the PAC process because I am pretty 

sure the Chair of the PAC Committee will concur with me that as a PAC Member you have the 

right and the ability and the power to summon certain individuals from within this Ministry to face 

the PAC Committee. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is at that point, Mr Speaker that we can fix this sort of nonsense.  Because, Mr Speaker once 

PAC passes it and endorses the Budget and hands the report to Parliament, it is what they say, a 

missed  opportunity  because  when  it  gets  to  Parliament  and  we  start  debating  it,  it  cannot  be 

changed, Mr Speaker.  So, like I said, Mr Speaker being a PAC Member is very important.  But 

when  one  decid</span><span>es  to  remove  oneself  from  a  PAC  Committee,  from  one’s  duty  as  a  PAC 

</span><span>Committee, what can I say, I am pretty sure we can all make up our minds. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In commenting again, Mr Speaker I do concur with the Leader of the Opposition’s views and why 

</span><span>I do because we owe it to the tax payer because we need to report truthfully as required under the 

law of the land.  On that note, thank you for those comments from the Opposition from across the 

Floor and may I close with some advice, please get back on the PAC Committee.  Thank you.
