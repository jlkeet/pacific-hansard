<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>I believe there are two questions from yesterday that needs to be answered.  The first question was 

from the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Browne to the Honourable Minister Vaine 

Mokoroa regarding the complaints that have been lodged with the Ombudsman regarding the status 

of the Police.   

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Minister Vaine Mokoroa.  The second one will go the Honourable Deputy 

Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  MOKOROA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  all  your  staff  this 

morning.  Salutations have already been conveyed to us this morning.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to provide a response to the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday.  The 

question pertained to the complaints that were submitted to the Office of the Ombudsman.  I have 

since received a response from the Ombudswoman. 

</span></div><div><span>According to the report, the Office of the Ombudsman received eight complaints from the Police 

Office between 2017 to 2024.  Out of the eight complaints, only two have been resolved, while the 

remaining six are awaiting a report from the Police Office detailing the actions taken.  The delay 

in the resolution of these complaints is attributed to the extended time taken by the Police to furnish 

the results of investigations to the Office of the Ombudsman. 

</span></div><div><span>The  lack  of  response  from  the  Police  to  requests  for  information  from  the  Ombudsman  is  a 

significant concern.  This issue, unfortunately, is not limited to the Police and is also prevalent in 

other Ministries within the Government.  Although we cannot provide specific details regarding 

the nature of the complaints, we are willing to address any complaints that have been submitted to 

us through the Ombudsman's office.  I hope my responses have been satisfactory.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The second question was from the Honourable Tim Varu to the Honourable 

</span><span>Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Albert  Nicholas  regarding  the  donation  that  was  given  by  the  Airport 

</span><span>Authority to the Mangaia Bicentennial.  Honourable Minister, the Floor is yours. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable 

</span><span>Members. Firstly, I would like to thank the Minister for providing an explanation.  However, I 

must clarify that  my question from  yesterday was perhaps unclear.   It  was made to  you, but  it 

related to the Ministry of Police.  Specifically, I raised concerns over a complaint that was lodged 

</span></div><div><span>655 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>with the Police in 2021 but was left unresolved.  Consequently, a complaint was forwarded to the 

Ombudsman regarding the Police's lack of response to the 2021 complaint.  

</span></div><div><span>I have gone through the Annual Report mentioned regarding the Ombudsman's Office, and I am 

familiar  with  its  contents.    Nonetheless,  I  must  clarify  that  the  complaint,  in  this  case,  is  not 

featured within the report.  The reason being that it was forwarded to  the Ombudsman's office 

earlier this year because the Police failed to provide any response regarding the matter. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKORA:  </span><span>As this issue is not currently being discussed in Parliament, there are more 

details required to better understand the matter. We would like to know the identity and origin of 

the  complainant,  and  the  nature  of  the  complaint  itself,  to  enable  us  to  forward  the  relevant 

</span><span>information to the Ombudsmanâ€™s Office.</span></div><div><span>MR  SEPAKER:</span><span>    I  agree  Honourable  Minister.    Can  we  proceed  with  the  second  question?  

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  First, Kia Orana to you and your staff.  Kia 

Orana to our Members of Parliament who are in attendance today.  Kia Orana also to our people 

who are listening, and I hope the blessings of the Lord are with you all.  Mr Speaker, I am here to 

address the question posed by the Member from Ruaau yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday, I experienced hearing difficulties and did not fully comprehend the question.  So, if I 

understood the Member's question correctly, they were wondering whether each island received 

the same amount of money donated by the Airport Authority.  In response to the Member's inquiry, 

the answer is yes.  Each island that marked the arrival of the gospel to Aitutaki, the islands of Nga-

Pu-Toru, and most recently, Mangaia, received a donation of $10,000 from the Airport Authority.  

These donations were made on behalf of the Crown and all taxpayers of our nation.  Additionally, 

if I may add, Mr Speaker, I believe the Honourable Member intends to donate all of his SRF for 

the next fiscal year to the next island celebrating 200 years.  The Member can correct me if I am 

wrong, but we will wait for his confirmation.  

</span></div><div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr  Speaker,  this  information  is  accessible  to  anyone,  especially  to  Members  of 

Parliament.  As a Member of Parliament, you have the right to request any information from an 

</span><span>agency of the Crown, unless it is confidential.  However, there may be difficulties obtaining such 

</span><span>information due to its confidentiality.  Nonetheless, as a Member of Parliament, all you have to do 

</span><span>is  send  an  email  to  the  relevant  agency  requesting  the  desired  information.    Alternatively,  you 

</span><span>could arrange an appointment by driving there on your bike and personally make your inquiry.  

</span><span>The  officials  of  the  agency  in  question  have  the  authority  to  release  information  to  you  upon 

request, and this applies to any agency or HOM.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, you may be curious as to where I am headed with this.  What I wish to convey is that 

there  is  no  need  for  Members  of  Parliament  to  come  to  Parliament  to  request  information.  

Although,  I do understand that it is  more advantageous to  seek information in  Parliament as it 

presents the opportunity to broadcast your proactiveness and your fulfillment of the duties set forth 

as a Member of Parliament.  In conclusion, I have provided my perspective and hope that I have 

answered the question at hand. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Leader of the United 

Party, the Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I am uncertain if you have already conveyed this, 

but  it  is  critical  to  remind  Members  not  to  share  stories  during  Question  Time  as  it  is 

counterproductive.  With that said, I would like to direct my question to the Minister for CIIC.  As 

</span><span>we  are  aware,  some  contract  workers,  particularly  carpenters,  are  departing  due  to  the  lack  of 

</span><span>available work.  We understand that CIIC is accountable for renovating the MFEM building and 

Tupapa Outpatient facility.  My question to the Honourable Minister is, why were these projects 

not tendered out to contractors to provide work to these individuals and prevent them from leaving 

the country, for instance, to Land Holdings Ltd? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you to the Honourable Member from Murienua for your question.  

You are correct that some companies are experiencing a lack of work and, as a result, have laid off 

employees.    Regarding  the  question  of  why  CIIC  has  undertaken  these  projects,  it  is  due  to 

financial considerations, Mr Speaker.  During project planning, costings were taken into account.  

However,  after  discussing  the  allocated  funding  with  contractors,  it  became  apparent  that  the 

funding was insufficient to complete the project.   

</span></div><div><span>To summarise, Mr Speaker, I would like to share a recent example.  We had a budget of $60,000 

for tarsealing work on the Ports Authority parking area, and we sent out an RFQ.  Unfortunately, 

the lowest quote we received was $200,000.  As a result, we are unable to pay the contractor as we 

only had $60,000 allocated for the project.  In short, Mr Speaker, it comes down to costs and what 

</span><span>we can or cannot afford.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  directed  towards  the  Member  for 

</span><span>Titikaveka;  however,  I  currently see him occupied with  his  mobile phone.  Fortunately,  I have 

</span><span>multiple inquiries to make.  Firstly, I would like to address the Minister responsible for sports by 

inquiring  about  the  current  status  of  our  sports  individuals.    The  Olympics  in  France  will 

commence in approximately two months, and many of our people are concerned about the athletes 

representing our nation.  Can the Minister please provide an update regarding this matter?

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, you may respond. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:   </span><span>Thank  you, Mr Speaker, and the Member for  Matavera for the  great 

question.  I would like to take this opportunity to share with all the listeners and viewers that our 

Cook Islands team is fully prepared to attend the Olympics.  If only we had the resources to fund 

a group of dancers, I would have taken them along, given that in our previous trip to the Solomon 

Islands, we won a gold medal. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it is my pleasure to announce that three athletes have been confirmed to represent our 

nation.    The  first  of  them  is  Mr  Alex  Beddoes  who  will  be  competing  in  athletics,  while  the 

remaining two are swimmers - Mr Wesley Roberts and Ms Lanihei Connolly - who come from the 

region of Pokoinu/Nikao, with one of them from Atiu.  We take immense pride in the fact that 

these three individuals will represent our country at the Olympics. 

</span></div><div><span>Additionally,  I  would  like  to  remind  those  who  were  unable  to  participate  in  this  event  to  be 

prepared  for  the  upcoming  Cook  Islands  games  which  will  take  place  in  September/October.  

Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Honourable Member, you may ask your first 

question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Apologies Mr Speaker for interrupting.  As the Member for Titikaveka is taking 

a considerable amount of time,  I have decided to ask my third question now and postpone my 

query to him till tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>My third question is aimed at the Minister responsible for Corrective Services.  I take this moment 

to compliment his choice of attire today, which resembles that of a correctional facility uniform.  

It has come to my attention that renovation work is undergoing at our prison, with inquiries being 

made on the matter.  Hence, I would like to ask the Minister about the status of the refurbishment 

project at the prison, considering the attire that he currently adorns.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, you may respond. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Allow me a moment to remove my reading glasses.  

</span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the chance to respond to the question brought up by the 

</span><span>Member for Matavera concerning our prison, its staff, and our youth. 

</span></div><div><span>Back in 2018, I was appointed as the Minister responsible for this particular Ministry.  During that 

</span><span>time, there were 68 prisoners being held.  Today, however, that number has reduced significantly, 

and there are only 28 prisoners remaining.  That is the present status of our prison, Honourable 

</span></div><div><span>658

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 19 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Member, and it is worth noting that this Ministry has seen tremendous improvements under my 

leadership.   

</span></div><div><span>During my time as a prisoner, none of the Ministers visited our facility.  However, today, I make 

an effort to speak to our inmates every morning, afternoon, and evening about my experiences 

both inside and outside of prison.  The correctional facility aided me in improving my literacy 

skills in English, and now, I am the one teaching our inmates.  Thank you to the government for 

their continuous financial support towards the department since my appointment as the Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  you  and  other  Members  may  recall  that  I  previously  referred  to  the  facility  as  an 

"earthquake" place.  During my time, when a few inmates attempted to escape, it created a tense 

atmosphere similar to an earthquake, which invoked fear amongst our people.  Today, however, 

visitors are pleased to see our inmates because they are actively employed and contribute to various 

projects deemed necessary within our community.  

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, I firmly believe that the Finance Ministry and yourself can allocate 

further funding in future budgets to facilitate additional improvements required by the department.  

Our inmates work tirelessly throughout the night, indicating the most efficient utilisation of time 

spent inside the facility.  As their Minister, I regard them as my children because their life inside 

prison is similar to those outside. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister </span><span>â€“</span><span> been there, done that. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  come  to  the  end  of  our  Question  Time  and  I  would  like  to  thank  every  Honourable 

Members for your contributions.
