<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:   </span><span>Thank  you, Mr Speaker, and the Member for  Matavera for the  great 

question.  I would like to take this opportunity to share with all the listeners and viewers that our 

Cook Islands team is fully prepared to attend the Olympics.  If only we had the resources to fund 

a group of dancers, I would have taken them along, given that in our previous trip to the Solomon 

Islands, we won a gold medal. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, it is my pleasure to announce that three athletes have been confirmed to represent our 

nation.    The  first  of  them  is  Mr  Alex  Beddoes  who  will  be  competing  in  athletics,  while  the 

remaining two are swimmers - Mr Wesley Roberts and Ms Lanihei Connolly - who come from the 

region of Pokoinu/Nikao, with one of them from Atiu.  We take immense pride in the fact that 

these three individuals will represent our country at the Olympics. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  I  would  like  to  remind  those  who  were  unable  to  participate  in  this  event  to  be 

prepared  for  the  upcoming  Cook  Islands  games  which  will  take  place  in  September/October.  

Thank you, Mr Speaker.
