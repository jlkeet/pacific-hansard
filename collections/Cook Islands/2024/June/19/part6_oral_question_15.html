<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Apologies Mr Speaker for interrupting.  As the Member for Titikaveka is taking 

a considerable amount of time,  I have decided to ask my third question now and postpone my 

query to him till tomorrow. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My third question is aimed at the Minister responsible for Corrective Services.  I take this moment 

to compliment his choice of attire today, which resembles that of a correctional facility uniform.  

It has come to my attention that renovation work is undergoing at our prison, with inquiries being 

made on the matter.  Hence, I would like to ask the Minister about the status of the refurbishment 

project at the prison, considering the attire that he currently adorns.  Thank you.
