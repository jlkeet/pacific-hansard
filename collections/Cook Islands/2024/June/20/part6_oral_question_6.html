<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  for  Murienua  for  your  request.  

However,  I  must  remind  you  that  this  time  is  allotted  for  Oral  Questions  and  not  requests.  

Nonetheless,  I  can  confirm  that  the  area  you  mentioned  is  one  that  we  have  recently  assessed.  

While ICI was correct in stating that there is no budget for this matter, I approached CIIC regarding 

the cables that come onto dry land.  The CEO for CIIC acknowledged that their Ministry is the 

appropriate department to explore suitable rocks for the area's protection.  I believe CIIC will reach 

out to TNM Ltd. to obtain pricing information for these rocks. 

</span></div>
<div><span>That is my response to your request; not to your question, your request.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
