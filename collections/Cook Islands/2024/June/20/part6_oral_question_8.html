<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker, I had intended to address my question to the Minister for 

Corrective  Services.    However,  I  will  redirect  my  inquiry  to  the  Member  of  Parliament  from 

Aitutaki,  specifically  for  the  Vai-Vai-Tau  constituency.    I  understand  that  this  Member  was 

actively involved in the Aitutaki harbour project.  During my visit to Aitutaki for the Ureia village 

Christmas celebration last year, I witnessed him inspecting the project's progress.  Therefore, my 

question for the Honourable Member is about the current status of the harbor project.  According 

to the budget, certain tasks are required to be completed for this project.  I would like to know 

more about it.  Thank you.
