</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Appropriation Bill 2024/25 </span><span>–</span><span> Consideration of Bill in Detail stage.  We 

were on the Vote Item for Corrective Services before we adjourned yesterday.  We have 25 minutes 

debating time left on this Vote Item.  I will now give the Floor to the Minister responsible for this 

Vote Item, the Honourable George Angene, to conclude the debate.  Honourable Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and to all of our Members of Parliament in this 

House, Kia Orana to you.  To my senior staff from the Ministry of Culture, thank you for joining 

us in this House.  Kia Orana to the gentlemen sitting in the Gallery and also the Assistant Minister 

</span><span>from our Church, greetings to all of you. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I continue, Mr Speaker the Word of God states,  </span><span>“Teach me Your Way, O Lord…” and 

</span><span>according  to  the  Book  of  Psalms,  </span><span>“Your  word  is  a  lamp  to  my  feet  and  a  light  to  my  path.”  

</span><span>Everything that comes from my mouth is the truth and is not a lie. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before I give my thoughts, I would like to recite a poem to you about the time I spent 

in prison.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The poem you have just heard was written by me on the 5</span><span>th</span><span> of August 1995. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Honourable Members and our listeners, I would like to speak about my experiences living 

inside and outside of prison walls.  During my time in confinement, I witnessed a severe lack of 

honour,  respect,  and  discipline  within  these  walls.    However,  when  I  became  the  Minister  for 

Prison  in  2018,  I  took  the  initiative  to  visit  inmates,  listen  to  their  stories,  and  offer  guidance.  

Every morning, I am there counseling them, and similarly, I return in the evening out of my love 

and  concern  for  these  children  (inmates).    Before  me,  there  was  no  Minister  responsible  for 

Corrective Services as it was under the Ministry of Justice.  However, when I became Member of 

Parliament, I was approached to join the Government, and I requested that the Corrective Services 

be allocated to me, which was granted with the support of Henry Puna and Mark Brown.  My first 

step  in  the  position  was to  put  up  large  banners  with  the  words  "Respect,"  "Honour,"  and  "Be 

Humble," prominently displayed for all to see.  This was to encourage inmates to practice these 

</span><span>values, and similarly, extend the same practice to visitors entering the facility. 

</span></div><div><span>First and foremost, thank you to the government for their continued support, both in the past and 

present.  They have allowed me to carry out my duties as Minister without any interference.  Next, 

I would like to  thank my  children  (inmates) for  taking heed of my  guidance and accepting the 

counselling I have offered.  To all the different denominations across the country that have visited 

us, thank you.  Your visits have not gone unnoticed, and it is clearly evident that you genuinely 

care  about  our  inmates.    A  special  acknowledgement  goes  out  to  the  Assistant  Minister  John 

Andrew of Arorangi, who regularly visits every Sunday at 9.00 a.m. to deliver God's Message to 

our children (inmates).  Finally, to all the parents who comes over to visit their children (inmates) 

in prison; I always encourage them to read the Bible daily.  The Book of John 5:19, teaches us a 

valuable lesson on living our lives, while verse 39 urges us to study God's Word. Love is another 

principle  I  have  taught  our  children.    It  is  not  just  about  giving  love,  but  about  enduring  and 

continuing to love throughout our lives, as described in 1 Corinthians 13:4.  During my visits to 

the prison, I always emphasise the importance of God's Word and how it can provide comfort, 

hope,  and  guidance  to  inmates.    Lastly,  I  would  like  to  commend  the  Secretary  of  Correctives 

Services, Teokotai Joseph, and the Superintendent of Prison for their excellent work, which I do 

</span><span>not interfere with. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker and all of use in this House, on the appropriation for the Corrective Services I believe 

</span><span>this  is  reasonable.  But  when  we  examine  it  carefully  in  the  Budget  Book  we  will  see  the 

</span><span>appropriation  and  my  aim  is  for  it  to  be  increased.  May  be  this  can  be  achieved  through  the 

</span><span>upcoming Supplementary Budget. There is a reason why I wanted an increased and I will let you 

</span><span>people know about it. We cannot talk what has been allocated now as it has already been set. But 

in regards to the Supplementary Budget that should be coming in February next year I will make 

this request. Mr Speaker and to our people, the reason why I need this money is I always say this 

place is where earthquakes happen. When two or three inmate escapes from this place people gets

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>scared. They become careful with their properties and home surroundings. I was also responsible 

for doing that on twelve occasions and people were scared of me. But this time being a Minister 

since 2018 to today not a single inmate has attempted to escape from custody. What is the reason? 

It  is  the  proper  running  of  this  household.  The  Secretary  of  Corrective  Services  and  the 

Superintendent of Prison are doing a good job. So, Prime Minister I am requesting for more money 

so my staff can make new developments to the prison.  

</span></div><div><span>Allow me to bring to the attention of this House concerning a crucial matter that demands our 

immediate attention.  I would like to shed light on the increasing number of our children (inmates) 

with  mental  health  issues  that  are  being  detained  in  prisons.    Despite  the  best  efforts  of  our 

wardens, the quality-of-care needs improvement, thus prompting my request for more funding.  In 

light of the upcoming 60th anniversary of our self-governing status, it is crucial that we increase 

the pay of our staff.  This is essential to enable them to perform their work dutifully, safeguarding 

and nurturing our children (inmates) who are our future.  Additionally, I urge for an improvement 

in the living standards of the inmates, which include proper accommodations and nutritious meals, 

both of which are imperative for their well-being.   

</span></div><div><span>At home, we only have two slices of bread and a cup of tea for breakfast, and the same goes for 

our evening meal.  The only addition is a serving of corned beef or tin fish.  Hence, I appeal to the 

Honourable Prime Minister for additional funding to support the nourishment of our inmates and 

the  salaries  for  our  staff.    You  need  not  worry  about  pork  or  side  dishes.    The  primary  chefs 

responsible for these meals are Taripo and Tamarangi. 

</span></div><div><span>As for my second thought on this Vote Item, I have a request for the Honourable Prime Minister, 

and I will leave the decision up to him.  For the remainder of my term, which I will retire, until the 

next election, if possible, I would like to be given the responsibility of the Police Portfolio and to 

serve as their Minister.  I have observed a significant issue on our island where the youth are being 

disrespectful and defiant.  I am confident that I know the appropriate approach to handle them. 

</span></div><div><span>I have noticed that in other countries, such as New Zealand, there is only one Minister responsible 

</span><span>for both the Police and Corrective Services.  I am not challenging the Honourable Minister; this is 

</span><span>merely a request, and the decision lies with him.  I understand that the Prime Minister role will 

remain responsible for the Police, but I believe that I can make a difference in the attitude and 

</span><span>behaviour of our youth. 

</span></div><div><span>I have approximately four minutes remaining, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank 

</span><span>my  constituency  of  Tupapa/Maraerenga  and  all  the  people  who  reside  within  it.    To  all  of  my 

Portfolio  Ministries,  including  the  Ministry  of  Corrective  Services,  the  Ministry  of  Cultural 

Development, the House of Ariki, and the Punanga Nui Market, my regards and the love of Jesus 

to you all.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I would like to bring to your attention a proposal for our prison.  But 

before I do so, thank you to the Honourable Member Teokotai Herman.  I have been informed 

about his willingness to assist our prison, but I understand that funding is essential to materialise 

his efforts.  As I am aware, he aims to impart his knowledge on building aluminium boats to our 

inmates, which can potentially provide them with a valuable skill in building boats.  I support his 

proposal,  but  the  budget  for  this  endeavour  remains  the  primary  issue,  and  I  suggest  that  an 

allocation should be made for this purpose. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that these inmates are capable of building the first boat, which can serve as a testament 

to their newfound skill.  I initially planned to claim ownership of this boat, but I offer it to the 

Speaker as a token of our appreciation.  

</span></div><div><span>I will finish here Mr Speaker, and may God bless us all and I love you all, AMEN. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister, for your kindness and generosity.  I suggest 

that upon your retirement, you consider enrolling yourself at the Takamoa Theological College. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,804,287 for Corrective Services 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CROWN LAW (15 minutes). 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,250,790 for Crown Law 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open.  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; 

</span><span>you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, Honourable Prime 

Minister, your Cabinet Ministers, and all those on your side in the Name of our Lord.  Kia Orana 

also those on our side and our visitors in the Public Gallery.  Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker, and 

your staff, including our two Interpreters.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  to  share  my  thoughts  on  this  Vote  Item.    I  know  that  this  department  holds  a  crucial 

responsibility of drafting Bills before presenting them to Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>As we are aware, a few days ago, an issue arose where it did not go through the Crown Law Office.  

This  situation  highlights  the  shortage  of  lawyers  in  the  Crown  Law  Office,  which  may  have 

contributed to the problem.  The Solicitor General confirmed that there is a deficit of six positions 

in the Crown Law Office, meaning that there are not enough staff to carry out the task of drafting 

the Bills for Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>If we were to tally all the Bills that have been presented in Parliament, we would see that if the 

Crown Law Office were well-resourced, or if there were sufficient lawyers working there, more 

Bills could have been tabled.  It is pointless for us to convene in Parliament when there are no Bills 

to debate. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, the Solicitor General informed me that drafting Bills is not their only responsibility.  

They  are  also  tasked  with  offering  advice  to  various  Ministries  and  prosecuting  cases  in  the 

Criminal Court.  Additionally, they are responsible for several other duties.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, as everyone is aware, I presented a Member's Bill in this House.  Although 

it is a small Bill, it is imperative that we amend our Constitution so that no one struggles with any 

land cases filed in Court.  The Crown Law Office does not have the resources to handle such minor 

Bills, so it has become my responsibility to advocate for this cause 

</span></div><div><span>I  intend  to  present  another  Members'  Bill  in  the  upcoming  future  concerning  the  status  of 

companies.  Recently, the High Court uncovered an issue in one of the clauses of the Companies 

Act, which was enacted two years ago.  As a result, companies were given a certain period to re-

register; however, over two thousand companies were unable to do so in time.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, I have to interrupt you.  When we come back, you may 

continue.  Honourable Members, it is time for break and we shall continue when we return from 

</span><span>lunch.  Sitting is now suspended until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.31 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition, you may continue.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I am very c</span><span>onscious of the time and I don’t really 

wish to take up the Minister’s time but I think the point that I was trying to make with the Crown 

</span><span>Law is the lack of resource, the personnel in Crown Law Office. 

</span></div><div><span>I was talking about my efforts to introduce an Amendment to the Companies Act and that short 

amendment is to plug a loophole in the Companies Act and I know being on one of a Parliamentary 

</span><span>Committees that it’s really difficult for the Solicitor General to participate because of lack of time 

</span><span>and I note that for the 2004/0</span><span>5 there’s a one</span><span>-off personnel reduction of $200,000 and that to me is 

indicative of what we should be expecting out of the Crown Law Office in the next financial year. 

</span></div><div><span>I urge the Minister to look at this area because if we do not properly resource our Crown Law 

</span><span>Office, it has some consequences as far as legislation that’s going to be tabled in this House.  Thank 

</span><span>you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Tina Browne.  I call upon the Prime Minister, you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to acknowledge that this is one of many 

Ministries that we have where the area of remuneration and retention is a real challenge.  There is 

a challenge in trying to meet what can be considered a market price to pay for the services of a 

lawyer and lawyers today can command significant salaries. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact, I was advised that in our research on looking at appropriate remuneration levels, that in 

Australia  and  New  Zealand  the  starting  rate  for  lawyers  is  up  to  a  hundred,  hundred  and  fifty 

thousand dollars plus.  So, we have to look at this, if we want to retain the services of not just 

lawyers, but good quality lawyers especially our graduate lawyers that are coming through to give 

them the experience of working in a Crown Law Office, we need to start looking at remuneration 

package that will attract these lawyers.  

</span></div><div><span>And these high salaries, Mr Speaker is not just New Zealand and Australia, our local law firms are 

</span><span>now paying our local lawyers at these market rates.  So, certainly we are looking, working closely 

</span><span>with our Ministry of Finance and the Budget Team to see how we can accommodate these demands 

that are being put on us, not just from lawyers in the Crown Law Office, from our professionals 

</span><span>working in the offices like Foreign Affairs and down to the staff that we mentioned in the last days, 

</span><span>even in the Police Force where remuneration levels need to be increased. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I have taken note of the comments by the Leader of the Opposition, herself a very accomplished 

lawyer  to  maybe  send  a  message  to  her  colleagues  in  the  Legal  fraternity,  stop  poaching  our 

lawyers in Crown Law.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>This next week, Mr Speaker we will be launching our new set of laws that will be on line and free 

and available to the people and the public for the first time and one of the invited guests and people 

that have been involved in this programme and initially launched our Consolidated Law Books 

back in the 1990s and today we afforded him the honour of Honorary Permanent Residence of 

course is Dr Alex Frame. 

</span></div><div><span>Dr Alex Frame of course has been a very valued and loyal supporter of the Cook Islands in the 

work that he has done for us, particularly in the area of Constitutional Law.  He advised me last 

year that he will no longer be able to provide those services due to his advancing age and the need 

for him to take care of himself so as a result of that our Government thought it would be appropriate 

to afford him the honour and privilege of Honorary Permanent Residency and this was conferred 

on him this morning by His Excellency Sir Tom Marsters and his wife and we will all have an 

opportunity to meet him and say hello at the launch of our laws which will be on Monday morning.  

</span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,250,790 for Crown Law 

stands part of the Schedule

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,699,671 for Cultural Development 

</span><span>stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  As I may be the only speaker from our side of the House 

</span><span>today,  I  would  like  to  request  that  the  Minister  Responsible  for  the  Ministry  of  Cultural 

</span><span>Development stand and show support for this appropriation, and then resume his seat. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  support  the  proposed  appropriation  for  the  Ministry  of  Cultural  Development.  

</span><span>Additionally, I express my support for the allocation of $2.5 million for the Maire Nui celebration

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>next year.  This allocation will provide much-needed support and allow our people to join us in 

Rarotonga to celebrate this event.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  am  aware  that  the  Ministry  has  received  some  funding  under  ODA  to  aid  the 

Archives  and  Maori  language  functions.    An  amount  of  $40,000  has  been  granted  to  Cultural 

Heritage to support its operations, while $70,000 has been granted to the Archives. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to take this opportunity to comment on the allocation for the House of Ariki under 

the POBOC. Since 2018, their allocation has remained stagnant at $336,690, and this amount has 

not changed under the current POBOC allocation.   

</span></div><div><span>The House of Ariki submitted a draft for me to review, but I have reason to believe that it did not 

reach the Ministry of Cultural Development.  As we all know, the House of Ariki has been under 

</span><span>Parliament  but  has  since  been  moved  to  MFEM  and  is  now  with  the  Ministry  of  Cultural 

</span><span>Development. 

</span></div><div><span>My request to the Minister and the government is that we bring the House of Ariki to become self-

reliant  and  independent.    I  make  this  request  because  we  are  commemorating  the  200th 

Anniversary of the Gospel, and we celebrate because the Ui Ariki accepted the Gospel. 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  my  belief  that  agencies  should  have  control  over  their  respective  areas  of  responsibility.  

Hence, I suggest that we allow the House of Ariki to have the opportunity to bring together our 

traditional  leaders  from  the  Pa  Enua  and  support  their  customs.    Therefore,  my  request  to  the 

Minister  and  government  is  to  create  a  stand-alone  agency  for  the  House  of  Ariki  under  the 

Minister responsible for it. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose that we start an appropriation for this agency at $1 million.  This move will bring joy not 

only to our traditional leaders but also to other leaders under the leadership of the Ariki, including 

the newly invested Chief in Pukapuka.  I am confident that this suggestion will be welcome news 

for everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I fully support this allocation, and I urge that we move quickly to address this matter 

so that we can move onto other necessary vote items. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Teariki 

</span><span>Heather; you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to show my support to the appropriation for Culture 

</span><span>as  well  as  contribute  my  thoughts  to  its  proceedings.    I  appreciate  the  government's  effort  in 

preparing for next year's celebrations.  It is not just this Ministry, but other government ministries

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>are also involved.  I note the views from the Member from Matavera on the House of Ariki.  We 

all know that the House of Ariki was established in 2011 at Atupare, and in 2012, all traditional 

leaders were brought to Rarotonga for the inauguration of the House.  The House of Ariki has done 

an excellent  job  bringing together the Mataiapos and Ui Rangatiras and  recognising traditional 

titles and names that were previously unknown.  

</span></div><div><span>In 2011, an amendment was made to the Act to seat them alongside the Queen's Representative at 

the time, and we also amended the terms of service from three to four years.  The government has 

also allocated the first Friday of July every year as a public holiday to honour the traditional chiefs 

and has offered support in various affairs, including times of emergencies.  The office is located 

in Puaikura, with a Clerk and a couple of staff administering their affairs.  I am making a request 

to the Minister for the House of Ariki to consider providing a larger car for the Kaumaiti Nui, as 

the current electric car is too small for his leading role. 

</span></div><div><span>On another note, during our meeting with the Prime Minister earlier, I asked about a passenger 

and cargo vessel to bring our families and friends to celebrate our 60 years of self-government.  

Unfortunately, the former Head of Ministry, who is also the Member of Parliament for Titikaveka, 

and  I  could  not  reach  the  required  funds  to  cover  the  costs  of  bringing  our  people  to  the 

celebrations.  Nonetheless, we were successful in bringing people from the islands and celebrating 

our founding father, Sir Albert Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly,  I would like to draw attention to the challenges that people from  the north region face. 

During  my  time  as  a  Minister,  I  recognised  their  struggles  and  would  like  to  emphasise  the 

importance of supporting them. Particularly, I am making a request to the Ministry to support the 

northern group islanders as they are not often seen or heard from. Thank you, Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>In the past, there was a man named Turoa in Penrhyn who looked after a Pukapuka Dentist named 

Flash, as requested by the late Tini Ford.  The people of Penrhyn wanted a root canal, and the 

Dentist, who was more concerned with attending to their needs than getting paid for his services, 

treated everyone on the island, not just the Pukapuka people.  He worked late into the night, and 

</span><span>we departed the following day at noon after he had assured us that everyone, including Turoa, his 

</span><span>friend, who had five root canals, had been taken care of.  There were 44 patients from the two 

</span><span>villages of Omoka and Tetautua in Penrhyn who received root canals. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  aim  is  to  urge  the  government  to  review  airfares  and  boat  fares,  which  are 

</span><span>prohibitively  expensive,  so  that  people  can  come  for  medical  treatment.    When  they  arrive, 

</span><span>everything should be free to help support them.  The Honourable Member Sonny Williams is aware 

of the plans that were put in place to assist them.  While I have more to say, I will stop here. May 

God bless us all.

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for the opportunity to speak.  I would like to share 

some aspects regarding the Vote Item for the Ministry of Cultural Development and discuss the 

plans arranged for this Ministry and requests by the two Members. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  my  colleague  Emile  Kairua  and  his  performing  group  in 

Hawaii.  Emile has requested me to relay his message to everyone in this House and to everyone 

listening in.  He </span><span>wanted to clear the air regarding the news that they are struggling and don’t have 

</span><span>enough food, money, and that their situation is not good.  Emile said that this news is wrong and 

was printed on Hawaiian Newspapers.  I reviewed it carefully; it is basically the same news as 

printed here in the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I also want to share some insight on our recent trip to Hawaii, which I was initially hesitant to 

attend  due  to  my  responsibilities  here  in  the  Cook  Islands.    However,  I  went  along  and  saw 

everything; the performances and events were exceptional.  I was particularly proud to witness the 

Prime Minister's role in the opening ceremony and gifting of Cook Islands gifts to Hawaii.  Our 

Prime  Minister  gifted  Hawaii  with  a  kumete,  drum,  and  other  gifts.    Additionally,  the  Prime 

Minister also gifted a ukalele to Hawaii as a Tahitian (interpretation error) gift.  However, I can 

attest that the gifted ukalele was made by Riki Adamu from the Cook Islands, and not from Tahiti. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding  the  Vote  Item  for  the  Ministry  of  Cultural  Development,  criticism  arose  about  my 

unworthiness as the Minister for this Ministry.  However, I have not done anything wrong with 

this Ministry or any other Ministries that I oversee.  I recall an idol that was constructed on the 

main road in Tupapa, which I requested ICI to remove and reopen the road.  I also cut down two 

other idols attached to plain wood on the side of the road.  When I was given my office at the 

Ministry of Cultural Development, several wooden idols were present, which I destroyed in an act 

of removal from my life, which is based on God.  Indeed, some may perceive these as traditional 

artefacts.  However, as the Word of God says, "you shall not make for yourself a carved image-

</span><span>any likeness of anything that is in heaven, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water 

</span><span>under the earth" (Exodus 20:4).  I am also trying to identify and remove any remaining wooden or 

</span><span>traditional objects that remain, especially in this Honourable House, to ensure our faith remains in 

</span><span>our Lord Jesus Christ.  

</span></div><div><span>I am excited about the upcoming 60th anniversary of our country's self-governance celebration 

</span><span>next year.  I support the Prime Minister's announcement that the Cook Islands will be getting two 

boats in time for the constitutional celebration in August next year to prevent any funding loss in 

chartering boats to bring people from the northern and southern groups to Rarotonga.  However,

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>if these boats do not arrive before the scheduled date, we will then request for additional funds 

from the Supplementary to aid this Ministry's celebrations. 

</span></div><div><span>I also  request additional funding to increase the wages for the staff of the Ministry of Cultural 

Development for future budgets.  I am not demanding more funds, but rather requesting on behalf 

of my staff.  I hope the Prime Minister can adhere to our requests, especially for the Ministry of 

Cultural Development's significant future events.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  currently  in  communication  with  my  Secretary,  the  Head  of  Ministry,  and  his  Acting 

Secretary in the Cook Islands through our mobile phones regarding the Constitution celebration in 

August.  I would like to thank the government for their assistance in supporting our dance teams 

and other related events.  However, may I request that the participating teams prepare four or five 

items during the event to make it worth the financial expenditure? 

</span></div><div><span>Please note that the Choir and Imene Tuki are not mandatory in the competition, and participation 

is  voluntary.    To  be  recognised  in  the  competition,  teams  must  have  five  items  and  will  be 

remunerated accordingly.  Many of us are looking forward to the drum dance, action song, and 

Pee, along with the Choir and Ute to make up the five items.  Please note that Ute and Choir are 

separate categories. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to share that I am confident that a team from the Prison can participate in the Choir 

competition, subject to the law and regulations, and perform at the Auditorium.  The reason being, 

when I have heard them sing in the evenings, they have sounded wonderful.  

</span></div><div><span>When I compare their performance to that of the SDA choir, I cannot say that they are better as 

the Prison choir is equally talented.  My team wants to support our Maori traditions. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  believe  I  have  spoken  enough  for  now.    I  would  like  to  take  this 

opportunity  to  send  my  regards  to  the  team  still  in  Hawaii,  who  are  scheduled  to  return  next 

Saturday.  A special acknowledgement goes to Emile Kairua, the Secretary, and our team leaders 

</span><span>Mark Short and Jane.  I am look forward to your return and pray that God keeps you safe. 

</span></div><div><span>Upon your return, I would like to request that you put on a performance for the public and tourists 

</span><span>at Punanga Nui.  With that, I would like to conclude my remarks for the time being, and take a 

</span><span>break, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I will put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>699 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum $1,699,671 for Cultural Development 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>EDUCATION (40 minutes). 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,742,099 for Education 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.  Based on the current situation, it appears that 

there are only two of us speaking on behalf of this side.  Therefore, may I propose that each of us 

speak for 10 minutes, while the Minister of Education delivers an additional 10-minute speech, 

thus utilising the entirety of the allocated time for the Ministry of Education.  

</span></div><div><span>First and foremost, I am in full support of this allocation for the Ministry of Education.  The reason 

for  my  support,  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  this  year,  the  salaries  of  teachers  have  been  increased 

dramatically, and they will now receive remuneration equivalent to band H.  This increase amounts 

to over $400,000 and it is a sum deserving of recognition.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there will be a significant increase of $2.2 million in the salary banding during the 

period of 2026/27.  This is why I am strongly in favour of the allocation for Education. 

</span></div><div><span>However, I would like to request the Minister to consider an issue which I have raised in this House 

in  the  past,  the  inclusion  of  our  language  in  the  school  curriculum.    It  is  imperative  that  our 

language  is  nurtured  and  preserved,  and  I  believe  that  it  should  be  added  to  the  curriculum.  

</span><span>Furthermore, under the same curriculum, the various dialects of our island should be reinforced. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would like to beseech the Minister to strengthen the teaching of different dialects such 

</span><span>as Mauke, Mitiaro, and Atiu from grade 1 to grade 6 or even at the form 1 level.   

</span></div><div><span>In addition, I would like to emphasise the importance of strengthening the languages spoken in the 

</span><span>Northern Group islands and the Southern Group islands, such as Mangaia.  Personally, I find the 

Pukapuka language and Mangaia dialect very enjoyable.  However, I am not particularly concerned 

with the Aitutaki dialect as our children are proficient in speaking it.  I strongly believe that the 

educational curriculum must strengthen our focus on language preservation and development.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I am aware that funds have been allocated for this purpose, and that there are resources available 

under the ODA.  However, these funds are generally directed towards administrative purposes and 

other matters. As I have used up my allotted five minutes, I wish to reiterate my strong support for 

this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I want to congratulate the Minister of 

</span><span>Education for an improvement on last year’s Budget allocation, a big improvement by comparison 

</span><span>to  other  years.    Every  year  when  we  come  to  debate  the  Appropriation  Bill,  I  have  always 

complained about the level of the appropriated amount.  I have always argued for more money for 

education because we all know that education is the future for our children and this year is no 

different. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  first  cover  a  very  small  example  of  where  I  think  our  education  is  at.    I  understand  that 

recently Tereora Year 11 students sat literacy and numeracy exams.  I understand that you need to 

pass these exams in order for you move forward to finishing school.  The Minister can correct me 

if  I  am  wrong.    It  has  come  to  my  attention  that  Year  11  students  from  Tereora  College  have 

recently  taken  Literacy  and  Numeracy  exams.  It  is  my  understanding  that  these  exams  are  a 

prerequisite for progressing to complete secondary school. 

</span></div><div><span>The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but the information I have received indicates that out 

of 180 students who sat the Literacy and Numeracy exams, only 12 passed on their first attempt.  

This is deeply concerning.  While I understand that students can retake the exams, this low success 

rate  underscores  the  need  to  recruit  and  retain  highly  qualified  teachers  if  we  are  to  improve 

educational outcomes. 

</span></div><div><span>We have seen that an under-qualified teaching  workforce does not  produce the desired results. 

Moreover, our qualified teachers often seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere.  According to 

</span><span>my own investigation into the situation in New Zealand, primary teachers earn an average salary 

</span><span>of around $85,000 per year. 

</span></div><div><span>While the Minister's efforts to increase the salaries of existing teachers are commendable, we must 

</span><span>aim higher and strive to attract qualified educators by offering salaries that are competitive and 

</span><span>comparable to those elsewhere. This is crucial if we are to enhance the quality of education in our 

</span><span>country.  I  want  to  make  it  clear  that  I  do  not  intend  to  devalue  or  belittle  our  local  teachers.  

However, I do recall from my own school days at Tereora (which was many years ago) that the 

teaching  staff  largely  comprised  expatriates.  This  is  reflected  even  in  this  chamber,  where  few 

members attended school on the island.   

</span></div><div><span>701 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Minister, I would like to draw attention to what I perceive as a lack of pathways for students 

graduating from Tereora College.  As an employer myself, I have observed that young people who 

leave Tereora and enter the workforce require significant coaching, teaching, and training before 

they  are  fully  prepared  for  employment.    This  is  a  significant  hurdle  for  both  employers  and 

employees. 

</span></div><div><span>Moreover,  I  am  aware of other businesses that have provided  engineering scholarships to  their 

young employees to attend the Air New Zealand Institute for a two-year course.  However, when 

they applied for assistance from the Scholarship Committee, they were informed that no such help 

was available.  I am unsure if this was because the applicant was a local private employer, but I 

believe  we  must  remember  that  it  is  our  young  people  who  will  ultimately  benefit  from  these 

scholarships to secure better jobs in our country.   

</span></div><div><span>My third point, Mr Minister, is that I think it is a conflict of interest for the Ministry of Education 

to function as both the regulator and the operator.  By regulating and operating themselves, they 

are, in my opinion, facing an inherent conflict. 

</span></div><div><span>Moving on to my fourth and final comment, I understand that the Ministry of Education intends to 

create and implement a unique Cook Islands curriculum. However, I believe this approach could 

be flawed and may lead to a plan for teachers that is made by teachers. If we want to plan for the 

future, we cannot do so without taking into account the costs involved. We need to start with an 

additional $5 million for Education, which is necessary to hire the appropriate number of qualified 

teachers at decent pay scales. Based on the number of students we have, and the number of teachers 

we require, I estimate this cost to be about $18 million. These figures may sound alarming, but we 

must consider them if we wish to secure a brighter future for our country. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, I would like to offer my support for this allocation.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    I  see  the  Honourable 

Member Sonny Williams; you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and Members of this House.  Before I express my 

full support for this allocation, I would like to share some thoughts. 

</span></div><div><span>A few weeks ago, prior to the renovation of the Tupapa Outpatient facility, I was approached by 

</span><span>two  individuals  in  Titikaveka  who  informed  me  that  the  Tupapa  Outpatient  center  would  be 

</span><span>permanently closed and that the Titikaveka School was also at risk of closure.  When I inquired 

about the source of their information, they simply replied, "from the wind."  I took the time to 

explain to them that the Tupapa Outpatient center was temporarily closed in order to remove the 

asbestos roofing, which had already been completed at the MFEM building and was now underway

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>at Tupapa.  As for the Titikaveka School, I assured them that the government has no intentions of 

closing it. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am pleased to see that Education has been given a sufficient allocation.  On page 

108,  the  Organisation  Structure  shows  a  list  of  all  schools,  including  Titikaveka.    Therefore,  I 

would like to assure the people of Titikaveka that the news they received about the school's closure 

is fake.  Despite being told that the school will be closed this year, I am unable to identify the 

source of such information.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to extend a warm welcome and congratulations to the new principal of Titikaveka 

College, Mrs Raewyn Morgan.  My congratulations also go out to the Ministry and the Minister 

for selecting a dynamic and vibrant principal for the school.  Mrs Morgan has breathed new life 

into Titikaveka College, and I am grateful that the former principal, Papa Vai Unuka, has remained 

to assist her and to provide a local touch in the management of the College. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would also like to express my gratitude towards the Ministry of Education for raising 

the  profile  of  Reo  Maori  in  their  curriculum.    As  the  former  Head  of  the  Ministry  of  Cultural 

Development, I am proud to say that I introduced the Reo Maori Act to Parliament in 2003, which 

raised the status of the language to that of English as the official language of our country.  Prior to 

that, English was the only official language, and Reo Maori was considered our second language 

in  government  institutions,  agencies,  and  courts.    It  was  not  even  recognized  as  our  national 

language until the passing of the Reo Maori Act.  I must also acknowledge the late Jim Marurai, 

who was a former Minister for the Ministry of Education and provided strong support for the Act. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would like to express my gratitude towards the current Minister and the Ministry of 

Education  for  including  Reo  Maori  up  to  grade  6  in  the  school  curriculum  as  a  language  of 

instruction.  Thank you  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there is a critical shortage of accountants and bookkeepers in our country.  Ministries 

and businesses alike are facing a major challenge in finding experienced personnel to manage their 

</span><span>accounts.   Many businesses have resorted to  hiring accountants from the Philippines and other 

</span><span>countries.  Therefore, the renewed focus and emphasis on numeracy in our education system is 

</span><span>exactly what we need to address this issue. 

</span></div><div><span>Personally, I was fortunate enough to have had some excellent mathematics teachers during my 

</span><span>time at Tereora College.  As the Leader of the Opposition has mentioned, most of these teachers 

</span><span>were  expats  who excelled in  their field.   One such teacher was Papa Peter Etches,  and he  was 

exceptional in teaching mathematics.

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am greatly encouraged by the new educational direction being taken by the Ministry 

of Education and the positive impact it will have on our young students.  I wholeheartedly support 

this initiative and thank you for it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister Tingika Elikana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to share some remarks 

regarding this crucial Vote Item, with a particular perspective on the education of our students and 

teachers  in  the  Outer  Islands.    While  previous  speakers  have  painted  a  gloomy  picture  of  the 

education sector in our country, it is important to note that the situation is far worse in the Outer 

Islands.  As someone who has worked with students from Pukapuka and spoken with Outer Islands 

students, I can attest to the significant disparity between their education and that of students on 

Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Teachers in the Outer Islands have cited low salaries as a factor that hinders their motivation to 

provide high-quality education.  However, I am pleased to see an increase in their salary, and I 

expect this to lead to improvements in education standards.  With the new Secretary of the Ministry 

of Education, I have confidence that he will introduce new methods to deliver better education in 

the Outer Islands, including through the use of technology. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  hold  the  Minister  of  Education  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Ministry  accountable  for  their 

commitment  to  ensuring  quality  education  for  students  in  the  Outer  Islands.    Thank  you,  Mr 

Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Minister for the Ministry of Education; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff, including the 

Honourable  Members.    I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  our  Finance  Corporate  Director,  Ms 

Sanjinita Sunish.  She is also one of the so-called expats that the Leader of the Opposition was 

referring to.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise today to present the Education Budget and Business Plan for this year, reflecting 

our  commitment  to  perseverance  in  the  face  of  challenges.    This  budget  ensures  our  financial 

</span><span>support reaches all Cook Islands learners, from our 30 schools to vocational and tertiary providers, 

</span><span>while  prioritising  our  dedicated  teachers.    This  shows  the  continuous  commitment  for  this 

</span><span>government to invest in education and health.   

</span></div><div><span>Despite the constraints we face, this budget is fit for purpose, with significant investment where it 

</span><span>is needed most, a step towards improving the quality of education in our schools.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as raised by the Leader of the Opposition, we acknowledge that our teachers are not 

paid what they are worth, and while we have made progress in recent years, we still have a long 

way to go.  This budget honours the teacher remuneration adjustment commenced in September 

2021, with the fourth tranche valued at $410,000 rolling out from July 1</span><span>st</span><span> 2024.  Further improving 

the teacher as raised by the Membe</span><span>r of Parliament for Pukapuka, this further improves the teacher’s 

</span><span>salaries across the salary band.  Mr Speaker, since 2021, a total of $1.27 million has been allocated 

</span><span>to  adjust  teachers’  salaries,  and  we  will  continue  working  with  partner  agencies  to  ensu</span><span>re 

</span><span>sustainability in recognising teacher’s qualifications and years of service.  </span></div><div><span>Amongst salaries and many other things, this budget also provides: 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>sustained operating budget for schools; 

</span><span></span><span>sustained CAPEX budget for digital devices, IT integration; 

</span><span></span><span>property improvements to government schools, including those in the Pa Enua; 

</span><span></span><span>Investment in Starlink devices, in collaboration with Vodafone Cook Islands; 

</span><span></span><span>Extension of our Pa Enua Scholarship Grant, providing financial assistance and personal 

</span></div><div><span>support to eligible Pa Enua secondary student. 

</span></div><div><span>As we move forward, with the support of ADB, we have appointed a consultant to assist in drafting 

the new Education Masterplan, we are hoping that the consultation has been taken as far as even 

</span><span>sitting with the Opposition’s Off</span><span>ice.  So, Ms Sanjinita Sunish, please ensure that our consultants 

meet all the experts on the Opposition side.  Mr Speaker, this plan will focus on: 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Early Start Matters: Providing high-quality early childhood and primary education to lay a 

</span></div><div><span>strong foundation for future learning; 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Preserving  Our  Identity:  Honouring  our  rich  cultural  heritage  and  language,  instilling  a 

</span></div><div><span>deep sense of identity and pride in our children for future success; 

</span></div><div><span>These initiatives are in anticipation of what the Member of Parliament for Matavera was humbly 

</span><span>asking to be done.  This plan will encompass in promoting quality educators, ensuring skilled and 

</span><span>dedicated,  and  passionate  teachers  are  at  the  heart  of  our  education  system.    A  data-driven 

</span><span>Approach, utilising data-driven decision-making and continuous evaluation to meet the needs of 

students, communities, and our nation.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, while we face considerable pressure, we remain prudent with government expenditure 

</span><span>and  this  Education  Budget  is  no  exception.    This  government  and  this  Ministry  is  committed 

</span><span>persevering and investing in the future of our nation’s youth through </span><span>quality education.  With those 

comments, I support the Budget.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.

is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,742,099 for Education 

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>ENVIRONMENT (30 minutes). 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Members, may I request that we allocate the last 10 minutes for 

each  Minister  when  we  go  through  Vote  Items?    The  Floor  is  open  and  I  see  the  Honourable 

Member Vaitoti Tupa you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    When  I  finish  speaking  on  this  Appropriation,  the 

Minister for Environment will rise and support this Vote Item and we will progress. 

</span></div><div><span>I fully support this Appropriation and the proposed increase in the vote item for the current year.  

It is heartening to see that there is an allocation to support the Outer Islands and the officers who 

will be working in these areas.  I would like to request that these officers be employed on a full-

time basis rather than part-time. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  amount  of  money  that  has  been  allocated  to  the  Ministry  of  Environment  is 

significant.  They  have  been  granted  $50,000  for  the  current  year,  $350,000  for  next  year,  and 

$600,000 by 2026. 

</span></div><div><span>On page 189, we can see that this fund has been granted under ODA.  Mr Speaker, I would like to 

express my gratitude to the organisations that have generously donated such large sums of money 

to aid our country. 

</span></div><div><span>The  amount  granted  through  GF7  will  go  towards  supporting  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  the 

</span><span>Ministry of Infrastructure, and even the tourism sector.   A remarkable sum of $1.4 million has 

been  granted  this  year  alone.    Furthermore,  the  United  Nations  organisation  UNCCD  has  also 

</span><span>contributed towards our development </span><span>–</span><span> a fact that we can celebrate, especially given that we have

</span></div><div><span>I am proud to share that her employment contract with this organisation has been extended due to 

the remarkable work she has accomplished.  It is worth noting that the funding granted by this 

organisation exceeds $91,000.  

</span></div><div><span>ISP has also allocated a significant sum of $57,000 towards the development of our country, along 

with  the  $30,000  grant  for  the  NAGOIA  Protocol  Programme.    Additionally,  the  field  of 

biodiversity has received an impressive funding amounting to over $300,000. 

</span></div><div><span>In  our  endeavor  to  find  sustainable  ways  to  reduce  plastic  usage,  various  organisations  have 

pledged  over  $100,000  in  support  of  this  initiative.    These  funds  reflect  the  recognition  of  the 

efforts and support put forth by the Minister's office. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Minister and the staff for their unwavering dedication and 

hard work.  I support this allocation.
