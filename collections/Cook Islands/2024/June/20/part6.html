<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS</span></div><div><span>Today being Thursday, Question Time is usually for one hour.  However, due to the budget before 

the House, </span><span>the two leaders on the Opposition side have agreed to reduce todayâ€™s </span><span>Oral Question to 

30 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open for Question Time. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to ask a question to the Member from 

</span><span>Titikaveka that I didn't pose yesterday.  It concerns the proposed diversion of the road behind the 

</span><span>Sheraton Hotel, with the current main road being closed and a new road being constructed.  Can 

</span><span>the Member inform the House whether this proposal is still being considered?   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  rise  to  address  the  fact  that  the  question 

addressed to the Member from Titikaveka may not be relevant to their jurisdiction.  The project in 

question falls under the management of CIIC, and therefore, is not the responsibility of the Member 

from Titikaveka.  

</span></div><div><span>In response to that question, I would like to briefly state that over 10 years ago, an agreement was 

made  between  the  government  and  landowners  for  the  development  of  a  new  road  behind  the 

Sheraton Hotel.  This road would have encroached on the land of these landowners.  

</span></div><div><span>However,  in  the  present  discussions  regarding  this  development,  there  has  been  no  mention  of 

redirecting the road, and it is unlikely that any changes will occur in the foreseeable future.  It is 

good news for our community that we will continue to use the current roadway.  

</span></div><div><span>It  is  worth  noting  that  the  developer  of  this  project,  Chris  Vaile,  has  already  built  a  restaurant 

beside the main road, and it seems unlikely he would have done so if a new road was going to be 

constructed.  Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if this arrangement is satisfactory. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  I see the Leader of the United 

Party; the Floor is yours. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to us all in the Name of our Lord.  I had 

planned to pose a question to the Honourable Minister for Corrective Services regarding a new 

variety of bean seed.  However, I will redirect my query to the Minister responsible for CIIC.   

</span></div><div><span>Honorable  Minister,  I  apologise  in  advance  for  any  issues  regarding  protocol.    My  question 

pertains to concerns raised last year regarding the Rutaki foreshore passage.   

</span></div><div><span>For several years now, the tides have been causing severe erosion along the main road near Ian 

Beaton's residence and the Jehovah's Witness Church.  Unfortunately, the response from  ICI is 

that there is no budget allocated to address this issue.  It is well-known that there are no funds 

</span><span>available for this matter.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank  you to the  government for their dedicated efforts in the past  years, particularly with the 

</span><span>ongoing  renovations  of  the  Sheraton  Hotel,  including  the  Rutaki  School.    The  results  of  these 

</span><span>projects are truly impressive.   

</span></div><div><span>I  have  one  more  request,  which  concerns  the  Rutaki  passage.    My  question  and  request  are  as 

follows: Is it possible to acquire funding for the area, or alternatively, could you arrange for your 

staff to visit the location and observe the ongoing damage?  Thank you, Honourable Minister.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  for  Murienua  for  your  request.  

However,  I  must  remind  you  that  this  time  is  allotted  for  Oral  Questions  and  not  requests.  

Nonetheless,  I  can  confirm  that  the  area  you  mentioned  is  one  that  we  have  recently  assessed.  

While ICI was correct in stating that there is no budget for this matter, I approached CIIC regarding 

the cables that come onto dry land.  The CEO for CIIC acknowledged that their Ministry is the 

appropriate department to explore suitable rocks for the area's protection.  I believe CIIC will reach 

out to TNM Ltd. to obtain pricing information for these rocks. 

</span></div><div><span>That is my response to your request; not to your question, your request.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member 

for Matavera; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker, I had intended to address my question to the Minister for 

Corrective  Services.    However,  I  will  redirect  my  inquiry  to  the  Member  of  Parliament  from 

Aitutaki,  specifically  for  the  Vai-Vai-Tau  constituency.    I  understand  that  this  Member  was 

actively involved in the Aitutaki harbour project.  During my visit to Aitutaki for the Ureia village 

Christmas celebration last year, I witnessed him inspecting the project's progress.  Therefore, my 

question for the Honourable Member is about the current status of the harbor project.  According 

to the budget, certain tasks are required to be completed for this project.  I would like to know 

more about it.  Thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Member Tai Herman; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker, while this question should have been directed to the 

Minister responsible for CIIC, I will respond to it.  The Aitutaki harbour project falls under their 

jurisdiction,  and  it  began  approximately  two  years  ago.    As  per  the  budget  for  the  upcoming 

financial year, $1.2 million has been allocated for this project.  Recently, the CEO for CIIC was 

</span><span>summoned by the PAC committee, and the matter of the Aitutaki harbour was discussed during 

</span><span>the session.  There is considerable public concern about this project, and so we have asked the 

</span><span>CEO  for  CIIC  to  submit  a  comprehensive  report  to  PAC  regarding  its  status.    Therefore, 

</span><span>Honourable Member, we are currently awaiting their report.  Once we receive the report, it will be 

</span><span>presented in Parliament.  From our observations, the project is progressing satisfactorily, but only 

</span><span>time will reveal when it will be completed.  Thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Honourable Member Tetangi Matapo; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Kia Orana to everyone in the Name of our Lord.  Before I pose my question, 

I  would  like  to  thank  the  entire  Cook  Islands  community,  including  the  government,  Prime 

Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  the  Opposition,  Parliament  staff,  including  you,  Mr  Speaker,  the 

Churches,  and  everyone  else  in  the  country  and  overseas.    On  behalf  of  our  High  Chief 

Numangatini, thank you for all your efforts in relation to the Bicentennial celebration for Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank the Honourable Ministers and Members of Parliament for their visit to 

Mangaia.    All  those  who  visited  deserve  our  thanks  and  praise.    By  coming  and  experiencing 

everything,  you  have  observed  the  Mangaian  way  of  doing  things.    Once  again,  thank  you  for 

everything. Praise the Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>To the Minister responsible for ICI or CIIC, I have a question regarding the state of the roads in 

Mangaia.  During the recent visit of the Honourable Ministers and Members of Parliament to our 

</span><span>island, the Honourable Minister had announced his intention to work on the roads of Mangaia.  If 

</span><span>you were fortunate enough to travel by bus on our roads in Mangaia, then you are lucky indeed.  

However, if you travelled by bike, then your hair colour would have changed due to the poor road 

conditions. 

</span></div><div><span>My question concerns the budget allocation towards the roads in Mangaia.  Looking through the 

budget, I could not find any specific allocation for our roads, unlike the funding provided for the 

roads in Rarotonga.  Therefore, Honourable Minister, I am seeking information about when the 

roads in Mangaia will be considered and when the work on these roads will commence.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I apologise for my physical discomfort as my 

knees are sore from repeatedly standing up and sitting down.  Mr Speaker, I wish to address a 

situation that arose one month prior to the bicentennial celebration on Mangaia.  However, I must 

clarify that the request did not originate directly from the Member of Parliament, but rather from 

</span><span>the Mayor and EO of Mangaia.  They requested support to improve the road in Mangaia for the 

</span><span>celebration period.  However, I informed them that if they had waited just two days before the 

</span><span>celebration, we could have come and repaired the road. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as time was limited, only two individuals, Amara and Teina, were flown to Mangaia.  

</span><span>The CIIC had already provided support to the island to repair the crusher, which was a request 

</span><span>made by the EO of Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>At that particular time, the EO was instructed by CIIC to produce gravel as soon as the crusher 

was repaired to fix the roads on Mangaia.  However, when Amara and Teina travelled to the island, 

</span></div><div><span>687 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>there was an insufficient amount of crushed gravel.  Consequently, they were only able to repair 

the roads in the Oneroa area. 

</span></div><div><span>Mangaia was fortunate to have the assistance of these two individuals who were able to travel to 

the island and help fix the roads in Oneroa. 

</span></div><div><span>Members may recall that a few years ago, it was promised in this House that once the work in 

Mauke was completed, Mitiaro would be given priority to have their roads upgraded.  Following 

Mitiaro,  the  initiative  would  continue  to  upgrade  roads  in  Mangaia.    However,  due  to  the 

bicentennial celebrations, some work was undertaken to improve the road in Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, I would like to assure the Honourable Member for Tamarua that we will continue to follow 

the programme that has already been established.  There have been complaints from the Member 

</span><span>for  Mitiaro  about  Mitiaro  being  left  out  while  we  provided  road  upgrades  in  Mangaia.    In  the 

</span><span>meantime,  while  waiting  for  the  completion  of  the  Mitiaro  road  project,  I  urge  you  to  ask  the 

people in Mangaia to crush more gravel in preparation for the roadworks. 

</span></div><div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr  Speaker,  we  have  completed  extensive  preparation  work  for  the  200-year 

celebrations.  However, more aggregate needs to be crushed in preparation for the full road sealing 

in Mangaia, which will commence after the Mitiaro road project.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Although time is limited, I have a question for the Prime Minister.  In your 

address, you mentioned the shipping service for the Outer Islands.  My question is, how long will 

it take?  Is it one year?  This is just a question, but it may benefit those residing in the Northern 

Group who are listening. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you to the Member for Murienua for this question.  The new ship that 

we are expecting is being paid for by the Government of Japan.  We have given the specifications 

</span><span>that we require for this boat to carry passengers and cargo to the Pa Enua.  We have been shown a 

</span><span>boat recently and we found that this boat is too big for our needs.  We need to know that there are 

</span><span>specifications set that any length of ships, there are conditions imposed for the safety and number 

</span><span>of crew that is required to run the boat. 

</span></div><div><span>We have not accepted what they have shown us and we have requested that they look for another 

boat exactly what we require, the specifications that we have told them which is acceptable to us.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>At this time the Government of Japan is looking for a boat which will meet our requirements and 

they are really trying hard because they want to use the finance that they have set aside at this time 

to help us acquire a new boat. 

</span></div><div><span>During  the  month  of  July,  I  will  be  travelling  to  Japan  to  attend  the  meeting  between  the 

Government of Japan and the Leaders of the Heads of Pacific countries.  During that meeting, I 

am hopeful that the Japanese Government can give some confirmation that the boat will arrive to 

our shores before the end of this year. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the first boat that we are hoping to acquire </span><span>â€“</span><span> there are two ships expected and the second 

one through the Government of China but I will not speak on that but just talk about this one for 

now. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have come to the end of our Oral Question and I would like to thank 

you all for your contributions.  Before we proceed, I would like to welcome the senior staff from 

the Ministry of Cultural Development who are in attendance. Thank you for joining us.
