<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR. V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to ask a question to the Member from 

</span><span>Titikaveka that I didn't pose yesterday.  It concerns the proposed diversion of the road behind the 

</span><span>Sheraton Hotel, with the current main road being closed and a new road being constructed.  Can 

</span><span>the Member inform the House whether this proposal is still being considered?   

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; you have the Floor.
