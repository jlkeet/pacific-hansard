<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Kia Orana to everyone in the Name of our Lord.  Before I pose my question, 

I  would  like  to  thank  the  entire  Cook  Islands  community,  including  the  government,  Prime 

Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  the  Opposition,  Parliament  staff,  including  you,  Mr  Speaker,  the 

Churches,  and  everyone  else  in  the  country  and  overseas.    On  behalf  of  our  High  Chief 

Numangatini, thank you for all your efforts in relation to the Bicentennial celebration for Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank the Honourable Ministers and Members of Parliament for their visit to 

Mangaia.    All  those  who  visited  deserve  our  thanks  and  praise.    By  coming  and  experiencing 

everything,  you  have  observed  the  Mangaian  way  of  doing  things.    Once  again,  thank  you  for 

everything. Praise the Lord.  

</span></div>
<div><span>To the Minister responsible for ICI or CIIC, I have a question regarding the state of the roads in 

Mangaia.  During the recent visit of the Honourable Ministers and Members of Parliament to our 

</span><span>island, the Honourable Minister had announced his intention to work on the roads of Mangaia.  If 

</span><span>you were fortunate enough to travel by bus on our roads in Mangaia, then you are lucky indeed.  

However, if you travelled by bike, then your hair colour would have changed due to the poor road 

conditions. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question concerns the budget allocation towards the roads in Mangaia.  Looking through the 

budget, I could not find any specific allocation for our roads, unlike the funding provided for the 

roads in Rarotonga.  Therefore, Honourable Minister, I am seeking information about when the 

roads in Mangaia will be considered and when the work on these roads will commence.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I apologise for my physical discomfort as my 

knees are sore from repeatedly standing up and sitting down.  Mr Speaker, I wish to address a 

situation that arose one month prior to the bicentennial celebration on Mangaia.  However, I must 

clarify that the request did not originate directly from the Member of Parliament, but rather from 

</span><span>the Mayor and EO of Mangaia.  They requested support to improve the road in Mangaia for the 

</span><span>celebration period.  However, I informed them that if they had waited just two days before the 

</span><span>celebration, we could have come and repaired the road. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, as time was limited, only two individuals, Amara and Teina, were flown to Mangaia.  

</span><span>The CIIC had already provided support to the island to repair the crusher, which was a request 

</span><span>made by the EO of Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>At that particular time, the EO was instructed by CIIC to produce gravel as soon as the crusher 

was repaired to fix the roads on Mangaia.  However, when Amara and Teina travelled to the island,

</span></div>
<div><span>Thursday, 20 June 2024 

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>there was an insufficient amount of crushed gravel.  Consequently, they were only able to repair 

the roads in the Oneroa area. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mangaia was fortunate to have the assistance of these two individuals who were able to travel to 

the island and help fix the roads in Oneroa. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Members may recall that a few years ago, it was promised in this House that once the work in 

Mauke was completed, Mitiaro would be given priority to have their roads upgraded.  Following 

Mitiaro,  the  initiative  would  continue  to  upgrade  roads  in  Mangaia.    However,  due  to  the 

bicentennial celebrations, some work was undertaken to improve the road in Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Today, I would like to assure the Honourable Member for Tamarua that we will continue to follow 

the programme that has already been established.  There have been complaints from the Member 

</span><span>for  Mitiaro  about  Mitiaro  being  left  out  while  we  provided  road  upgrades  in  Mangaia.    In  the 

</span><span>meantime,  while  waiting  for  the  completion  of  the  Mitiaro  road  project,  I  urge  you  to  ask  the 

people in Mangaia to crush more gravel in preparation for the roadworks. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr  Speaker,  we  have  completed  extensive  preparation  work  for  the  200-year 

celebrations.  However, more aggregate needs to be crushed in preparation for the full road sealing 

in Mangaia, which will commence after the Mitiaro road project.  Thank you.
