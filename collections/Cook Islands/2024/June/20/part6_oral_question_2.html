<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  rise  to  address  the  fact  that  the  question 

addressed to the Member from Titikaveka may not be relevant to their jurisdiction.  The project in 

question falls under the management of CIIC, and therefore, is not the responsibility of the Member 

from Titikaveka.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In response to that question, I would like to briefly state that over 10 years ago, an agreement was 

made  between  the  government  and  landowners  for  the  development  of  a  new  road  behind  the 

Sheraton Hotel.  This road would have encroached on the land of these landowners.  

</span></div>
<div><span>However,  in  the  present  discussions  regarding  this  development,  there  has  been  no  mention  of 

redirecting the road, and it is unlikely that any changes will occur in the foreseeable future.  It is 

good news for our community that we will continue to use the current roadway.  

</span></div>
<div><span>It  is  worth  noting  that  the  developer  of  this  project,  Chris  Vaile,  has  already  built  a  restaurant 

beside the main road, and it seems unlikely he would have done so if a new road was going to be 

constructed.  Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if this arrangement is satisfactory. 

</span></div>
