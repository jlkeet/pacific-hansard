<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to us all in the Name of our Lord.  I had 

planned to pose a question to the Honourable Minister for Corrective Services regarding a new 

variety of bean seed.  However, I will redirect my query to the Minister responsible for CIIC.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Honorable  Minister,  I  apologise  in  advance  for  any  issues  regarding  protocol.    My  question 

pertains to concerns raised last year regarding the Rutaki foreshore passage.   

</span></div>
<div><span>For several years now, the tides have been causing severe erosion along the main road near Ian 

Beaton's residence and the Jehovah's Witness Church.  Unfortunately, the response from  ICI is 

that there is no budget allocated to address this issue.  It is well-known that there are no funds 

</span><span>available for this matter.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you to the  government for their dedicated efforts in the past  years, particularly with the 

</span><span>ongoing  renovations  of  the  Sheraton  Hotel,  including  the  Rutaki  School.    The  results  of  these 

</span><span>projects are truly impressive.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I  have  one  more  request,  which  concerns  the  Rutaki  passage.    My  question  and  request  are  as 

follows: Is it possible to acquire funding for the area, or alternatively, could you arrange for your 

staff to visit the location and observe the ongoing damage?  Thank you, Honourable Minister.
