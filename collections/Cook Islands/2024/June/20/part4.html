</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to all Members of this House on this 

new day.  

</span></div><div><span>I rise to mention the passing of Papa Tavita Katoa, who left us yesterday while performing the 

</span><span>breakfast blessing in Tamarua.  He was a member of the Pua Inano delegation visiting from New 

</span><span>Zealand to the Cook Islands.  Following his passing, his body got brought back to Rarotonga from 

</span><span>Mangaia  and is  currently  in the hospital morgue.   Today, his  remains will be returned to  New 

</span><span>Zealand.  In light of this loss, I would like to express our sincere condolences to his family, residing 

</span><span>both in the Cook Islands and New Zealand, as well as any other regions where his family may be 

</span><span>located.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you very much, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member 

Sonny Williams from Titikaveka; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and Honourable Members of this House, as well as 

all those in the Public Gallery, Kia Orana to you all today.  Kia Orana also to those who may be 

listening or watching from afar, including my electorate of Titikaveka.   

</span></div><div><span>First of all, I would like to express my deepest sympathies to the family who recently suffered a 

loss.  Mama Ngatokorua Nana Russell,  the 86-year-old  mother of my dear friend  Tua Russell, 

passed away last night.  

</span></div><div><span>Tua  and  his  family  would  like  to  thank  the  Minister  of  Health  and  the  dedicated  nurses  who 

provided round-the-clock care to Mama, as she had been bedridden for an extended period of time.  

Specifically, the family would like to thank Tuvaine Numanga, as well as Maria (a Fijian nurse) 

and Wata (a Pukapuka nurse) from the Ministry of Health for their compassionate service.  

</span></div><div><span>Additionally, Tua and his family would like to acknowledge the efforts of Rarotonga Home Health 

Care Services, a privately owned business.  Maui Daniels and Apii Mateariki, the owners of this 

organisation,  provided  exceptional  care  and  support  to  Mama  Ngatokorua  Russell  during  her 

illness.  The family would like to thank these individuals for their exceptional efforts for helping 

their loved one. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to commemorate the passing of several individuals 

from the Titikaveka community over the last few weeks.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, we mourn the loss of David Moeroa, who held the title of Puati Mataiapo.  We also mourn 

the loss of Papa Moe Tutira, a stalwart of the Titikaveka Ekalesia.  Additionally, Papa Toreariki 

Teao, elder brother to John Teao, has also passed away.  Finally, we offer our condolences for the 

loss of Siai Taylor, the beloved granddaughter of Aunty Pito Maeva.  

</span></div><div><span>To the families affected by these losses, please accept our deepest sympathies during this difficult 

time.  We also extend a special condolence to the family of Mama Ngatokorua Nana Russell, who 

passed away recently. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Deputy Prime Minister Albert Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>   Thank  you  Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to  all present  in  this  Honourable 

</span><span>House.  I rise to share the sad news of the passing of a cherished father figure to me and many 

</span><span>others, Matamaru Tongia.  To those who may not know him, he is the brother of Makiuti Tongia.  

</span></div><div><span>In his younger years, Matamaru was a talented rugby player, playing alongside my own father.  He 

</span><span>was also skilled in karate martial arts.   Eventually, he relocated to Christchurch, New Zealand, 

where he became an active and valued member of our local  Church.  Matamaru was originally

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>from Ruatonga and had an elder brother there, Tete Unuia, who was affectionately known as "the 

scientist."  It is worth noting that many prominent individuals with the title of scientist come from 

Ruatonga, including Doctor Teina Rongo.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Matamaru's family, as well as to our own family.  

His passing is deeply felt by all who knew him.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Seeing that there is no more announcement we will continue.
