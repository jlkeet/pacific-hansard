<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you to the Member for Murienua for this question.  The new ship that 

we are expecting is being paid for by the Government of Japan.  We have given the specifications 

</span><span>that we require for this boat to carry passengers and cargo to the Pa Enua.  We have been shown a 

</span><span>boat recently and we found that this boat is too big for our needs.  We need to know that there are 

</span><span>specifications set that any length of ships, there are conditions imposed for the safety and number 

</span><span>of crew that is required to run the boat. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We have not accepted what they have shown us and we have requested that they look for another 

boat exactly what we require, the specifications that we have told them which is acceptable to us.

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>At this time the Government of Japan is looking for a boat which will meet our requirements and 

they are really trying hard because they want to use the finance that they have set aside at this time 

to help us acquire a new boat. 

</span></div>
<div><span>During  the  month  of  July,  I  will  be  travelling  to  Japan  to  attend  the  meeting  between  the 

Government of Japan and the Leaders of the Heads of Pacific countries.  During that meeting, I 

am hopeful that the Japanese Government can give some confirmation that the boat will arrive to 

our shores before the end of this year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is the first boat that we are hoping to acquire </span><span>â€“</span><span> there are two ships expected and the second 

one through the Government of China but I will not speak on that but just talk about this one for 

now.
