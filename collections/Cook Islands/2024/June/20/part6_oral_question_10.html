<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker, while this question should have been directed to the 

Minister responsible for CIIC, I will respond to it.  The Aitutaki harbour project falls under their 

jurisdiction,  and  it  began  approximately  two  years  ago.    As  per  the  budget  for  the  upcoming 

financial year, $1.2 million has been allocated for this project.  Recently, the CEO for CIIC was 

</span><span>summoned by the PAC committee, and the matter of the Aitutaki harbour was discussed during 

</span><span>the session.  There is considerable public concern about this project, and so we have asked the 

</span><span>CEO  for  CIIC  to  submit  a  comprehensive  report  to  PAC  regarding  its  status.    Therefore, 

</span><span>Honourable Member, we are currently awaiting their report.  Once we receive the report, it will be 

</span><span>presented in Parliament.  From our observations, the project is progressing satisfactorily, but only 

</span><span>time will reveal when it will be completed.  Thank you.   

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Honourable Member Tetangi Matapo; you have the Floor.
