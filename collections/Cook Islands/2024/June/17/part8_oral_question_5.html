<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker, and my appreciation to the Minister for sharing details 

about the trip to Hawaii.  I have a Supplementary Question addressed to the Leader of the Nation.  

Based  on  the  assurance  I  received  from  the  Members  of  Ngatangiia  and  Titikaveka,  they  have 

volunteered to participate in the upcoming festival in the Cook Islands.  I strongly believe that, in 

2028,  the  festival  will  be  held  in  Noumea.    My  question  is  directed  to  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister to confirm whether it is true that the festival will be held in the Cook Islands in 2032, as 

two Members from Titikaveka and Ngatangiia are prepared to participate in the festival.
