<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill 2024/25.  I now open the Floor 

to Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill.  I see the Honourable 

Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, it appears that we will be discussing the Vote Items for the different 

Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion for the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Just to clarify the point now, we are speaking on 

the principles and merits of the Bill and the opportunity now for Members to speak freely on the 

</span><span>Budget  and  when  we  get  into  the  Committee  of  Supply  then  the  opportunity  to  individually 

</span><span>question the appropriations on Ministries? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  Honourable Sonny Williams; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Kia Orana Honourable Speaker and fellow Members of this Honourable 

</span><span>House.  Kia Orana to all our people residing in the North and Southern Group islands, as well as 

Rarotonga,  including  those  who  are  listening  to  our  debate  and  those  watching  from  afar  via 

livestream.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand today to voice two thoughts on this Bill and ultimately convey my support for 

it.  Firstly, I would like to discuss some comments made by the PAC Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>The PAC Committee reviewed the accounts and requested the Heads of Ministries to appear before 

the Committee to provide explanations and answer inquiries.  I am pleased to say that the Heads 

of the Ministries were very thorough in their responses, gaining us a better understanding of how 

the fund allocation was made.  Although we had some confusion about some fund allocations, the 

Committee  received  clarification  from  the  Heads  of  the  relevant  Ministries  and  clearer 

comprehension was achieved. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the report by PAC, the Honourable Member for Matavera mentioned that the Report 

lacked some information about  CIIC.    I  would like to  clarify that  the committee examined the 

Budget Appropriation for CIIC for the next financial year and not the Audited Accounts of the 

</span><span>CIIC for the previous year.  As such, if any questions were raised about any future programs or 

</span><span>projects, it may not have been included in the Report.  However, these issues will be covered in 

the next sitting of the PAC Committee, where we will be discussing the audited accounts of CIIC.   

</span></div><div><span>So, this Report covers the future, we will go back and look at the past in our next sitting of the 

PAC committee.  In any case the details of our discussions are contained in the Hansard records 

of the Committee and every Member is most welcomed to go through those Hansards and get the 

details of what was deliberated if they really want to know what took place. 

</span></div><div><span>In retrospect, PAC's report mainly covers future allocations and planning while specific details of 

our  discussions  are  covered  in  the  Hansard  records.    Any  member  who  wishes  to  review  our 

discussions can go through these records. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Leader  and  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition  seemed  to  imply  that  there  are  some 

shortcomings in the PAC Report.  It is essential to note that PAC's capacity and experience reduced 

significantly after the resignations of three Members and the resignation of the former Chairperson, 

following  the  Wellington  trip  where  seven  members  got  extra  upskilling  and  training  from 

</span><span>Wellington Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>This committee lost a lot of capacity, skills and experience within the PAC to review the budget.  

</span><span>We lost over 50 percent of the capacity of this committee just by what transpired in one or two 

</span><span>weeks from the resignations.   And then to  talk down of this committee in  the media  I think is 

</span><span>grossly unfair.  I think it is grossly unfair because we were left in the lurch but we carried on to 

</span><span>carry out our mandate under the Standing Orders of this Parliament.  It would be fair to say Mr 

Speaker we were very disappointed with these resignations because I felt we were a good group 

and we were professionals in our dealings. We followed the Standing Orders for elections as the 

Prime Minister alluded to before and we kind of miss their presence in our PAC meetings and miss 

</span></div><div><span>623 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>their robust contributions to our investigations and deliberations in our PAC committee.  It is not 

surprising that there are some shortcomings in the PAC report because we lost so much experience.   

</span></div><div><span>But  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  really  like  to  commend  the  Members  that  remained  on  this  PAC 

committee to carry out our job to review this budget appropriation.  Even though our committee is 

labelled as a joke in the media but we all know reviewing and examining the budget of this country 

is no joke.  The expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, taxpayers funding is no joke.  

</span></div><div><span>The biggest job of this PAC committee is to scrutinise expenditure or the budget proposals of the 

Ministries and Agencies put forward in this budget.  Not to vibe for positions who is Chairperson, 

who  is  Deputy  who  is  not?    That  is  not  the  main  job.    The  main  job  is  look  at  this  budget 

appropriation, look at audit reports, look at all sorts of things that is tabled in this House and put 

before PAC.  There is still dozens and dozens of report for this PAC committee to go through.  

</span><span>That is why I am very disappointed these Members have resigned because to me they relinquish 

</span><span>their  rights,  their  mandate  to  scrutinise  </span><span>governmentâ€™s</span><span>  expenditure.  They  have  shed  their 

responsibilities of holding government to account in the committee that really matters the most.  

</span></div><div><span>So, as the Prime Minister has said they have spat the dummy and resigned because they did not 

get the Chairmanship of this committee.  But in saying that Mr Speaker, I have full confidence in 

my nomination of the Honourable Tai Herman as the Chairperson of this committee.  I do believe 

he is going to do a good job so my plea to my fellow Ministers, Associate Ministers in Government 

if PAC comes and investigate your agencies, it is with the intention to ensure that expenditure of 

public funds is proper.  If there are deficiencies found out in these investigations, we will refer it 

to Audit and to come up with recommendations to strengthen all our Ministries in the expenditure 

and next step will be the Pa Enua.  

</span></div><div><span>So to the Chairman of the PAC committee thank you for your leadership in this hard times and 

your confidence in taking it on and the rest of the committee in progressing the work of PAC to 

produce its report in front of Parliament today.  And with that, I have every confidence in providing 

my full support to this budget before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to extend my gratitude to the Honourable 

</span><span>Member from Titikaveka, who is also a member of the PAC committee. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the allocation of funds to various agencies, I have no concerns and fully support the 

</span><span>allocation.  I believe all Members of the Opposition also support this allocation.  It is crucial to 

</span></div><div><span>624 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>note that the Leader of the Nation talked about the vision behind this appropriation and expressed 

the importance of providing what is best for the allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>During the previous allocation, the opposition worked alongside the government to explore ways 

in  which  we  could  enhance  government  spending,  including  supporting  officers  within  each 

agency.  I believe this was done in the best possible manner. 

</span></div><div><span>I also support the suggestions made by the Member of Titikaveka on ways to improve and support 

this system, as we are here to discuss the merits of this Bill and support all the allocation presented 

to the House.  Therefore, I have no reservations in supporting the merits of this appropriation and 

therefore pledge my support. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Tukaka Ama; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:   </span><span>I noticed that both Members from Takitumu had stood up so I therefore has to 

stand  up  as  well  speak  to  the  House.  Honourable  Speaker,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Member  of  this 

House,  greetings  to  you  and  I  also  extend  warm  greetings  to  those  watch  on  livestream  and 

listening by radio. Without delay a separate greeting to my people in Ngatangiia today. I would 

like to extend a special greeting to Papa Rau Nga who we celebrated his 80</span><span>th</span><span> birthday on Saturday. 

We know Papa Rau is a strong member in the Cook Islands Party, a rugby supporter in the village 

and hold the position of Assistant Pastor for the Ngatangiia Christian church. He is also a father 

figure to us in the village.  

</span></div><div><span>I know it was Papa Tupai who got Papa Rau from Tupapa to come and play rugby for Ngatangiia.  

Perhaps you may recall that in 1979, Papa Rau Nga and Papa Kiriau were prominent rugby players.  

As a player yourself during that time, Mr Speaker, you may know them and their skills on the field, 

especially when they start stepping on you.  Recently, the Honourable Member for Titikaveka and 

</span><span>I attended Rau Ngaâ€™s birthday celebration o</span><span>n behalf of the Government, where we conveyed our 

felicitations and good wishes to him.  During his speech that day, he ended up praising himself, 

</span><span>and I jokingly remarked that I had given him an envelope.  Although there was no money inside 

</span><span>it, I had included the phone number of two women. 

</span></div><div><span>I express my support for the Appropriation Bill.  In my opinion, it is vital to expedite its passage, 

</span><span>as we have important work to accomplish in our villages.  I want to reiterate the fact that our island 

</span><span>is a crucial contributor to tourism in the Cook Islands, and is consequently a primary source of 

</span><span>income for our country, including Rarotonga.  I believe that my constituency, specifically Muri in 

Ngatangiia,  is  also  a  significant  source  of  revenue.    It  is  for  this  reason  that  I  wholeheartedly 

support this Appropriation Bill.  As the saying goes, "there is never enough work, but money is 

essential."  I have proposed some projects for Ngatangiia, and I want to request for our community 

</span></div><div><span>625 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>policing to be reinstated.  This initiative was discarded a while ago, and I am uncertain whether it 

was due to budget constraints.  Regardless, I aim to renew this program and am pleased with the 

allocation increase for the police in this Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Over the past few days, there have been reports of young people driving recklessly on our road.  It 

is  noteworthy  that  our  road  in  Ngatangiia  is  currently  being  tar-sealed,  and  the  drive  will 

undoubtedly be much smoother.  As such, I propose to reintroduce our community police program 

as one of my initiatives. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I have had the opportunity to review some of the projects that ICI has proposed for my 

constituency; however, I have additional plans for ICI.  It is imperative to inform my constituents 

that my work is ongoing, as there is still unfinished business on our roads, specifically those that 

lead to the back road.  This matter has been included in the budget for roadwork plans by ICI.  

</span><span>Moreover,  I  have  also  allocated  funds  to  install  street  lights  along  the  back  road,  thereby 

</span><span>illuminating the small houses in the area.  The aim is to install street lights around the small houses 

since  we  have  observed  several  tourists  staying  in  bed  and  breakfast  accommodations  situated 

along these roads.  This initiative will greatly benefit families in my constituency by allowing them 

to earn an income by providing accommodations for tourists.  Hence, I felt it necessary to install 

street lights in the area.  

</span></div><div><span>I noticed that the Appropriation Bill has allocated specific funds for climate change initiatives, 

which aligns well with my plans.  Our beaches are a primary attraction for tourists, and I believe 

that  using  some  of  the  budget  to  improve  the  beach  areas  is  a  necessity.    Since  the  significant 

waves, no meaningful action has been taken, especially in the areas between Muri and Vaimaanga. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I give my full support for the Appropriation Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Member Tereapii Maki-Kavana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, thank you for this opportunity.  Kia Orana to all Members 

</span><span>of Parliament in this Honourable House.  If I may, I would like to take a moment to extend my 

</span><span>regards  to  my  constituency,  Aitutaki,  and  everyone  in  the  Cook  Islands  viewing  us  live  on 

Facebook.  Kia Orana to the Chief of my ARE-NIKAU constituency, Church Leaders, and the 

</span><span>Island Government in the Name of our Lord.  I also acknowledge our sports youth groups, the 

</span><span>President of the ARE-NIKAU Sports Association, and extend my regards to you all.  Furthermore, 

</span><span>Kia Orana to the hardworking women of my constituency and the men who work in our plantation 

</span><span>yards in the Mighty Name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>At this stage, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my regards to the island of Mangaia.  

I consider myself fortunate to have returned early, otherwise, I would have lost my Aitutaki dialect.

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to the Chief on the island of Mangaia and the Church Leaders on the island.  Thank you 

to the people of Mangaia for their hospitable nature, including their three Members of Parliament, 

who I notice are absent. I acknowledge that they might be busy since their island is full of visitors. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand before this Honourable House, representing my people of Aitutaki, to express our profound 

gratitude to the people of Mangaia for their exceptional hospitality and unwavering commitment 

towards our people from Day 1.  I have noticed a significant issue on this island that needs urgent 

attention.  The solution lies in everyone transitioning to the Cook Islands Party, wherein we can 

provide much-needed aid in the form of renovations and other beneficial projects for the people of 

Mangaia.  I urge you all not to remain passive, but to take action and join the Cook Islands Party. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my full support to the Appropriation Bill and its comprehensive content, from the 

first page to the last page.  The Committee deserves commendation for their excellent job, and I 

</span><span>extend my sincere gratitude to the Honourable Minister and his team for their meticulous review 

</span><span>of our country's budget.  Your diligent efforts are truly appreciated, and I understand that you will 

not rest until this Appropriation Bill is passed in this Honourable House.  Once again, thank you 

for your diligent work. 

</span></div><div><span>As I observe the Appropriation Bill, I notice that the allocation designated for my constituency is 

not quite in line with our aspirations.  However, we must accept what has been allocated to us.  It 

is true that the budgets in previous years have fallen short of our expectations.  Unfortunately, this 

is a reflection of the various requests made by other islands that compete for funding.  Resignedly, 

I would say </span><span>"Tauta, tauta, tauta"</span><span> - such is the nature of the situation. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to provide an update on the current status of the wharf in Aitutaki.  Despite the passage of 

time, work is still in progress.  Our Prime Minister has set a goal of holding the South Pacific Mini 

Games in the Cook Islands by 2029.  If so happens, we may get the opportunity to host some of 

the events in Aitutaki, which is ideal for activities like canoeing and sailing. 

</span></div><div><span>On our island, one of the critical issues we are currently facing is the state of our water system.  

</span><span>Fortunately, there is an allocation set aside to address this issue, and I am hopeful that in the first, 

</span><span>second, and third year, we will see improvements made. 

</span></div><div><span>However, Aitutaki is not the only island with this problem - practically every island in our country 

</span><span>is  grappling  with  water  scarcity.    Thankfully,  the  Aitutaki  Island  Government  has  granted 

</span><span>permission for ICI to address the issue now and in the long term. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I rise today, Mr Speaker, to give my support to this allocation presented to the House.  

</span><span>Additionally, I am glad we will be reviewing the minimum wages, but I believe it is essential to 

</span></div><div><span>627 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>focus not only on the minimum wage rate but also on those who are on the higher end of the scale.  

We must ensure they also receive a fair increase. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  a  friend  who  holds  a  senior  position,  and  yet  newly  employed  individuals'  salaries  are 

catching up with his - this is a prevalent issue.  I urge Ministers to examine our wage scales and 

ensure they are rated appropriately for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I give my full support for this appropriation, and I thank you for allowing me to speak 

on this matter. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Member Teokotai 

Herman; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker, Honourable Prime Minister, and all Members of this 

Honourable House, and to all those listening to the livestream of Parliament this afternoon.  My 

constituents have urged me not to waste time with pleasantries, so I will dive right in. 

</span></div><div><span>I am honoured to serve on the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), as are my colleagues.  This 

committee serves the House and the people of the Cook Islands, not any particular political party.  

Its  duties  and  responsibilities  are  governed  by  Standing  Orders,  and  those  appointed  to  the 

committee should take pride in these responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>The  PAC  is  the  sole  platform  in  Parliament  that  enables  individual  Members  to  engage  with 

government entities that spend public money.  It is not worthwhile to leave this body and criticise 

from the outside.  One cannot box in a boxing ring from outside the ropes - the same logic applies 

here. 

</span></div><div><span>At the beginning of this year, seven of us from the PAC took a trip to New Zealand to learn about 

the functions of the PAC Committee in the New Zealand Parliament.  We found that their system 

is  one that we should emulate, and we wished that  all members of PAC could  have seen what 

</span><span>happens in their Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>When we returned, the Committee discussed how we could adopt the system used in New Zealand.  

</span><span>The  main  issue  we  face  in  this  area  is  resource  constraints.    We  need  finance  to  enable  the 

</span><span>Committee to function effectively. 

</span></div><div><span>PAC is like a ship, and belongs to Parliament and the people of the Cook Islands.  It has seven 

crew members, who are selected from all parties in the House.  Unfortunately, three crew members 

are planning to leave the ship.  We have faced some challenges, as we have only four Members, 

</span></div><div><span>628 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>and we are all new to this Honourable House.  However, we know that we must deliver a PAC 

Report to Parliament at the end of the day. 

</span></div><div><span>Our only recommendation to Parliament in our most recent report was to pass the Budget.  There 

are  no  recommendations  to  look  into  individual  Ministries,  as  the  previous  PAC  Report  from 

2023/24 contains many outstanding recommendations that have not been addressed.  As a result, 

we  should  not  start  new  recommendations  until  we  address  the  previous  ones.    The  PAC  is 

authorised to look into all Ministries and Agencies utilising public money, not just scrutinise and 

review the Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>The PAC would like to caution agencies to be prudent in how they spend government money.  It 

is important to do a proper job in accordance with policy and law.  Throughout the year, the PAC 

will keep an eye on agencies that are not performing.  It is healthy for the government to monitor 

</span><span>entities that expend public money to ensure they work correctly. 

</span></div><div><span>As  the  Chairman  of  the  PAC,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  Members,  including  the 

Honourable Sonny Williams, Honourable Tehani Brown, and Honourable Stephen Matapo, as well 

as our advisors, the Director of Audit Desmond Wildin, the Clerk of Parliament, and all the staff 

who contributed to our Report.  All the allocations for various government entities and agencies 

are set before you, Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>As previously stated, I support the appropriation.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    The 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Initially, I had no intention of speaking 

on this matter, given the limited time we have to discuss the appropriation.  However, I believe it 

is crucial for us to express our thoughts on the Vote Items as we proceed.  Yet, I have noticed that 

some of the previous speakers have digressed from the subject at hand, and their opinions have 

</span><span>become irrelevant. 

</span></div><div><span>Although it is interesting to note that I am a fan of boxing and that my father was a boxer, it holds 

</span><span>no relevance to the purpose of this discussion.  Rather, what matters is our adherence to Article 70 

</span><span>of the Constitution.  If the Appropriation Bill aligns with Article 70, then we must pass it without 

</span><span>further ado. 

</span></div><div><span>The  theme  of  this  year's  budget  is  Perseverance.    We  face  the  daunting  task  of  making  tough 

</span><span>choices within the budget, which means that every allocation must be balanced among various 

sectors.  Additionally, we must remain mindful of the inflation rate, even as we discuss the budget.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I was dismayed by the comments made by the Member of Arutanga, Reureu, Nikaupara, implying 

that if Members from Mangaia joined the government, only Mangaia would be looked after.  Such 

remarks are unfair, particularly within these walls, as our duty is to help everybody in the Cook 

Islands, not just the members of CIP. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I will finish here and I look forward to debating the allocations in the budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Now, I see the Honourable Member Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In line with what the Leader of the Democratic 

Party previously stated, I had no intention of speaking on the matter relating to the Report from 

the PAC committee.  However, I wanted to emphasise that it is vital for us to bear in mind the 

</span><span>interests of the people of this nation when making decisions that affect them.  It is regrettable that 

</span><span>this  has  become  an  issue  in  the  way  we  operate  our  parliamentary  system.    Nonetheless,  the 

statements made by Members of the committee have spurred me to speak out. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to commend the committee for its efforts and for the significant benefit they have 

brought to our Parliament and the people of this country. I wish to address the comments made by 

the Prime Minister regarding us being outnumbered.  It appears as though those in power believe 

they are solely responsible for governing our country and that we, as Members of Parliament, are 

merely numbers without significance.  When considering the situation, it is notable that regardless 

of  being  an  Independent  upon  entering  Parliament,  all  Members  are  now  Cook  Islands  Party 

Members working under the same umbrella. 

</span></div><div><span>The Chairman of the PAC committee has provided us with an account of their accomplishments 

and has expressed his gratitude and regard for the PAC committee members. However, the manner 

in which the information was presented to this House seems to imply that we are immature, as if 

we are like children in this House.  I implore all Members to behave in a manner befitting of the 

leaders we are, rather than indulging in childish behavior. There is no use in crying over spilt milk.  

</span><span>We must respect all political parties represented in this House, and must not allow anyone to feel 

</span><span>undervalued.  It is our responsibility to work together to develop our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>I was delighted this afternoon when informed by the Clerk and Deputy Clerk that this week would 

</span><span>be dedicated to discussing the Appropriation Bill proposed by the government for our nation.  I 

</span><span>am grateful to the government for presenting us with this opportunity, as there are certain matters 

</span><span>we wish to address.  It must be noted that we will support the Budget wholeheartedly. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am pleased to declare that Members of the Cook Islands United Party supports the 

PAC Report.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister Mokoroa; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:   </span><span>Thank  you Mr Speaker, good afternoon to  you  and  your staff in  this 

Honourable House.  Kia Orana to our Prime Minister and the Members within the Government 

side.  Kia Orana to the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the United Party and Kia Orana 

to our people listening in this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, Kia Orana also to our Chaplain that did our Service this afternoon.  If we had listened 

carefully to his theme this afternoon, he mentioned two things </span><span>â€“</span><span> the first thing he said is, step in 

the right direction and secondly to follow the process.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our Budget as highlighted by the Prime Minister is about perseverance and as heard 

by the Leader of the Opposition, she was mentioning the challenges that we are going through in 

this Budget and hence the reason the Prime Minister has labelled this Budget  as the Budget of 

perseverance because we know that challenges are inevitable. 

</span></div><div><span>We have known that we have come through a lot of lows and highs in the past couple of years and 

the period of COVID has caused us such hardship in the past couple of years. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would also like to thank the Budget Committee who have led the drafting of this 

</span><span>Budget Book before us.  I would also like to thank all the Heads of Ministries and the CEOâ€™s who 

</span><span>were involved in putting together their business plan. 

</span></div><div><span>As the Chairman of the PAC has mentioned, the PAC Members are worried about the misspending 

or the overspending of their Budget.  I think like all of us within this House, all we want is that the 

work or the Budget appropriated to each Ministry, that the work is delivered properly </span><span>â€“</span><span> that we 

will see hot mix road like what we see in Ngatangiia and we would like to see this road maintenance 

or road programmes carried on and it does not happen only here in Rarotonga but also in the outer 

islands as well and I am hoping that the road of Mitiaro will be sealed sometime in the near future. 

</span></div><div><span>We are hearing the go</span><span>od work thatâ€™s been carried out by To Tatou Vai and we have been hearing 

</span><span>some good comments from people who are living up the hill who are getting good supply of water 

</span><span>â€“</span><span> whereas in the past they have not been getting water for about 30 years. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, we are hearing  water meters being placed starting in  Nikao.  We are the last village to 

</span><span>receive water from the intakes of Ngatangiia and we all know that when drought hits, both Nikao 

and Ruaau will be the first constituencies to be affected by drought.  So, the meters that have been 

installed has shown one particular house that is using 22,000 litres of water a day when the rest of 

the 169 houses are only using 900 litres of water a day.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So, these houses who are using 22,000 litres of water a day is the kind of houses that needs to be 

stopped by To Tatou Vai for wasting water.  So, we are thankful of To Tatou Vai putting in these 

meters because it shows that there are a lot of people in Nikao who are wasting a lot of good water 

that is supplied all the way from Ngatangiia. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am hoping that the water project is not only improved for us here in Rarotonga but 

as well as in the outer islands as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there are so many things that we want our government to deliver and I would like to 

thank the Ministry of Finance who has given good sound advice right across all Ministries and 

who has given guidance to our Prime Minister who is Minister of Finance despite the fact that we 

are limited in delivering all these visions or priorities for our people, we can only persevere if we 

all work together. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for leading this Budget for this financial 

year.  I would like to support this Budget.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister and thank you Honourable Members.  We have 

come to the end of our Sitting for today.  Parliament will now adjourn until tomorrow, Tuesday, 

18 June 2024 at 1 p.m.  May I ask an Honourable Member to say our Closing Prayer?
