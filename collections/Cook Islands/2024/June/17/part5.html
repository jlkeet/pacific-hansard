</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to inform you of a bereavement notice regarding 

the sudden passing of Papa Tapi Taio. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Speaker.    If  possible,  may  you  please  include  Papa 

Paranapa Ben's obituary notice to the list?  He has recently passed away. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I also see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you.  Kia Orana to everyone in this Honourable House.  I do not have 

any obituary notices to announce.  Instead, I would like to convey an apology from the Honourable 

Deputy Prime Minister, who is suffering from an ear infection that may have caused hearing loss 

in one of his ears.  Nonetheless, he intends to join us for the session later today. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The Honourable Leader of the Opposition? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, please include in our obituary notices one of our 

Papa from Rakahanga, Papa Temu Hagai.  It is with great sadness to inform you that his body will 

be arriving in Rarotonga tomorrow and will be transported to Rakahanga on the barge this coming 

Saturday. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you everyone.  I see the Honourable Tim Varu.   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of a great man 

and supporter from my Constituency, Iro Rangi.  Last Saturday, we laid him to rest. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you all.  I strongly believe that adopting a procedure where each Member 

</span><span>can rise and share news of bereavements in their respective constituency is proper and necessary, 

</span><span>as I may not be aware of some particular loss.  I appreciate everyone's contribution towards this. 

Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>We will continue with the Presentation of Reports and I now call on the Chairperson of the Public 

</span><span>Accounts Committee, the Honourable Tai Herman to present the Public Accounts Committee</span><span>â€™s</span><span>Report on the review of the Appropriation Bill 2024/25.
