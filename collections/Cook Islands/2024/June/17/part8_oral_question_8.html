<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  In regards to this question about hosting 

</span><span>the Cultural Arts Festival for 2032, yes, our application has been submitted to the Committee for 

</span><span>the Pacific of Arts.  At the Ministerial meeting that was held just prior to the Pacific Festival (Pac-

</span><span>Fes) in Hawaii, the Minister and the Head of Ministry put forward our application to host Pacific 

Festival for 2032, and I believe that it is one of two applications that will be considered.  It will be 

favourable to the Cook Islands to host this event because it will be 40 years exactly since the last

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>time we hosted in 1992.  We are hopeful that the Committee will make a decision on that this year, 

so that gives us close to eight years to prepare.   

</span></div>
<div><span>This proposal of involving the Member for Titikaveka and Ngatangiia into our group, no!  When 

that time comes, their warrants would have expired.  Their names will be added into the group, but 

it will not be them, it will be their children.  We look forward to that.  Mr Speaker, I might just 

add that on the back is also an application we have put for the Pacific Council to host the Mini 

Games  for  2029.    These  are  important  regional  events  because  it  helps  us  to  also  upgrade  and 

refurbish  our  own  infrastructure  to  be  prepared  to  host  these  events.    So,  while  we  will  be 

upgrading  our  schools,  our  infrastructure,  our  venues  for  the  Pacific  Mini  Games,  if  we  are 

successful with the host for 2029, it will lead in nicely to the hosting of the Pacific Arts and Festival 

in 2032. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to add Mr Speaker that my own words of a very proud leader of our country, our 

team  that  represented  us  in  Hawaii,  did  our  country  very  proud.    Not  only  their  cultural 

performances  were  outstanding,  their  costumes  were  just  absolutely  stunning  to  see,  but  the 

conduct of our team as well were something to behold with our young people.  As I said in my 

opening  statement,  this  was  the  flower  of  a  generation  that  we  took  to  Hawaii  and  they  really 

bloomed over there.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  the  youthful  leaders  that  took  this  team,  responsible  for  the 

choreography of the dancing, the drumming led by Mark Short and Jane Rupena.  What we saw 

</span><span>Mr Speaker was original compositions, original drumming, not that I’m an expert, and absolutely 

</span><span>stunning uniforms led by their costume designer, Mareta Angene.  It is right that we recognise 

these new composers, up and  coming leaders of our culture into this  new century.  We  are no 

longer in the 1990s, 1980s, we are in the 2020s and so what they showed us is their version of 

what our culture is today.  It showed through the enthusiasm, the energy, the passion of our young 

dancers  and  performers  in  the  way  that  they  performed.    It  was  a  truly,  a  really  remarkable 

performances that they had throughout the week in Hawaii.  We have a unique approach, at times 

we do not make requests, but our team managed to get there.  We had the dinner hosted by the 

</span><span>Governor of the State, the programme is set, Secret Service at the front door vetting everybody 

</span><span>that comes in, and then when our team arrived, they could not control them, they got on stage and 

</span><span>then drumming started.  So, the Governor said, well it is so good that he is coming to Rarotonga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wanted  to  acknowledge  the  60  odd  group  of  supporters  and  trades  people  that  also 

</span><span>accompanied the team who paid their own way to go to Hawaii.  These were the people who trade 

</span><span>in the pearls, the market vendors, the TAVS designers, and a whole range of our own business 

people here, who accompanied our team and used the PACfest an opportunity to showcase their 

products as well.  I was really pleased to see our master carver Papa Mike Tavioni and his Mrs, 

who were staying in the same hotel as us, enjoying their time in Hawaii.  I had a couple of occasions

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>to have a morning coffee with Papa Mike and he was telling me that it has been a while since he 

has been back to Hawaii, but he was able to visit some of his old friends, some of the places like 

the Bishop Institute to just share ideas with young cultural carvers in these areas.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to acknowledge during the event Mr Speaker, very important occasion we had 

which was the signing of our sister-city relationship between Rarotonga and Honolulu.  Last year, 

</span><span>when I attended the White House, the US President and Pacific Island Leaders’ Summit, one of 

</span><span>the outcomes was the US wanting to establish Sister City relationships with the American cities 

and towns and islands in the Pacific.  So, we were very pleased Mr Speaker to have a sister-city 

signing and with the city of Honolulu.  I cannot think a better city for us to sign up with as a part 

of the United States, because we have a very closed traditional links to Hawaii.  Hawaii of course 

is  the  northern  most  of  the  Polynesian  triangle,  and  one  of  the  islands  in  the  great  voyages  of 

discovery by our Polynesian navigators, and the Hawaiian language Mr Speaker when they were 

</span><span>speaking it, it was very similar to our language as well.  The Sister City relationship is going to 

</span><span>open again and re-engage our relationship with the likes of </span><span>Kamehameha Schools, </span><span>with the likes 

of University of Hawaii, and also strengthen the existing relationships that we have had with their 

BYU, Bringing Young University.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I  know  the  International  Sister  City  organisation  is  very  keep  to  support  exchanges  of  people, 

particularly young people between Hawaii and Rarotonga.  And I know that some of our vendors 

who attended the PACFest will now look at this particular destination as a market for some of their 

products that they are selling.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, there are plenty of opportunities that has now opened up with this Sister City relationship that 

we have developed and now with the one-year anniversary of the Hawaiian Airlines flight flying 

direct to Hawaii, a six hour flight, it makes our connection so much easier. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I look forward, Mr Speaker to these new relationships that we will develop as a result of our 

Sister  City  relationship  to  benefit  our  people,  our  community  where  we  can  seize  on  the 

opportunities provided by some of our counterparts in Hawaii.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, fingers crossed, we wait for the outcome of the Pacific Arts Council meeting that we may be 

the successful host in 2032 for the Pacific Arts Festival.  Thank you.
