<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Cultural Development.  He, along 

with the Prime Minister, led the Cook Islands delegation to Hawaii.  Upon reviewing the delegation 

list, I found my name on it initially, but it turned out to be my son with the same name who was 

travelling.  I would like to inquire about our position regarding the delegations that travelled with 

the team,  including the carvers, and request  the Minister of Culture to share information  about 

what took place.
