<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Leader of the House.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member, Sonny Williams 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the Motion be agreed to 

</span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div>
<div><span>Members can now speak to the Motion as they wish and I now open the Floor to speakers.  I see 

the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the PAC Committee's 

Report  concerning  the  Government  Ministries'  allocations,  and  to  thank  those  who  have  been 

involved in its preparation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of two Officials who played an instrumental 

role in  drafting this Report.   The Clerk of this  House and Desmond, the Advisor to  the Public 

</span><span>Accounts Committee, have collaborated diligently to compile this Report that has been presented 

</span><span>to Parliament for discussion. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I do not have any problem concerning the presented Report.  However, I do recognise 

</span><span>that certain components are lacking, which is not the responsibility of the Clerk of this House or 

</span><span>the Director of Audit to present. 

</span></div>
<div><span>During my time on the Committee, several faults were discovered in the operations of the Cook 

</span><span>Islands  Investment  Corporation.    Despite  complaints  reported  in  the  newspaper,  there  is  no 

explanation acknowledging those faults in this particular Report.

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  the  Police  Department  is  another  area  not  appropriately  incorporated  in  the  present 

report.  A portion of the police investigation findings has not been included.  Given the importance 

of these two areas, both the government and the Opposition side should be adequately informed. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I recall, during the Honourable Minister of Pukapuka's term as the Committee Chair, he used to 

send me a copy of the report to review before finalisation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I wish to  emphasise that my  remarks are directed towards what  has NOT been included in  the 

Report, rather than what is already mentioned.  I appreciate the Clerk of the House and the Director 

of Audit for their efforts in preparing this document. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  I request  the  new Committee to  examine carefully what  has been missing from  this 

Report.    Although  I  am  aware  of  what  they  are,  I  will  not  disclose  that  information  presently.  

</span><span>Nonetheless,  I  extend  my  support  and  appreciation  to  the  PAC Committee  for  presenting  their 

</span><span>Report. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Leader of the Opposition; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  again,  Mr  Speaker.    Before  I  commence  my 

discussion on the Report, I would like to offer my congratulations to the people of Mangaia for 

their  commendable  efforts.    I  am  not  sure  if  the  radio  is  working  in  Mangaia  but  in  case  this 

broadcast  does  not  reach  Mangaia,  then  perhaps  Mr  Speaker  you  can  send  a  message  to 

congratulate  them  on  their  outstanding  work  undertaken  on  Saturday.    The  event  was  well-

organised and attended  by several  individuals from  overseas and the  Outer  Islands, despite the 

rainfall. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Honorable Minister Tingika and I could not declare the size of our donation because it was 

significantly less than the Airport Authority's.  Therefore, I request  you, Mr Speaker, to send a 

letter conveying our appreciation to the people of Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In reference to our standing orders, I have a few thoughts on the Report, which I will share during 

the allocation debate.  When we look at Standing Order 213, it states that: 

</span></div>
<div><span>“When the Appropriation Bill has completed its Second Reading, Parliament is then</span><span> adjourned 

</span><span>for up to 14 days and the Estimates stand referred to the Public Accounts Committee...”</span></div>
<div><span>And then it says that:

</span></div>
<div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>“A maximum of 10 days is allocated for consideration by the Public Accounts Committee which 

</span><span>must report to Parliament on its examination of the Estimates as soon as possible or within 14 

</span><span>days of the referral.”</span></div>
<div><span>There are two issues here, Mr Speaker.  The Second Reading was completed on the 15</span><span>th</span><span> of May.  

The  Report  has  been  filed  today  well  after  the  Standing  Order  213.    Even  Parliament,  the 

Appropriation Bill, according to the Standing Order was supposed to be adjourned for no more 

than 14 days.  And the reason that I raised this Mr Speaker is because I understand that we do want 

to comply with the Standing Orders and particularly with the Public Accounts Committee.  We try 

and insist on Ministries to try and comply with the date requirements for filing reports.   So Mr 

Speaker, I want some discussions on this so we can move forward and know what we can do and 

what we cannot do.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister Mark 

Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Aloha to everyone in the House.  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have looked at 

the Report by the Public Accounts Committee and  I noticed three Members of this Committee 

have  resigned.    And  there  seems  to  be  some  misrepresentation  in  the  media  about  why  these 

Members from the Opposition resigned their positions in the PAC committee.  Apparently, there 

is  a  feeling  that  the  Chairperson  of  PAC  should  be  from  the  Opposition  side.    That  is  not  a 

requirement under the Standing Orders nor is it a convention in other Parliaments around the world.   

</span></div>
<div><span>For  the  benefit  of  our  people  who  are  listening  in,  our  previous  Chairperson  for  the  Public 

Accounts Committee, the Honourable Member for Pukapuka and Nassau Tingika Elikana, was 

appointed to a Minister of the Crown, thereby leading to step down from his role on the committee.  

And the membership of the PAC committee comprises of four Members from the Government 

side and three Members from the Opposition side.  So, the Government side met to decide which 

of  our  Members  would  replace  the  Honourable  Minister  on  the  committee.    And  after  careful 

consideration Mr Speaker, we looked at our Government side and selected one of the Independent 

</span><span>Members on Government side to fill the role on the Public Accounts Committee.   So, we have 

</span><span>three  Cook  Islands  Party  Members,  one  Independent  Member,  one  United  Cook  Islands  Party 

</span><span>Member and two Democratic Party Members.  And if you look at the composition of the House, 

</span><span>Mr Speaker there is 16 Members of the Government side over here and I count my good friend 

</span><span>from  the  United  Cook  Islands  because  he  is  sitting  on  the  Government  side  and  there  are  five 

</span><span>members of the Democratic Party, but they have two members on the PAC committee.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I say their representation on the PAC is over and above their representation here in the House.  

</span><span>That is right, in fact I have to correct myself on the Government side, there are two Cook Islands 

Party Members and two Independent Members made up of the Member for Mauke and the Member

<div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>for Tengatangi, Areora, Ngatiarua.  And as we were replacing not just the Member but also the 

Chairperson of the PAC Committee, a new Chairperson needed to be elected and under Standing 

Orders 121, the Election of a Chairperson of a Committee, this was undertaken and the committee 

nominated and elected the Member for Vaipae, Vaipeka, Tautu the Honourable Tai Herman as the 

Chairperson for the PAC committee.   

</span></div>
<div><span>We  saw  this  Mr  Speaker  as  a  great  opportunity  to  engage  particularly  our  new  Members  of 

Parliament  into  senior  parliamentary  roles.    An  opportunity  to  celebrate  Mr  Speaker  the  new 

Chairperson of this important committee but instead, it created a lot of upset from the Opposition 

Members.  They got so upset Mr Speaker that spat the dummy and they walked out and resigned 

from the Public Accounts Committee. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker! 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Misleading statement.  Now that the Prime Minister has opened 

up  that  can  of  worms,  I  want  to  correct  those  misleading  statements.    The  first  thing  he  made 

reference to is the resignation of the Chairperson.  

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Point of Order! 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:   </span><span>Mr Speaker,  I am  talking to the  Report.  The Honourable  Leader of the 

Opposition  will  have  an  opportunity  to  rebut  my  statements  when  the  time  comes  rather  than 

interrupting my flow of thought that is going really well.  

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span> I do want to apologise to the Prime Minister for the interruption 

of his train of thoughts but our Standing Orders clearly gives us a reason to raise a Point of Order 

</span><span>and in this case, misleading statements.  And I want to correct those misleading statements while 

</span><span>it is still fresh in the ears of our people because the statement is misleading right from when he 

</span><span>started with the resignation of the Minister.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, can you highlight on your Point of Order? 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Misleading statement.  </span><span>Standing Order …</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  If we cannot find that Honourable Member, can we leave the Prime Minister to 

continue?  Honourable Prime Minister, you may continue.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  I  do  acknowledge  that  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition will have an opportunity to refute some of the statements that I am making but I believe 

that my account that I received of this situation is accurate.  As I was saying that the appointment 

and fair election under Standing Orders 121 of the new Chairperson of the PAC committee.  So, 

in sense the Opposition Members on the committee that they resigned on mass the three Members 

and left the four Members to go through the Report themselves.  

</span></div>
<div><span>But  this  is  a  behaviour  Mr  Speaker  that  I  am  not  surprised  because  it  is  a  behaviour  that  the 

Democratic Party has illustrated, demonstrated to us over the last years about walking out when 

things do not go their way. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I have been in the House Mr Speaker where we have debated the budget, and Democratic Party 

Members, not these current Members, previous Members have walked out of the House because 

they do not agree with the Appropriation that we table before the House.  The most recent time of 

course was the election of myself as the new Prime Minister, when again, during the debate and 

the discussions, they vacated the House to express their disgusts.  So, it seems to be a behaviour 

of the Opposition, the Democratic Party Mr Speaker, that when the ongoing gets tough, you run 

away.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Let me also highlight the role of the Public Accounts Committee in scrutinising the Appropriation 

</span><span>Bill.  Article 70 of the Constitution clearly states that the Public Account Committee’s role is to 

</span><span>scrutinise the Appropriation Bill to ensure that it is a fiscally responsible Bill.  They are to ensure 

that the Appropriation Bill  meets  the legal  requirements under the MFEM Act,  and they make 

comments on the Appropriations to different Departments.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The debates on policy decisions on Appropriations should be during the period of debate on the 

principles  and  merits  of  the  Bill  and  also  when  we  enter  into  the  Committee  of  Supply.    The 

comments by the Opposition that the Government Members should not be chairing this Committee 

because they would be impartial, is quite an insult to our Members of Parliament in this House.  

</span><span>As Members of Parliament in this House, and as Members of certain Committees, particularly the 

</span><span>Public  Accounts  Committee,  your  responsibility  is  to  this  House  and  not  to  your  Party.    Your 

</span><span>responsibility is to provide an assurance to the people of this country that the Appropriation Bill 

</span><span>that they are reviewing is one that meets the legal requirements of the MFEM Act.  We have full 

</span><span>confidence  in  our  Government  and  Independent  Members  on  the  Government  side,  that  these 

</span><span>Members have carried out their duties fairly and impartially and with great capability. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I hope that this is reported accurately in the media, that we follow the rules of the Standing 

</span><span>Order, that our Members are doing their duties as diligently as they can in ensuring that this Bill 

is proper and correct.

<div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I know that our individual Members have their own personal views on appropriations to different 

Departments and Ministries, and the time for those views Mr Speaker is during the debate on the 

principles and merits, and when we go into Committee of Supply.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The Honourable Leader of the Opposition made reference to Standing Orders and would like a 

discussion on some of the points particularly on the timing that is stipulated in the Standing Orders.  

And I note, Standing Order 213, in reference when the Appropriation Bill is completed its Second 

Reading: 

</span></div>
<div><span>“A  maximum  of  10  working  days  is  allocated  for  consideration  by  the  Public  Accounts 

Committee…” </span><span>but it says that it, </span><span>“must report to Parliament on its examination of the Estimates 

</span><span>as soon as </span><span>possible after it completes its consideration or within 14 days…”</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, the tabling of the Report can come after 14 days because the first provision 

must be tabled as soon as possible after it completes its consideration.  Now, the consideration can 

take more than 14 days.  So, I am saying Mr Speaker that the timing to take into consideration is 

what it says here, is </span><span>“after it completes its consideration...”  </span><span>But we equivaling over a matter of 

days Mr Speaker when we should be looking at the content of this Appropriation, because 10 days 

is given for debate on this budget Mr Speaker.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I can see on that side that there are only five of them.  I do not think they will be able to fit 10 days 

of  debate  within  10  or  five  people  there  Mr  Speaker.    But  we  will  give  as  much  time  as  the 

Members require to be able to give their thoughts and consideration on the Appropriation and to 

support it where it is in their favour, and to raise questions where they see some areas they would 

like to question.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I will now take my seat Mr Speaker and await the rebuttal from the Opposition.   

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Leader of the Opposition, the 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I will first respond to the comment by the Prime 

Minister in regards to Standing Order 213. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When I read Standing Orders 213 and 214 together, this is what it means, when the Second Reading 

</span><span>for the Appropriation Bill is completed, Parliament will be adjourned for 14 days.  During the 14 

</span><span>days period, the estimates will be referred to the Public Accounts Committee, and that Committee 

has a maximum of 10 days to examine the estimates and report to Parliament.  So, there are two 

things  wrong  here  with  respect  Prime  Minister,  we  adjourned  Parliament  from  15</span><span>th</span><span>  of  May  in 

excess of 14 days.  And it is not just a matter of days, we are talking about a month </span><span>–</span><span> exactly a 

</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>Monday, 17 June 2024 

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>month.  And within those 14 days, SO says 213, PAC has 10 days.  And so, I am saying that those 

two are the first mistakes.   It is not my wish to complicate matters, but I think if we have Standing 

</span><span>Orders, we should comply with Standing Orders otherwise, what’s the point!  </span></div>
<div><span>Now, I want to make a comment on the allegations by the Prime Minister as to the composition of 

PAC.  Standing Order 114, provides that: 

</span></div>
<div><span>“A Minister must not be a member of a select committee</span><span>.”</span></div>
<div><span>Now,  my  reading  of  this  Standing  Orders,  says  once  you’re  a  Minister,  then  you  cannot  be  a 

</span><span>Member of the Committee.  There is no such thin</span><span>g as resigning, you just don’t!  And that is the 

</span><span>same principle when you are convicted, then you no longer hold a Minister position because by 

your very act, you lose the position.  And did this happen?  No, it did not.  We went on for another 

two months until I raised it in Parliament on the 15</span><span>th</span><span> of May (2024).  After that, the hive was busy 

trying to see how we can resolve it.  And I want to say this because, I was in the meeting.  The 

meeting of PAC on the 16</span><span>th</span><span> of May (2024), which is a Thursday prior to our Parliament, at the 

PAC  meeting,  we  were  told,  this  is  the  new  Member  of  the  Committee  and  this  is  the  new 

Chairperson, that was what we were told.  Not what the Prime Minister was saying!  He obviously 

did not know because he was not at that meeting.  And I said, </span><span>“</span><span>hello, excuse me, wait a minute our 

Standing Orders say something different</span><span>.”  B</span><span>ecause my reading of the Standing Order says, that it 

is only the Speaker who appoints a replacement not the Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Honourable  Member,  I  believe  the  problem  lies  with  me  and  not  with  the 

Minister, for not addressing the change for the Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>No with respect, Mr Speaker I am trying to correct what I say is 

a misleading statement made by the Prime Minister.  Now, if we had allowed the meeting to go 

ahead with what the meeting was told on the 16</span><span>th</span><span> of May, we would have had an appointee that 

was not properly appointed and notwithstanding what the Prime Minister says about a common 

trend in our region, the common trend is to have more Opposition Members on a Public Accounts 

</span><span>Committee than Government Members and the rationale behind that is if you are seriously genuine 

</span><span>about having government accounts properly scrutinised you will appoint a Committee that does 

</span><span>not participate in the team that actually approves those same accounts. 

</span></div>
<div><span>With the PAC Committee, we already had a Deputy Chair and it would not be unusual if once a 

</span><span>Chairperson vacates a seat, the Deputy Chair moves into that seat as anticipated in the Standing 

</span><span>Orders in the interim period.  And there were no misleading statements to the media, Mr Prime 

Minister.  I put it down as a difference of opinion and we on our side were interested in promoting 

good governance, promoting transparency and accountability on behalf of government and that is 

our ultimate objective.
