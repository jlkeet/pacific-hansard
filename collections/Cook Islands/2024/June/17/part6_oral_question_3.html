<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I think we have come to the conclusion of 

this discussion and must now proceed to Question Time.  I see the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>I will be very brief on the Report from PAC if I can seek your indulgence, 

if I could make some comments on that. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You must be brief! 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>The Prime Minister has indicated that the primary role of the Committee 

is  to  ensure  that  the  Estimates  comply  with  Article  70  of  the  Constitution  and  that  the  Budget 

presented to the House is responsible financially.  This responsibility falls on the PAC Committee 

when the Estimates are referred to them. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Member from Matavera referenced other reports, which, as  you are aware, have also been 

referred to the PAC Committee.  The PAC Committee will present their deliberations and findings 

on these reports in due course. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding my so-called resignation or stepping down as head of PAC, I presented the positions 

on behalf of the government, proposing that the Honorable Tai Herman take on the role of Chair 

and the Honorable Stephen Matapo be a Member of PAC to replace me on the Committee. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In my correspondence with you, I acknowledged that the decision regarding these appointments 

lies with you.  Interestingly, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Deputy 

Speaker take over as Chair.  However, the Standing Orders do not provide for this option.  It is the 

Committee's responsibility to elect the Chair and the Deputy Chair, and they should exercise their 

democratic right.  In our current PAC Committee, we have two Members from the Cook Islands 

Party, two Members from the Independent candidates, one from the United Party, and two from 

the Democratic Party.  It is essential to respect the Committee's decision when they elect the Chair 

and Deputy Chair. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is worth noting that the Standing Orders don't distinguish between government or Opposition; it 

is  up  to  the  Committee  to  select  their  Chair  and  Deputy  Chair.    Despite  this,  I  support  the 

</span><span>Committee's Report.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  We will now move to our next business for 

</span><span>today, Presentation of Papers.
