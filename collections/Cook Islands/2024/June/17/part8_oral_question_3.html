<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to everyone this afternoon.  I am 

pleased to respond to the question from the Honourable Member from Matavera.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Kia Orana to everyone in this House, including the Honourable Prime Minister, all Ministers, and 

</span><span>Members of Parliament.  Also, Kia Orana to everyone from that side of the House.  Regarding the 

</span><span>progress of the team led by the Prime Minister and me, which went to Hawaii, I must express our 

deep appreciation and gratitude for the outstanding performances of our children in Hawaii.  The 

</span><span>Cook Islands drum beats and the beautiful performances by our boys and girls were received with 

</span><span>much enthusiasm and wrapped people up.  During the presentation of gifts and artefacts, the Prime 

</span><span>Minister acknowledged the people of the Cook Islands' unwavering support for the team.   This 

</span><span>celebration reminded me of my number in the One Cook Islands movement, emphasising that the 

</span><span>Cook Islands are also number one in this celebration.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Member Vaitoti Tupa mentioned his son, and it is only appropriate that his son went to Hawaii 

instead of him.  While the Members' drumming is for the 80s, his son's drumming is for the year 

2000.  When the entire team returns to Rarotonga, we will do a performance for all our people to 

witness their exceptional talents. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  conclude,  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  wearing  these  beautiful  necklaces  from  the  Pa  Enua  that 

represent our islands, and the hat is specially made for me by my wife.  I want to clarify that all 

the adornments I am wearing were created by myself, not my daughter.  Thank you.
