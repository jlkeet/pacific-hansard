</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I will not take much time since I fully support the Internal 

Affairs  allocation.    However,  I  would  like  to  make  a  brief  comment  about  Rarotonga's 

beautification program.  I am aware of a delay in the contract signing, and the Office of Crown 

Law is examining this matter. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, I would like to request that the Minister explore an area of concern regarding the 

proposed diversion of funds from the beautification scheme to other areas within the Ministry next 

year.  Specifically, a $50,000 appropriation is proposed for 2025/26's allocation to other Ministry 

projects, which may impact Puaikura and Takitumu areas where work is already underway. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I want to express that Members from Vaka Takitumu would appreciate this allocation being used 

to  beautify our  areas and in  Puaikura.  Thank  you to  the Ministry's  Secretary and the Minister 

Responsible for their continued support in recognising the need for beautification in our Vaka. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In  the  past,  there  was  an  allocation  of  $5,000  for  each  Vaka  for  stream  beautification  and 

maintenance, which is no longer in place.  Members of Matavera and Ngatangiia, including myself, 

have been required to clear these streams independently when they become blocked after rain. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the Minister of ICI for supporting us in the past during flood times.  My 

request is to support this Appropriation for Internal Affairs and to address these concerns.  Thank 

you.
