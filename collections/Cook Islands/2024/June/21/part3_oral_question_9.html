<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>HEALTH</span><span>–</span><span> 20 minutes. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $22,050,378 for Health  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>   Thank  you, Mr Speaker.   I stand to  support this Vote Item  and the proposed 

increases.  I am particularly pleased with the allocation for patient referrals to New Zealand, which 

has been raised by $1 million.  This is important as we have observed a significant number of our 

patients being referred to medical facilities in New Zealand.  I would also like to acknowledge the 

</span><span>Minister and Secretary for the Ministry of Health for their efforts in creating a training program 

</span><span>that focuses on training more nurses and dentists.  It is a commendable initiative, and I fully support 

it. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As there are only two more speakers from our side before the Minister for Health's turn, I would 

like to express my support for this allocation. Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Honourable Leader; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I am going to be brief.  My comment is really with 

regard  to  the  referrals,  the  increase  in  referral.    While  I  support  that  increase  given  the  health 

condition of our people in the Cook Islands, it gives me a bit of concern because we look like our 

health condition is getting worse. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We know and we talk about it many times amongst ourselves that we need to deal with obesity 

because it leads to diabetic, high blood pressure, etc., etc. and I think many of us have considered 

</span><span>many options but it’s not working.  For example, when we were in Mangaia last Saturday, even 

</span><span>the Orometua Ngateitei was referring to the health condition and how it is that we should lower 

</span><span>our food intake. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And the reality for us is that when we go to feasts, we see this happening all the time.  We might 

</span><span>follow the example by the caterers of the Apostolic Church.  Instead of the people coming to the 

</span><span>table and scooping their food, we have servers.  I </span><span>know it’s a very sensitive subject to talk about 

</span><span>but  I believe we as Parliamentarians need to take a step higher to try and combat this problem 

</span><span>because it’s being reflected in the money that we spend on referrals.  And we should encourage 

</span><span>people to take responsibility for their own health.

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>We all know, and it’s now a joke in many of the functions that we attend, the person who says the 

</span><span>grace will mention the fact that we are going to eat and not to take home.  Notwithstanding that, 

we see it all the time.  So, whoever the Minister who is going to champion and lead that, will win 

the gold medal.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker,  staff  and  Member  of  this  Honourable 

House, and our people listening to our debate.  Thank you to the two Honourable Members who 

gave their support to the Vote Item for Health 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you to the Ministry of Health's Secretary and his staff for their commitment to serve our 

people.  I am also thankful to CIIC, the Minister, and the workers who are replacing the roof of 

the health building in Tupapa. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  agree  with  the  Member  for  Rakahanga's  concern  about  the  unhealthy  eating  habits  prevalent 

among  our  people.    Despite  the  Ministry  of  Health's  efforts  to  promote  healthy  eating  habits 

through Church outreach programs, some people reject these efforts by saying that they buy their 

food and that we should not interfere with their traditional ways of life on our islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Some individuals are yet to comprehend the importance of our message to the people.  Our current 

focus is to prioritise promoting good health among young children and even the unborn.  

</span></div>
<div><span>It  gives us immense pleasure to inform that the Green Climate Fund has extended its generous 

support to us.  We, as the first country in the Pacific to receive funding from the Green Climate 

Fund, can now mobilise nearly $24 million toward improving health and associated facilities. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The initial workshop was conducted yesterday to deliberate the implementation of devised plans.  

While  the  Ministry  of  Health  took  charge  of  developing  the  plan,  the  Ministry  of  Finance, 

</span><span>Agriculture,  and  Internal  Affairs  were  also  actively  involved  in  the  planning  phase.    In 

</span><span>collaboration with the Ministry of Health, these Ministries will work towards implementing the 

</span><span>program over the next five years. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  objective  of  this  initiative  is  to  enhance  the  quality  of  health  facilities,  clinics,  train  our 

</span><span>healthcare professionals, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, to  identify  and address  newly 

</span><span>emerging diseases.  Additionally, there will be programs aimed at educating people to shift their 

focus  towards  adopting  a  healthier  lifestyle  and  nutrition.    Moreover,  we  will  introduce  health 

programs in schools that cater to our children's needs.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>The primary focus of this program is to promote healthy living by adopting a more sustainable 

lifestyle.  The program is set to commence this year and will run for five years, benefiting from 

the extended funding. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now,  turning  our  attention  to  the  nurses  undergoing  training,  there  are  several  nurses  in  New 

Zealand  who  recently  completed  their  primary  training.    Thank  you  to  the  New  Zealand 

government and the University here in Rarotonga for their contribution towards this program.  The 

training occurs mainly in Rarotonga, ensuring that the nurses need not leave their families and 

children behind.  

</span></div>
<div><span>This is a three-year-long program, and the nurses travel to New Zealand in the final few months 

of  their  training  to  complete  their  studies.    I  strongly  urge  our  nurses  and  doctors  to  avail  this 

training opportunity, as only a few Cook Islanders undertake this training. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It  is  evident  that  a  substantial  amount  has  been  allocated  to  the  referral  program.    The  Prime 

Minister mentioned that our people are sent to private clinics in New Zealand due to the inadequate 

allocation of  funds by the New  Zealand Health Service.   It  is  noteworthy that the Member  for 

Amuri is presently undergoing knee surgery in New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, I support this allocation for the Ministry of Health.  Thank you.
