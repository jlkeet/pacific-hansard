</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $6,890,427 for Infrastructure Cook Islands  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to inform the House that only two Members 

from our side wish to voice their views on this Vote Item.  Despite the absence of the Minister for 

ICI, I hope the Minister of Education will offer support to the current allocation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our party gives its full support to this Appropriation and other proposed increases.  Additionally, 

we highly appreciate the increased fund allocation for road maintenance, waste management, and 

</span><span>drainage.  Also, we acknowledge that the Member for Ruaau will address the issue of the rubbish 

</span><span>dump in Ruaau. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, I notice that the employees' salaries have been increased, and I would like to thank the 

Minister for  ICI  and the Secretary for finding new ways to  improve the appropriations for this 

Ministry.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Secretary  Liz  Koteka,  who  has  simplified  ICI's 

financial statement and made it more transparent, unlike previous years, where it was disclaimed.  

Hence, I give my full support for this Appropriation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Robert 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I support this Vote Item for ICI but would like to 

provide some suggestions that could enhance the road division in this Ministry.  It is stated that 

roads should serve as vital emergency routes, with a particular focus on deteriorating roads that 

</span><span>fail to meet the required standards.  Although the Minister might find it repetitive, I implore him 

</span><span>to be patient and consider my recommendations. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Recent road statistics from the Arorangi main road, captured between November 2023 and January 

</span><span>2024 via traffic counter meters, reveal that an average of 14,500 vehicles ride the road monthly, 

</span><span>with  a  total  of  43,105  vehicles  passing  through  the  main  road.    This  road  serves  emergency 

</span><span>vehicles, public transportation, transport businesses, cyclists, and residents.

</span></div>
<div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our  country's  two  most  prominent  hotels  have  operated  for  40  to  50  years,  respectively, 

contributing significantly to our economy.  We owe it to them to maintain better road conditions 

for our visitors and tourism to thrive. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In Puaikura, we have over 2,000 residents who are employed and pay their taxes, with companies 

and businesses also generating revenue and paying their fair share of taxes.  We pay for vehicle 

registration annually, and our vehicles require a Warrant of Fitness every six months.  Yet, our 

cars are continually exposed to potholes, requiring regular maintenance and repairs.  Perhaps it is 

time for our roads to undergo a Warrant of Fitness as well, to ensure they consistently meet the 

required standards. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, one of the problems affecting our youth could be due to their vehicles getting damaged 

on the bumpy  roads  with  numerous potholes.   My mother had multiple hospital visits,  and the 

</span><span>ambulance ride on the terrible roads was not a pleasant experience, although fortunately, she did 

</span><span>not fall. 

</span></div>
<div><span>ICI mentions priority areas, but I need to request that they scrutinize our region's road conditions. 

For  ten  years,  we  have  been  waiting,  hoping,  and  persevering  on  these  bumpy  roads.  Thus,  I 

request the Government to prioritise our region's road development, and acknowledge this as an 

urgent  and  much-needed  requirement  for  not  just  Puaikura,  but  for  all  the  people  of  the  Cook 

Islands.  Thank you.
