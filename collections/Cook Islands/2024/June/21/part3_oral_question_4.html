<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $30,754,277 for Finance and Economic Management  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div>
<div><span>TOURISM </span><span>–</span><span> 20 minutes.</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question:  

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $9,268,495 for Tourism Corporation  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    As  previously  mentioned  by  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, I have been designated as our spokesperson for this Vote Item, and the Minister of 

Tourism will sum up after my statement.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I lend my full support to this Vote Item and wish to provide some comments regarding 

the budget allocated to market and promote the Cook Islands.  This year's budget allocation is set 

at $100,000.  However, I am delighted to note that the estimated amount for the following year, 

2025/26, will be increased to $500,000.  This increase in budget will facilitate travel opportunities 

for the department's team, thus promoting the Cook Islands on the global stage. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Previously, the Honourable Member for Ngatangiia, Tukaka, would accompany teams travelling 

</span><span>abroad to promote the Cook Islands.  This method is a crucial tool in allowing those living outside 

</span><span>of our country to become familiar with the Cook Islands' splendors.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Moving on, Mr Speaker, this year, more than $376,000 has been allocated towards enhancing flight 

</span><span>services into our country, which is  a significant  amount.  For the  year 2025/26,  this amount is 

</span><span>anticipated to increase to $1.5 million and will continue to increase if our tourism industry remains 

</span><span>productive.  This allocation provides an opportunity for us to negotiate with other airlines to secure 

their service to our country.

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Currently,  airlines like Jet  Star, Air New  Zealand, and Hawaiian Airlines serve our country.   I 

recall the Prime Minister discussing Air Fiji previously.  Perhaps discussions with Air Fiji could 

result in direct flights to the Cook Islands rather than routing through New Zealand.  My time of 

five minutes has come to an end; therefore, we support this allocation.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you.  Yes, my gratitude towards our tourism Board and industry for 

their outstanding efforts in the past four years, despite the difficult times.  Their contribution has 

helped  revive  our  economy.    To  continue  this  growth,  we  have  allocated  almost  $5.5  million 

towards marketing, with a focus on expanding our reach in key markets such as New Zealand, 

Australia, North America, and Europe. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In contrast to the Fijian Government's expenditure of almost $30 million on marketing, our Budget 

may seem smaller.  However, when considered proportionately, we invest significantly more per 

capita than Fiji.   

</span></div>
<div><span>As  I  always  try  to  clarify  when  comparing  costs,  examining  per  capita  costs  such  as  runway 

construction reveals  that the expense remains constant regardless  of the size of the  population.  

Consequently, we end up paying a higher cost per capita.  This holds true for marketing, as well.  

Regardless  of  whether  we're  promoting  a  million  or  a  hundred  thousand  visitors  to  the  Cook 

Islands, the cost of a 30-second commercial on TV or  a billboard in New Zealand remains the 

same.  Therefore, we must prioritise our presence in these markets. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In our marketing  efforts in  New  Zealand and Australia, we face competition  from  destinations 

such as Hawaii, Bali, and Fiji, all of which have much larger marketing budgets than ours. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take my hat off to the Board of Tourism, CEO Karla, and the entire team who, 

despite  being  a  small  group,  have  been  doing  an  excellent  job.    Moving  forward,  I  see  the 

marketing budget increasing by another million dollars to enable us to compete with other popular 

</span><span>destinations.    While  their  primary  role  is  to  boost  tourist  numbers,  it  is  our  responsibility  as  a 

</span><span>government to explore ways to diversify our product and ensure that the benefits of tourism are 

</span><span>shared with our Pa Enua islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>During my recent trip to Hawaii with our PACfest team and to see this island with 9 million visitors 

</span><span>a year coming into it, the opportunity provides to businesses over there are hugely available, hugely 

</span><span>expanded.  But we </span><span>don’t need to be like Hawaii.  We need to be like the Cook Islands.   </span><span>In  a  conversation  with  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  VAI-VAI-TAU  from  Aitutaki,  it  was 

</span><span>highlighted  that  the  tourism  sector  offers  opportunities  not  only  to  big  businesses  but  also  to 

households in Aitutaki.  Households in Aitutaki are utilising their boats to provide private charters

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>to  small  groups,  families,  and  couples.    This  tailored  lagoon  excursion  is  an  excellent  way  of 

spreading the tourism dollar throughout the community.  In the past, activities such as bone fishing 

have proven to be immensely valuable to some members of the community living on islands like 

Aitutaki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The tourism industry in islands like Atiu is starting to develop, with people offering unique caving 

and bird watching expeditions.  This showcases the potential for each of our islands to participate 

in their way and ensure that a portion of the tourism dollars coming into our country are spent in 

these islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I look forward to the day when our airports in the Pa Enua, particularly the Northern Group, can 

be opened, allowing visitors to stay in holiday homes over the water and appreciate the stunning 

beauty of our lagoons.  This will be a remarkable opportunity for our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>They are already a beautiful paradise like the island of our Minister of Finance, Pukapuka which I 

have had the absolute pleasure of visiting a couple of times now and I just look and if the rest of 

us from the other islands had the opportunity to go and stay in one of these islands, I thin</span><span>k you’d 

</span><span>be blown away by how beautiful it is. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker by continuing our strategies and our policies, we have an opportunity to 

grow and build on our tourism product, particularly with the opportunity available for the Pa Enua.  

Thank you very much.
