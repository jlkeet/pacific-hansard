<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>May I ask for my statement not to be translated because I will run out of 

time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Request declined. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  I agree with you, Member for Akaoa, that I have no objections to anything 

</span><span>you said.  The views you expressed regarding taxpayers and the Puaikura industry align with those 

</span><span>of the Members for Ngatangiia and Titikaveka, who have also shared similar sentiments with me.  

However, it would be remiss and inappropriate of me to prioritise fixing roads in Puaikura over 

</span><span>those in other regions. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As  evident  in  the  2024/25  financial  year  budget,  there  will  be  a  significant  reduction  in  ICI's 

</span><span>Capital Budget to align with our fiscal capacity.  However, Mr Speaker, the fiscal sacrifices that 

we will make in the upcoming  year will pave the way for substantial increases in  ICI's overall 

capital and maintenance budget in the following years.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I anticipate that in the 2024/25 Budget, Mr Speaker, ICI will continue to concentrate on core capital 

investments.  The sealing of Nikao and the Avatiu back road will be a primary focus, followed by 

the Titikaveka main drag, and then Arorangi. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, as the Minister of ICI,  I have prioritised delivering our projects in an orderly and 

systematic  manner.    We  now  focus  on  completing  one  road  from  start  to  finish,  rather  than 

following the past culture of randomly working on multiple projects, resulting in unfinished roads. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  acknowledge that financial constraints have  resulted in  slower progress than desired, but  rest 

assured, my intention is to ensure all our roads are completed.  However, Mr Speaker, there are 

factors beyond my control, just as they are beyond the Prime Minister's control.  Work can only 

be completed as funds become available.  Unless some companies in the Cook Islands are willing 

to contribute by delivering work for free, perhaps a company with which the Honourable Member 

</span><span>is involved can tar seal Puaikura at no cost. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  am  pleased  to  collaborate  with  the  Honourable  Member's  son  to  develop  all  the  necessary 

technical designs.  I understand that this will require significant financial resources.  However, I 

can  assure  the  Honourable  Member  that  as  long  as  I  serve  as  the  Minister  of  ICI  and  my 

government  stays in  power,  I  am  committed to  completing the Puaikura road.  Thank  you, Mr 

Speaker.
