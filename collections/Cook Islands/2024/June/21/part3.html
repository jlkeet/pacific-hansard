<div><span>OPENING PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER (T. TURA</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span>  I hereby convene the House.  Good morning to everyone present.  

</span><span>Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Government  Members,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

</span><span>Members on the Opposition side and all our listeners and viewers on Rarotonga, in the Northern 

Group and the Southern Group.  To our people residing in Australia, New Zealand and other parts 

of the world, Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>Moving on, are there any bereavement notices to be shared this morning?  Honourable Member 

Tereapii Maki Kavana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for allowing me to speak at this time on behalf 

of the three Members from Aitutaki, Teokotai Herman, Toanui Isamaela and myself.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, my heartfelt condolences to the family of the late Paora Teiti, who has recently been laid 

to rest.  Paora Teiti served as a dedicated Member of Parliament for Aitutaki, tirelessly working 

for  the  benefit  of  his  people  until  his  retirement.    Today,  I  rise  to  pay  tribute  and  extend  our 

condolences to his family.  On the 14th of this month, he was laid to rest on his birthplace Aitutaki.  

Paora Teiti was a hard worker, not only for his people and country, but also for his Church.  The 

</span><span>verse that comes to my mind when I think of him is, </span><span>“Well done, good and faithful servant! You 

</span><span>have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things.  Come and share 

</span><span>your master’s happiness!” (Matthew 25:21).</span></div><div><span>We  would  also  like  to  extend  our  condolences  to  Mama  Taiti,  and  pray  that  God  showers  His 

</span><span>mercy  and  comfort  upon  her,  her  children,  and  family  during  this  difficult  time.    In  such 

</span><span>circumstances, I would like to share a Verse from the Bible with our Mama Taiti, “looking </span><span>unto 

</span><span>Jesus the author and finisher of our faith…” (Hebrews 12:2).  On behalf of the people of the Cook 

</span><span>Islands, we offer our deepest sympathies to you.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, I would like to mention that Papa Paora is a direct descendant of the Strickland family, 

who founded the Seventh Day Adventist Church on our island of Aitutaki and in the Cook Islands 

as a whole.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  It appears that there are no other bereavement notices to share, and we will now 

proceed with our work.  Moving on to the Question Time, I would like to invite the Honourable 

Prime Minister to take the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In order to facilitate more speaking time for our 

Estimates  and  Appropriation  Bill  and  the  consideration  of  detail  of  the  Vote  Items,  I  request 

Members  to  consider  Standing  Order  49  (5)  where  the  Government  Orders  of  the  Day  take 

precedence particularly if the Budget Debate on the consideration of detail for the Appropriation 

is before the House.  This will allow us an additional 30 minutes during the day to debate these 

</span><span>vote items.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to support the comments made 

by the Prime Minister.  So, we have more time on each of the allocation.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Prime Minister and also to the Leader of the Opposition.  As stated 

by  those  Honourable  Members,  to  underscore  the  critical  importance  of  passing  our  national 

budget today, I wish to inform all Honourable Members that speaking time for each Vote Item has 

been further reduced to expedite our proceedings and ensure we achieve our objective today.  

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Appropriation Bill 2024/25 </span><span>–</span><span> Consideration of Bill in Detail stage. 

</span></div><div><span>FINANCE AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT </span><span>–</span><span>15 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $30, 754, 277 for Finance and Economic Management  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you and all Honourable Members in 

the House.  As agreed, upon by the Opposition side, we have decided to have only one speaker.  

After I have shared my thoughts, the Floor will be handed back to the Minister Responsible, as we 

will be the only two speakers for this debate.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You can share seven minutes each.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I will give the Prime Minister his 10 minutes.  I 

will take five minutes only.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is one of the most important Ministries in government.   I am  glad there were 

some discussions around the problems or the challenges that the Ministry has.  In my past life on 

the Public Accounts Committee, there were some complaints made to the PERCA, and reports 

were filed.  Investigations and reports by PAC were also filed. And in the report, it was revealed 

that the Ministry was struggling especially with the recruitment and retention of qualified people. 

</span></div><div><span>Coupled with the new programme, and here I am a bit lost with the IT, there is a program that 

</span><span>they’ve been working on to facilitate especially the Inland Revenue Division.  What I am pleased 

</span><span>about is that there is recognition of the challenges, and I believe that efforts are being made to meet 

those challenges. 

</span></div><div><span>I just want, Mr Prime Minister if I may, if you could extend a thank you to the Secretary of Finance, 

not for the allocation but for something separate.  When the now Minister Tingika Elikana was the 

Chairman of PAC, he recommended that I attend one of the PASAI conferences or workshops in 

Vanuatu. 

</span></div><div><span>And the agenda was on corruption and a week after I had accepted to participate, I was asked to 

do a presentation.  I panicked, because I knew nothing about PASAI, as I did not pass a UE in 

accounting or bookkeeping, and I knew nothing about what it is our country was doing as far as 

corruption was concerned. 

</span></div><div><span>I  went  looking  for  help  and  ended  up  with  Mr  Henderson,  who  apparently  is  the  Chair  of  the 

Anticorruption Committee.  He was the one that gave me a full briefing of what has been happening 

since we started a Corruption Committee up till when I think they had a strategic plan that was 

</span><span>intended to be adopted at the PIF meeting last year somehow or rather it fell off the agenda. 

</span></div><div><span>The wealth of information he gave me enabled me to do a 15-minute presentation at the PASAI in 

</span><span>Vanuatu.  I want you, please, to extend to him, and I did send him an email but I wanted to come 

</span><span>into this House for another reason. 

</span></div><div><span>It would be very helpful for Heads of Ministries when Parliamentarians are sent to workshops to 

be more cooperative and to assist Parliamentarians with their research.  So that, after all, we are 

representing our country, whether we are Government or Opposition, we are travelling on behalf 

</span></div><div><span>711 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>of our country.  And I believe that it is in the interest of our country that we are well prepared and 

well researched before we attend conferences.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  thank  you  very  much  to  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition and I well certainly convey those messages to the current Head of the Anticorruption 

Committee.  This was a committee that was set up with the makeup of senior government officials 

and  the  Anticorruption  Committee  forms  part  of  our  checks  and  balances  of  the  government 

systems to firstly, prevent corrupt practices from being taken up and secondly, to be able to catch 

any corrupt practices that may be undertaken.  I am very happy that our Anticorruption Committee 

ranks quite highly in the region.  And for the information of the Members of the House the Chair 

of the Anticorruption Committee does rotate amongst its membership and the current Chair now 

</span><span>is the Public Service Commissioner Carl Hunter.  

</span></div><div><span>The only thing I would like to point out to Members that maybe of interest to them is in the Budget 

Book  83  where  there  is  a  broader  description  of  the  Administered  Payments  that  Ministry  of 

Finance is responsible for.  We can see it is quite a significant amount just under the Administered 

Payment amount of over $23 million that Ministry of Finance is responsible for.  But if we take a 

closer look, we can see that bulk of that Administered Payment close to $18 million for this year 

is for the Airline Route Development or the Airline Subsidy.  

</span></div><div><span>But  the  Table  on  page  85  spells  out  exactly  where  each  of  this  Administered  Payment  by  the 

Ministry of Finance goes to.  The only other point that is interest for Members also is currently, 

the Ministry of Finance is involved in the work on the development of our sovereign wealth fund.  

And secondly, have finalised and will be presenting to Cabinet next week, the revised procurement 

policy.    And  that  will  help,  at  the  way  I  am  looking  at  it,  help  streamline  and  reduce  delays, 

particularly in the procurement of large capital project items.   

</span></div><div><span>So,  there  will  be  a  measure  of  training  provided  across  our  government  agencies  so  that 

</span><span>government agencies are very clear on what the procurement policy is and how they need to go 

</span><span>about in either procuring or tendering for services or goods.  And probably the third one I would 

just like to advise our Members is, the further work that we are now doing in the review of our 

</span><span>RMD,  our  tax  and  customs  division  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance.    There  needs  to  be  an 

</span><span>improvement  in  the  services  provided  to  individuals  and  companies  so  that  we  do  not  create 

</span><span>situations where companies will find themselves into hardship in order to try and meet their RMD 

</span><span>obligations.  And my policy and strategy with the team is to lift and improve their service and 

</span><span>support, rather than where the focus is right now is on enforcement and compliance.  If you can 

help an issue and find a solution, it is far better than trying to solve the problem once it is already 

occurred.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $30,754,277 for Finance and Economic Management  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>TOURISM </span><span>–</span><span> 20 minutes.</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question:  

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $9,268,495 for Tourism Corporation  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    As  previously  mentioned  by  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, I have been designated as our spokesperson for this Vote Item, and the Minister of 

Tourism will sum up after my statement.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I lend my full support to this Vote Item and wish to provide some comments regarding 

the budget allocated to market and promote the Cook Islands.  This year's budget allocation is set 

at $100,000.  However, I am delighted to note that the estimated amount for the following year, 

2025/26, will be increased to $500,000.  This increase in budget will facilitate travel opportunities 

for the department's team, thus promoting the Cook Islands on the global stage. 

</span></div><div><span>Previously, the Honourable Member for Ngatangiia, Tukaka, would accompany teams travelling 

</span><span>abroad to promote the Cook Islands.  This method is a crucial tool in allowing those living outside 

</span><span>of our country to become familiar with the Cook Islands' splendors.   

</span></div><div><span>Moving on, Mr Speaker, this year, more than $376,000 has been allocated towards enhancing flight 

</span><span>services into our country, which is  a significant  amount.  For the  year 2025/26,  this amount is 

</span><span>anticipated to increase to $1.5 million and will continue to increase if our tourism industry remains 

</span><span>productive.  This allocation provides an opportunity for us to negotiate with other airlines to secure 

their service to our country.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Currently,  airlines like Jet  Star, Air New  Zealand, and Hawaiian Airlines serve our country.   I 

recall the Prime Minister discussing Air Fiji previously.  Perhaps discussions with Air Fiji could 

result in direct flights to the Cook Islands rather than routing through New Zealand.  My time of 

five minutes has come to an end; therefore, we support this allocation.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you.  Yes, my gratitude towards our tourism Board and industry for 

their outstanding efforts in the past four years, despite the difficult times.  Their contribution has 

helped  revive  our  economy.    To  continue  this  growth,  we  have  allocated  almost  $5.5  million 

towards marketing, with a focus on expanding our reach in key markets such as New Zealand, 

Australia, North America, and Europe. 

</span></div><div><span>In contrast to the Fijian Government's expenditure of almost $30 million on marketing, our Budget 

may seem smaller.  However, when considered proportionately, we invest significantly more per 

capita than Fiji.   

</span></div><div><span>As  I  always  try  to  clarify  when  comparing  costs,  examining  per  capita  costs  such  as  runway 

construction reveals  that the expense remains constant regardless  of the size of the  population.  

Consequently, we end up paying a higher cost per capita.  This holds true for marketing, as well.  

Regardless  of  whether  we're  promoting  a  million  or  a  hundred  thousand  visitors  to  the  Cook 

Islands, the cost of a 30-second commercial on TV or  a billboard in New Zealand remains the 

same.  Therefore, we must prioritise our presence in these markets. 

</span></div><div><span>In our marketing  efforts in  New  Zealand and Australia, we face competition  from  destinations 

such as Hawaii, Bali, and Fiji, all of which have much larger marketing budgets than ours. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to take my hat off to the Board of Tourism, CEO Karla, and the entire team who, 

despite  being  a  small  group,  have  been  doing  an  excellent  job.    Moving  forward,  I  see  the 

marketing budget increasing by another million dollars to enable us to compete with other popular 

</span><span>destinations.    While  their  primary  role  is  to  boost  tourist  numbers,  it  is  our  responsibility  as  a 

</span><span>government to explore ways to diversify our product and ensure that the benefits of tourism are 

</span><span>shared with our Pa Enua islands. 

</span></div><div><span>During my recent trip to Hawaii with our PACfest team and to see this island with 9 million visitors 

</span><span>a year coming into it, the opportunity provides to businesses over there are hugely available, hugely 

</span><span>expanded.  But we </span><span>don’t need to be like Hawaii.  We need to be like the Cook Islands.   </span><span>In  a  conversation  with  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  VAI-VAI-TAU  from  Aitutaki,  it  was 

</span><span>highlighted  that  the  tourism  sector  offers  opportunities  not  only  to  big  businesses  but  also  to 

households in Aitutaki.  Households in Aitutaki are utilising their boats to provide private charters 

</span></div><div><span>714 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>to  small  groups,  families,  and  couples.    This  tailored  lagoon  excursion  is  an  excellent  way  of 

spreading the tourism dollar throughout the community.  In the past, activities such as bone fishing 

have proven to be immensely valuable to some members of the community living on islands like 

Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>The tourism industry in islands like Atiu is starting to develop, with people offering unique caving 

and bird watching expeditions.  This showcases the potential for each of our islands to participate 

in their way and ensure that a portion of the tourism dollars coming into our country are spent in 

these islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I look forward to the day when our airports in the Pa Enua, particularly the Northern Group, can 

be opened, allowing visitors to stay in holiday homes over the water and appreciate the stunning 

beauty of our lagoons.  This will be a remarkable opportunity for our country. 

</span></div><div><span>They are already a beautiful paradise like the island of our Minister of Finance, Pukapuka which I 

have had the absolute pleasure of visiting a couple of times now and I just look and if the rest of 

us from the other islands had the opportunity to go and stay in one of these islands, I thin</span><span>k you’d 

</span><span>be blown away by how beautiful it is. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker by continuing our strategies and our policies, we have an opportunity to 

grow and build on our tourism product, particularly with the opportunity available for the Pa Enua.  

Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Members.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is:

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to all Members of this House.  The 

hymn that we sang during our Opening Prayer and the thoughts shared by the Chaplain feel quite 

fitting for this allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>According  to  Book  2  on  crime  prevention,  I  notice  there  is  no  appropriation  for  Community 

Policing.  It could be due to financial constraints or recruitment issues.  However, it is reassuring 

to know that the Prime Minister has recognised this as an urgent service. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Minister  for  Corrective  Services  said  yesterday  that  he’d  like  to  take  over  the  Police 

</span><span>Department.    We  know  he  has  good  intentions  but  I  do  not  agree.    The  reason,  we  have  three 

former Police members who are Members of Parliament in this House.  Between the three of them, 

they have 30 plus years of experience in our Police Force.  They know where we are failing today 

and I am sure they can assist our Police Force in improving the standards that we see today. 

</span></div><div><span>Vaka Puaikura Community Police was established in 2008 and unfortunately ceased operations in 

2016.    Crime  dropped  significantly  during  that  period  because  of  the  relationship  between  the 

community, our Vaka Police and our Volunteer Wardens. 

</span></div><div><span>The three Members of Parliament for Takitumu have supported this initiative and they see the need 

to revive community policing.  It is grassroots policing, connecting people with police and vice 

versa and it works and the results speak for themselves.</span></div><div><span>Three out of the 16 volunteer Police Wardens went onto careers within the Justice sector and five 

were warranted as Honorary Constables.   

</span></div><div><span>We’ve had eight major and 11 minor vehicle accidents so far this year in Puaik</span><span>ura and thankfully, 

no fatalities.  Six vehicles were clocked at over 110 kilo meters per hour by the traffic counter 

meter.  Bike theft and burglaries are on the rise and affecting families and businesses.   

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker, to our government, we implore you to take action now, recruit to bolster our ranks 

</span><span>and pay them well to provide this essential service for a safe and secure Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>As stated by our Chaplain, you have the power to change our lives for the better.  To our men and 

</span><span>women in blue, we applaud you for your sacrifices, we salute and thank you for your duty and 

</span><span>service and may the force be with you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Tukaka

</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker, Members of this Honourable House, and a special Kia 

Orana  to  the  Ngatangiia  constituency,  which  I  represent.    I  wish  to  thank  the  Member  from 

Puaikura for bringing up the topic of community policing in our respective districts. 

</span></div><div><span>I will keep this brief.  I support this Appropriation for one important reason.  After discussing with 

the Minister of Police once again, we both agreed that it is important to reintroduce community 

policing in the Takitumu district. 

</span></div><div><span>As our constituency forms the largest tourism sector, it is imperative that we prioritise community 

policing not just for the people of Ngatangiia but for every resident and tourist in the area.  Hence, 

I  extend  my  gratitude  to  the  Minister  for  allowing  us  to  establish  Community  Policing  in  the 

Ngatangiia district.  I have strategies in mind to assist our people, and some retired police officers, 

as mentioned earlier by the previous Member, reside in our area and can lend their support for 

</span><span>community policing.  This will benefit the entire Takitumu district. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, on behalf of myself and the Members of Matavera and Titikaveka, thank you to the 

Minister of Cultural Development for their support towards the Takitumu Cultural team for the 

upcoming Maire Maeva Nui.  Though I have not attended any of the practices, Vaitoti and I have 

been deeply moved to witness the children's splendid performances last night.  In conclusion, I 

support the appropriation for police.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you and 

the Minister has eight minutes to share. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I think I might only have two messages.  The first 

one is I was not really going to speak on this Vote Item.  The reason being is in my country of 

</span><span>Rakahanga, we don’t have a policeman.  The reason why we don’t have a policeman is because 

</span><span>we have no crime.  So, when I hear everyone else asking for village police that means there is a 

lot of crime in their </span><span>vaka</span><span>.  So, we will continue Prime Minister to have no policeman until we have 

crime in our country.  

</span></div><div><span>My second message is a more serious message is that I have been promoting increase in wages for 

the Police officers for quite sometimes.  But there is a proviso with that Minister and that proviso 

</span><span>is that we pay for quality service not just pay for anything.  On the other day Prime Minister, you 

</span><span>were mentioning the challenges in the Police Department and what is going to be happening with 

</span><span>their assistance of their accounts management etc.  I think the quality performance coming out in 

</span><span>the service provided by our police also needs to be looked at with a magnifying glass.  But it is not 

</span><span>going  to  be  easy  I  understand  but  I  think  if  we  are  able  to  put  plans  in  place  that  meets  these 

challenges then we would be ahead.  Thank you.

from Ngatangiia in regards to Community Policing.  You can standby because we will be having 

a meeting and I will be calling on our Members of Parliament from Puaikura and from Takitumu 

to see how we can get our Community Program up and running as quickly as possible.  With the 

help with the likes of the Ministry of Finance to identify areas of resourcing that needs to be put 

in place so that we can have these programs running.  

</span></div><div><span>We can see the total appropriation amount is $6.1 million.  But we can see if we look at these 

figures that $1.5 million of that is depreciation.  This large figure of course is the depreciation of 

</span><span>our patrol boat and it puts a big dent in the appropriation that the Ministry has.  But I am confident 

</span><span>that working with the Ministry of Finance and working closely with the Police Department and 

our Members of Parliament in the districts that we will have much more effective policing moving 

forward.   

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned by the Member from Akaoa, there are three retired police officers in his team and 

their policing experience put together is in excess of 30 years.  But he forgot that in my team, the 

experience from the Member from Tupapa with police when tallied up is close to a hundred.  We 

heard the request from the Minister from Tupapa for the Police portfolio to be given to him.  We 

all know his character is that he is a person that when he sees something that needs to be done, he 

does it straight away.  That is why he is called the Action Man.  I have no doubt that he has the 

capability of carrying this portfolio.  But, Mr Speaker, this portfolio is my responsibility and I do 

not want to give it away.  So, these are the challenges I will take to make changes in this Ministry.  

Maybe in the future, this portfolio will be given to another Minister.  If I want to scare people, I 

will give it to the Minister of Corrective Services </span><span>(Laughter).</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,288,983 for Police  

stands part of the Schedule

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HEALTH</span><span>–</span><span> 20 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $22,050,378 for Health  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>   Thank  you, Mr Speaker.   I stand to  support this Vote Item  and the proposed 

increases.  I am particularly pleased with the allocation for patient referrals to New Zealand, which 

has been raised by $1 million.  This is important as we have observed a significant number of our 

patients being referred to medical facilities in New Zealand.  I would also like to acknowledge the 

</span><span>Minister and Secretary for the Ministry of Health for their efforts in creating a training program 

</span><span>that focuses on training more nurses and dentists.  It is a commendable initiative, and I fully support 

it. 

</span></div><div><span>As there are only two more speakers from our side before the Minister for Health's turn, I would 

like to express my support for this allocation. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Honourable Leader; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I am going to be brief.  My comment is really with 

regard  to  the  referrals,  the  increase  in  referral.    While  I  support  that  increase  given  the  health 

condition of our people in the Cook Islands, it gives me a bit of concern because we look like our 

health condition is getting worse. 

</span></div><div><span>We know and we talk about it many times amongst ourselves that we need to deal with obesity 

because it leads to diabetic, high blood pressure, etc., etc. and I think many of us have considered 

</span><span>many options but it’s not working.  For example, when we were in Mangaia last Saturday, even 

</span><span>the Orometua Ngateitei was referring to the health condition and how it is that we should lower 

</span><span>our food intake. 

</span></div><div><span>And the reality for us is that when we go to feasts, we see this happening all the time.  We might 

</span><span>follow the example by the caterers of the Apostolic Church.  Instead of the people coming to the 

</span><span>table and scooping their food, we have servers.  I </span><span>know it’s a very sensitive subject to talk about 

</span><span>but  I believe we as Parliamentarians need to take a step higher to try and combat this problem 

</span><span>because it’s being reflected in the money that we spend on referrals.  And we should encourage 

</span><span>people to take responsibility for their own health.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We all know, and it’s now a joke in many of the functions that we attend, the person who says the 

</span><span>grace will mention the fact that we are going to eat and not to take home.  Notwithstanding that, 

we see it all the time.  So, whoever the Minister who is going to champion and lead that, will win 

the gold medal.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker,  staff  and  Member  of  this  Honourable 

House, and our people listening to our debate.  Thank you to the two Honourable Members who 

gave their support to the Vote Item for Health 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you to the Ministry of Health's Secretary and his staff for their commitment to serve our 

people.  I am also thankful to CIIC, the Minister, and the workers who are replacing the roof of 

the health building in Tupapa. 

</span></div><div><span>I  agree  with  the  Member  for  Rakahanga's  concern  about  the  unhealthy  eating  habits  prevalent 

among  our  people.    Despite  the  Ministry  of  Health's  efforts  to  promote  healthy  eating  habits 

through Church outreach programs, some people reject these efforts by saying that they buy their 

food and that we should not interfere with their traditional ways of life on our islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Some individuals are yet to comprehend the importance of our message to the people.  Our current 

focus is to prioritise promoting good health among young children and even the unborn.  

</span></div><div><span>It  gives us immense pleasure to inform that the Green Climate Fund has extended its generous 

support to us.  We, as the first country in the Pacific to receive funding from the Green Climate 

Fund, can now mobilise nearly $24 million toward improving health and associated facilities. 

</span></div><div><span>The initial workshop was conducted yesterday to deliberate the implementation of devised plans.  

While  the  Ministry  of  Health  took  charge  of  developing  the  plan,  the  Ministry  of  Finance, 

</span><span>Agriculture,  and  Internal  Affairs  were  also  actively  involved  in  the  planning  phase.    In 

</span><span>collaboration with the Ministry of Health, these Ministries will work towards implementing the 

</span><span>program over the next five years. 

</span></div><div><span>The  objective  of  this  initiative  is  to  enhance  the  quality  of  health  facilities,  clinics,  train  our 

</span><span>healthcare professionals, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, to  identify  and address  newly 

</span><span>emerging diseases.  Additionally, there will be programs aimed at educating people to shift their 

focus  towards  adopting  a  healthier  lifestyle  and  nutrition.    Moreover,  we  will  introduce  health 

programs in schools that cater to our children's needs.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The primary focus of this program is to promote healthy living by adopting a more sustainable 

lifestyle.  The program is set to commence this year and will run for five years, benefiting from 

the extended funding. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  turning  our  attention  to  the  nurses  undergoing  training,  there  are  several  nurses  in  New 

Zealand  who  recently  completed  their  primary  training.    Thank  you  to  the  New  Zealand 

government and the University here in Rarotonga for their contribution towards this program.  The 

training occurs mainly in Rarotonga, ensuring that the nurses need not leave their families and 

children behind.  

</span></div><div><span>This is a three-year-long program, and the nurses travel to New Zealand in the final few months 

of  their  training  to  complete  their  studies.    I  strongly  urge  our  nurses  and  doctors  to  avail  this 

training opportunity, as only a few Cook Islanders undertake this training. 

</span></div><div><span>It  is  evident  that  a  substantial  amount  has  been  allocated  to  the  referral  program.    The  Prime 

Minister mentioned that our people are sent to private clinics in New Zealand due to the inadequate 

allocation of  funds by the New  Zealand Health Service.   It  is  noteworthy that the Member  for 

Amuri is presently undergoing knee surgery in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I support this allocation for the Ministry of Health.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $22,050,378 for Health

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,890,427 for Infrastructure Cook Islands  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I would like to inform the House that only two Members 

from our side wish to voice their views on this Vote Item.  Despite the absence of the Minister for 

ICI, I hope the Minister of Education will offer support to the current allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>Our party gives its full support to this Appropriation and other proposed increases.  Additionally, 

we highly appreciate the increased fund allocation for road maintenance, waste management, and 

</span><span>drainage.  Also, we acknowledge that the Member for Ruaau will address the issue of the rubbish 

</span><span>dump in Ruaau. 

</span></div><div><span>Moreover, I notice that the employees' salaries have been increased, and I would like to thank the 

Minister for  ICI  and the Secretary for finding new ways to  improve the appropriations for this 

Ministry.  

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Secretary  Liz  Koteka,  who  has  simplified  ICI's 

financial statement and made it more transparent, unlike previous years, where it was disclaimed.  

Hence, I give my full support for this Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Robert 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I support this Vote Item for ICI but would like to 

provide some suggestions that could enhance the road division in this Ministry.  It is stated that 

roads should serve as vital emergency routes, with a particular focus on deteriorating roads that 

</span><span>fail to meet the required standards.  Although the Minister might find it repetitive, I implore him 

</span><span>to be patient and consider my recommendations. 

</span></div><div><span>Recent road statistics from the Arorangi main road, captured between November 2023 and January 

</span><span>2024 via traffic counter meters, reveal that an average of 14,500 vehicles ride the road monthly, 

</span><span>with  a  total  of  43,105  vehicles  passing  through  the  main  road.    This  road  serves  emergency 

</span><span>vehicles, public transportation, transport businesses, cyclists, and residents.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our  country's  two  most  prominent  hotels  have  operated  for  40  to  50  years,  respectively, 

contributing significantly to our economy.  We owe it to them to maintain better road conditions 

for our visitors and tourism to thrive. 

</span></div><div><span>In Puaikura, we have over 2,000 residents who are employed and pay their taxes, with companies 

and businesses also generating revenue and paying their fair share of taxes.  We pay for vehicle 

registration annually, and our vehicles require a Warrant of Fitness every six months.  Yet, our 

cars are continually exposed to potholes, requiring regular maintenance and repairs.  Perhaps it is 

time for our roads to undergo a Warrant of Fitness as well, to ensure they consistently meet the 

required standards. 

</span></div><div><span>Moreover, one of the problems affecting our youth could be due to their vehicles getting damaged 

on the bumpy  roads  with  numerous potholes.   My mother had multiple hospital visits,  and the 

</span><span>ambulance ride on the terrible roads was not a pleasant experience, although fortunately, she did 

</span><span>not fall. 

</span></div><div><span>ICI mentions priority areas, but I need to request that they scrutinize our region's road conditions. 

For  ten  years,  we  have  been  waiting,  hoping,  and  persevering  on  these  bumpy  roads.  Thus,  I 

request the Government to prioritise our region's road development, and acknowledge this as an 

urgent  and  much-needed  requirement  for  not  just  Puaikura,  but  for  all  the  people  of  the  Cook 

Islands.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>May I ask for my statement not to be translated because I will run out of 

time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Request declined. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  I agree with you, Member for Akaoa, that I have no objections to anything 

</span><span>you said.  The views you expressed regarding taxpayers and the Puaikura industry align with those 

</span><span>of the Members for Ngatangiia and Titikaveka, who have also shared similar sentiments with me.  

However, it would be remiss and inappropriate of me to prioritise fixing roads in Puaikura over 

</span><span>those in other regions. 

</span></div><div><span>As  evident  in  the  2024/25  financial  year  budget,  there  will  be  a  significant  reduction  in  ICI's 

</span><span>Capital Budget to align with our fiscal capacity.  However, Mr Speaker, the fiscal sacrifices that 

we will make in the upcoming  year will pave the way for substantial increases in  ICI's overall 

capital and maintenance budget in the following years.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I anticipate that in the 2024/25 Budget, Mr Speaker, ICI will continue to concentrate on core capital 

investments.  The sealing of Nikao and the Avatiu back road will be a primary focus, followed by 

the Titikaveka main drag, and then Arorangi. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as the Minister of ICI,  I have prioritised delivering our projects in an orderly and 

systematic  manner.    We  now  focus  on  completing  one  road  from  start  to  finish,  rather  than 

following the past culture of randomly working on multiple projects, resulting in unfinished roads. 

</span></div><div><span>I  acknowledge that financial constraints have  resulted in  slower progress than desired, but  rest 

assured, my intention is to ensure all our roads are completed.  However, Mr Speaker, there are 

factors beyond my control, just as they are beyond the Prime Minister's control.  Work can only 

be completed as funds become available.  Unless some companies in the Cook Islands are willing 

to contribute by delivering work for free, perhaps a company with which the Honourable Member 

</span><span>is involved can tar seal Puaikura at no cost. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  pleased  to  collaborate  with  the  Honourable  Member's  son  to  develop  all  the  necessary 

technical designs.  I understand that this will require significant financial resources.  However, I 

can  assure  the  Honourable  Member  that  as  long  as  I  serve  as  the  Minister  of  ICI  and  my 

government  stays in  power,  I  am  committed to  completing the Puaikura road.  Thank  you, Mr 

Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, before proceeding, I would like to extend our best 

wishes and a speedy recovery to our Clerk, currently on sick leave.  Our thoughts are with him 

during  this  time.    Additionally,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  new  Minister  Responsible  for  the 

Parliament  of  the  Cook  Islands  and  the  Minister  of  ICI  for  their  prompt  actions  to  rewire  the 

electrical systems in Parliament.  This ensured the uninterrupted proceedings of this Sitting. 

</span></div><div><span>My remarks pertain to the revisions in the allocation for Parliament, specifically the $450,000 for 

MP  Travels  and  Allowances.    It  also  includes  my  own  observations.    I  noted  that  in  the  2023 

Budget, the initial amount was $250,000, which was then supplemented by two top-ups totaling 

approximately $466,000.  My concern is  if  we plan to  increase the amount,  why  not  specify a 

figure that reflects the actual expenditure from last year?  This would provide transparency on the 

anticipated  expenses  for  MP  Travels  and  Allowances.    Moreover,  I  am  troubled  that  the  only 

increase in the Parliament budget pertains to MP Travels and Allowances.  As a member of the 

</span><span>PAC  that  visited  Wellington,  my  experience  informed  me  that  Parliament  lacks  sufficient 

</span><span>resources to support PAC effectively.  For instance, we do not have a research personnel to assist 

PAC  with  their  findings,  and  we  lack  a  designated  person  like  the  New  Zealand  Finance  and 

Expenditure  Committee  to  draft  reports  for  PAC's  consideration.    Every  Sitting  of  Parliament 

refers numerous reports to PAC for further elaboration.  My concern is unless we properly resource 

PAC, the quality of the reports from PAC may not be effective.  It is not about the composition of 

PAC; instead, it is the support system that we currently lack, which I urge the Minister Responsible 

for Parliament to address thoroughly. 

</span></div><div><span>My second point is a request for the Minister, Prime Minister, or Cabinet to review the workshops 

that we attend.  My belief is that if the workshop serves its purpose and benefits our country, then 

we  should  send  people  to  attend.    However,  if  it  does  not,  we  should  abstain  from  doing  so, 

disregarding that they may cover the airfare while we pay for the allowances. 

</span></div><div><span>My third point, Mr Speaker, concerns the requirement of Ministries to report their expenditure to 

the PAC.  I believe the same should apply to MPs attending workshops.  We should be accountable 

for  the  knowledge  we  gain  from  such  events  and  whether  they  provide  value  for  money.    In 

</span><span>essence, we should set an exemplary role model by reporting our expenses, just like we expect 

</span><span>Ministries  to  report  their  expenditure.    With  these  remarks,  Mr  Speaker,  I  fully  support  this 

</span><span>allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to everyone present in Parliament 

today.   I agree with the Leader of the Opposition and also wish the Clerk of Parliament a speedy 

recovery.  I must acknowledge that the Leader of the Opposition pre-empted me by thanking the 

Minister of ICI and those who participated in improving our building's infrastructure.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Let me reassure the House that we have already begun to assess the effectiveness and shortcomings 

of our procedures and processes within Parliament.  We will examine the cost-benefit analysis of 

bringing our outer islands constituents to Rarotonga, taking into account the timing of meetings to 

optimise  their  output.   The  goal  is  to  minimise  the  cost  of  transportation  while  prioritising  the 

results that can be achieved while they are on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>As the Leader of the Opposition has referred to New Zealand practices, I believe it is necessary to 

fully utilise their visit on Rarotonga by engaging them in committee work during the morning and 

parliamentary  work  in  the  afternoon.    To  optimise  our  limited  resources,  we  should  consider 

bringing them to Rarotonga for one or two weeks so that they can complete both parliamentary 

and committee work without requiring additional intervals for their visit.  I have already discussed 

this with the Clerk and Deputy Clerk and expect that we will develop a program for the House and 

Parliamentary Services next week.  

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation and best wishes to the staff, Speaker, and 

everyone who has assisted Parliament's work, past and present.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,179,977 for Justice  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  discuss  the  operations  of  the  Justice 

</span><span>Department, primarily due to timing.  Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the Justice Department 

staff  who  have  provided  exemplary  service.    It  is  commendable  that  many  have  abandoned 

outdated practices and have initiated positive changes.  Consequently, lawyers are seeing good 

service out of them. 

</span></div><div><span>726 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>It is noteworthy that we have a robust system in place.  The Court sittings are satisfactory, and the 

schedule is prepared a year in advance.  Land sittings, Civil and Criminal sittings are held three 

times each regularly, and if necessary, sittings are also scheduled for the Court of Appeal. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, there has been an increase in Justices of the Peace sittings, and my colleague Janet 

Maki has been handling a significant portion of the backlog of Land Court applications as a Justice 

of the Peace.  Frequent sittings of the Land Court by Justices of the Peace have resulted in the 

clearance  of  the  list  of  outstanding  cases  for  judges.    This  aspect  of  the  Justice  Department  is 

operating effectively. 

</span></div><div><span>What we do have a problem with, Minister is, with two areas in particular.  There is a Division in 

the Ministry that does recording of orders on to register of titles of lands.  In simple terms what 

this means is once you have succeeded to your mother or father that then is entered onto the register 

</span><span>of that land to show that you are a landowner.  So that when you go to meetings called by the Court 

</span><span>they only call out the names of people whose names are on the register.  If your name is not on the 

register, even though you have succeeded, you have a problem. 

</span></div><div><span>So, in my experience and bear in mind this is my playing ground, there is a real delay, a long delay 

between the making of the order and the entry onto the register of titles.  I have only given one 

example of many orders.  I am aware that the person who was leading or in charge of that aspect 

</span><span>has left, she’s retired and I am not aware whether there was ever succession plan in place but this 

</span><span>Mr Minister is an area that a new Secretary of Justice will have to focus on. 

</span></div><div><span>The second area relates to the payment of rental monies and that division I think I am aware that 

there are only two staff members looking after that area and it is best if I give you an example of 

</span><span>what I’m talking about. </span></div><div><span>About four years ago, the Court fixed the rental for the Pacific Resort in Aitutaki.  One or two 

months later the lessee, the Pacific Resort paid the outstanding rental which I think exceeded a 

hundred and something thousand to the Court for distribution.  As far as I am aware the first rental 

</span><span>might have been paid out last month, four years later. 

</span></div><div><span>This is a better example, the other examples are probably ten or fifteen  years and it’s not only 

</span><span>difficult  for  our  locals  to  receive  their  rental,  the  process  is  even  more  difficult  if  you  are  not 

</span><span>resident in Rarotonga.  So, Mr Minister if you can assist with those two areas, I am sure our public 

</span><span>will be happy. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Good afternoon to you, Members and staff of 

this House.  I take on board the comments highlighted by the Leader of the Opposition but before 

that at  the outset, let me take this opportunity,  Mr Speaker to  thank one of our most effective, 

humble and qualified Secretary of Justice, Mr Tamatoa Jonassen.  He has been serving and leading 

this Ministry in the last five years.  To me he was there mainly to tidy up all unfinished work, 

unattended and improve the work that former Secretaries all from Atiu like Terry Hagan, Mark 

</span><span>Short, Papa Nono and Tingika Elikana didn’t sort out when they were</span><span> there. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to welcome our new HOM, Mr Peter Graham.  I think he is Mangaian.  He has been 

one of our local lawyers working in the Police, regionally and lately from the Ministry of Marine 

resources.   

</span></div><div><span>The complimentary notes from the Leader of the Opposition have been targeted at praising our 

Justices of the Peace.  On that note I would like to thank the New Zealand High Commissioner 

and the Government of New Zealand for their support in assisting our Ministry in running trainings 

for all of our current JPs and as it is we are always looking at recruiting and appointing very good 

JPs to assist this Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we have some inhouse teething issues that will require some delicate approach and 

resolving and I am confident that with the new HOM we can address these issues as raised by the 

Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>Among other issues within the Ministry would also involve the Registry of Titles and payment of 

rental monies.  With those few comments  I would like to support the Budget.   Thank  you, Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,179,977 for Justice  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>INTERNAL AFFAIRS</span><span>–</span><span> 15 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question:</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,618,627 for Internal Affairs  

</span><span>stands part of the Schedule

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I will not take much time since I fully support the Internal 

Affairs  allocation.    However,  I  would  like  to  make  a  brief  comment  about  Rarotonga's 

beautification program.  I am aware of a delay in the contract signing, and the Office of Crown 

Law is examining this matter. 

</span></div><div><span>Additionally, I would like to request that the Minister explore an area of concern regarding the 

proposed diversion of funds from the beautification scheme to other areas within the Ministry next 

year.  Specifically, a $50,000 appropriation is proposed for 2025/26's allocation to other Ministry 

projects, which may impact Puaikura and Takitumu areas where work is already underway. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to express that Members from Vaka Takitumu would appreciate this allocation being used 

to  beautify our  areas and in  Puaikura.  Thank  you to  the Ministry's  Secretary and the Minister 

Responsible for their continued support in recognising the need for beautification in our Vaka. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  past,  there  was  an  allocation  of  $5,000  for  each  Vaka  for  stream  beautification  and 

maintenance, which is no longer in place.  Members of Matavera and Ngatangiia, including myself, 

have been required to clear these streams independently when they become blocked after rain. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Minister of ICI for supporting us in the past during flood times.  My 

request is to support this Appropriation for Internal Affairs and to address these concerns.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and much appreciation to the Member 

for  your  contribution  regarding  this  appropriation.    Without  further  ado,  I  rise  to  express  my 

support for the appropriation allocated to this Ministry.  Thank you for your support. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,618,627 for Internal Affairs  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>OUTER ISLANDS </span><span>–</span><span> 15 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $13,404,603 for Outer Islands  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise quickly as I know many Members 

have an interest in speaking.  I support the allocation for Rakahanga, although it is relatively small.  

However, I am delighted to see that it includes the Pa Enua government building as a project under 

the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation.    This  building  in  Rakahanga  is  in  dire  need  of 

replacement and has been neglected for some time.  Therefore, I am delighted to hear that the new 

building should be completed sometime in the near future. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, I am curious if the recently mentioned cyclone shelter is intended for Rakahanga as 

it appears in the major project list.  Since Rakahanga is the only island remaining, we are the last 

country, aside from Nassau, I presume it is for our use.  Thus, I am pleased to see that two projects 

are scheduled for Rakahanga's progress. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, during the agriculture debates, I neglected to submit a petition for Rakahanga.  However, 

the Leader of the United Party had advised the acquisition of a digger to enhance taro farming in 

our region.  We take pride in our taro as it is the finest quality, and we do export to Manihiki, 

where taro is not grown.  Unfortunately, our labor resources are limited, and we need this digger 

to improve our swamp systems.  I humbly request consideration for this request, as it may help us 

expand our exports in the future.  I am uncertain of the cost, but the primary goal is to enhance our 

taro crop. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader.  I can see the Member for VAI-VAI-TAU; you 

</span><span>have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  As this is our final Vote Item, may we please have 

</span><span>five  hours  allocated  for  our  discussions?    I  note  that  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  had  spoken 

</span><span>extensively  earlier  about  the  PAC  and  our  travels.    It  seems  she  may  still  have  an  interest  in 

</span><span>returning to the PAC.  In any case, I would like to suggest that we set aside our individual concerns 

</span><span>and collaborate as a united front.  As the song goes, "My problems, your problems, let us put them 

away and work together."

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 21 June 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to express my support for the $13.4 million that have been allocated to the Outer 

Islands.  While I do understand that complaints are emerging from the Outer Islands, we must bear 

in  mind that we are accountable to  Parliament for this expenditure.  Since the inception of the 

PAC,  and  the  formation  of  Islands  Governments,  we  have  yet  to  receive  any  Annual  Reports 

regarding Outer Islands</span><span>’</span><span> expenditure.  This lack of transparency means that we, in Parliament and 

the Ministry of Finance, are unaware of how these funds are being utilised.  Despite this, we are 

determined to find ways to rectify this situation and improve upon it. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to point out that the government is providing additional funding to the 

Outer Islands beyond the $13 million, including investments in Health, Education, and Welfare 

through Internal Affairs, among other areas.  On our island of Aitutaki, we have already allocated 

$9 million towards various initiatives.   It  is  important  that as Members of Parliament from  the 

Outer  Islands,  we  communicate  with  our  constituents  about  the  amount  of  funding  we  have 

</span><span>received and how it will be utilised. 

</span></div><div><span>Additionally, I believe there are other avenues for us in the Outer Islands to enhance our financial 

situation.  The government has plans to improve the airport on Manihiki, and we have also heard 

the  Prime  Minister  mention  other  upcoming  projects  for  the  Outer  Islands.    They  are  actively 

seeking  funding  to  make  all  Outer  Island  airports  more  modern,  and  it  will  improve  living 

conditions.    This  is  one  way  to  ensure  that  tourists  visit  the  other  Outer  Islands,  including  the 

Northern group, and not just Rarotonga and Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>However, we know that tourism is currently limited to Rarotonga and Aitutaki.  Therefore, we 

need to spread tourism to the other Outer Islands as well.  Mr Speaker, I will conclude as I have 

run out of time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  acknowledge  the  allocations  that  have  been 

assigned to the Pa Enua, which, in the past, were determined through a formula that heavily relied 

</span><span>on the population.  Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, as highlighted by the previous speakers, it is crucial 

</span><span>to explore ways to integrate our Pa Enua fully into the Cook Islands economy.  This objective will 

</span><span>only  be  achievable  if  we  prioritise  the  establishment  of  critical  infrastructure  that  enables 

</span><span>connectivity among the islands.  Connectivity that I am talking about is the connectivity through 

</span><span>ships, planes, and the internet to promote integration among our islands.  As I have stated before, 

</span><span>not just in this Chamber, but also via the media, the cost of achieving this objective in a small 

</span><span>nation like ours is disproportionately high when assessed on a per capita basis.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, it is imperative to devise innovative measures to tackle these financial barriers.  One 

such strategy could involve exploring the potential contributions of our diaspora residing in New

</span></div><div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Zealand  and  Australia.    Moreover,  the  200th-anniversary  celebrations  have  taught  us  that  our 

people in Aitutaki, Nga-Pu-Toru, and now Mangaia possess a keen zeal to support significant and 

worthwhile undertakings.  They generously contributed a vast sum, as witnessed in the case of 

Mangaia alone, which exceeded a million dollars, for the festivities.  This exemplifies that our 

islands' residents have the potential to raise substantial sums that can enable their events' successful 

hosting and facilitate their people's return to their ancestral homes. 

</span></div><div><span>I  know  that  there  is  a  big  event  planned  for  the  island  of  Penrhyn  with  the  opening  of  the 

</span><span>Orometua’s House that will take place next year.  Indications are that over a thousand people will 

</span><span>be coming to that event.  This is being financed by the people themselves.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, 

I  think  it  is  important  not  just  the  government's  contribution  to  the  Pa  Enua  that  we  are 

appropriating in this Budget but to acknowledge also the contribution by our own people that are 

making into their own islands.  

</span></div><div><span>I look forward, Mr Speaker, to the government looking for those avenues of financing that will 

enable us to bring each of our Pa Enua into the wider Cook Islands economy.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister and thank you to the Members for their 

</span><span>contribution on today’s Vote Item.</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is:  

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $13,404,603 for Outer Islands  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Members,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  217,  I  forthwith  put  successively,  without 

debate,  the  Question  on  every  departmental  vote  not  yet  disposed  of.    This  implies  that  no 

Honorable Member will speak on the Vote Items.  However, I require your support.
