<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  It appears that there are no other bereavement notices to share, and we will now 

proceed with our work.  Moving on to the Question Time, I would like to invite the Honourable 

Prime Minister to take the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  In order to facilitate more speaking time for our 

Estimates  and  Appropriation  Bill  and  the  consideration  of  detail  of  the  Vote  Items,  I  request 

Members  to  consider  Standing  Order  49  (5)  where  the  Government  Orders  of  the  Day  take 

precedence particularly if the Budget Debate on the consideration of detail for the Appropriation 

is before the House.  This will allow us an additional 30 minutes during the day to debate these 

</span><span>vote items.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition.
