<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I think I might only have two messages.  The first 

one is I was not really going to speak on this Vote Item.  The reason being is in my country of 

</span><span>Rakahanga, we don’t have a policeman.  The reason why we don’t have a policeman is because 

</span><span>we have no crime.  So, when I hear everyone else asking for village police that means there is a 

lot of crime in their </span><span>vaka</span><span>.  So, we will continue Prime Minister to have no policeman until we have 

crime in our country.  

</span></div>
<div><span>My second message is a more serious message is that I have been promoting increase in wages for 

the Police officers for quite sometimes.  But there is a proviso with that Minister and that proviso 

</span><span>is that we pay for quality service not just pay for anything.  On the other day Prime Minister, you 

</span><span>were mentioning the challenges in the Police Department and what is going to be happening with 

</span><span>their assistance of their accounts management etc.  I think the quality performance coming out in 

</span><span>the service provided by our police also needs to be looked at with a magnifying glass.  But it is not 

</span><span>going  to  be  easy  I  understand  but  I  think  if  we  are  able  to  put  plans  in  place  that  meets  these 

challenges then we would be ahead.  Thank you.
