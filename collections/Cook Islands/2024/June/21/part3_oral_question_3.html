<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Prime Minister and also to the Leader of the Opposition.  As stated 

by  those  Honourable  Members,  to  underscore  the  critical  importance  of  passing  our  national 

budget today, I wish to inform all Honourable Members that speaking time for each Vote Item has 

been further reduced to expedite our proceedings and ensure we achieve our objective today.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Interrupted debate on the Appropriation Bill 2024/25 </span><span>–</span><span> Consideration of Bill in Detail stage. 

</span></div>
<div><span>FINANCE AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT </span><span>–</span><span>15 minutes. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $30, 754, 277 for Finance and Economic Management  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you and all Honourable Members in 

the House.  As agreed, upon by the Opposition side, we have decided to have only one speaker.  

After I have shared my thoughts, the Floor will be handed back to the Minister Responsible, as we 

will be the only two speakers for this debate.

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You can share seven minutes each.  

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I will give the Prime Minister his 10 minutes.  I 

will take five minutes only.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, this is one of the most important Ministries in government.   I am  glad there were 

some discussions around the problems or the challenges that the Ministry has.  In my past life on 

the Public Accounts Committee, there were some complaints made to the PERCA, and reports 

were filed.  Investigations and reports by PAC were also filed. And in the report, it was revealed 

that the Ministry was struggling especially with the recruitment and retention of qualified people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Coupled with the new programme, and here I am a bit lost with the IT, there is a program that 

</span><span>they’ve been working on to facilitate especially the Inland Revenue Division.  What I am pleased 

</span><span>about is that there is recognition of the challenges, and I believe that efforts are being made to meet 

those challenges. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I just want, Mr Prime Minister if I may, if you could extend a thank you to the Secretary of Finance, 

not for the allocation but for something separate.  When the now Minister Tingika Elikana was the 

Chairman of PAC, he recommended that I attend one of the PASAI conferences or workshops in 

Vanuatu. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And the agenda was on corruption and a week after I had accepted to participate, I was asked to 

do a presentation.  I panicked, because I knew nothing about PASAI, as I did not pass a UE in 

accounting or bookkeeping, and I knew nothing about what it is our country was doing as far as 

corruption was concerned. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  went  looking  for  help  and  ended  up  with  Mr  Henderson,  who  apparently  is  the  Chair  of  the 

Anticorruption Committee.  He was the one that gave me a full briefing of what has been happening 

since we started a Corruption Committee up till when I think they had a strategic plan that was 

</span><span>intended to be adopted at the PIF meeting last year somehow or rather it fell off the agenda. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The wealth of information he gave me enabled me to do a 15-minute presentation at the PASAI in 

</span><span>Vanuatu.  I want you, please, to extend to him, and I did send him an email but I wanted to come 

</span><span>into this House for another reason. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It would be very helpful for Heads of Ministries when Parliamentarians are sent to workshops to 

be more cooperative and to assist Parliamentarians with their research.  So that, after all, we are 

representing our country, whether we are Government or Opposition, we are travelling on behalf

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>of our country.  And I believe that it is in the interest of our country that we are well prepared and 

well researched before we attend conferences.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  thank  you  very  much  to  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition and I well certainly convey those messages to the current Head of the Anticorruption 

Committee.  This was a committee that was set up with the makeup of senior government officials 

and  the  Anticorruption  Committee  forms  part  of  our  checks  and  balances  of  the  government 

systems to firstly, prevent corrupt practices from being taken up and secondly, to be able to catch 

any corrupt practices that may be undertaken.  I am very happy that our Anticorruption Committee 

ranks quite highly in the region.  And for the information of the Members of the House the Chair 

of the Anticorruption Committee does rotate amongst its membership and the current Chair now 

</span><span>is the Public Service Commissioner Carl Hunter.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The only thing I would like to point out to Members that maybe of interest to them is in the Budget 

Book  83  where  there  is  a  broader  description  of  the  Administered  Payments  that  Ministry  of 

Finance is responsible for.  We can see it is quite a significant amount just under the Administered 

Payment amount of over $23 million that Ministry of Finance is responsible for.  But if we take a 

closer look, we can see that bulk of that Administered Payment close to $18 million for this year 

is for the Airline Route Development or the Airline Subsidy.  

</span></div>
<div><span>But  the  Table  on  page  85  spells  out  exactly  where  each  of  this  Administered  Payment  by  the 

Ministry of Finance goes to.  The only other point that is interest for Members also is currently, 

the Ministry of Finance is involved in the work on the development of our sovereign wealth fund.  

And secondly, have finalised and will be presenting to Cabinet next week, the revised procurement 

policy.    And  that  will  help,  at  the  way  I  am  looking  at  it,  help  streamline  and  reduce  delays, 

particularly in the procurement of large capital project items.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So,  there  will  be  a  measure  of  training  provided  across  our  government  agencies  so  that 

</span><span>government agencies are very clear on what the procurement policy is and how they need to go 

</span><span>about in either procuring or tendering for services or goods.  And probably the third one I would 

just like to advise our Members is, the further work that we are now doing in the review of our 

</span><span>RMD,  our  tax  and  customs  division  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance.    There  needs  to  be  an 

</span><span>improvement  in  the  services  provided  to  individuals  and  companies  so  that  we  do  not  create 

</span><span>situations where companies will find themselves into hardship in order to try and meet their RMD 

</span><span>obligations.  And my policy and strategy with the team is to lift and improve their service and 

</span><span>support, rather than where the focus is right now is on enforcement and compliance.  If you can 

help an issue and find a solution, it is far better than trying to solve the problem once it is already 

occurred.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.
