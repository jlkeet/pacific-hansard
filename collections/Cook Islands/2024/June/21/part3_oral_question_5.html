<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to all Members of this House.  The 

hymn that we sang during our Opening Prayer and the thoughts shared by the Chaplain feel quite 

fitting for this allocation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>According  to  Book  2  on  crime  prevention,  I  notice  there  is  no  appropriation  for  Community 

Policing.  It could be due to financial constraints or recruitment issues.  However, it is reassuring 

to know that the Prime Minister has recognised this as an urgent service. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  Minister  for  Corrective  Services  said  yesterday  that  he’d  like  to  take  over  the  Police 

</span><span>Department.    We  know  he  has  good  intentions  but  I  do  not  agree.    The  reason,  we  have  three 

former Police members who are Members of Parliament in this House.  Between the three of them, 

they have 30 plus years of experience in our Police Force.  They know where we are failing today 

and I am sure they can assist our Police Force in improving the standards that we see today. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Vaka Puaikura Community Police was established in 2008 and unfortunately ceased operations in 

2016.    Crime  dropped  significantly  during  that  period  because  of  the  relationship  between  the 

community, our Vaka Police and our Volunteer Wardens. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The three Members of Parliament for Takitumu have supported this initiative and they see the need 

to revive community policing.  It is grassroots policing, connecting people with police and vice 

versa and it works and the results speak for themselves.</span></div>
<div><span>Three out of the 16 volunteer Police Wardens went onto careers within the Justice sector and five 

were warranted as Honorary Constables.   

</span></div>
<div><span>We’ve had eight major and 11 minor vehicle accidents so far this year in Puaik</span><span>ura and thankfully, 

no fatalities.  Six vehicles were clocked at over 110 kilo meters per hour by the traffic counter 

meter.  Bike theft and burglaries are on the rise and affecting families and businesses.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr Speaker, to our government, we implore you to take action now, recruit to bolster our ranks 

</span><span>and pay them well to provide this essential service for a safe and secure Cook Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As stated by our Chaplain, you have the power to change our lives for the better.  To our men and 

</span><span>women in blue, we applaud you for your sacrifices, we salute and thank you for your duty and 

</span><span>service and may the force be with you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Tukaka 

</span><span>Ama; you have the Floor.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. AMA:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker, Members of this Honourable House, and a special Kia 

Orana  to  the  Ngatangiia  constituency,  which  I  represent.    I  wish  to  thank  the  Member  from 

Puaikura for bringing up the topic of community policing in our respective districts. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I will keep this brief.  I support this Appropriation for one important reason.  After discussing with 

the Minister of Police once again, we both agreed that it is important to reintroduce community 

policing in the Takitumu district. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As our constituency forms the largest tourism sector, it is imperative that we prioritise community 

policing not just for the people of Ngatangiia but for every resident and tourist in the area.  Hence, 

I  extend  my  gratitude  to  the  Minister  for  allowing  us  to  establish  Community  Policing  in  the 

Ngatangiia district.  I have strategies in mind to assist our people, and some retired police officers, 

as mentioned earlier by the previous Member, reside in our area and can lend their support for 

</span><span>community policing.  This will benefit the entire Takitumu district. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, on behalf of myself and the Members of Matavera and Titikaveka, thank you to the 

Minister of Cultural Development for their support towards the Takitumu Cultural team for the 

upcoming Maire Maeva Nui.  Though I have not attended any of the practices, Vaitoti and I have 

been deeply moved to witness the children's splendid performances last night.  In conclusion, I 

support the appropriation for police.  Thank you.
