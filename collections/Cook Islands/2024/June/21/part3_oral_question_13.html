</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, before proceeding, I would like to extend our best 

wishes and a speedy recovery to our Clerk, currently on sick leave.  Our thoughts are with him 

during  this  time.    Additionally,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  new  Minister  Responsible  for  the 

Parliament  of  the  Cook  Islands  and  the  Minister  of  ICI  for  their  prompt  actions  to  rewire  the 

electrical systems in Parliament.  This ensured the uninterrupted proceedings of this Sitting. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My remarks pertain to the revisions in the allocation for Parliament, specifically the $450,000 for 

MP  Travels  and  Allowances.    It  also  includes  my  own  observations.    I  noted  that  in  the  2023 

Budget, the initial amount was $250,000, which was then supplemented by two top-ups totaling 

approximately $466,000.  My concern is  if  we plan to  increase the amount,  why  not  specify a 

figure that reflects the actual expenditure from last year?  This would provide transparency on the 

anticipated  expenses  for  MP  Travels  and  Allowances.    Moreover,  I  am  troubled  that  the  only 

increase in the Parliament budget pertains to MP Travels and Allowances.  As a member of the 

</span><span>PAC  that  visited  Wellington,  my  experience  informed  me  that  Parliament  lacks  sufficient 

</span><span>resources to support PAC effectively.  For instance, we do not have a research personnel to assist 

PAC  with  their  findings,  and  we  lack  a  designated  person  like  the  New  Zealand  Finance  and 

Expenditure  Committee  to  draft  reports  for  PAC's  consideration.    Every  Sitting  of  Parliament 

refers numerous reports to PAC for further elaboration.  My concern is unless we properly resource 

PAC, the quality of the reports from PAC may not be effective.  It is not about the composition of 

PAC; instead, it is the support system that we currently lack, which I urge the Minister Responsible 

for Parliament to address thoroughly. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My second point is a request for the Minister, Prime Minister, or Cabinet to review the workshops 

that we attend.  My belief is that if the workshop serves its purpose and benefits our country, then 

we  should  send  people  to  attend.    However,  if  it  does  not,  we  should  abstain  from  doing  so, 

disregarding that they may cover the airfare while we pay for the allowances. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My third point, Mr Speaker, concerns the requirement of Ministries to report their expenditure to 

the PAC.  I believe the same should apply to MPs attending workshops.  We should be accountable 

for  the  knowledge  we  gain  from  such  events  and  whether  they  provide  value  for  money.    In 

</span><span>essence, we should set an exemplary role model by reporting our expenses, just like we expect 

</span><span>Ministries  to  report  their  expenditure.    With  these  remarks,  Mr  Speaker,  I  fully  support  this 

</span><span>allocation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to everyone present in Parliament 

today.   I agree with the Leader of the Opposition and also wish the Clerk of Parliament a speedy 

recovery.  I must acknowledge that the Leader of the Opposition pre-empted me by thanking the 

Minister of ICI and those who participated in improving our building's infrastructure.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Let me reassure the House that we have already begun to assess the effectiveness and shortcomings 

of our procedures and processes within Parliament.  We will examine the cost-benefit analysis of 

bringing our outer islands constituents to Rarotonga, taking into account the timing of meetings to 

optimise  their  output.   The  goal  is  to  minimise  the  cost  of  transportation  while  prioritising  the 

results that can be achieved while they are on Rarotonga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As the Leader of the Opposition has referred to New Zealand practices, I believe it is necessary to 

fully utilise their visit on Rarotonga by engaging them in committee work during the morning and 

parliamentary  work  in  the  afternoon.    To  optimise  our  limited  resources,  we  should  consider 

bringing them to Rarotonga for one or two weeks so that they can complete both parliamentary 

and committee work without requiring additional intervals for their visit.  I have already discussed 

this with the Clerk and Deputy Clerk and expect that we will develop a program for the House and 

Parliamentary Services next week.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation and best wishes to the staff, Speaker, and 

everyone who has assisted Parliament's work, past and present.  Thank you.
