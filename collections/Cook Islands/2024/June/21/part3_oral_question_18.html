<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>OUTER ISLANDS </span><span>–</span><span> 15 minutes. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $13,404,603 for Outer Islands  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise quickly as I know many Members 

have an interest in speaking.  I support the allocation for Rakahanga, although it is relatively small.  

However, I am delighted to see that it includes the Pa Enua government building as a project under 

the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation.    This  building  in  Rakahanga  is  in  dire  need  of 

replacement and has been neglected for some time.  Therefore, I am delighted to hear that the new 

building should be completed sometime in the near future. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, I am curious if the recently mentioned cyclone shelter is intended for Rakahanga as 

it appears in the major project list.  Since Rakahanga is the only island remaining, we are the last 

country, aside from Nassau, I presume it is for our use.  Thus, I am pleased to see that two projects 

are scheduled for Rakahanga's progress. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, during the agriculture debates, I neglected to submit a petition for Rakahanga.  However, 

the Leader of the United Party had advised the acquisition of a digger to enhance taro farming in 

our region.  We take pride in our taro as it is the finest quality, and we do export to Manihiki, 

where taro is not grown.  Unfortunately, our labor resources are limited, and we need this digger 

to improve our swamp systems.  I humbly request consideration for this request, as it may help us 

expand our exports in the future.  I am uncertain of the cost, but the primary goal is to enhance our 

taro crop. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader.  I can see the Member for VAI-VAI-TAU; you 

</span><span>have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  As this is our final Vote Item, may we please have 

</span><span>five  hours  allocated  for  our  discussions?    I  note  that  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  had  spoken 

</span><span>extensively  earlier  about  the  PAC  and  our  travels.    It  seems  she  may  still  have  an  interest  in 

</span><span>returning to the PAC.  In any case, I would like to suggest that we set aside our individual concerns 

</span><span>and collaborate as a united front.  As the song goes, "My problems, your problems, let us put them 

away and work together."

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to express my support for the $13.4 million that have been allocated to the Outer 

Islands.  While I do understand that complaints are emerging from the Outer Islands, we must bear 

in  mind that we are accountable to  Parliament for this expenditure.  Since the inception of the 

PAC,  and  the  formation  of  Islands  Governments,  we  have  yet  to  receive  any  Annual  Reports 

regarding Outer Islands</span><span>’</span><span> expenditure.  This lack of transparency means that we, in Parliament and 

the Ministry of Finance, are unaware of how these funds are being utilised.  Despite this, we are 

determined to find ways to rectify this situation and improve upon it. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to point out that the government is providing additional funding to the 

Outer Islands beyond the $13 million, including investments in Health, Education, and Welfare 

through Internal Affairs, among other areas.  On our island of Aitutaki, we have already allocated 

$9 million towards various initiatives.   It  is  important  that as Members of Parliament from  the 

Outer  Islands,  we  communicate  with  our  constituents  about  the  amount  of  funding  we  have 

</span><span>received and how it will be utilised. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, I believe there are other avenues for us in the Outer Islands to enhance our financial 

situation.  The government has plans to improve the airport on Manihiki, and we have also heard 

the  Prime  Minister  mention  other  upcoming  projects  for  the  Outer  Islands.    They  are  actively 

seeking  funding  to  make  all  Outer  Island  airports  more  modern,  and  it  will  improve  living 

conditions.    This  is  one  way  to  ensure  that  tourists  visit  the  other  Outer  Islands,  including  the 

Northern group, and not just Rarotonga and Aitutaki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, we know that tourism is currently limited to Rarotonga and Aitutaki.  Therefore, we 

need to spread tourism to the other Outer Islands as well.  Mr Speaker, I will conclude as I have 

run out of time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  acknowledge  the  allocations  that  have  been 

assigned to the Pa Enua, which, in the past, were determined through a formula that heavily relied 

</span><span>on the population.  Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, as highlighted by the previous speakers, it is crucial 

</span><span>to explore ways to integrate our Pa Enua fully into the Cook Islands economy.  This objective will 

</span><span>only  be  achievable  if  we  prioritise  the  establishment  of  critical  infrastructure  that  enables 

</span><span>connectivity among the islands.  Connectivity that I am talking about is the connectivity through 

</span><span>ships, planes, and the internet to promote integration among our islands.  As I have stated before, 

</span><span>not just in this Chamber, but also via the media, the cost of achieving this objective in a small 

</span><span>nation like ours is disproportionately high when assessed on a per capita basis.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, it is imperative to devise innovative measures to tackle these financial barriers.  One 

such strategy could involve exploring the potential contributions of our diaspora residing in New 

</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>Zealand  and  Australia.    Moreover,  the  200th-anniversary  celebrations  have  taught  us  that  our 

people in Aitutaki, Nga-Pu-Toru, and now Mangaia possess a keen zeal to support significant and 

worthwhile undertakings.  They generously contributed a vast sum, as witnessed in the case of 

Mangaia alone, which exceeded a million dollars, for the festivities.  This exemplifies that our 

islands' residents have the potential to raise substantial sums that can enable their events' successful 

hosting and facilitate their people's return to their ancestral homes. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  know  that  there  is  a  big  event  planned  for  the  island  of  Penrhyn  with  the  opening  of  the 

</span><span>Orometua’s House that will take place next year.  Indications are that over a thousand people will 

</span><span>be coming to that event.  This is being financed by the people themselves.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, 

I  think  it  is  important  not  just  the  government's  contribution  to  the  Pa  Enua  that  we  are 

appropriating in this Budget but to acknowledge also the contribution by our own people that are 

making into their own islands.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I look forward, Mr Speaker, to the government looking for those avenues of financing that will 

enable us to bring each of our Pa Enua into the wider Cook Islands economy.  Thank you.
