<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I just like to thank the Honourable Members for 

their comments on this particular Vote Item in particular, our Member from Akoa and the Member 

from Ngatangiia in regards to Community Policing.  You can standby because we will be having 

a meeting and I will be calling on our Members of Parliament from Puaikura and from Takitumu 

to see how we can get our Community Program up and running as quickly as possible.  With the 

help with the likes of the Ministry of Finance to identify areas of resourcing that needs to be put 

in place so that we can have these programs running.  

</span></div>
<div><span>We can see the total appropriation amount is $6.1 million.  But we can see if we look at these 

figures that $1.5 million of that is depreciation.  This large figure of course is the depreciation of 

</span><span>our patrol boat and it puts a big dent in the appropriation that the Ministry has.  But I am confident 

</span><span>that working with the Ministry of Finance and working closely with the Police Department and 

our Members of Parliament in the districts that we will have much more effective policing moving 

forward.   

</span></div>
<div><span>As mentioned by the Member from Akaoa, there are three retired police officers in his team and 

their policing experience put together is in excess of 30 years.  But he forgot that in my team, the 

experience from the Member from Tupapa with police when tallied up is close to a hundred.  We 

heard the request from the Minister from Tupapa for the Police portfolio to be given to him.  We 

all know his character is that he is a person that when he sees something that needs to be done, he 

does it straight away.  That is why he is called the Action Man.  I have no doubt that he has the 

capability of carrying this portfolio.  But, Mr Speaker, this portfolio is my responsibility and I do 

not want to give it away.  So, these are the challenges I will take to make changes in this Ministry.  

Maybe in the future, this portfolio will be given to another Minister.  If I want to scare people, I 

will give it to the Minister of Corrective Services </span><span>(Laughter).</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.
