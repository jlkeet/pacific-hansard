<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $931,063 for Parliament Services  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div>
<div><span>JUSTICE</span><span>–</span><span> 15 minutes. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the sum of $3,179,977 for Justice  

stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  discuss  the  operations  of  the  Justice 

</span><span>Department, primarily due to timing.  Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the Justice Department 

staff  who  have  provided  exemplary  service.    It  is  commendable  that  many  have  abandoned 

outdated practices and have initiated positive changes.  Consequently, lawyers are seeing good 

service out of them.

</span></div>
<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is noteworthy that we have a robust system in place.  The Court sittings are satisfactory, and the 

schedule is prepared a year in advance.  Land sittings, Civil and Criminal sittings are held three 

times each regularly, and if necessary, sittings are also scheduled for the Court of Appeal. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, there has been an increase in Justices of the Peace sittings, and my colleague Janet 

Maki has been handling a significant portion of the backlog of Land Court applications as a Justice 

of the Peace.  Frequent sittings of the Land Court by Justices of the Peace have resulted in the 

clearance  of  the  list  of  outstanding  cases  for  judges.    This  aspect  of  the  Justice  Department  is 

operating effectively. 

</span></div>
<div><span>What we do have a problem with, Minister is, with two areas in particular.  There is a Division in 

the Ministry that does recording of orders on to register of titles of lands.  In simple terms what 

this means is once you have succeeded to your mother or father that then is entered onto the register 

</span><span>of that land to show that you are a landowner.  So that when you go to meetings called by the Court 

</span><span>they only call out the names of people whose names are on the register.  If your name is not on the 

register, even though you have succeeded, you have a problem. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, in my experience and bear in mind this is my playing ground, there is a real delay, a long delay 

between the making of the order and the entry onto the register of titles.  I have only given one 

example of many orders.  I am aware that the person who was leading or in charge of that aspect 

</span><span>has left, she’s retired and I am not aware whether there was ever succession plan in place but this 

</span><span>Mr Minister is an area that a new Secretary of Justice will have to focus on. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The second area relates to the payment of rental monies and that division I think I am aware that 

there are only two staff members looking after that area and it is best if I give you an example of 

</span><span>what I’m talking about. </span></div>
<div><span>About four years ago, the Court fixed the rental for the Pacific Resort in Aitutaki.  One or two 

months later the lessee, the Pacific Resort paid the outstanding rental which I think exceeded a 

hundred and something thousand to the Court for distribution.  As far as I am aware the first rental 

</span><span>might have been paid out last month, four years later. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is a better example, the other examples are probably ten or fifteen  years and it’s not only 

</span><span>difficult  for  our  locals  to  receive  their  rental,  the  process  is  even  more  difficult  if  you  are  not 

</span><span>resident in Rarotonga.  So, Mr Minister if you can assist with those two areas, I am sure our public 

</span><span>will be happy. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor.

<div><span>Ninth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Good afternoon to you, Members and staff of 

this House.  I take on board the comments highlighted by the Leader of the Opposition but before 

that at  the outset, let me take this opportunity,  Mr Speaker to  thank one of our most effective, 

humble and qualified Secretary of Justice, Mr Tamatoa Jonassen.  He has been serving and leading 

this Ministry in the last five years.  To me he was there mainly to tidy up all unfinished work, 

unattended and improve the work that former Secretaries all from Atiu like Terry Hagan, Mark 

</span><span>Short, Papa Nono and Tingika Elikana didn’t sort out when they were</span><span> there. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to welcome our new HOM, Mr Peter Graham.  I think he is Mangaian.  He has been 

one of our local lawyers working in the Police, regionally and lately from the Ministry of Marine 

resources.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The complimentary notes from the Leader of the Opposition have been targeted at praising our 

Justices of the Peace.  On that note I would like to thank the New Zealand High Commissioner 

and the Government of New Zealand for their support in assisting our Ministry in running trainings 

for all of our current JPs and as it is we are always looking at recruiting and appointing very good 

JPs to assist this Ministry. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, we have some inhouse teething issues that will require some delicate approach and 

resolving and I am confident that with the new HOM we can address these issues as raised by the 

Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Among other issues within the Ministry would also involve the Registry of Titles and payment of 

rental monies.  With those few comments  I would like to support the Budget.   Thank  you, Mr 

Speaker.
