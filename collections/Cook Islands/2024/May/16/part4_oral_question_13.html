<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Clerk, Parliamentary staff, 

and all the Honourable Members, as well as to our country's leaders, such as the Leader of the 

Opposition, the Leader of our Party, other representatives, and traditional leaders.  Kia Orana! 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I have a brief question to ask the Minister for Internal Affairs regarding the tender 

process  for  cleaning  our  roads  and  villages  on  our  island.    I  understand  that  the  last  tendering 

</span><span>process took place in 2018 and since then, I have not received any updates on the tendering process.  

</span><span>The reason for my inquiry is that I am aware that three individuals had submitted tenders for the 

</span><span>cleaning of roads throughout the island, but I am unsure about the status of the applications. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; Rose Toki-

</span><span>Brown; you have the Floor.

</span><span>as to all the leaders of the various parties and traditional leaders, Kia Orana.  I would also like to
