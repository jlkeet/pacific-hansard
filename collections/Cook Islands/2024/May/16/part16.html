<div><span>TOBACCO PRODUCTS CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL 2024 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown for the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Bill 2024  

be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Honourable Minister, George Angene 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>My topic of choice is to address you all.  Kia Orana to all Members of this 

House, including the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers, as well as those from the Opposition, 

United Party, One Cook Island and the Independent.  Kia Orana to the Honourable Speaker, the 

Clerk,  the  Deputy  Clerk  and  all  the  staff.    Furthermore,  I  wish  to  acknowledge  and  greet  my 

supporters from the Constituency of Tupapa-Maraerenga.  To my dependable followers, I extend 

my  thanks  and  appreciation  for  your  unwavering  support.    I  also  take  the  opportunity  to 

acknowledge the Ministry of Cultural Development, the traditional leaders of this Ministry, as well 

as the staff from the Ministry of Corrective Services.  In addition, Kia Orana to the various groups 

of people residing in my constituency, including those from Samoa, Fiji and other outer islands of 

</span><span>the north and south.  Finally, I express my gratitude to the European community for their support 

</span><span>during the election period. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in relation to this Bill on tobacco, I would like to share a personal story that highlights 

</span><span>my support for this initiative.  In 1992, I found myself incarcerated for some of the wrongs I had 

</span><span>committed, and was placed in a dark room.  This was not the first time I was locked up, but it was 

</span><span>the first time in my life that I felt true fear.  Growing up, I had never been afraid of anything or 

anyone, but the devil inside me had gained power and was controlling my life.  As I sat in the 

darkness of the room, I began to cry and spoke to God.  I challenged Him to help me become a 

better man in the future.  Through the grace of God, the light shone on me and an epiphany revealed

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>itself.  Though I was unable to read, write, or speak English, I prayed for strength and guidance to 

overcome these obstacles. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I proceed, Mr Speaker, I would like to make the House aware of my past.  I have committed 

assault against three pastors and two chiefs, and I have used pages from the Bible as wrapping 

paper for my cigarettes.  However, on the day I was locked in the dark room, I made a vow to God 

that  I  would  never  touch  alcohol  again  and  promised  to  take  my  own  life  if  I  ever  broke  that 

promise.  This promise was made on 18 June 1992.  Later on, I was transferred to the Maximum 

Block where I had a room to myself.  I asked one of the inmates to teach me how to read and write, 

and by 1997, I accomplished my goal.  I also made another promise to my wife and children that 

I would never go back to prison again.  Since then, for 32 years, I've managed to keep my promise 

and have never touched alcohol. However, I still continue to smoke cigarettes. 

</span></div><div><span>In light of the current Bill being discussed in the House, I would like to make a declaration.  As of 

8  p.m.  this  evening,  I  am  ending  my  relationship  with  cigarettes.    I  selected  this  specific  time 

because  it  marks  my  birth  date  and  Proverbs  8:8  states,  </span><span>"All  the  words  of  my  mouth  are  with 

</span><span>righteous; Nothing crooked or perverse is in them.‚Äù</span><span>  By quitting smoking, I am also setting an 

example for my newly born grandchild.  I do not want anyone smoking in or around my home, as 

I want my grandson to grow up in an environment that promotes a healthy lifestyle.  When young 

people drink alcohol, they are throwing away a block to build their future.  Six bottles each on 

Friday,  Saturday,  and  Sunday  equal  18  blocks  wasted  that  could  go  towards  building  a  better 

future.  Over 52 weeks, this equates to 2,225 discarded blocks.  Personally, I spent over $5,000 on 

cigarettes yearly and I challenge all young and old individuals to follow my example and give up 

this damaging practice.  I do not intend to judge others, as according to 1 Corinthians 13:11, </span><span>"When 

I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish 

things."</span><span>  I am a mature person and it is in my best interest to give up this harmful habit.  Lastly, I 

extend my gratitude to the Honourable Minister Rose Brown for introducing this Bill, and I fully 

support it. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr. Speaker, if I may, I would like to take these remaining six minutes to share with you a poem. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honorable Minister, please grant me a moment of your time.  I would like to 

</span><span>yield the Floor to the Honorable Minister Tingika Elikana for a brief moment. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  ELIKANA:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  I  apologise  for  interrupting  the  speech  of  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Minister  George  Angene,  but  as  I  observe  the  time,  I  would  like  to  propose  a  Motion.    In 

</span><span>accordance with Standing Order 40, Paragraph 2, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament be extended to the extent necessary  

</span><span>to complete all businesses of the House

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I now call the Minister George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE: </span><span> Mr Speaker, may I say my poem on how I was raised and grew up through 

having nothing and experiencing poverty. But today God has made me happy through my wife 

and my children and the support of my people. 

</span></div><div><span>(Recites poem in the Maori language) 

</span></div><div><span>I wrote this poem on the 4</span><span>th</span><span> August 1995 while I was in prison.  I wrote this especially for my 

children and the future generation.  Thank you very much Mr Speaker. May God bless us all.  Love 

you all my people.  Amen. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honorable  Minister,  your  message  has  resonated  with  the 

Opposition,  and  I  can  see  that  the  Honorable  Member,  Wesley  Kareroa,  is  now  standing.  

Honorable Wesley Kareroa; you now have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. KAREROA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you and Kia Orana to the Prime Minister, Cabinet 

Ministers, and all Members of the Government.  Kia Orana once again to our new Member, Mrs 

Tapaitau, who joined us yesterday in this Honorable House. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the leader of the United Party, Honourable Teariki Heather and 

your colleagues, Kia Orana to you all.  And finally, Kia Orana to our Leader of the Opposition and 

</span><span>all Members of the Opposition, Kia Orana to all of you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to convey my warmest regards to my constituency 

</span><span>Oneroa, located in Mangaia.  To all the hardworking people of Oneroa, Ivirua, and Tamarua who 

</span><span>are tirelessly preparing for the special 200-year anniversary celebration, tangi ke to you all.  I also 

</span><span>want to acknowledge Numangatini Ariki, all Council members, the Mayor, and your Executive 

</span><span>Officer, Kia Orana to all of you. 

</span></div><div><span>In addition, I would like to greet all the different denominations residing on our island.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to express my thoughts on this Bill, specifically regarding smoking.  I recall a couple 

of  years  ago,  when  Honourable  Member  George  Angene  and  I  were  the  only  Members  of 

Parliament who smoked at the time.  During one parliamentary session, we both opposed a Bill 

proposing  a  75  percent  increase  in  the  cost  of  cigarettes.    Our  united  front  was  successful  in 

rejecting the proposed cost increase. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, my friend has switched his stance on this Bill.  As a result, I see no point in opposing it as 

I stand alone.  I would like to appeal to the Honourable Members to bear with me, as many of my 

friends are heavy smokers.  Despite this, I have chosen to support my friend, the Honorable George 

Angene and stand in favour of this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Another reason why I am in support of this Bill is that I have a personal connection to the dangers 

of smoking and vaping.  Let me be clear, I am not making any promises that I will quit smoking 

</span><span>myself - that would be a lie.  However, about two years ago, a child in Mangaia was diagnosed 

</span><span>with a severe health condition and was flown to New Zealand for treatment.  Upon examination, 

doctors  discovered  that  one  side  of  the  child's  brain  was  significantly  damaged.    After  further 

investigation,  it  was  revealed  that  the  child,  only  three  years  old,  had  been  smoking  vape.    It 

remains unknown how the child obtained the instrument, but it is believed that it may have been 

brought to the island by a visitor. 

</span></div><div><span>This tragic incident highlights the dangers of vaping and smoking, and I share this story with you 

all to raise awareness on this pressing issue.  Moreover, I support this Bill precisely because this 

child  is  a  member  of  my  family,  and  I  am  committed  to  preventing  similar  incidents  from 

happening to anyone else.  I firmly hold the belief that smoking poses a serious threat to the health 

and wellness of our people.  Whether it be tobacco, marijuana, or vaping, these products can all 

have detrimental effects on our well-being.  

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, this Bill directly addresses the issue of smoking, particularly in regards to drivers of 

vehicles.  Those caught smoking inside a vehicle will be held accountable under this law, as such 

behavior poses a risk to the health of passengers and those in close proximity. 

</span></div><div><span>For these reasons and many others, I am happy to lend my support to this Bill.  I understand that 

my colleague and I might be the only smokers present in this House and have already expressed 

</span><span>our views.  Therefore, there may be no additional speakers on this topic.  Nevertheless, I remain 

</span><span>committed to supporting this crucial issue.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Leader of the United Party, Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I appreciate this opportunity to say thank you to a 

group of dedicated health staff.  I would like to take a moment to commend the exceptional efforts 

of "Oronga Ora" and specifically acknowledge the outstanding work of nurses Maui, Tarina, and 

Aroa.  These nurses are not employed by the Ministry of Health, yet they have demonstrated an 

unwavering  commitment  to  utilising  their  nursing  expertise  to  help  those  in  need  within  our 

community.  Their selfless actions deserve recognition and appreciation from us all.  Thank you 

again, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I was unaware of this until last November when they assisted my dear friend, Supa.  

From that point until his unfortunate passing, they tended to him vigilantly.  Thus, I want to express 

my utmost commendation and congratulations to these exceptional nurses.  Moreover, I sincerely 

pray that God bestows abundant blessings upon them for their outstanding work in aiding those in 

need on Rarotonga.  May God bless you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Their  funding  is  partially  supplied  by  international  agencies,  including  New  Zealand,  and  they 

receive medication for the individuals under their care from physicians.  Despite their invaluable 

efforts  in  tending  to  the  well-being  of  our  community,  they  do  not  receive  considerable 

compensation or salaries. 

</span></div><div><span>Returning to the current Bill being discussed in this House, I must express that as United Party 

representatives, we are unable to support it for several compelling reasons.  Firstly, concerning the 

proposed limitation on soft drinks, this measure could significantly harm those suffering from non-

communicable  diseases.    Moreover,  I  recall  a  past  instance  when  cigarette  prices  were  raised 

locally, and I did not support such action due to similar concerns. 

</span></div><div><span>The factors leading to the escalation of costs for cigarettes and other consumables, such as canned 

corned beef, are diverse.  Presently, Port Royale cigarettes of 50 milligrams are available at various 

vendors with varying prices of $55 to $65 per pack.  During my travels to Northern Group islands, 

namely Rakahanga, Manihiki, Penrhyn, and Pukapuka, I observed that smoking is a cherished part 

of their lifestyle.  Unfortunately, cigarette purchases are exorbitantly pricier there, twice as much 

</span><span>as Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>My inquiry is directed towards the Ministry of Health: what is the recorded number of individuals 

</span><span>who have passed away due to cigarette smoking in comparison to those afflicted with NCDs? 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday's Daily Bread advised us not to criticise others' eating habits since we may be guilty of 

</span><span>similar faults.  Personally, I refrain from smoking.  Furthermore, regardless of whether or not one 

smokes,  they  will  eventually  perish.    Smoking  can  exacerbate  health  issues  and  increase  the 

likelihood of an earlier demise.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the age of a person should not be a factor in the discussion of tobacco legislation as 

exemplified by the case of my grandfather, Papa George Faimau Robati, who is 94 years old and 

still smokes Rothmans.  I argue that smoking is a matter of freedom of choice and should not be 

regulated by law.  One's personal choices such as what to eat or drink should not be interfered with 

by others' opinions.  Our party opposes this bill because it punishes those who choose to purchase 

and smoke cigarettes despite knowing the risks.  

</span></div><div><span>As one of the oppositions in the Cabinet, I hold firmly to our belief that each individual should be 

responsible for their own smoking habits.  We are against the bill that is presented in this House 

because  it  interferes  with  personal  choices.    We  do  not  believe  that  the  government  should  be 

concerned with preventing illnesses caused by smoking as this would be interfering with personal 

choices.  If the aim is to protect people, then why not penalise people who put on weight?  This 

bill is not just for smokers but targets only a specific population, which is unfair.   To penalise 

</span><span>shops  and  importers  who  sell  tobacco  products  by  imposing  a  $10,000  fine  is  too  drastic  and 

</span><span>disproportionate.    Businesses  contribute  significantly  to  our  economy  and  they  should  not  be 

penalised for selling tobacco products.  

</span></div><div><span>I agree that some people choose to give up smoking, and the public is informed about the health 

risks associated with smoking.  However, we are not against the spirit of this bill, but we cannot 

support the punishment of our people and their ability to purchase their own cigarettes.  We need 

to protect our people, but we cannot do so by punishing them.  In fact, smoking is not the only 

issue as marijuana smoking is widespread on Rarotonga, and what are we doing about that?  

</span></div><div><span>I feel that this bill is unjust as it affects the livelihood of our people.  We need to create a balance 

between the cost of cigarettes compared to other daily essentials, such as a tin of corned beef at $8 

and cigarettes at $65.  One solution is to increase the cost of other items such as corned beef.  My 

company promotes planting local crops like taro and maniota, which are available at Prime Foods 

and Wigmore.  We have maintained the same price for two kilos of taro for the past year, which is 

vacuum packed and frozen, as we aim to support local people. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, we are opposed to this bill, not because we do not support the spirit of it, but because 

</span><span>we do not agree with punishing people for their personal choices.  We should be supporting our 

local  people  by  increasing  the  cost  of  necessary  items  rather  than  penalising  them  for  buying 

</span><span>cigarettes.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; 

</span><span>you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Perhaps I will be the final speaker before the Minister's 

final summary of this debate.  I have read this bill, and it primarily addresses areas where smoking 

</span></div><div><span>600 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>is prohibited.  I am pleased to see that this bill identifies non-smoking areas for the public, as signs 

have already been put up in Rarotonga.  I have no objection to the provisions established under 

this bill regarding public smoking.  

</span></div><div><span>Additionally,  I  have  no  qualms  about  the  Health  Ministry's  promotions  to  support  the  bill's 

objectives.  Their plan, which extends from now until 2030, aims to eventually eradicate cigarette 

smoking, provided that they can reduce it by two percent.  

</span></div><div><span>I support this Bill's merits and goals, and I strongly support charging individuals who smoke in 

public areas.  This is a summons letter from the Ministry of Health addressed to individuals caught 

smoking  in  prohibited  areas.    There  are  individuals  who  intentionally  smoke  in  front  of  non-

smokers,  despite  being  aware  of  the  consequences.    Hence,  I  fully  back  this  bill,  particularly 

concerning the imposition of fines through summonses for those caught smoking in non-smoking 

designated areas.  However, I also think that, if an allocated partition can be designated, such areas 

can be arranged for smokers within designated non-smoking zones. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  strongly  advocate  for  the  prohibition  of  vaping  in  our  country.    My  stance  is 

influenced by a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health involving our youth.  The outcome 

revealed that the majority of those affected reside in our Outer Islands, particularly on Aitutaki 

Island. Shockingly, children as  young as six years old were found to be vaping.  In one of our 

secondary schools, Tereora College, some students acknowledged vaping as a sweet-smelling and 

pleasant-tasting alternative to tobacco.  However, it was established that vaping is far more harmful 

than smoking cigarettes. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  proposing  a  complete  ban  on  vaping  in  our  country  and  beseech  my  fellow  Honourable 

Members to take this matter into serious consideration.  Regarding the smoking issue, the Ministry 

of Health is currently assessing when to enforce a ban.  This bill contains several amendments, 

including restrictions on smoking areas, and providing authority to the Minister.  I fully support 

the Minister's authority, as stated in the Bill, even though it requires consultation with other parties 

before its implementation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  will  conclude  my  speech  and  give  way  for  the  Minister's  final  statement.  

Nonetheless, my position on the matter is as follows: 

</span></div><div><span>1. 

</span><span>2. 

</span></div><div><span>Enforcement of a complete ban on vaping 

</span><span>Evaluation of non-smoking areas in public spaces, and urging smokers not to smoke 

</span><span>in these areas while supporting the Minister's authority. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the Ministers who have 

expressed their perspectives on this Bill.   Before  I proceed,  I  would like  to  thank  the Solicitor 

General  from  Crown  Law  and  his  team  for  their  effort  in  drafting  this  Bill  for  the  House.  

Additionally,  I  would  like  to  pay  tribute  to  the  Honourable  Minister  George  Angene  for  his 

dedicated commitment to this issue.  During the Public Health Act debate, he took the Floor to 

convey his views, and he remains steadfast in his message.  I commend him for adhering to his 

promise and standing firmly to enforce his decision to quit smoking. 

</span></div><div><span>Indeed, the Honourable Minister George Angene can be stubborn,  and I recall a time when we 

proposed reducing smoking in public spaces, particularly the Punanga Nui market area.  I vividly 

remember the day when the "no-smoking sign" was erected, and that evening, I drove past the area 

and  saw  the  Minister  smoking  right  beneath  the  notice.    I  spoke  to  him,  but  he  ignored  me.  

Similarly, he visited my house where there is a big "no smoking" sign, but he disregarded it and 

lit up a cigarette in our presence.  Therefore, I am grateful to God for guiding him and using him 

as an example for his family and the people. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, I extend the Head of the Ministry of Health's gratitude to the Honourable Minister for his 

unwavering  support.    Thank  you.    Perhaps  tomorrow,  our  Honourable  Member  from  Oneroa, 

Wesley Kareroa, will express his support for the proposal to quit smoking. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, I wish to acknowledge the Leader of the United Party for sharing his thoughts on this 

issue.  However, concerning raising the minimum age, we have not included that aspect in this 

Amendment Bill.  As stated by the Honourable Member from Matavera, our main intention is to 

permanently ban vaping.  During our consultations with the public, concerns were raised regarding 

vaping and the potential to also ban smoking.  Moreover, it has been observed that many children 

have started vaping without realising the adverse effects it will have on their lives and those around 

them. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, our professional officers and health specialists proposed this initiative, as vaping is a 

new  phenomenon  in  our  country.    Health  professionals  have  also  discovered  that  most  of  the 

</span><span>illnesses in recent times are caused by smoking.  Many people, including passive smokers, are 

</span><span>affected by smoking's harmful effects.  The Ministry of Health is proposing to reduce the number 

</span><span>of smokers in our country to 5 percent by 2030 or even lower to 2 percent.  However, one of the 

</span><span>issues we face is the expensive cost of cigarettes.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My encouragement, as I previously stated during the Public Health Act, is to encourage expectant 

mothers to quit smoking before their babies are born.  This will prevent exposing the babies from 

being affected by smoke and educate them on the health risks associated with smoking. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I urge all Honourable Members and those listening to support these proposals, which 

were initially introduced in 2007.  These proposals aim to ban vaping in our country and improve 

the enforcement of designated smoking areas and non-smoking areas.  Although you have the right 

to do what you wish with your own body, the Ministry of Health and the Government are proposing 

these measures to assist our citizens in living longer and healthier lives. 

</span></div><div><span>It is also proposed to ensure the implementation of these laws, particularly in spaces accessible to 

the public, such as public transport.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to present the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Bill 

2024.  I pray that God blesses us all, and our nation.  I would like to extend my appreciation to the 

Ministry of Health and all the people of Rarotonga and the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister and Honourable Members.
