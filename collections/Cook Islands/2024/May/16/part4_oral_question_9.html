<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, I have three questions that I would like to ask you.  

Firstly, why is there no government office in Aitutaki that can provide assistance to our elderly 

citizens?  Secondly, why is there a prolonged delay in processing their applications?  Finally, what 

has become of the three applications that were submitted on 6 January 2024, as there has been no 

response to them thus far?  Once you have provided your responses, I may have additional inquiries 

to pose.
