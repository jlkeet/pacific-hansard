<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>MR  T.  ISAMAELA:</span><span>    Kia  Orana,  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  intended  for  the  Minister  of 

Immigration, but before I proceed, I want to express my support for the request of the Member for 

Matavera, Vaitoti Tupa, to obtain an excavator for his constituency.  I would also like to request 

the same for my constituency, Amuri-Ureia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I pose my question, I would like to share some details about my query.  On behalf of the 

Members  of  Parliament  from  Aitutaki,  I  extend  a  warm  welcome  to  our  new  Member  from 

</span><span>Tongareva, Sarakura Tapaitua, for representing the people of Penrhyn.  I also wish to congratulate 

</span><span>our Deputy Speaker, Tuakeu Tangatapoto from Mitiaro, for his appointment to the post of Deputy 

Speaker.  I take this opportunity to greet all the Honourable Members of this House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  on  Aitutaki,  a  volunteer  is  dedicated  to  assisting  our  elderly  citizens  who  have 

repatriated  to  the  island.    He  assists  them  in  securing  their  New  Zealand  pension  and 

superannuation,  which  is  not  his  designated  responsibility,  as  this  service  is  performed  by  the 

Executive Officer when he is on the island.  Our volunteer is making a valuable contribution by 

serving the elderly in my constituency.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Previously, the Customs office at the MFEM office provided this type of assistance, specifically 

in  relation  to  travel  declaration  forms.  However,  this  service  is  now  unavailable  on  Aitutaki, 

causing a significant problem for our elderly citizens, as they now have to fly to Rarotonga and 

schedule an appointment with MFEM to address this issue. The volunteer, who assists the elderly 

in my constituency, faces this challenge. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The elderly individuals have to pay a fee of $25 to the government and bear the cost of flying to 

</span><span>Rarotonga,  completing  the  necessary  formalities  and  returning  to  their  homeland,  Aitutaki. 

</span><span>Previously,  support  had  existed  for  these  individuals  on  Aitutaki,  but  changes  have  made  it 

burdensome for our people. If these elderly citizens receive their travel declaration documents, 

</span><span>they will be unable to visit the New Zealand High Commission office to begin processing their 

</span><span>pension application. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  second  problem  is  the  lengthy  waiting  period  for  approval  from  MFEM,  which  takes 

approximately three to six months, and in some cases, over a year.  I do not intend to blame or 

criticise anyone, but I want to underscore the challenges that our people are facing.
