<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member from Matavera for your question.  As you 

mentioned God's Words, I would like to respond with another Bible Verse: "Seek and you will 

find; knock and the door will be opened to you."  Therefore, if you send me your request, I will 

provide a response. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding how I acquired my excavator, it was through the Chinese, after a request was made by 

George Angene.  It is not true that the Government approved the machine, as some have falsely 

claimed. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In response to your request for an excavator for Matavera, I fully support it.  Please visit my office, 

</span><span>and  we  can  collaborate  to  determine  how  to  navigate  this  process.    I  would  like  to  extend  an 

invitation for you to visit my office, where I can provide you with a plan for obtaining a machine 

</span><span>for your constituency.  However, I must admit that I am uncertain about your proposal, as there 

</span><span>are several Members of Parliament seeking access to similar resources that I have acquired.  In 

</span><span>this  regard,  I  recommend  that  you  also  seek  assistance  from  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Albert 

</span><span>Nicholas. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to reflect on the Bible Verse shared by our Chaplain today</span><span>: </span><span>"Do not judge, or you too 

will be judged," as stated in Matthew 7:1.  The Verse reminds us that we should avoid judging

before pointing out the defects of others.
