</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to speak on the Bill first before we proceed. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, you may continue Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, we have brought this Bill before the 

House to rectify an oversight in our current immigration legislation, as I am sure we are all aware.  

This oversight was identified as a result of the actions taken by the Friends of Fiji, challenging the 

provisions  of  the  Cook  Islands  Immigration  Regulations  of  2022.    These  provisions  offered 

preferential treatment to our friends from New Zealand over other countries.  I am confident that 

we all know the decision of the court on this matter. 

</span></div><div><span>The key finding of the court was that these preferential treatments were invalid because they are 

not part of the domestic or national laws of the Cook Islands.  It is important to note that regulations 

are executive decisions that typically follow parliamentary actions, such as legislation or principal 

acts.    However,  the  court  found  that  the  law  passed  by  Parliament  does  not  allow  for  this 

preferential treatment. 

</span></div><div><span>The  oversight  occurred  because  Section  3  of  the  current  Immigration  Act  does  not  refer  to 

international  obligations,  and  the  court  was  clear  that  the  joint  declaration  between  the  Cook 

Islands and New Zealand is indeed a treaty.  If the Cook Islands intends to include the provisions 

of this treaty and joint declarations as part of our domestic laws, they must be incorporated into an 

Act of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>This was not captured in Section 3 of the current Act, which I mentioned in my opening statement.  

However, the proposed Amendment Bill now includes this in Section 3.  In the past, there have 

been  several  instances  where  Cook  Islands'  international  obligations  were  incorporated  into 

domestic law, such as in Section 2 of the Civil Aviation Act of 2002, stating that the purpose of 

this Act is to: 

</span></div><div><span>(a)</span><span>Establish rules of operation and divisions of responsibility within the civil aviation system 

</span></div><div><span>in order to promote aviation safety and security; and 

</span></div><div><span>(b)</span><span>Ensure  that  the  Cook  Island’s  obligations  under  inte</span><span>rnational  aviation  agreements  are 

</span></div><div><span>implemented. 

</span></div><div><span>The  convention  on  international  civil  aviation,  ratified  by  the  Cook  Islands  through  the  Cook 

</span><span>Islands instrument of adherence, effective September 1986, is central to the Act.  As I mentioned 

earlier, the joint declaration between New Zealand and the Cook Islands allows for preferential 

</span><span>treatment, especially in Article 2.2, where it states that "the government of the Cook Islands will 

</span><span>accord New Zealand citizens preferential considerations in respect of entry into and residence in 

the Cook Islands."

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Unfortunately, our current Act does not provide for this preferential treatment.  However, as is 

evident from the proposed amendment to Section 4 stating that:  

</span></div><div><span>Section 3 replaced (Purpose) 

Replace section 3 with: 

Purpose 

</span><span>“3</span><span>

The purpose of this Act is to manage immigration to the Cook Islands in a way that- 

balances the national interest, as determined by the Crown, and the rights of  

</span><span>“(a)</span><span>

individuals; and 

</span></div><div><span>“(b)</span><span>  meets the international obligations of the Cook Islan</span><span>ds.”</span></div><div><span>The thrust of this proposed legislation is to rectify the oversight identified in the court's decision.  

Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister, Vaine Mokoroa 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is still open for debate.  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition and you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I rise to express my views concerning this Bill.  

Firstly, I have perused the Chief Justice Keene's judgment from 7 March 2024, relating to the case 

fought by the Friends of Fiji.  Moreover, I was a member of the Select Committee on Immigration 

at the time, and the Crown Law Office also advised the Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the Minister's mention of the oversight, it was undoubtedly an oversight not to inform 

the Select Committee about the joint declaration with New Zealand.  The previous Minister who 

spoke was also a member of the Select Committee.  Therefore, three lawyers in the Committee did 

not identify it.   

</span></div><div><span>However, I am confident that if we had been informed of the joint declaration with New Zealand, 

we would not be discussing this Amendment Bill today.  Conversely, I believe that the amended 

</span><span>Section  3  addresses  that  issue  because  it  makes  reference  to  us  meeting  our  international 

</span><span>obligations. 

</span></div><div><span>During the legal proceedings, the court faced three questions and resolved the first two.  The final 

question relates to Article 64 of the Constitution, which addresses fundamental human rights and 

freedoms.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The Judge explained that they could not provide an answer to the aforementioned query because 

they already stated that the Regulation was invalid.  Therefore, it is my hope that the amended Act 

will clarify why New Zealanders are given preferential treatment, and we will not breach Article 

64's balancing act.  I am confident that the Minister of Immigration discussed this matter with the 

Crown Law Office because we do not wish to return to court due to that provision. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my comments, and we support this Amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Kia Orana to everyone present in this Honourable House today, and also to 

our people listening through the radio.  I want thank the Honourable Minister Responsible for this 

Bill  for  clarifying  the  purpose  of  the  proposed  amendments.    I  would  also  like  to  thank  the 

Interpreter for providing a lucid translation. 

</span></div><div><span>It is true that the Committee responsible for handling this aspect of the Act made an error, and 

today's action seeks to correct that mistake.  Moreover, I acknowledge that Article 64 has created 

numerous issues for our country.  This Article affects the rights regarding religion, and we must 

tread carefully about what goes on within our borders as it will undoubtedly influence us. 

</span></div><div><span>There are many religious groups entering our country today, causing changes in the way we view 

religion.    In light  of this,  I urge these new religious bodies to  stay  away  from  our country and 

perhaps proceed to Papua to preach the Gospel there.  Although this is happening presently, when 

will  we  awaken  to  protect  our  ancestral  heritage?    These  are  my  views  on  the  principles  and 

benefits of the Bill.  My Party supports this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Teariki Heather.  Thank you, Honourable Members for 

your contribution.  I will now put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion for the Second Reading of the  

Cook Islands Immigration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2024 be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK:  </span><span>Short Title:  Cook Islands Immigration Amendment Act (No.2) 2024.
