</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I stand to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Manatua Cable Protection Bill 2024

</span></div><div><span>574

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion?  I see the 

Honourable Minister Mokoroa. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister, Vaine Mokoroa 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill.  I 

see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition the Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I stand in the support of this Bill, which aims to 

safeguard the two cable sites, one in Aitutaki at the airport and the other in the Rutaki passage. 

</span></div><div><span>After reading the Bill, it seems like it is intended to protect big boats other than our small Tapi 

Taio Shipping. I agree that the penalty, along with the Captain, should also apply to the owner of 

the vessel if they breach the offence. As opposition, we support this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Leader of the United 

Party the Honourable Teariki Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER: </span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I support this Bill to protect the undersea cables 

that go through our ocean.  We are aware of the significant benefits that we can get from these 

cables, specifically on the islands of Aitutaki and Rarotonga.  I also agree with the severe penalties 

that will be imposed on the boat owners and operators who breach the law.  Therefore, I will not 

prolong the discussion on this matter and affirm our support for the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Toanui Isamaela of One 

Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to express my opinion concerning this Bill as it 

mentions the cable situated in Aitutaki.  It is crucial to safeguard this cable, and I entirely support 

</span><span>this notion.  It is especially essential as it lies within the constituency of Amuri and Ureia.  Thank 

</span><span>you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  This Bill's objective is to shield the areas near the 

</span><span>cables that run from the ocean onto our shores. The condition of the loan acquired to pay for the 

cable necessitates us to establish safeguarded areas around it, starting from the ocean onto the reef, 

and extending onto the beach.  Although it took some time, we have successfully implemented 

both legislative and physical protections such as encasing the cables in steel cover. Being the only

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>fisherman diver in the team, I can affirm that divers in Aitutaki may shoot the cable unintentionally 

while trying to target fish.  That is why steel encasing is necessary to prevent damage.   

</span></div><div><span>Passing this legislation is paramount to ensure that the cable's insurance takes place.  As we have 

seen in Tonga recently before the eruption of the volcano, a ship's anchor dragged across the cable 

and broke it.  Without the insurance, the cost to repair the damage would have been exorbitant.  

Thus, it is imperative that we have these measures in place to protect our cable and ensure it is 

covered by insurance.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister 

Responsible. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>I rise to thank the four leaders in this House for exemplifying a spirit of 

unity  in  endorsing  this  Bill.    I  have  faith  that  this  support  will  continue  during  our  budget 

discussions. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion for the Second Reading of the  

Manatua Cable Protection Bill 2024 be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK:  </span><span>Short Title: Manatua Cable Protection Act 2024.
