<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, every Member of this House, 

and to all those listening in to our Session today. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday,  the  Honourable  Member  from  Akaoa  posed  a  question  to  me  regarding  the  $400 

</span><span>thousand  that  was  allocated  in  the  previous  financial  year  for  a  foreshore  protection  proposal 

</span><span>concept note.  To save time during our Question Time, I have comprehensive documentation that 

</span><span>I  would  like  to  hand  over  to  the  Honourable  Member  to  read  tonight  before  bed.    The 

</span><span>documentation clearly stipulates what has happened since the financial year budget was approved. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In summary, the process to approve the concept note for this program required a requested tender, 

</span><span>which had to go through an RFQ and obtain approval from both the MFEM and Crown Law Office.  

</span><span>Currently, the documentation is with Crown Law, but they have assured us that it will be ready by 

</span><span>the end of this month, after which we can proceed with the tender.  However, given that we are 

nearing the end of the financial year 2023/24, we will apply to carry forward this budget of $400 

thousand into the 2024/25 financial year.

<div><span>That is where we currently stand Mr Speaker, but there are more details to the matter, and I am 

happy to provide the Honourable Member with the documentation for further clarification.  Thank 

you.
