<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>My apologies, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister, who was asked a question 

yesterday.  Would the Minister kindly provide a response to that question, please? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, every Member of this House, 

and to all those listening in to our Session today. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday,  the  Honourable  Member  from  Akaoa  posed  a  question  to  me  regarding  the  $400 

</span><span>thousand  that  was  allocated  in  the  previous  financial  year  for  a  foreshore  protection  proposal 

</span><span>concept note.  To save time during our Question Time, I have comprehensive documentation that 

</span><span>I  would  like  to  hand  over  to  the  Honourable  Member  to  read  tonight  before  bed.    The 

</span><span>documentation clearly stipulates what has happened since the financial year budget was approved. 

</span></div><div><span>In summary, the process to approve the concept note for this program required a requested tender, 

</span><span>which had to go through an RFQ and obtain approval from both the MFEM and Crown Law Office.  

</span><span>Currently, the documentation is with Crown Law, but they have assured us that it will be ready by 

</span><span>the end of this month, after which we can proceed with the tender.  However, given that we are 

nearing the end of the financial year 2023/24, we will apply to carry forward this budget of $400 

thousand into the 2024/25 financial year.

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>That is where we currently stand Mr Speaker, but there are more details to the matter, and I am 

happy to provide the Honourable Member with the documentation for further clarification.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  It seems that the Honourable Member will 

be pleased to take possession of this document. 

</span></div><div><span>I now see the Honorable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  directed  to  the  Minister  of  Cultural 

Development.   Reflecting on the Daily Bread that our Chaplain shared with us earlier, "do not 

condemn, and you will not be condemned," I am curious to know how the Minister acquired his 

excavator.  Specifically, I am keen to learn about the steps he took to procure it, as I believe this 

</span><span>information can be useful in helping Matavera acquire one as well. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  aware  that  many  people  have  seen  the  Minister's  excavator,  and  I  commend  him  for 

successfully acquiring one.  My request for the Minister is if he can provide any advice on how 

Matavera can obtain its own excavator.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I can see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member from Matavera for your question.  As you 

mentioned God's Words, I would like to respond with another Bible Verse: "Seek and you will 

find; knock and the door will be opened to you."  Therefore, if you send me your request, I will 

provide a response. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding how I acquired my excavator, it was through the Chinese, after a request was made by 

George Angene.  It is not true that the Government approved the machine, as some have falsely 

claimed. 

</span></div><div><span>In response to your request for an excavator for Matavera, I fully support it.  Please visit my office, 

</span><span>and  we  can  collaborate  to  determine  how  to  navigate  this  process.    I  would  like  to  extend  an 

invitation for you to visit my office, where I can provide you with a plan for obtaining a machine 

</span><span>for your constituency.  However, I must admit that I am uncertain about your proposal, as there 

</span><span>are several Members of Parliament seeking access to similar resources that I have acquired.  In 

</span><span>this  regard,  I  recommend  that  you  also  seek  assistance  from  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Albert 

</span><span>Nicholas. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to reflect on the Bible Verse shared by our Chaplain today</span><span>: </span><span>"Do not judge, or you too 

will be judged," as stated in Matthew 7:1.  The Verse reminds us that we should avoid judging

</span></div><div><span>others, as we will also face judgment.  It also suggests that we should be mindful of our own flaws 

before pointing out the defects of others. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Toanui Isamaela and 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  ISAMAELA:</span><span>    Kia  Orana,  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  intended  for  the  Minister  of 

Immigration, but before I proceed, I want to express my support for the request of the Member for 

Matavera, Vaitoti Tupa, to obtain an excavator for his constituency.  I would also like to request 

the same for my constituency, Amuri-Ureia. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I pose my question, I would like to share some details about my query.  On behalf of the 

Members  of  Parliament  from  Aitutaki,  I  extend  a  warm  welcome  to  our  new  Member  from 

</span><span>Tongareva, Sarakura Tapaitua, for representing the people of Penrhyn.  I also wish to congratulate 

</span><span>our Deputy Speaker, Tuakeu Tangatapoto from Mitiaro, for his appointment to the post of Deputy 

Speaker.  I take this opportunity to greet all the Honourable Members of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  on  Aitutaki,  a  volunteer  is  dedicated  to  assisting  our  elderly  citizens  who  have 

repatriated  to  the  island.    He  assists  them  in  securing  their  New  Zealand  pension  and 

superannuation,  which  is  not  his  designated  responsibility,  as  this  service  is  performed  by  the 

Executive Officer when he is on the island.  Our volunteer is making a valuable contribution by 

serving the elderly in my constituency.  

</span></div><div><span>Previously, the Customs office at the MFEM office provided this type of assistance, specifically 

in  relation  to  travel  declaration  forms.  However,  this  service  is  now  unavailable  on  Aitutaki, 

causing a significant problem for our elderly citizens, as they now have to fly to Rarotonga and 

schedule an appointment with MFEM to address this issue. The volunteer, who assists the elderly 

in my constituency, faces this challenge. 

</span></div><div><span>The elderly individuals have to pay a fee of $25 to the government and bear the cost of flying to 

</span><span>Rarotonga,  completing  the  necessary  formalities  and  returning  to  their  homeland,  Aitutaki. 

</span><span>Previously,  support  had  existed  for  these  individuals  on  Aitutaki,  but  changes  have  made  it 

burdensome for our people. If these elderly citizens receive their travel declaration documents, 

</span><span>they will be unable to visit the New Zealand High Commission office to begin processing their 

</span><span>pension application. 

</span></div><div><span>The  second  problem  is  the  lengthy  waiting  period  for  approval  from  MFEM,  which  takes 

approximately three to six months, and in some cases, over a year.  I do not intend to blame or 

criticise anyone, but I want to underscore the challenges that our people are facing.

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, you have provided a detailed explanation on the issue, 

and it appears that the Minister is prepared to respond to your query.  Kindly request that you ask 

your specific question now. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, I have three questions that I would like to ask you.  

Firstly, why is there no government office in Aitutaki that can provide assistance to our elderly 

citizens?  Secondly, why is there a prolonged delay in processing their applications?  Finally, what 

has become of the three applications that were submitted on 6 January 2024, as there has been no 

response to them thus far?  Once you have provided your responses, I may have additional inquiries 

to pose. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I have noticed that the Honourable Minister 

is prepared to respond to your inquiry. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I have a question for the Ministry of Immigration, 

who are responsible for safeguarding our borders and boundaries. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I pose my question, I would  like to request permission to visit the Ministry and inquire 

whether the Member of Parliament for whom I am advocating has previously raised these issues 

with them, in order to better address the issue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Robert Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Kia Orana to you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Clerk, Parliamentary staff, 

and all the Honourable Members, as well as to our country's leaders, such as the Leader of the 

Opposition, the Leader of our Party, other representatives, and traditional leaders.  Kia Orana! 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have a brief question to ask the Minister for Internal Affairs regarding the tender 

process  for  cleaning  our  roads  and  villages  on  our  island.    I  understand  that  the  last  tendering 

</span><span>process took place in 2018 and since then, I have not received any updates on the tendering process.  

</span><span>The reason for my inquiry is that I am aware that three individuals had submitted tenders for the 

</span><span>cleaning of roads throughout the island, but I am unsure about the status of the applications. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; Rose Toki-

</span><span>Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker.  Clerk and the Parliamentary staff, as well 

</span><span>as to all the leaders of the various parties and traditional leaders, Kia Orana.  I would also like to

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>give  a  special  welcome  to  our  newly  elected  Member  of  Parliament,  Sarakura  Tapaitau.    I  am 

pleased that you have taken up this responsibility to represent the people of Tongareva. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the Honourable Member's inquiry, I would kindly request some time to consult with 

the relevant Ministry, after which I will provide a suitable response.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I have observed two matters that could be 

addressed  outside  of  the  House,  namely,  the  concern  raised  by  the  Honourable  Member  Toa 

Isamaela and the query brought forth by the Honourable Member for Akaoa, as we will not be 

having a meeting tomorrow.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is now handed over to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Tina 

Pupuke Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Good Afternoon to everyone.  Kia 

Orana to all the Members present here including you, Mr Speaker, along with your staff, the Prime 

Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Members  of  Opposition,  United  Party,  and  Independent  Party 

Representatives.   I would also like to acknowledge the King's Representative and  your spouse, 

who are listening to the broadcast.  Kia Orana to the Kaumaiti and the House of Ariki, the Leaders 

of the Churches, and people from the Northern Group and Southern Group, both here in Rarotonga 

and abroad. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Prime Minister, I have a question for you.  Two groups from our country recently travelled to 

Fiji for a workshop, which I believe was an essential duty travel.  During that period, I saw many 

tourists visiting Fiji and I believe, just like us, they are also trying to recover from the pandemic.  

I recollect reading in the Cook Islands news last year that we were exploring the possibility of an 

airline flying from Nadi to the Cook Islands to promote tourism.  Could you please update us on 

where we stand concerning this matter at present? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  Tina  Pupuke  Browne  and  I  see  the  Prime 

</span><span>Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you for the question.  The airline flights that we are working on to 

</span><span>come  into  our  country,  we  certainly  did  put  a  recommendation,  a  proposal  to  Fiji  Airways  to 

</span><span>consider a flight from Nadi to Rarotonga and we went a step further and helped to facilitate a direct 

</span><span>flight,  a  charter  flight  from  Nadi  to  Rarotonga  to  bring  the  participants  and  the  leaders  for  the 

</span><span>Pacific Islands Forum and that proved to be a successful flight.  

</span></div><div><span>But the airline business is a tough business and airlines will look to where they can be assured that 

their flights will provide the best return.  We were certainly attracted to Fiji Airways because they 

</span></div><div><span>573 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>have now a well-established network into North America, the United States and Canada and in the 

last year they posted a $1 billion profit and they also took possession of two brand new aircrafts 

just last year and I have just seen the recent announcement from the CEO that they are looking to 

expand their market into America. 

</span></div><div><span>Understandably so, because America is a huge market of millions of potential tourists whereas we 

are a small market of a few thousand passengers that will travel and one of the only ways that we 

can make ourselves attractive to airlines is to what we are doing now, look at subsidising air flights 

into our country. 

</span></div><div><span>But  this  of  course  requires,  Mr  Speaker  careful  analysis,  cost  analysis  to  be  part  of  the  wider 

programme of marketing our destination and to work out the cost benefit of this additional subsidy.  

Right now this is not something that we can entertain and so at this stage there is no indication that 

</span><span>we will have a direct flight with Fiji Airways coming through to Rarotonga.  However, the future 

</span><span>remains promising and if the airline sees that there is an opportunity to make a decent return, a fair 

return then I have no doubt we will be an attractive destination. 

</span></div><div><span>But make no mistake we have a tourism destination and we operate a tourism product that is up 

there at the top.  Fiji brings in a million tourist a year into Fiji compared to their population of just 

under a million </span><span>–</span><span>900 thousand, that’s almost one for one.</span></div><div><span>Just prior to COVID we were bringing in just under 180,000 visitors compared to our resident 

population of around 18</span><span>,000 that’s ten to one.  So, Fiji had a tourism product like we would, they 

</span><span>would be bringing in ten million tourist a year not one million.  But we remain open, Mr Speaker 

to any opportunity from any airline that wishes to come into our country particularly looking at 

expanding our market through North America and Europe.  We have run out of time, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister and thank you all Members who raised 

questions and those who provided answers.
