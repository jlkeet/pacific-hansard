</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Clerk.  That completes the First, Second and Third Reading of the 

Cook Islands Immigration Amendment Bill (No.2) 2024. 

</span></div><div><span>Before suspending this Sitting, I wish to acknowledge the attendance of the Head of the Ministry 

of Health, who is with us in the Public Gallery.  You are cordially invited to join us for lunch.  I 

am suspending the Sitting until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.13 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please be seated and I call the House to Order.  Our next Bill on the Order is 

</span><span>the Public Health Bill 2024.  I call the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown for the Second 

</span><span>Reading of the Bill.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I move:

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister, George Angene 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue if you want to. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Kia Orana to all Members of this House, including our Leader.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker for granting me the opportunity to speak about the principles and merits of this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I come before this distinguished House in acknowledgment of my status as a confirmed champion 

heavy smoker.  With this in mind, my aim is to highlight the benefits that this Bill could bring, and 

</span><span>I look forward to doing so later in my presentation.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this privilege. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR.  V.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    May  I  request  your  permission  to  offer  a  brief 

acknowledgement before proceeding with my speech? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:    </span><span>Firstly,  I  would like to express  my  commendation to  the Clerk of the House, 

Deputy  Clerk,  and  their  colleague.    Mr  Speaker,  during  a  recent  trip  with  Member  Teokotai 

Herman to Fiji, we had the opportunity to witness the excellent support provided by your staff in 

Parliament.  I therefore commend the Clerk of Parliament and his staff for their tremendous efforts. 

</span></div><div><span>Moving on to the Bill, Mr Speaker, I acknowledge that it highlights some of the challenges facing 

</span><span>our nation.  Part 11 of the Bill specifically concerns our people, both those on Rarotonga and other 

parts  of  the  Cook  Islands.    I  have  read  through  the  Bill  and  noticed  that  there  is  provision  for 

</span><span>regulations,  including one regarding burial  at  sea.    This  has been a source of difficulty  for our 

</span><span>traditional leaders and the Cook Islands Christian Church, and it is therefore inspirational to see 

</span><span>the introduction of this Bill by the Minister and the Secretary for Health. 

</span></div><div><span>When I worked for the Environment Services, we were often the subject of blame for authorising 

</span><span>these burials at sea.  However, there is no provision for this in the Environment Act, and even 

today, there is no authorisation for burial at sea.  Therefore, I implore that upon the passing of the 

</span></div><div><span>584 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>proposed regulation, burial at sea should not be allowed.  I believe the traditional leaders and the 

Cook Islands Christian Church would be pleased with such a decision. 

</span></div><div><span>In summary, I fully support the other areas of the Bill and the proposed regulation indicated in Part 

11.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you for the opportunity to speak.  Firstly, Kia Orana to our fellow 

citizens in Puaikura.  Kia Orana to Tinomana Ariki, our traditional leaders, the various religious 

denominations in our community, and the children at Apii Rutaki and Arorangi schools.  As this 

Sitting is scheduled to conclude today, we felt it was important to convey our condolences to the 

</span><span>families  who  have  lost  loved  ones,  including  Ngametua  Ritea  (also  known  as  Supa  Man)  who 

</span><span>passed away last Friday.  We mourn his passing and extend our sympathies to Paroro Mataiapo of 

Titikaveka and Ritea's family. 

</span></div><div><span>We were also saddened to hear about the passing of Rima Unga, a person of Pukapuka descent 

who was looked after by the late Raymond Pirangi and his wife.  We extend our condolences to 

those who knew and cared for him.  We are also offering our condolences to all those who have 

lost loved ones during these difficult times. 

</span></div><div><span>We are gathered here today to discuss the Public Health Bill 2024. On behalf of our Members, we 

offer our support, believing that it will enhance the quality of care provided by our health services 

system.    We  hope  that  the  provisions  outlined  within  the  bill  will  result  in  significant 

improvements. 

</span></div><div><span>However, we are concerned about the resources required to implement the regulations, especially 

given  the  number  of  Cook  Islanders  who  have  left  the  country.    We  hope  that  the  authorized 

personnel will be sufficient to handle this burden. 

</span></div><div><span>As we move forward, it is essential that we maintain a spirit of collaboration and avoid placing 

blame on others.  </span><span>We support the Member for Matavera’s objection to burials in the sea since they 

</span><span>are detrimental to our ocean, which is our primary source of food. Moreover, and our traditional 

</span><span>leaders have frequently raised concerns about this issue.  We need to find an appropriate solution 

</span><span>and discourage foreigners from being buried in our seas. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, thank you to our sponsors who provided funds for the purchase of a van that will serve the 

</span><span>elderly in our community.  However, we regret to inform you that it will only be available within 

the limits of Puaikura.  We need to support our people in ways that go beyond solely relying on

</span></div><div><span>the  government.   We have experienced support  from our local  businesses and individuals who 

have given generously to this cause.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for your attention, and we support this Bill wholeheartedly. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Sonny William; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  S.  WILLIAM:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker,  Clerk  and  staff  of  Parliament,  all  Honourable 

Members and our new Honourable Member.  Kia Orana also to all those listening on air, watching 

via livestream in the Cook Islands and overseas. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I address the merits of this Bill, I would like to offer words of comfort to the people of my 

constituency, Titikaveka.  To my fellow leaders and supporters across Tikioki to Vaimaanga and 

all denominations, Kia Orana.  Kia Orana to our elderly residents. 

</span></div><div><span>However,  I  must  express  my  sadness  at  the  recent  passing  of  many  who  have  loved  ones  in 

Titikaveka, including the passing of two strong pillars, Puaati Mataiapo and Papa Moe Tutira, and 

an avid church member, Papa Tureariki Teao.  The sense of loss in our community is palpable, 

and I extend condolences to all affected families. 

</span></div><div><span>As  I  turn  to  the  matter  at  hand,  I  cannot  help  but  reflect  on  the  many  who  have  passed  alone, 

abandoned  in  their  homes.    Our  Member  for  Matavera  highlighted  a  similar  situation  in  his 

electorate, and it is a problem that is all too common.  It is a sad reflection of our neglect of our 

elderly people, who are left to fend for themselves. 

</span></div><div><span>However, I commend the National Health Committee, which is mentioned in the Bill, and believe 

it can play a vital role in ensuring care for our people.  I am pleased that the responsible Minister 

for  Health  is  also  responsible  for  Internal  Affairs,  which  oversees  care  for  the  elderly.    As  we 

deliberate this Bill, I urge the Committee to look into this issue. 

</span></div><div><span>The Committee includes members from the House of Ariki, the Religious Council, the Pa Enua, 

Punas, disabled organizations, youth and NGOs, and I am hopeful that they will address this issue.  

</span><span>We also acknowledge the efforts of Marae Ora and the Are Pa Metua organization, who are deeply 

</span><span>committed to caring for our elderly and are in need of further assistance. 

</span></div><div><span>Overall, I support this Bill, which touches on many important issues for our community. Thank 

you, Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  wish  to  share  my  thoughts  on  this  Bill.    Its 

objectives  are  commendable  </span><span>–</span><span>  to  reduce  the  prevalence  of  diseases  in  the  Cook  Islands  and 

promote better community involvement for delivering improved health. 

</span></div><div><span>We are all aware of the state of health in our country </span><span>–</span><span> possibly the highest rate of obesity in the 

Pacific, if not in the world.  It is disheartening to see individuals, on bikes or otherwise, struggling 

with their weight.  This Bill, which seeks to repeal the 2004 Public Health Bill, offers a chance to 

help our population avoid preventable diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure. 

</span></div><div><span>As a parliamentarian and a human being, I understand the importance of personal responsibility 

for our well-being.  This Bill should provide a turning point, leading to greater sensitivity to health 

concerns.  The advertisements by the Health Ministry ought to be advertised more often to bring 

awareness to the public. 

</span></div><div><span>The second objective of the Bill, community involvement, is just as critical.  Using myself as an 

example, if I delivered a message concerning the risks of these illnesses, it may be received as 

better  when  shared  by  a  delegation  from  the  Ministry  of  Health.    It  is  essential  that  our  island 

administrators and Island Councils partner to educate our people because ultimately, it is us who 

are responsible for our own wellbeing. 

</span></div><div><span>Over-indulging in sugar, oil, and flour can cause a range of these health issues.  Import restrictions 

on sugar and fizzy drinks have been suggested, but this option may not be feasible.  However, we 

must find ways to tackle these challenges gradually and teach our people about good health. 

</span></div><div><span>The $1 million allocated in the budget for referrals confirms that our health is deteriorating; hence, 

the need for us to practice good health for a healthier population and save costs in the process.  The 

Cook  Islands  Christian  Church  attempted  plain  water  consumption  at  their  gatherings  without 

</span><span>sweets, but it lasted only a month.  So, it is crucial to incorporate churches and traditional leaders 

</span><span>in the planning process as they play a vital role in the community. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, we must own our health and not rely only on the Ministry of Health, and I support 

</span><span>this Bill.  The objectives are admirable, and it is necessary to apply them equally effectively. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    I  see  the  Honourable 

Minister Tingika Elikana; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 16 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill and wish to keep my remarks 

brief.  I align myself with the Leader of the Opposition's recognition of the important objectives 

of this Bill and the need for inclusive collaboration between the Ministry and all sectors of society.  

The Ministry must understand that they cannot advance their goals without the full support of the 

community. 

</span></div><div><span>However,  I  rise  to  offer  necessary  thanks  and  appreciation  from  the  people  of  Pukapuka  and 

Nassau,  particularly  regarding  Part  11  which  pertains  to  human  remains.  As  the  Member 

representing these islands, I cannot ignore the limitations of burying people at sea and the lack of 

land space on our islands and here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>I am certain my colleagues from the Northern Group will join me in expressing our gratitude to 

the many landowners who have selflessly offered their land for the burial of our people.  I refer to 

</span><span>the cemetery opposite the LDS church in Arorangi, the Ngati Arera burial grounds in Nikao, and 

</span><span>most significantly, the Vakatini Ariki, a surrogate chief and benefactor who has granted land for 

the burial of our people from Pukapuka and Nassau over the years. 

</span></div><div><span>I request that those present convey our appreciation and a big 'ataiwaiwolo' from the people of 

Pukapuka  to  these  landowners,  and  that  they  continue  to  offer  their  lands  for  the  burial  of  our 

people.  Atawaiwolo. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Minister of Health; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, thank you to all the Members of this House, the staff 

of Parliament, and those listening.  Kia Orana to everyone, including people on Enuamanu.  My 

condolences to families who have lost loved ones during these difficult times. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to take us back to 2018, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a review 

of the Public Health Act.  We faced many challenges during this period and emerged victorious.  I 

extend my gratitude to the Ministry of Health, including Secretary Bob Williams, doctors, nurses, 

</span><span>and stakeholders involved in drafting this Bill.  The Cook Islands community has also contributed 

</span><span>through public consultations.  It was not an easy task, and hard work has been put in since 2019.  

</span><span>A Working Taskforce comprising of different stakeholders is recommended in the Bill, reflecting 

</span><span>the collaborative effort needed for better health. 

</span></div><div><span>We cannot rely on the Ministry of Health alone.  We must work together in each household to 

</span><span>achieve  better  health.    The  Opposition  Leader  addressed  regulations  for  better  health  and 

protection, such as reducing sweet soft drink and alcohol intake, but some may not be heeding 

these warnings.  To promote healthy habits, I make it a rule for functions organised by Te Marae

</span></div><div><span>Ora to serve no soft drinks or alcohol.  I have submitted this concept to Cabinet colleagues, and I 

hope they will follow suit. 

</span></div><div><span>This  Bill  aims  to  reduce  incidents  of  diseases  and  prioritise  community  involvement.    Whole 

communities should collaborate to plan for better health delivery.  Thank you to the Ministry of 

Education, Agriculture, and Internal Affairs for their ongoing support in working with the Ministry 

of Health to establish good laws and regulations for our future generations.  It may be challenging 

for older generations to adapt to better lifestyles, resulting in many being referred to New Zealand 

for treatments.  I encourage everyone to look after our elderlies, and I thank the Ministry of Internal 

Affairs for their continual support. 

</span></div><div><span>The Ministry of Health may not have enough staff, but they are trying their best to cater to the 

health needs of our people.  I believe that the first step towards better health is holding hands with 

</span><span>our children and immediate family, working together.  The Ministry of Health has implemented 

</span><span>the  ‘healthy  island’  program  to  enhance  the  health  of  children  in</span><span>  the  Outer  Islands.    We  are 

extending this program to all our Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The House previously referred to the burial of people in our ocean, and I believe that the National 

Body created by this Bill will bring good regulations to improve our health system.  The saying, 

"that  you  will  be  saved  by  your  own  sword"  encourages  us  to  work  together  against  health 

problems affecting our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, I thank all Honourable Members for supporting this Bill, which will positively impact our 

people's health.  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister and thank you Honourable Members for your 

contribution. 

</span></div><div><span>I now put the Question.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion for the Second Reading of the  

Public Health Bill 2024 be agreed to
