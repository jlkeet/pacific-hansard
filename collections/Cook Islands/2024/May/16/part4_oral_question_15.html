<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Good Afternoon to everyone.  Kia 

Orana to all the Members present here including you, Mr Speaker, along with your staff, the Prime 

Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Members  of  Opposition,  United  Party,  and  Independent  Party 

Representatives.   I would also like to acknowledge the King's Representative and  your spouse, 

who are listening to the broadcast.  Kia Orana to the Kaumaiti and the House of Ariki, the Leaders 

of the Churches, and people from the Northern Group and Southern Group, both here in Rarotonga 

and abroad. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Prime Minister, I have a question for you.  Two groups from our country recently travelled to 

Fiji for a workshop, which I believe was an essential duty travel.  During that period, I saw many 

tourists visiting Fiji and I believe, just like us, they are also trying to recover from the pandemic.  

I recollect reading in the Cook Islands news last year that we were exploring the possibility of an 

airline flying from Nadi to the Cook Islands to promote tourism.  Could you please update us on 

where we stand concerning this matter at present?
