<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  directed  to  the  Minister  of  Cultural 

Development.   Reflecting on the Daily Bread that our Chaplain shared with us earlier, "do not 

condemn, and you will not be condemned," I am curious to know how the Minister acquired his 

excavator.  Specifically, I am keen to learn about the steps he took to procure it, as I believe this 

</span><span>information can be useful in helping Matavera acquire one as well. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  am  aware  that  many  people  have  seen  the  Minister's  excavator,  and  I  commend  him  for 

successfully acquiring one.  My request for the Minister is if he can provide any advice on how 

Matavera can obtain its own excavator.  Thank you.
