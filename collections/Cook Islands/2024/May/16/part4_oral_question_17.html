<h3>Oral Question 17</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you for the question.  The airline flights that we are working on to 

</span><span>come  into  our  country,  we  certainly  did  put  a  recommendation,  a  proposal  to  Fiji  Airways  to 

</span><span>consider a flight from Nadi to Rarotonga and we went a step further and helped to facilitate a direct 

</span><span>flight,  a  charter  flight  from  Nadi  to  Rarotonga  to  bring  the  participants  and  the  leaders  for  the 

</span><span>Pacific Islands Forum and that proved to be a successful flight.  

</span></div>
<div><span>But the airline business is a tough business and airlines will look to where they can be assured that 

their flights will provide the best return.  We were certainly attracted to Fiji Airways because they

</span></div>
<div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>have now a well-established network into North America, the United States and Canada and in the 

last year they posted a $1 billion profit and they also took possession of two brand new aircrafts 

just last year and I have just seen the recent announcement from the CEO that they are looking to 

expand their market into America. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Understandably so, because America is a huge market of millions of potential tourists whereas we 

are a small market of a few thousand passengers that will travel and one of the only ways that we 

can make ourselves attractive to airlines is to what we are doing now, look at subsidising air flights 

into our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But  this  of  course  requires,  Mr  Speaker  careful  analysis,  cost  analysis  to  be  part  of  the  wider 

programme of marketing our destination and to work out the cost benefit of this additional subsidy.  

Right now this is not something that we can entertain and so at this stage there is no indication that 

</span><span>we will have a direct flight with Fiji Airways coming through to Rarotonga.  However, the future 

</span><span>remains promising and if the airline sees that there is an opportunity to make a decent return, a fair 

return then I have no doubt we will be an attractive destination. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But make no mistake we have a tourism destination and we operate a tourism product that is up 

there at the top.  Fiji brings in a million tourist a year into Fiji compared to their population of just 

under a million </span><span>–</span><span>900 thousand, that’s almost one for one.</span></div>
<div><span>Just prior to COVID we were bringing in just under 180,000 visitors compared to our resident 

population of around 18</span><span>,000 that’s ten to one.  So, Fiji had a tourism product like we would, they 

</span><span>would be bringing in ten million tourist a year not one million.  But we remain open, Mr Speaker 

to any opportunity from any airline that wishes to come into our country particularly looking at 

expanding our market through North America and Europe.  We have run out of time, thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister and thank you all Members who raised 

questions and those who provided answers.
