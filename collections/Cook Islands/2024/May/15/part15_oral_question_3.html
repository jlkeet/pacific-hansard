<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the United Party for your inquiry.  My colleague to 

my left has informed me that the tractor is currently in Matavera.  However, I would like to provide 

a more detailed response to your question.  Currently, we are awaiting engine parts to arrive in 

order to repair the tractor properly.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In the meantime, to compensate for the airport mowing tractor's absence, we have been utilising 

the Nikao constituency's tractor to maintain the airport.  Rest assured that the necessary part will 

be arriving shortly, and we will be working to fix the tractor as soon as possible.  The part required 

</span><span>to fix the tractor has been entrusted to the Tupapa-based mechanic garage, BNM.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Deputy Speaker, thank you for taking on the challenging role of Deputy Speaker 

</span><span>in  guiding  and  overseeing  this  House.    I  have  faith  that  you  will  provide  leadership  and  be  a 

</span><span>powerful voice for all of us in this House.

<div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  congratulations to  the newly elected Member of Parliament from  Tongareva who 

was victorious in the recent by-election.  We pray that the Almighty will guide and support you as 

you represent your constituents and work with us in this House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>With that said, I have a question that I would like to present to the Minister of Education.  Although 

I was contemplating whether to ask the Member for Takitumu or the Minister for Agriculture, I 

believe the Minister of Education is best suited to answer my query. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Allow me to provide context.  During a trip to Fiji with the Amuri Member on behalf of the PAC, 

I had an interview with a Radio PI representative from Auckland.  During this interview, I was 

asked about the purpose of our trip and what we were doing to support our language.  I expressed 

my desire to support the Cook Islands Maori language spoken by our people in the Northern and 

Southern  Groups  and  all  of  the  Cook  Islands.    I  recommended  that  a  language  program  be 

</span><span>implemented into the curriculum and strongly encouraged and supported from Year 1-6, a message 

</span><span>I wanted our people in New Zealand to hear.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister of Education if it is feasible to incorporate this language 

program into their curriculum, allowing our children to learn the Cook Islands Maori language 

from Year 1-6.
