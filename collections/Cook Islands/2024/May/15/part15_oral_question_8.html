<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    I  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  their  question.    If  permissible,  I 

would like to request time until tomorrow so that I may confer with the Secretary of Environment 

Services and obtain further clarification on this research.  I pledge to return with an answer as soon 

as possible, for discussion in the House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  all  present  in  the  House  today,  including  the 

Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, and Members of Government.  Kia Orana to all on 

this side of the House, as well as the Independent Members.  Kia Orana to the Deputy Speaker, 

Clerk, and staff of Parliament, and to the families and attendees in the Public Gallery.  We extend 

a warm welcome to the Solicitor General, who is seated in the back.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to begin by extending my congratulations to the newly elected Member of Parliament 

</span><span>for Penrhyn, Mrs Sarakura Tapaitau, on her swearing-in and Maiden Speech.  As a native of the 

</span><span>Northern  Group,  I  am  elated  to  see  three  women  MPs  from  our  region,  with  only  one  male 

representative from Pukapuka.  Based on this, we will certainly outvote him in our future meetings.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to express my appreciation to the Deputy Speaker for assuming this challenge.  It is 

</span><span>noteworthy  that  the  Deputy  Speaker  only  takes  the  Chair  in  the  Speaker's  absence.    During  a 

</span><span>previous visit to the New Zealand Parliament, we observed that they rotate the individuals who 

preside over meetings.  I would like to  take this opportunity to  express  my appreciation  to  the 

Speaker  for  allowing  you,  Deputy  Speaker,  to  obtain  the  necessary  training  and  experience  to 

effectively run our business.

<div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>My  first  question  </span><span>pertains  to  Standing  Order  114  (2)  which  states,  “A  Minister  must  not  be  a 

member of a select committee.”  According to Section 2 of the Standing Orders, which states that 

“The Speaker or other person presiding is responsible for ruling whenever any quest</span><span>ion arises as 

to  the  interpretation  or  application  of  a  Standing  Order  and  for  deciding  cases  not  otherwise 

</span><span>provided  for.”    Therefore,  could  you  please  provide  an  explanation  of  the  Speaker's  r</span><span>uling 

concerning this specific Clause of our Standing Orders?
