<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Mr</span><span>Deputy Speaker, thank you for your question to the Prime Minister, 

</span><span>but I would like to provide an answer if I may.  If I understand your question correctly, you are 

</span><span>inquiring about the incinerator.  In terms of the procurement process, it is still ongoing at this time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As part of the procurement process, a Request for Quotes was issued, both locally and overseas.  

Approximately 14 to 15 companies have expressed interest and submitted quotes.

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding funding for this project, I would like to clarify that it is sourced from the ICF under the 

New  Zealand  Government.    Following  an  investigation,  the  New  Zealand  High  Commission 

Office has been directed to allocate the necessary funds for the project. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  would  also  like  to  touch  on  the  current  situation  at  the  landfill.    As  you  may  be  aware,  the 

government has contracted TNM's compress machine to compress the rubbish at the landfill using 

a roller.  The compressed rubbish has allowed us to extend the lifespan of the landfill.  I believe 

this answers your question.
