</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Amendment  Bill  2024.    I  call  the 

Honourable Albert Nicholas for the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Amendment Bill 2024  

be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I reserve my time to speak at the end. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister, Vaine Mokoroa 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I now open the Floor to the Honourable Members to speak on the principles and 

</span><span>merits of the Bill.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>I have limited comments to make on this Bill before the House, but I would like 

</span><span>to focus on Section 10(a) as it appears to have been introduced to reinforce the application of this 

Act.    I  appreciate  the  significance  of  this  Bill,  particularly  its  emphasis  on  appointing  capable

</span></div><div><span>individuals  to  administrative  positions,  with  a  minimum  requirement  for  the  position's 

equivalence. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding other amendments, I have no objections.  I am pleased to report that the individuals 

involved with the CIIC were present before the PAC Committee, and during the hearing, it came 

to  light  that  their  account  had  been  modified.    The  appointment  of  Directors  on  the  Board, 

including one Member of this House, has given me confidence that the process will be carried out 

satisfactorily. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  note  that  the  Ministry  has  been  allocated  a  significant  budget  for  development.  

However, their report only indicates developments up to 2014, and its status is still modified from 

2018 to 2022, during my tenure in Parliament.  I feel compelled to speak frankly on this matter as 

our people are monitoring their  progress.    I appreciate the  government's  efforts to  improve the 

</span><span>country, and that is why I am endorsing this Bill to grant them the necessary authority to carry out 

</span><span>their responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>I have previously requested that the Ministry present an unmodified report for 2024, and I hope 

they will oblige.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Leader  of  the  United  Party, 

Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable  Members  of 

Parliament.    I  wish  to  address  the  Bill  presented  to  the  House  by  the  Minister  of  CIIC.    Upon 

reviewing the proposed changes, it appears that the Bill intends to rectify an error in which some 

individuals were appointed to positions without following the appropriate measures outlined in the 

2019 Act. 

</span></div><div><span>Under clause 10(4) of the 2019 Act, certain criteria are to be met for board appointments, including 

a minimum of two years of relevant experience.   It is concerning that these measures were not 

</span><span>adhered to previously, but as it is an issue of the past, I must object to this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>However,  I  do  support  the  recommendation  put  forth  by  the  Member  for  Matavera  and 

</span><span>acknowledge the reasoning behind bringing this matter before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, I would like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister for his statement on the Budget 2024, 

</span><span>with the support of the Ministry of Finance.  I have nothing further to add, but I support this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Member.  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you have 

the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  When we have a look at the legislation, 

we go back to 2019 and that amendment to the Principal Act was made, it was to modernise the 

requirements  for  the  appointment  of  the  Directors  of  the  Corporation  and  the  making  of  other 

reforms  to  the  arrangements  governing  directors  and  the  Board  of  the  corporation.    And  that 

particular legislation set out in detail the qualifications for appointment as Director on the Board 

of CIIC. 

</span></div><div><span>And  my  reading  of  those  qualifications  was  to  tighten  up  qualifications  so  that  we  have  good 

quality people on the Board.  And one of the qualifications and the one that we are dealing with 

</span><span>today,  says,  that  person  must  has  at  least  two  years’  experience  as  Director  of  Statutory 

</span><span>Corporation or a State-owned Enterprise.  Now that is quite a tight qualification. 

</span></div><div><span>I feel what the Leader of the United Cook Islands Party says and I agree with what he is saying, 

except that I do not think it is just to correct a mistake I am going to suggest that it is being designed 

for someone who is earmarked for this position.  Because the amendment actually then make set 

more flexible.  And what it says, is that now there is no longer a requirement for a State-owned 

Enterprise but rather comparable with a Statutory Corporation. 

</span></div><div><span>And why I say that this sounds like a legislation to suit a particular appointee because this is not a 

foreign thing with this government.  We have seen it in the amendment with the Police Act and 

</span><span>we have seen it to the amendment of the Ombudsman’s Act</span><span>.  And while I support that we should 

appoint people that have skills I am cautious in supporting a legislation that is designed to give a 

job to someone. 

</span></div><div><span>I will not make comments on the actual corporation as a whole because we have already had as 

part of the papers tabled today a report by Audit on this very agency of government.  I will leave 

my comments to a later day.  Those are my comments Mr Speaker on this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Tina Browne.  I see the Honourable Minister Tingika 

Elikana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to express my support of the Bill presented 

to the House.  I thought it was appropriate to give a balanced view on behalf of the government 

</span><span>regarding the commentary on this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>The previous speakers before me have already reiterated the importance of this Bill.  The leader 

</span><span>of the United Party and the leader of the Opposition both emphasised the necessity of this Bill.  

Nonetheless,  although we agree on the significance of this  Bill,  we hold  differing views on its 

intent.  The leader of the Opposition suggested that this Bill is intended to accommodate specific 

individuals, which I disagree with.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The purpose of this Bill is to rectify an oversight that has become apparent in the qualifications for 

appointing Directors to any Board.  As you may recall, Mr Speaker, the objective of this Bill is to 

expand the pool of potential candidates eligible to be Directors of any Corporation.  The current 

legislation  only  permits  the  appointment  of  individuals  in  two  categories,  as  appropriately 

mentioned by the leader of the Opposition </span><span>–</span><span> those who work in Statutory Corporations and those 

who work in State-owned Enterprises. 

</span></div><div><span>The Bill presented to the House broadens the scope to include people working in organisations 

that  are  comparable  with  a  Statutory  Corporation.    This  amendment  opens  the  possibility  of 

appointing  individuals  who  have  previously  served  as  Heads  of  Ministries  or  have  ample 

experience in such positions, which is much needed, particularly in our situation where there exists 

a limited pool of qualified individuals to serve as Directors. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, I support the Bill presented to the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, as the former immediate Minister of Cook Islands 

Investment Corporation.  I too stand to support the Bill and the amendment that is being proposed 

particularly around the qualification of people to Board Memberships.  It became very clear Mr 

Speaker that the very tight qualification as pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition precluded 

a number of our people who are more than qualified to serve on Boards.  And as highlighted by 

the Honourable Minister this Amendment is to correct this anomaly to be able to allow people with 

suitable qualifications to be able to serve on our Boards.  And of course one of the Amendments 

that  was  pushed  through  in  2019  was  also  designed  people  to  put  forward  their  names  to  be 

considered for Board Directors and from what I understand Mr Speaker there is a pool of qualified 

or  interested  Board  members  who  have  provided  their  CVs  into  the  pool  for  consideration  as 

members.  

</span></div><div><span>Another tool that the government initiated to allow us to have a good robust process to ensure we 

</span><span>have good people on these Boards.  Let us be reminded Mr Speaker it is not just people when you 

go on the Boards that are good with numbers or people that have degrees. Although we do need 

</span><span>people of that calibre on a number of our Boards we also need people on these Boards who have a 

</span><span>sense of humanity Mr Speaker. Everyday people who knows the struggles and the hardships of 

</span><span>life.  So, that when we have Board discussions the Board looks at essentially the bottom line of the 

</span><span>balance sheet.  We also need someone who can look at what the bottom line means and how its 

</span><span>impact is going to be on everyday people.  However, this qualification, this requirement fortunately 

is adequately captured in the existing qualifications for Board membership.  This Amendment is 

specifically geared Mr Speaker to broaden the net to enable those who have a specific skill set may

</span></div><div><span>be not through the formal appointment through an SOE but through another organisation that has 

comparable recognition.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker I give my support to this Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Prime Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the Question. The Question is</span><span>…</span><span>  Sorry, I see the Honourable Minister Responsible 

for the Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS: </span><span> I will keep my comments briefly.  In a nutshell Mr Speaker, in concurring 

with what the Honourable Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs shared just earlier.  

</span></div><div><span>With the current Act, Mr Speaker makes it exclusive to SOE Directors only to qualify for the CIIC 

directorship.  Mr Speaker, when  I became Minister of CIIC, I had an issue with this particular 

clause in the Act.  Simply because Mr Speaker we have a lot of capable people out there in society 

that  serves  our  communities  and  country  on  different  panels  or  boards.    And  who  holds  vast 

experiences in many different areas but unfortunately, we were not able to cage their experience 

and  expertise  at  this  level  at  CIIC  directorship.    Hence  the  Amendment  before  the  House  Mr 

Speaker.  And as the Prime Minister clearly put it Mr Speaker, it was clogging the net.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, basically was to do away with qualification exclusively to SOE directors only and to 

amend the Act and make it inclusive of all those in the wider community.  And there is no big 

mystery  behind  as  shared  to  this  Honourable  House  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    The 

Amendment is not to cater for some mysterious individual that she feels is waiting for a job.  It is 

to widen the net and capture more people who we feel are qualified in their own right Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>On that note Mr Speaker, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    I  note  that  we  have  approximately  five 

</span><span>minutes left.  May I humbly request permission from the Honourable Members to conclude the 

</span><span>discussions on this Bill?  Thank you, Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now put the Question.  The Questions is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion for the Second Reading of the Bill be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
