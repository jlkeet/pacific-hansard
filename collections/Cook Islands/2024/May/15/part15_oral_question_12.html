<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>MR T. VARU:  </span><span>Congratulations to you Mr Deputy Speaker, for leading our Session today.  Kia 

Orana to  all Members present  in  this  Honourable  House.  We would  also  like to  welcome  our 

newly appointed Member and our sister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I have a question to ask, which was initially posed by a Member of Parliament from Matavera to 

the Prime Minister at the beginning of 2023.  If I recall, the question was focused on our waste 

management  practices.    I  believe  the  Prime  Minister,  or  maybe  the  Minister  Responsible 

Honourable  Albert  Nicholas,  responded  during  that  Session,  noting  that  the  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Infrastructure was exploring various avenues to reduce waste, including acquiring a machine to 

</span><span>burn rubbish.  Perhaps the Honourable Prime Minister could provide a response to this question 

</span><span>today?
