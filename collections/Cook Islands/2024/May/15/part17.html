<div><span>KEY BUDGET INITIATIVES </span><span>–</span><span> OPERATING 

</span></div><div><span>Salary banding for Teachers 

</span></div><div><span>Let  me  speak  to  some  of  our  key  budget  initiatives  Mr  Speaker,  investing  in  our  </span><span>tamariki</span><span>  or 

</span><span>children is critical for our future and to do this effectively, we need to invest in the teachers who 

</span><span>guide them.  We understand the important role that our teachers have in guiding the next generation 

and giving them the skills to succeed in life </span><span>–</span><span> for all of us.  The former United Nations Secretary 

</span><span>General, Kofi Annan once remarked that “education is the premise of progress in every society” 

</span><span>and that is true of us here in the Cook Islands, so we are making investments in education </span><span>–</span><span> to 

</span><span>continue that progress. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, in this Budget, we have allocated $5.2 million over the next four years to 

</span><span>bring  our  teachers  up  to  pay  scales  which  more  accurately  reflect  the  important  work  they

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>undertake in our society.  This will help the Ministry of Education to ensure they can recruit and 

retain teachers as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Providing support for critical healthcare: 

</span></div><div><span>Each  year,  many  of  our  people  face  serious  health  challenges,  meaning  travel  overseas  for 

treatment </span><span>–</span><span> either from the Pa Enua to Rarotonga or to New Zealand.  This Budget increases our 

commitment by providing an additional $1 million per year to ensure those who need treatment 

can  access  it.    This  builds  Mr  </span><span>Speaker  on  last  year’s  decision  to  facilitate  access  to  private 

</span><span>healthcare in New Zealand, improving health outcomes for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Non-Government Organisations 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, many NGOs in our community operate alongside Government to provide important 

services  to  our  people.    Unfortunately,  as  a  result  of  our  success  in  being  classified  as  a  high-

income  country,  some  of  these  organisations  have  found  it  difficult  to  access  funding  from 

development partners as that funding is now being withdrawn.  So we now have to step in and fill 

in  the  gap.  With  the  critical  work  that  these  organisations  do,  especially  in  helping  our  most 

vulnerable people, government is providing almost $700 thousand in funding to continue support 

for this sector which includes NGOs such as the Cook Islands Family Welfare Association, Te 

Kainga, Punanga Tauturu and the Cook Islands Civil Society organisation </span><span>–</span><span> all of whom contribute 

critical work to our society.  This will allow these organisations to continue to support our families 

and our children to have the best possible opportunities in life, as well as provide some help and 

guidance for those most in need.   

</span></div><div><span>This funding initiative was initially in the last Budget, for one year to allow the organisations some 

time  to  be  able  to  seek  funding  from  development  partners.    However,  this  funding  has  so  far 

proven difficult to source, therefore the government needs to step in and provide funding. 

</span></div><div><span>Tourism and the economy 

</span></div><div><span>Tourism, Mr Speaker remains a vital  part of our economy, driving two-thirds of our economic 

activity.  

</span></div><div><span>Over the past, government has made some significant investments in the sector especially with 

</span><span>regard  with  the  airline  connectivity,  and  we  have  seen  those  investments  begin  to  pay  off. 

</span><span>Government is continuing to support these investments in additional flights and additional capacity 

to bring people to the Cook Islands.

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the flights are a key component of our tourism sector, however they do not achieve 

much if the people do not know much about them. So, government is providing additional funding 

of $4.7 million over four years for marketing the Cook Islands as a destination to help support the 

investment  in  connectivity  to  fill  these  planes  up.  Further  to  this,  $1.8  million  in  funding  for 

Destination Development which will help to provide an environment for tourists when they visit 

</span><span>–</span><span> including in the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>Pa Enua transport 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  many  people  have  seen  the  discussions  in  the  media  around  key  transport  and  in 

particular  shipping  links  to  the  Pa  Enua.  I  am  proud  to  report  that  this  Budget  include  a 

considerable investment in shipping in the Pa Enua to ensure regular freight connections for our 

people  outside  of  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  In  this  regard  we  continue  to  work  closely  with  the 

</span><span>governments  of  both  Japan  and  China  to  ensure  fit  for  purpose  vessels  that  can  be  secured  to 

</span><span>support our Pa Enua development. 

</span></div><div><span>This work will help make life on our Pa Enua a little easier, and reduce one of the barriers to their 

economic development </span><span>–</span><span> assisting in the entrepreneurial spirit of our people in the Pa Enua to run 

businesses and create investment outside of the two hubs of Rarotonga and Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>Building Up Reserves 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we remain committed to building our financial reserves. This includes a sensible plan 

for  repaying  the  loans  that  were  taken  out  during  the  pandemic  and  moving  towards  fiscal 

surpluses. We are also ensuring that funds are available in our stabilisation account and our loan 

repayment funds to meet future obligations.  

</span></div><div><span>Capital Investments 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, let me turn to our capital investments.  I have spoken many times about the importance 

</span><span>of capital expenditure, about its ability to employ workers and stimulate our economy, particularly 

</span><span>while investment from private companies is limited.  Governments all over the world know this, 

and the Cook Islands is no different.  </span><span>That is why it’s one of the Economic Recovery Roadmap 

</span><span>work streams.  

</span></div><div><span>Capital  expenditure in  this  Budget  will continue the government’s investment themes from  the 

</span><span>previous  year,  and  in  particular  make  use  of  the  Infrastructure  Trust  Fund,  which  has  been 

generously provided by New Zealand.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>In  this  Budget,  government  has  focused  on  projects  that  are  either  already  in  progress  or  in 

development in order to complete existing projects with importance to the Cook Islands. These are 

designed to employ local contractors and labour, such as the Te Tau Papa O Avarua </span><span>–</span><span> the Avarua 

Town Plan project which is funded under the Infrastructure Trust Fund. This project, and indeed 

many in the infrastructure space, are geared toward ensuring both that we build the infrastructure 

that we need, but also that there is activity for local construction firms, engineers and trades peoples 

</span><span>–</span><span> as without that pipeline of work, the skilled labour involved in this sector will probably leave. 

The government is continually in discussion with development partners around financing of work 

in this sector to ensure that there is work ongoing </span><span>–</span><span> especially while our private sector repair their 

balance sheets. As these discussions bear fruit, announcements will be made, but rest assured, we 

keep a very open dialogue with our partners. 

</span></div><div><span>Physical Infrastructure 

</span></div><div><span>Let  me  turn  to  physical  infrastructure  Mr  Speaker.  Infrastructure  Cook  Islands  will  continue 

important work on physical infrastructure on Rarotonga and the Pa Enua, with an ongoing focus 

on  bridges  and  roads  on  Rarotonga,  and  marine  and  air  infrastructure  works  in  the  Pa  Enua, 

including on Nassau and Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>The work on Manihiki airport in particular will pilot a new approach to infrastructure development 

in the Pa Enua. We know that the cost of building thins in the outer islands is prohibitively high in 

</span><span>many respects, so to deliver key projects, a ‘public works’ style model is being undertaken. This 

</span><span>project will be used to shown how such a model can work and learn from it to be able to implement 

it in infrastructure projects for the future </span><span>–</span><span> keeping them as affordable as possible. 

</span></div><div><span>Cook Islands Investment Corporation continues its focus on building and repairing government 

buildings. All of these projects employ local businesses and labourers on both Rarotonga and the 

Pa Enua. And as well as spending through the Budget, the government is also actively discussing 

capital investment proposals with our donor partners. We continue to work with New Zealand on 

proposals to fund projects through the Infrastructure Trust Fund with a strong emphasis on shovel 

</span><span>ready projects that will keep our people employed and help to retain our skilled labour. 

</span></div><div><span>Changes to social payments to help the most vulnerable 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, turning finally to our social support programmes.   

</span></div><div><span>I previously commented that inflation has been significant, but out of the Government’s control 

</span><span>and while we continue to work on reducing inflation, we must also help our vulnerable populations 

</span><span>more  directly  and  as  signalled  in  last  year’s  budget  we  have  increased  payment  rates  for  the 

</span><span>destitute  payment,  the  power  subsidy  and  the  caregiver  payment  and  consistent  with  our  plans 

</span></div><div><span>560 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>from last year, from 1 July this year the Caregiver payment will go up again from $300 per month 

to $400 a month to better support those who care for others. 

</span></div><div><span>These payments, Mr Speaker help some of our most vulnerable people and those looking after our 

most  vulnerable.    Increasing  these  rates  helps  to  bring  them  along  with  the  recovery  in  our 

economy.   

</span></div><div><span>As well as these payment increases, we have seen more recipients of our pension and some other 

payments.  There are more people turning sixty, Mr Speaker and to meet the needs of these increase 

numbers of pensioners we have allocated over $3 million over the next four years to cover these 

increased costs. 

</span></div><div><span>Minimum Wage Increase to $9.50 per hour 

</span></div><div><span>As we have seen announced by our Minister of Internal Affairs, the government has also confirmed 

an increase in the minimum wage from $9 to $9.50 per hour and for a worker on 35 hours per 

</span><span>week, that’s an additional $900 a year.  The increase of the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour has 

</span><span>required an additional provision for government spending on personnel, primarily in the Pa Enua.  

The total cost to government is an additional 1.3 million dollars over the next four years. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, </span><span>today’s budget is about perseverance and ensuring that we are well placed to take 

</span><span>advantage of the opportunity on the horizon which results from our strong economic management. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I leave you with a Budget that balances fiscal responsibility and the needs of our Nation 

as we continue our journey towards our prosperous future.  Thank you very much for your attention 

and support as we work together to build a stronger, more resilient Cook Islands.  I lay this Bill 

before the House, Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana e kia manuia.
