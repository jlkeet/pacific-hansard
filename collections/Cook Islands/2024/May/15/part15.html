<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Leader of the United Party, the Honourable Teariki Heather, and the Floor is yours. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Kia Orana Deputy Speaker, I would like to extend my greetings to you and 

express our gratitude to God for allowing you to serve as Deputy Speaker in our Parliament.  We 

also warmly welcome our new Member who was sworn in today and enjoyed their Maiden Speech.  

To the Minister of the  Airport,  I have a  question regarding the location of the tractor that was 

purchased to maintain the airport lawn, as I have not seen it recently.  Could you provide an update 

on its whereabouts? 

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister Albert Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the United Party for your inquiry.  My colleague to 

my left has informed me that the tractor is currently in Matavera.  However, I would like to provide 

a more detailed response to your question.  Currently, we are awaiting engine parts to arrive in 

order to repair the tractor properly.  

</span></div><div><span>In the meantime, to compensate for the airport mowing tractor's absence, we have been utilising 

the Nikao constituency's tractor to maintain the airport.  Rest assured that the necessary part will 

be arriving shortly, and we will be working to fix the tractor as soon as possible.  The part required 

</span><span>to fix the tractor has been entrusted to the Tupapa-based mechanic garage, BNM.  

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Deputy Speaker, thank you for taking on the challenging role of Deputy Speaker 

</span><span>in  guiding  and  overseeing  this  House.    I  have  faith  that  you  will  provide  leadership  and  be  a 

</span><span>powerful voice for all of us in this House.

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore,  congratulations to  the newly elected Member of Parliament from  Tongareva who 

was victorious in the recent by-election.  We pray that the Almighty will guide and support you as 

you represent your constituents and work with us in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>With that said, I have a question that I would like to present to the Minister of Education.  Although 

I was contemplating whether to ask the Member for Takitumu or the Minister for Agriculture, I 

believe the Minister of Education is best suited to answer my query. 

</span></div><div><span>Allow me to provide context.  During a trip to Fiji with the Amuri Member on behalf of the PAC, 

I had an interview with a Radio PI representative from Auckland.  During this interview, I was 

asked about the purpose of our trip and what we were doing to support our language.  I expressed 

my desire to support the Cook Islands Maori language spoken by our people in the Northern and 

Southern  Groups  and  all  of  the  Cook  Islands.    I  recommended  that  a  language  program  be 

</span><span>implemented into the curriculum and strongly encouraged and supported from Year 1-6, a message 

</span><span>I wanted our people in New Zealand to hear.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister of Education if it is feasible to incorporate this language 

program into their curriculum, allowing our children to learn the Cook Islands Maori language 

from Year 1-6. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to address the House.  As 

previously stated by our Chaplain from Nikao, we should receive our newly elected Member with 

open arms.  I would like to take this opportunity to welcome her and commend her for taking on 

this challenge. 

</span></div><div><span>The question raised in this House regards the support of the different dialects and languages spoken 

on individual islands in our education system.  I am pleased with this question, as the newly elected 

Education Secretary, Owen Lewis, has assured me of his efforts to teach our language in schools, 

beginning at the preschool level up to Year 6.  It is notable that other countries, such as Fiji, Samoa, 

China, Japan, and Korea, have legislation requiring the teaching of their respective languages in 

</span><span>schools.  However, this is not currently mandated by law in our country.  Therefore, I believe it is 

</span><span>essential that we include this mandate in our Education Act. 

</span></div><div><span>I had the privilege of attending a meeting for the Council of the University of the South Pacific in 

</span><span>Vanuatu two weeks ago, where it was approved and agreed upon to endorse a Certificate of Maori 

</span><span>Studies, focused on teaching and recognising our language and culture.  This is why I am content 

</span><span>with the Member from Matavera's question. There is strong community support for the teaching 

of our language, as it not only encourages the preservation of our customs but also combats the 

predicted disappearance of our indigenous languages by the end of this century.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Deputy Speaker, it is the government's intention to promote the use of our language, not only for 

today but for the generations to come.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  DEPUTY  SPEAKER:</span><span>    I  can  see  the  Honourable  Member  Robert  Heather;  you  have  the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Kia Orana and congratulations to you Mr Deputy Speaker on your recent 

appointment.  My inquiry is directed to the Minister for Conservation.  Concerns have been raised 

about the looming threat of high seas, and it is imperative that we prepare ourselves accordingly.  

In this regard, I would like to inquire about the $400 thousand allocated in June 2023 for research 

on the impacts to our coastal areas, specifically from Ngatangiia to Arorangi.  I seek clarification 

on whether research has been conducted regarding our coastal areas. 

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    I  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  their  question.    If  permissible,  I 

would like to request time until tomorrow so that I may confer with the Secretary of Environment 

Services and obtain further clarification on this research.  I pledge to return with an answer as soon 

as possible, for discussion in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  all  present  in  the  House  today,  including  the 

Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, and Members of Government.  Kia Orana to all on 

this side of the House, as well as the Independent Members.  Kia Orana to the Deputy Speaker, 

Clerk, and staff of Parliament, and to the families and attendees in the Public Gallery.  We extend 

a warm welcome to the Solicitor General, who is seated in the back.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to begin by extending my congratulations to the newly elected Member of Parliament 

</span><span>for Penrhyn, Mrs Sarakura Tapaitau, on her swearing-in and Maiden Speech.  As a native of the 

</span><span>Northern  Group,  I  am  elated  to  see  three  women  MPs  from  our  region,  with  only  one  male 

representative from Pukapuka.  Based on this, we will certainly outvote him in our future meetings.  

</span></div><div><span>I also wish to express my appreciation to the Deputy Speaker for assuming this challenge.  It is 

</span><span>noteworthy  that  the  Deputy  Speaker  only  takes  the  Chair  in  the  Speaker's  absence.    During  a 

</span><span>previous visit to the New Zealand Parliament, we observed that they rotate the individuals who 

preside over meetings.  I would like to  take this opportunity to  express  my appreciation  to  the 

Speaker  for  allowing  you,  Deputy  Speaker,  to  obtain  the  necessary  training  and  experience  to 

effectively run our business.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My  first  question  </span><span>pertains  to  Standing  Order  114  (2)  which  states,  “A  Minister  must  not  be  a 

member of a select committee.”  According to Section 2 of the Standing Orders, which states that 

“The Speaker or other person presiding is responsible for ruling whenever any quest</span><span>ion arises as 

to  the  interpretation  or  application  of  a  Standing  Order  and  for  deciding  cases  not  otherwise 

</span><span>provided  for.”    Therefore,  could  you  please  provide  an  explanation  of  the  Speaker's  r</span><span>uling 

concerning this specific Clause of our Standing Orders? 

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for your question.  I would 

like to request the Prime Minister to provide the answer. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.  Congratulations on your assuming your 

first role in the Chair of the House and I see you are being tested straight away by the Leader of 

the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to raise a point of order and that is I want clarification, can a Member of the House ask a 

question  during  Question  Time  to  the  Speaker  because  my  understanding  is,  Question  Time  is 

directed to Ministers. 

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:  </span><span>I appreciate the question from the Leader of the Opposition.  The 

Prime Minister has already provided an answer, and we may discuss further how to address this 

issue at a later time.  For now, I recognise Honourable Member Tim Varu on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU:  </span><span>Congratulations to you Mr Deputy Speaker, for leading our Session today.  Kia 

Orana to  all Members present  in  this  Honourable  House.  We would  also  like to  welcome  our 

newly appointed Member and our sister. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a question to ask, which was initially posed by a Member of Parliament from Matavera to 

the Prime Minister at the beginning of 2023.  If I recall, the question was focused on our waste 

management  practices.    I  believe  the  Prime  Minister,  or  maybe  the  Minister  Responsible 

Honourable  Albert  Nicholas,  responded  during  that  Session,  noting  that  the  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Infrastructure was exploring various avenues to reduce waste, including acquiring a machine to 

</span><span>burn rubbish.  Perhaps the Honourable Prime Minister could provide a response to this question 

</span><span>today? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Mr</span><span>Deputy Speaker, thank you for your question to the Prime Minister, 

</span><span>but I would like to provide an answer if I may.  If I understand your question correctly, you are 

</span><span>inquiring about the incinerator.  In terms of the procurement process, it is still ongoing at this time. 

</span></div><div><span>As part of the procurement process, a Request for Quotes was issued, both locally and overseas.  

Approximately 14 to 15 companies have expressed interest and submitted quotes.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding funding for this project, I would like to clarify that it is sourced from the ICF under the 

New  Zealand  Government.    Following  an  investigation,  the  New  Zealand  High  Commission 

Office has been directed to allocate the necessary funds for the project. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  touch  on  the  current  situation  at  the  landfill.    As  you  may  be  aware,  the 

government has contracted TNM's compress machine to compress the rubbish at the landfill using 

a roller.  The compressed rubbish has allowed us to extend the lifespan of the landfill.  I believe 

this answers your question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR DEPUTY SPEAKER:  </span><span>It appears that there are no further questions.  Honourable Members, 

this brings us to the end of our Question Time.  We will now adjourn Parliament for 45 minutes to 

provide an opportunity for this House and other attendees to meet our recently sworn-in Member, 

Mrs Tapaitau.  Parliament is hereby suspended. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.11 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3 p.m.
