<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Kia Orana Deputy Speaker, I would like to extend my greetings to you and 

express our gratitude to God for allowing you to serve as Deputy Speaker in our Parliament.  We 

also warmly welcome our new Member who was sworn in today and enjoyed their Maiden Speech.  

To the Minister of the  Airport,  I have a  question regarding the location of the tractor that was 

purchased to maintain the airport lawn, as I have not seen it recently.  Could you provide an update 

on its whereabouts?
