<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I call the Minister of Finance for the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill 

2024. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana, Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Appropriation Bill 2024  

be now read for the Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Before  I  continue,  I  would  like  to  extend  my 

</span><span>congratulations to our new Member that has been sworn in to this Honourable House today, the 

</span><span>Honourable Member for Tongareva, Sarakura Mary Tapaitau.  Welcome to the Parliament, you 

follow two other strong women in following their husbands into the Parliament House.  And Mr 

</span><span>Speaker  this  demonstrates  the  democracy  of  our  Constitution.    If  there  is  one  thing  that  our 

</span><span>Constitution allows, is it doesn’t ma</span><span>tter who you are, what your walk of life, there is an opportunity 

for you to be elected into this Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>And we have now seven women elected into this Parliament and one more and then we will reach 

one third.  So, I think in the Pacific Region, Mr Speaker our Parliament we have compared to some 

of our pacific neighbours are very high representation of women in our parliament.  But of course,

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I know that the leader of the Opposition will agree with me that we can always use more women 

in the parliament.  And the added bonus, I guess of this Mr Speaker is there is no special provision 

for women in  parliament.  Every Member of Parliament here was elected on their own merits.  

Something that we as a country and our Parliament should be very proud of. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me turn to our Budget Statement, Mr Speaker.  Firstly, I would like to greet the three pillars 

that is represented in our country and we often make reference to them.  Foremost to our Head of 

</span><span>State,  the  King’s  Representative,  Sir  Tom  Marsters  and  Lady  Mars</span><span>ters,  and  all  Members  of 

Parliament.    Honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  Members  of  the  Government  and  Members  of  the 

Opposition and all Members </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To all our island leaders, those who represent our people on each individual island and even here 

on the island of Rarotonga; to all of you that I listening in to our broadcast a very warm welcome 

</span><span>to you all.  I now extend a very warm welcome to our Religious Advisory Council and to all the 

</span><span>leaders of the different denominations in the country, all your church members, I greet you all in 

the Name of the Lord.  To our traditional leaders, the Ui Ariki on our islands and all your supporters 

in different districts, I extend a very warm welcome to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, Kia Orana to all our listeners and those who are watching here in Rarotonga, the Northern 

and Southern Group and those of our people living outside the Cook Islands </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today I am well pleased to be here to talk about o</span><span>ur Government’s 2024 Budget, the 

</span><span>key financing mechanism that will help guide our economy on its continued path of recovery.  It 

is also a great honour and privilege to present to you today my 14</span><span>th</span><span> Budget as your Minister of 

Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our nation has shown incredible strength and resilience over the past year.  However, 

I want to take this opportunity to remind us all of the great challenge that our nation has faced and 

overcame.    Back  in  2019,  our  Half-Year  Economic  and  Fiscal  Update  painted  a  bright  future 

</span><span>showing that our prospects for the next four years were strong and very positive.  And for the first 

</span><span>time in history, we were on track to see our national income, or our GDP, exceeds $600 million, 

</span><span>and was on track by June 2023, to accumulating $2.3 billion in those four years period.  Then the 

</span><span>unforeseen struck </span><span>–</span><span> COVID-19.  Thankfully, our health sector stood resilient, but the necessary 

</span><span>closure of our borders dealt a severe blow to our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, to give you a sense of the impact, imagine that if one of our workers in a restaurant 

or in a shop had to sacrifice $1 out of every $4, then earned for four years.  That is the scale of 

what we have had to face as a nation.  Our actual income during these years fell short by nearly 

</span></div><div><span>551 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>one quarter, which translates to over $500 million lost due to the pandemic.  No other country in 

the region let alone the world experienced such a significant loss. 

</span></div><div><span>This loss was a heavy burden, Mr Speaker comparable to an individual losing a substantial part of 

their  income.    We  are  still  addressing  the  impact,  particularly  through  the  debt  we  incurred  to 

support  our  people  and  businesses  during  this  crisis.    This  additional  $130  million  that  we 

borrowed during the pandemic will need to be repaid, but it was a crucial investment in our people 

and our community </span><span>–</span><span> an investment that I would happily make again without hesitation. 

</span></div><div><span>However, within these challenges, there is a silver lining.  The resilience of our people and the 

renewed strength of our economy is among them.  Just three years after facing the largest economic 

</span><span>downturn in our history, I’m proud to stand here and report that our economy is rebounding well.  

</span><span>We have now reached the $600 million mark, albeit a bit later than expected.  But this shows the 

</span><span>power of our community and our determination to succeed, no matter what challenges we face. 

</span></div><div><span>The Last Budget 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to reflect on our last budget from 202</span><span>3, which was themed “Nurturing a</span><span>Nation.” </span><span> That budget was all about support.  We increased payments for caregivers and for our 

most destitute citizens, supported key positions within Health and Education, and we took care of 

our environment.  The Nurturing extended to supporting our role in the region </span><span>–</span><span> as Chair in the 

Pacific Islands Forum, we also took steps to strengthen our Blue Pacific continent and advocate 

for our regional neighbours around the world.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker,  I want  to  highlight the significant  steps that we have made  on the regional stage, 

particularly in our Blue Pacific continent.  The Cook Islands has led the way in progressing several 

key  initiatives,  including  the  Pacific  Resilience  Fund  (PRF),  and  the  Pacific  Partnerships  for 

Prosperity (PPfP). 

</span></div><div><span>The PPfP is a critical development.  It is designed to help Pacific nations bolster their defenses 

</span><span>against climate change and extreme weather events.  This fund represents a unique opportunity for 

</span><span>our development  partners to  contribute in a way  that empowers us to  manage our own climate 

response effectively. 

</span></div><div><span>On another front, the PPfP represents a collaborative effort across our region.  This initiative brings 

</span><span>together  a  series  of  actions  and  partnerships  that  opens  doors  to  new  funding  and  investment 

</span><span>opportunities, aimed at transforming the Pacific both economically and socially.  I am very proud 

to lead in particular the establishment of the Pacific Centre of Excellence on deep ocean science 

also known as PCDOS which will be based here in the Cook Islands and positions us to become a 

preeminent ocean science hub in the region and the world.  Our involvement not only position us 

</span></div><div><span>552 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>as key players on the regional stage but also ensures that we have a significant say in the shaping 

our future and the future of our Pacific community. 

</span></div><div><span>But we do not stop there, closer to home, we also invested in our economy.  We improved airline 

access and these investments have paid off.  I am proud to report a remarkable 14 percent growth 

in our economy this year, a clear sign of our collective effort, determination, and the resilience of 

our businesses.  By the end of June, we expect to welcome around 160,000 visitors, nearly reaching 

the levels that we saw back in 2019. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I present this year’s Budget, which continues our path to economic recovery, I must express 

</span><span>our deep gratitude to our development partners.  These partners have contributed well over $100 

million in support over the response of COVID-19 and into economic recovery.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I extend a special thank you to the Asian Development Bank, to the Government of 

Japan,  to  the  Green  Climate  Fund,  and  to  the  Global  Environment  Facility  for  their  continued 

support.  But let me particularly highlight the New Zealand Government and the support they have 

continued to provide our country.  In the 2024/25 year alone, they have committed $52 million in 

budget support, $34 million of which directly related to the Cook Islands Infrastructure Trust Fund 

and a total of a $121 million over the past four years.  New Zealand support has been crucial in 

our recovery journey. 

</span></div><div><span>Budget 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our theme for the 2024 Budget is </span><span>“Perseverance”</span><span> or </span><span>“Tautā’anga”</span><span>.  Over the last 

</span><span>four  years,  we’ve  faced  some  of  our  toughest  challenges  in  our  history.</span><span>But  we’ve  shown 

incredible perseverance and today I’m proud to say that our economy has not only recovered, but 

</span><span>that the recovery efforts are exceeding our expectations and the economy is well on its way to 

surpassing our pre-pandemic levels.  We are indeed stepping out into the light.   

</span></div><div><span>However, our journey is not over.  We must continue to persevere.  This budget is designed to 

</span><span>keep us moving forward, to keep us on track and to ensure our recovery is complete and benefits 

</span><span>all Cook Islanders.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as I have shared, our economy continues to show strong signs in its recovery but the 

</span><span>effects of the pandemic will continue to linger and it will take some time before we are fully out 

</span><span>of its shadows, nevertheless I have immense faith that the resilience we have shown as a people 

</span><span>can get us through.   

</span></div><div><span>We are looking towards better days ahead.  If we remain responsible now, we will be ready to 

seizure future opportunities.  This means making smart strategic decisions now, to pave the way 

</span></div><div><span>553 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>for a prosperous tomorrow.  Every choice we make today affects our ability to invest and flourish 

in the future.  Conversely, poor decisions now could close doors that we need to open later.  

</span></div><div><span>The challenge with Budget is that it involves tough choices.  Every dollar we allocate in one area 

means  a  dollar  less  somewhere  else.    This  is  the  reality  of  opportunity  cost.    However,  I  am 

confident that the decisions we have made are wise as they are designed not just to meet immediate 

needs but to set us up for future successes.  

</span></div><div><span>Our private sector has had a strong year last year but they are still on the path to full recovery, a 

journey the government has supported every step of the way.  Now as our businesses regain their 

strength,  it  is  also  time  for  the  government  to  be  prudent,  rebuilding  our  financial  reserves  to 

prepare for any future challenges and to take advantage of future opportunities. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  today’s  budget  is  one  that  shows  government’s  continued  commitment  to  fiscal 

</span><span>responsibility.  It balances the need to build our reserves while continuing to invest in essential 

areas of our economy and our society.  This approach not only prepares us for future uncertainties 

but also ensures we can face any challenges ahead with confidence </span><span>–</span><span> whether those challenges be 

natural disasters or economic challenges or God forbid, another pandemic. 

</span></div><div><span>It is remarkable, Mr Speaker to reflect on the severe economic downturn that we experienced </span><span>–</span><span>

one of the largest in the world </span><span>–</span><span> and to see how quickly we have bounced back.  This recovery is 

</span><span>a testament to our enduring faith in God’s providence and to the effectiveness of the policies that 

</span><span>we implemented during the pandemic and the strategic investments we made since reopening our 

borders. 

</span></div><div><span>The responsibility shown in this Budget and the previous ones allows us to provide support to key 

parts  of  our  society  and  especially  those  who  help  others  so  we  can  all  benefit.    This  budget 

reaffirms  increases  in  support  for  people  caring  for  their  loved  ones  as  well  as  support  to  key 

</span><span>NGO’s which provide important services across our community to our most vulnerable.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, let us turn our attention to the exciting developments in our tourism sector.  By the 

</span><span>end  of  this  fiscal  year  in  June  we  expect  to  have  welcomed  more  than  30,000  visitors  from 

Australia  </span><span>–</span><span>  more  than  in  any  previous  year.    We  also  anticipate  over  15,000  visitors  from  the 

</span><span>Northern  Hemisphere,  broadening  our  tourism  market  beyond  our  traditional  ties  with  New 

</span><span>Zealand.  This diversification not only enhances our economic resilience but also strengthens our 

</span><span>recovery. 

</span></div><div><span>With these developments and our continued careful planning to ensure sustainable tourism, we are 

</span><span>not just navigating through challenges, we are also preparing to thrive in the times to come.

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Economic outlook 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  today’s  budget  shows  that  despite  some  economic  headwinds  that  we  have 

</span><span>experienced, the economic outlook for the Cook Islands is positive, as we have climbed out of the 

depths  of  the  pandemic  and  are  moving  rapidly  back  towards  the  prosperity  that  we  once 

experienced. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  GDP  is  on  the  rise  again,  very  quickly  as  we  fill  in  the  gap  from  the  hole  caused  by  the 

pandemic </span><span>–</span><span> our growth rates will return to more levels as our cycle continues and GDP is projected 

to grow by just over 4 percent in the financial year 2025.  This is solid growth when compared to 

any other economy but it does pale in comparison to the 14 percent that we will experience this 

year and the 27 percent growth from 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>We must also acknowledge, Mr Speaker the surge in price inflation over the past two years.  This 

peaked in late 2022 and was the highest inflation that we have faced in our history.  Thankfully 

the rapid growth of prices has slowed down but prices still remain high and they are unlikely to 

fall back to where they were just over two years ago.  Factors beyond our control such as the global 

supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions and various conflicts resulting in volatile oil prices 

and supply distributions have been the major contributors to this inflation. 

</span></div><div><span>Over the past year to March 2024, inflation was 4.2 percent and food prices rose by 4.8 percent.  I 

would like to stress that this inflation is something that government cannot control as it is coming 

from outside of our country but this slowing of inflation is welcome, even if it is not slowing as 

quickly as we would like. 

</span></div><div><span>The slowing down of inflation is welcome with its peak in 2022 being well behind us.  This is 

consistent with the experiences in New Zealand and Australia who have seen inflation declining 

though  not  as  rapidly  as  we  would  desire  but  government  is  continuing  to  undertake  work 

throughout economic recovery roadmap to ease costs and put downward pressure on prices. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we are also actively working on advancements that promise to transform the way we 

</span><span>do business in our country.  Our collaboration with the banking sector aims to enhance our payment 

system.    This  is  crucial  as  it  will  empower  our  local  businesses  to  explore  and  expand  into 

</span><span>eCommerce and to use digital platforms which are vital in today’s global market.</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, we have undertaken significant efforts to setup regulations for our utilities.  The goal 

</span><span>here  is  straight-forward,  we  want  these  sectors  to  operate  more  efficiently  and  ensure  that  our 

people pay only what is necessary to maintain these essential services. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to say a few words about Perseverance.   

</span></div><div><span>555

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Perseverance 

</span></div><div><span>As we discussed perseverance and the spirit of resilience, I am reminded of a powerful Verse from 

the Bible that speaks directly to our collective journey and this verse is from the Book of James, 

Chapter 1, verse 12 which reads: </span><span>“Blessed is the one who</span><span> perseveres under trial because, having 

stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who 

</span><span>love Him.”</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Bible Verse encourages us all to be patient and keep pushing forward, especially 

through the toughest times.  And it teaches us that it is through adversity that we are able to grow, 

not only as individuals but also as a nation.  That there is great reward, not just in material terms, 

but in the strength and unity we hold as a community when we face challenges together. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker as we continue to navigate the challenges ahead, let us draw inspiration from these 

words.    Let  us  continue  to  be  patient  and  embrace  adversity  as  an  opportunity  to  grow,  and 

perseverance as a necessity to strengthen us as a nation. 

</span></div><div><span>A  core  aspect  of  perseverance,  means  standing  strong  even  when  times  are  tough.    As  Cook 

Islanders, our future </span><span>–</span><span> of our communities, businesses, economy and environment </span><span>–</span><span> relies heavily 

on our resilience. 

</span></div><div><span>And throughout our history, Mr Speaker, we have faced numerous setbacks.  Each time, we have 

demonstrated remarkable strength.  These challenges remind us that we must be prepared for future 

difficulties that will come our way.  While resilience might not always be visible, especially in 

politics,  it  is  crucial  and  requires  our  full  attention.    It  prompts  us  to  look  beyond  temporary 

victories and focus on achievement that las for generations. 

</span></div><div><span>Fiscal outlook 

</span></div><div><span>As we look at this year’s Budget, it reflects our ongoing commitment to fis</span><span>cal responsibility.  This 

</span><span>budget moves towards a neutral fiscal stance, meaning we aim to spend only what we bring in, 

</span><span>avoiding any unnecessary debt.  This careful balance is critical as it prepares us to handle future 

economic shocks or natural disasters without relying excessively on borrowing. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, managing our nation’s finances responsibly means ensuring we have enough funds 

</span><span>to  handle  unexpected  challenges  such  as,  being  able  to  respond  to  another  economic  shock  or 

</span><span>natural disaster or that we have the fiscal capacity to draw down on debt to respond if we need to 

and as we have done in the past.  Our journey to financial health is not without its difficulties, 

especially as our debt repayment will significantly increase, reaching over $30 million dollars per 

</span></div><div><span>556 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 15 May 2024 

</span></div><div><span>Eighth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>year by the end of this decade.  This requires a substantial part of our revenue, emphasising the 

need for careful financial management. 

</span></div><div><span>However, the good news is that we have been actively discussing with our funding partners in 

particular the Asian Development Back, ways to effectively manage our debt.  These conversations 

are promising, and as we indicated at the budget breakfast this morning, the potential outcomes 

look very promising.  But we must remain cautious with our spending. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, while this Budget 2024 might seem stringent due to the high cost of living, it is part 

of  a  broader  plan  to  ensure  the  recovery  of  our  government  revenues,  which  lag  behind  the 

economic recovery. 

</span></div><div><span>However, this does not mean cutting essential spending.  The government will continue to invest 

in our economy to bolster future resilience.  This includes following through with our Economic 

Recovery  Roadmap,  enhancing  government  services,  and  making  strategic  capital  investments.  

Now is not the time for austerity but for prudent investment.  Experience from around the world 

has shown us that drastic budget cuts, often referred to as austerity, has rarely  yielded the best 

results.  In fact, such measures can leave lasting negative impacts on the economy, what we might 

call economic scarring.  For us in the Cook Islands, this could mean something very specific and 

very  personal  </span><span>–</span><span>  increase  migration  of  our  people  abroad.    When  time  gets  tough  here.    The 

prospects of earning a New Zealand income can seem very appealing. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  our  goal  is  to  make  the  Cook  Islands  not  only  a  beautiful  place  to  live  but  also  a 

prosperous and stable one, where our people can thrive without having to look elsewhere.
