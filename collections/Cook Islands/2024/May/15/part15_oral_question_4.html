<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to address the House.  As 

previously stated by our Chaplain from Nikao, we should receive our newly elected Member with 

open arms.  I would like to take this opportunity to welcome her and commend her for taking on 

this challenge. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question raised in this House regards the support of the different dialects and languages spoken 

on individual islands in our education system.  I am pleased with this question, as the newly elected 

Education Secretary, Owen Lewis, has assured me of his efforts to teach our language in schools, 

beginning at the preschool level up to Year 6.  It is notable that other countries, such as Fiji, Samoa, 

China, Japan, and Korea, have legislation requiring the teaching of their respective languages in 

</span><span>schools.  However, this is not currently mandated by law in our country.  Therefore, I believe it is 

</span><span>essential that we include this mandate in our Education Act. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I had the privilege of attending a meeting for the Council of the University of the South Pacific in 

</span><span>Vanuatu two weeks ago, where it was approved and agreed upon to endorse a Certificate of Maori 

</span><span>Studies, focused on teaching and recognising our language and culture.  This is why I am content 

</span><span>with the Member from Matavera's question. There is strong community support for the teaching 

of our language, as it not only encourages the preservation of our customs but also combats the 

predicted disappearance of our indigenous languages by the end of this century.

</span></div>
<div><span>Deputy Speaker, it is the government's intention to promote the use of our language, not only for 

today but for the generations to come.  Thank you.
