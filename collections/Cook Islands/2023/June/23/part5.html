<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>We have now come to Question Time, and Question Time is for 30 minutes and I now open the 

Floor  for  Question  Time.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  sorry,  I  see  the 

</span><span>Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to respond to the questions raised yesterday 

by the Members of Ivirua and of Amuri/Ureia. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, to the question regarding the application of tax to those collecting the New Zealand pension 

who resides in the Outer Islands.  We are all subject to the same tax laws in our country but because 

this side of the House approved the change to the tax structure for the Outer Islands, just to remind 

</span><span>our people that it was not Parliament that changed it, it was this side of the House because the 

</span><span>Opposition opposed to it.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>July,  those  Pensioners’  income  will  be  assessed  under  the  new  tax  regime, 

</span><span>which means if their income is below $60,000 per annum, they will not be taxed.  That is good 

news for our people living in the Outer Islands who are collecting this pension.  But not just this 

pension, if your income is less than $60,000, you will not be taxed. 

This is an example of a good economic policy from a very good Government which leads me to 

the answer to the Member for Ivirua asking about what the current departure tax is.  Currently, the 

departure tax in every ticket is $77.68 and that applies to passengers over 12 years old. 

</span></div><div><span>Again, a bit of history for us, in 2011, this Government held an economic summit and amongst a 

number  of  economic  initiatives,  one  of  them  those  who  can  remember  was  to  incorporate  the 

departure tax into the airline ticket. 

</span></div><div><span>Many  of us will remember in  those days that there was  a booth at  the airport  and if  you  were 

departing, you would have to pay your departure tax and get a stamp or a ticket before you depart.  

Despite the  efforts of previous Governments  in  trying to incorporate the  departure tax into the 

ticket, there was  great reluctance from the likes of Air New Zealand in particular to do this.  I 

</span><span>remember very distinctly some of their comments were, “if you incorporate this departure tax into 

</span><span>the ticket, your tourism industr</span><span>y will collapse.”   This will led to again this Government compelling 

</span><span>the airlines to do that by changing the departure tax law and forcing the airlines to incorporate this 

tax into their tickets and rather than our tourism collapsing, the opposite occurred of course and 

over the last ten years, we have experienced the significant tourism boom. 

</span></div><div><span>We did not just incorporate the departure tax into the ticket, we also incorporated an annual amount 

of increase or indexing of the departure tax each year and I do not recall the amount but it is a 

small amount of probably two percent or less.  Our team will dig up on that but each year, that 

departure tax increases by a little bit to keep up with the pace of inflation. 

</span></div><div><span>So, while today, the departure tax is calculated at $77.68.  From 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, it will be a slight increase 

to $79.23.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  Please accept our apology Honourable 

Members, we forgot about the outstanding accounts for reply this morning.  I see the Honourable 

Toanui Isamaela; you have the Fsloor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:   </span><span>Mr Speaker, greetings to you and all your staff and to Members on the 

Government side and the Opposition side.  I rise to comment on the answer by the Prime Minister 

to my question from yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Is that a Supplementary Question? 

</span></div><div><span>295 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>Yes, I want to clarify my question first.  The Prime Minister stated that the 

Opposition was not in support of this tax system for the Outer Islands.  I want this House to know 

that I am not on the Opposition; I am in the middle.  I was one of the first Member to support this 

tax reform because I represent the Outer Islands. 

 My  question  to  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  can  he  explain  again  to  this  House  whether  a 

discussion with New Zealand regarding New Zealand Pensioners here in the Cook Islands took 

place?  I wonder whether our people will face any issues in the future regarding this. 

</span></div><div><span>I remember back in 2013, it is an income for those who collecting the pension. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see that you have the same shirt as your two 

colleagues from Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you again to the Member for Amuri/Ureia.  

You are quite right, the colours are changing and maybe next week, your shirt will be green. 

</span></div><div><span>I think we all remember that incident with the Grey Power back in 2013 and at that time, the tax 

department was applying the tax law of our country and that led to a number of people being caught 

with arrears in tax that they had to pay n their income, which was the New Zealand pension.  It 

was a matter of great concern to myself as the Minister of Finance at the time and even though we 

</span><span>did remedy the situation and returned the tax that were taken from people’s accounts; it still left a 

very bad taste in many of people’s minds.</span></div><div><span>Since then, much effort was made by the Tax Department to assist those who were collecting the 

New Zealand pension to ensure that they could meet their tax obligations and pay their tax in the 

</span><span>prescribed time.  In that way, they were complying with the tax law of our country like every other 

</span><span>person in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>So, the question whether we will get into another situation like that is a very good point.  I can 

assure the Member that once the law change comes into effect on 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, our people will be under 

that umbrella of the tax law which means, if the tax free threshold is  increased to  $60,000  for 

residents of the Outer Islands, then they fall under that umbrella until their income exceed $60,000, 

there will be no tax deducted from their income.   

</span></div><div><span>So, I do not see any issues in the future because our people are protected under our tax laws.  Thank 

you.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    Before  I  let  the  Member  raise  her 

question, I would like to acknowledge the presence of one of our sons in the Public Gallery who 

is  involved  with  the  New  Zealand  Parliament.    Now  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Tina 

Browne to take the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    This  question  is  a  result  of  the 

explanation by the Prime Minister regarding the tax for the Outer Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps the explanation is for only that side of the House supporting that Bill because I have had 

many calls from Rakahanga; this is the other Pa Enua you do not know about or you on that side 

do not know about because they could not understand this Bill.  To them, this Bill really did nothing 

for them.  I can understand the Members of Parliament with large populations that support the Bill 

but islands like us, Mitiaro and maybe Penrhyn; I am not sure what the benefit is.  

</span></div><div><span>The reason why I say that Prime Minister and you can perhaps explain it in response is that there 

are 25 Public Servants in Rakahanga; 21 of them are on the Minimum Wage.  And it is those 21 

that desperately need the assistance, and it is those 21 who cannot afford a tin of corned beef.  The 

four, maybe four, are the ones that possibly can afford the corned beef who will benefit slightly 

from the Pa Enua income tax. 

</span></div><div><span>So, that is the explanation as to why I was not supportive of the Bill because I could not see how 

it would benefit the people of Rakahanga.  I can however understand the other islands like Aitutaki, 

Mangaia who have more people that receives above the Minimum Wage supporting the Bill.  The 

question to you Prime Minister is explain to me how is it that my view of the matter is wrong. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for 

</span><span>this opportunity to speak more about our tax policy.  

</span></div><div><span>What this policy is about Mr Speaker is more than just the immediate benefit to some of our people.  

This  is  about  creating  and enabling the  environment  that will assist  our communities in  the Pa 

Enua.  This is about changing the minds, the views and attitudes of people who may be choosing 

to reside in the Pa Enua.  This is about having a vision about what life would be like if you chose 

to go and work in the Pa Enua.  So, while we are creating an enabling environment to lift economic 

opportunities in the Pa Enua, we are also looking at the immediate concerns of incomes of how 

</span><span>people especially the minimum incomes which is why we looked at things like the Minimum Wage 

</span><span>and though we have a very lean budget, we have managed to find some ways to accommodate the 

recommendations to increase our Minimum Wage by a little bit.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>You will recall I mentioned in 2011, we held an Economic Summit.  During that time, a number 

of  initiatives  were  proposed  and  I  mentioned  the  simple  things  like  the  incorporation  of  the 

Departure Tax into the tickets, but there were host of other economic reforms that Government 

instituted.  Those reforms were to create an enabling environment so that our Private Sector could 

drive the economy because back in 2011, the Government did not have any money.  There was no 

bucket of resources and there was no stabilisation fund.  But we know that the solution of lifting 

economic prosperity was not just giving immediate money in the short term but it is to build the 

environment so that our Private Sector the engine of the economy can really start growing.  

</span></div><div><span>So, in the period from 2011 to 2018, our economy went from $350 million a year to over $500 

million a year.  Almost a doubling of our economy.  That lead to the OECD declaring our country 

in 2020 to be a high income or Developed Nation status. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Point of Order 244!  If you the Prime Minister can answer my 

question, it is just simple.  Suppose to be an easy answer. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Yes, but I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition that if the question 

is easy then the answer should easy.  But to bring my answer to a very short conclusion then Mr 

Speaker, how is this change in the tax going to benefit the people on Rakahanga?  Yes, the benefit 

is only to a few today when we just look in front of our nose but the benefit will be great to many 

when we look to the horizon.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER</span><span>:  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Speaker.  My question is  directed to  the  Leader of the nation.  

Maybe the Minister for Culture can reply but I will direct the question to the Leader of the nation.  

The question is because our Minister and his Associate will be attending a conference and I believe 

they depart this weekend, can you please explain to us about this conference because I believe in 

the conference, the Cook Islands has been nominated to chair?  Can you please explain the nature 

of the conference because I believe this is an important meeting that we are chairing plus we have 

a festival coming up? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor.
