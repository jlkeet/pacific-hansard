<div><span>CORRECTIVE SERVICES: 

</span></div><div><span>I think, before we proceed on to this Vote Item, I have seen most of us speaking to this Vote Item 

in the last couple of days.  Some of us have raised some issues concerning this Vote Item.  No one 

have experienced anything about this Vote Item except for the person who has been there.  

</span></div><div><span>To shorten our time on this Vote Item, I would like to seek leave for everyone to agree for the 

Minister to speak to this Vote Item only.  No?  It is not allowed.  I can see some Members wanting 

to speak to this Vote Item.  Honourable Minister, you will be our final speaker for this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me this time to speak on this Vote Item.  As 

you have rightly stated, most of us Members supports this Budget and I stand to give my support 

to this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>We see in our Budget Book 2, the expenditures for this Vote Item.  This Ministry have improved 

a lot and are well organized.  The structure for this Ministry can be found on Page 66; it is quite 

</span><span>huge and I can see some vacancies.  Although we have a “lean budget”, the Minister of Finance 

</span><span>will have to consider filling up these vacancies, maybe include it in the future budgets. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we can see that the Minister Responsible for this Ministry is doing his job, for he has 

been an inmate himself in the past and I know that he is using his knowledge and experience for 

the administration of this place.   

</span></div><div><span>In  closing,  I  support  this  Vote  Item  and  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Government  to  increase  the 

allocation for this Vote Item to fill the vacancies on their structure.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member for Matavera and I see the Honourable Member 

for Pukapuka-Nassau; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Just like the Member for Matavera, I stand to give 

my strong support to this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>But I stand Mr Speaker for the Vote Items ahead or still to be deliberated on.  I stand to speak for 

all the Outer Islands.  I noticed that the allocation for this Vote Item does not include us in the 

Outer Islands.  As you may be aware, there are only two islands that this allocation will benefit 

them.  Most of the other islands outside of Rarotonga will not benefit because they do not have 

any staff working for this Ministry.  I have asked the Minister Responsible for this Ministry and I 

will ask him again to allocate and to appoint a staff member on each islands for this Ministry as 

responsibilities for this Ministry falls under the Ministry of Justce. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my thoughts Mr Speaker and I support this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to share my thoughts on this 

Vote Item.  I do not support the views of the Member for Pukapuka-Nassau; we in Rakahanga do 

not need a corrective services officer because we do not have any criminal or crimes on our island.  

They are only on Pukapuka-Nassau. 

</span></div><div><span>I only want to raise two points because Honourable Minister, I know you participated at a meeting 

about two weeks ago in regards to the suggestion by the Edgewater Resort in regards to a project 

they are doing opposite the prison in Arorangi.  I believe you attended the meeting together with 

staff from your Ministry of Corrective Services. 

</span></div><div><span>I heard from my sources because I was not present at the meeting that if the project is to go ahead, 

it will benefit the inmates or the prison as a whole.  I know Minister whether it is a go ahead or 

</span><span>not, the landowners will be the last to approve of it. 

</span></div><div><span>My second thought Minister is to ask about the work programs of the inmates in our prison.  I 

know of and am happy with the service that offered by the prison for anyone who needs their pig 

slaughtered and cleaned, the prison inmates could do this; of course, there is a fee that has to be 

paid  for  this  good  service  because  we  do  not  have  an  abattoir  today.    One  of  the  agreed 

arrangements  of  the  payment  is  that  the  owner  takes  his  pig  carcass  away  but  leaves  the  pig 

intestines for the prisoners.   I am  not  happy with  that arrangement because the intestines are a 

</span><span>king’s cuisine.  Not for prisoners but for a king.</span></div><div><span>300

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I have negotiated for the killing of my pig with the prison.  They slaughtered it, cleaned it and 

brought it back with the intestines and I paid them with a carton of chops.  But, the prison warden 

was not happy with my arrangement but I know the other people that use this service cannot afford 

to pay the prison with a carton of chops.  My message here Minister is that I am happy that our 

inmates are occupied or involved with many work programs to do.  We are not to look down on 

slaughtering and cleaning pigs for food because this is a necessary skill in our society. 

</span></div><div><span>We all know that our children who have attended Universities, they do not even know how to kill 

a pig. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the points that I heard you mention in one of the statements that you have given that in the 

past, there were over 60 prisoners and I think you were answering the question from the Member 

for  Matavera  that  now,  during  your  time,  that  number  has  come  down  to  27  I  think.    To  me, 

something must be working there to reduce the numbers from a high number of 60 down to 27. 

</span></div><div><span>When the Minister of Justice spoke on the Juvenile Court, we parents know that we have a mini 

Juvenile Court at home to deal with these juveniles.  So Minister, I support your allocation and 

hope that in the future, if the number of prisoners decreases, that will be even better.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Hon. Member and I would like to acknowledge again the presence 

of one of our daughters in the Public Gallery, the Secretary of Education.  Welcome to Parliament.  

Honourable Minister George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Kia Orana to all of us here today and greetings to all of our people that are 

listening on the radio and watching the livestream.  To you Mr Speaker and the staff, greetings to 

you.  Thank you for the opportunity to sing in this House.  Greetings to our Prime Minister, the 

Leader of the Cook Islands Party and our Nation.  To the Ministers and Members of Government, 

greetings to you all.  I will not forget the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition Tina Browne 

and your Members, Kia Orana.  Kia Orana to the Members of the United Party and the Leader of 

</span><span>One Cook Islands, Toa Isamaela, because I held that position in this House; now I am on this side.  

</span><span>Greetings to you. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  regarding  the  Vote  Item  for  the  Corrective  Services,  I  have  come  up  with  an  idea  that  I 

formed when I was in prison one evening and I will present this to the House.  I was in prison for 

a long time and when I become depressed, I will recite a chant but today Mr Speaker, I will sing 

because I am happy with thus appropriation and this song goes like this; Mr Speaker may  I be 

allowed to sing?  </span><span>(Minister proceeds to sing).</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  want  to  speak  on  the  thoughts  of  the  Member  for  Matavera  in  regards  to  this 

allocation.  When we study the structure for 2021, this is now 2023 and according to the structure, 

</span></div><div><span>301

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>the vacancies have all been filled and sorry Honourable Member, you are too late.  Thank you for 

your thoughts though. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I want to reply to the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne 

and thank you for your thoughts.  When I became the Minister, there were 68 inmates and today, 

there are only 27 inmates.  That means, Corrective Services is working well but the Police is not 

doing their part to fill the prison cells.  Maybe our youth are behaving now. 

</span></div><div><span>I heard the part of pigs being killed and dressed at the prison and the payment is a carton of chops.  

To my thinking, we should not pay with meat rather the payment should be ice cream.  The idea 

here is what you can afford to give as payment, they will accept it. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I think we have all been to school and we will see there are two departments in this 

one Vote Item.  Their intention is to increase the allocation for Corrective Services because there 

are two departments and we should give another $1.8 million for prison only and the other for 

Probation.  Note, that there are two departments  and not one.  On the heading, it is Corrective 

Services but with two branches, Probation and Prison.  So, I am asking if it will be possible Mr 

Prime Minister, in the next Budget, consider this area as my Secretary finds it difficult to make 

ends meet. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe you all support the allocation for this year but next year, please notice that there are two 

departments and for the Ministry of Finance to consider my request for these two departments. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now make a request to the Minister of Justice that if a person from an outer island commits 

a crime that they should be left to serve their prison time on their own island.  They commit the 

crimes on their islands and are brought to Rarotonga for me to deal with. 

</span></div><div><span>There is a request from the Honourable Member for Pukapuka for an Office for Pukapuka.  Yes, I 

have asked the Secretary concerning this but I am not sure when that will happen.  It could possibly 

</span><span>mean that there is  enough funds; but  it is  not  just  for Pukapuka only, there is  also  a prison on 

</span><span>Mangaia, Aitutaki, Atiu and Mauke but is not been made use of and that is why I asked for these 

prisoners to serve their sentences on their own islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker and to the Minister and to all of us in Rarotonga, if you are an offender from Tupapa, 

you should then be sent to Tupapa to serve your time.  If you are an offender from Arorangi or 

elsewhere, to you should then be send back there to serve your time.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have come to the end of my speech and like what I have mentioned earlier, I need 

to look at this Appropriation.  In the meantime, I support the Vote Item for Corrective Service.  

These words remind me of what our Lord Jesus Christ had said to His disciples, </span><span>“Verily, verily I

</span></div><div><span>say unto you that there is no greater love than that you love one another as I have loved you that 

</span><span>you may live in peace.”</span></div><div><span>From me to  you all, thank you because I will be leaving some time later this evening overseas 

hence why I shared this with you all.  Also, because Mr Speaker I am the Minister Responsible for 

Culture as well, I will give permission to the Prime Minister to speak on my behalf.  Therefore Mr 

Speaker,  I  will  be  leaving  shortly  at  about  11.30  a.m.,  I  wish  everyone  in  this  House  the  best.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question.  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,815,737 for Corrective Services stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Our next Vote Item is Crown Law, for one hour. 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to</span></div>
