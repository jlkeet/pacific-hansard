<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    This  question  is  a  result  of  the 

explanation by the Prime Minister regarding the tax for the Outer Islands.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps the explanation is for only that side of the House supporting that Bill because I have had 

many calls from Rakahanga; this is the other Pa Enua you do not know about or you on that side 

do not know about because they could not understand this Bill.  To them, this Bill really did nothing 

for them.  I can understand the Members of Parliament with large populations that support the Bill 

but islands like us, Mitiaro and maybe Penrhyn; I am not sure what the benefit is.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The reason why I say that Prime Minister and you can perhaps explain it in response is that there 

are 25 Public Servants in Rakahanga; 21 of them are on the Minimum Wage.  And it is those 21 

that desperately need the assistance, and it is those 21 who cannot afford a tin of corned beef.  The 

four, maybe four, are the ones that possibly can afford the corned beef who will benefit slightly 

from the Pa Enua income tax. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, that is the explanation as to why I was not supportive of the Bill because I could not see how 

it would benefit the people of Rakahanga.  I can however understand the other islands like Aitutaki, 

Mangaia who have more people that receives above the Minimum Wage supporting the Bill.  The 

question to you Prime Minister is explain to me how is it that my view of the matter is wrong. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for 

</span><span>this opportunity to speak more about our tax policy.  

</span></div>
<div><span>What this policy is about Mr Speaker is more than just the immediate benefit to some of our people.  

This  is  about  creating  and enabling the  environment  that will assist  our communities in  the Pa 

Enua.  This is about changing the minds, the views and attitudes of people who may be choosing 

to reside in the Pa Enua.  This is about having a vision about what life would be like if you chose 

to go and work in the Pa Enua.  So, while we are creating an enabling environment to lift economic 

opportunities in the Pa Enua, we are also looking at the immediate concerns of incomes of how 

</span><span>people especially the minimum incomes which is why we looked at things like the Minimum Wage 

</span><span>and though we have a very lean budget, we have managed to find some ways to accommodate the 

recommendations to increase our Minimum Wage by a little bit.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>You will recall I mentioned in 2011, we held an Economic Summit.  During that time, a number 

of  initiatives  were  proposed  and  I  mentioned  the  simple  things  like  the  incorporation  of  the 

Departure Tax into the tickets, but there were host of other economic reforms that Government 

instituted.  Those reforms were to create an enabling environment so that our Private Sector could 

drive the economy because back in 2011, the Government did not have any money.  There was no 

bucket of resources and there was no stabilisation fund.  But we know that the solution of lifting 

economic prosperity was not just giving immediate money in the short term but it is to build the 

environment so that our Private Sector the engine of the economy can really start growing.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So, in the period from 2011 to 2018, our economy went from $350 million a year to over $500 

million a year.  Almost a doubling of our economy.  That lead to the OECD declaring our country 

in 2020 to be a high income or Developed Nation status.
