</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 68: 

</span></div><div><span>Financial Statement for the Office of the Minister George Angene 

for the year ended 30</span><span>th</span><span> June 2022. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 229 (6), Papers 65 to Paper 68 is hereby classified for 

referral to the Public Account Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Clerk.  I see the Leader of the Opposition the Honourable 

Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  to  you  this  morning  Mr  Speaker  and  to  all  of  us 

Honourable Members in the House today.  Kia Orana to our people listening on the radio and those 

watching our livestream.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand Mr Speaker to seek a point of clarification on Paper 65.  I believe that Paper 65 should be 

referred to the PAC committee. 

</span></div><div><span>I am not clear why it is just 68 that will be referred to PAC and not 65 also because it has some 

financial implications. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The Clerk has referred all these Papers to the Public Accounts Committee.  You 

</span><span>will see under Paper No. 68 that “pursuant to Standing Order 229 (6), Paper Number 68 is hereby 

classified and referred to the Public Accounts Committee”; the Clerk did declare for these Papers 

</span><span>for referral to PAC.  Thank you Honourable Member and thank you Clerk.
