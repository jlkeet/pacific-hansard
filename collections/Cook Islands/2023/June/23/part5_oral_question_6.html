<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you again to the Member for Amuri/Ureia.  

You are quite right, the colours are changing and maybe next week, your shirt will be green. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I think we all remember that incident with the Grey Power back in 2013 and at that time, the tax 

department was applying the tax law of our country and that led to a number of people being caught 

with arrears in tax that they had to pay n their income, which was the New Zealand pension.  It 

was a matter of great concern to myself as the Minister of Finance at the time and even though we 

</span><span>did remedy the situation and returned the tax that were taken from people’s accounts; it still left a 

very bad taste in many of people’s minds.</span></div>
<div><span>Since then, much effort was made by the Tax Department to assist those who were collecting the 

New Zealand pension to ensure that they could meet their tax obligations and pay their tax in the 

</span><span>prescribed time.  In that way, they were complying with the tax law of our country like every other 

</span><span>person in our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, the question whether we will get into another situation like that is a very good point.  I can 

assure the Member that once the law change comes into effect on 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, our people will be under 

that umbrella of the tax law which means, if the tax free threshold is  increased to  $60,000  for 

residents of the Outer Islands, then they fall under that umbrella until their income exceed $60,000, 

there will be no tax deducted from their income.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I do not see any issues in the future because our people are protected under our tax laws.  Thank 

you.
