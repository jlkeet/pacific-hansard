<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to respond to the questions raised yesterday 

by the Members of Ivirua and of Amuri/Ureia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, to the question regarding the application of tax to those collecting the New Zealand pension 

who resides in the Outer Islands.  We are all subject to the same tax laws in our country but because 

this side of the House approved the change to the tax structure for the Outer Islands, just to remind 

</span><span>our people that it was not Parliament that changed it, it was this side of the House because the 

</span><span>Opposition opposed to it.

<div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>July,  those  Pensioners’  income  will  be  assessed  under  the  new  tax  regime, 

</span><span>which means if their income is below $60,000 per annum, they will not be taxed.  That is good 

news for our people living in the Outer Islands who are collecting this pension.  But not just this 

pension, if your income is less than $60,000, you will not be taxed. 

This is an example of a good economic policy from a very good Government which leads me to 

the answer to the Member for Ivirua asking about what the current departure tax is.  Currently, the 

departure tax in every ticket is $77.68 and that applies to passengers over 12 years old. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Again, a bit of history for us, in 2011, this Government held an economic summit and amongst a 

number  of  economic  initiatives,  one  of  them  those  who  can  remember  was  to  incorporate  the 

departure tax into the airline ticket. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Many  of us will remember in  those days that there was  a booth at  the airport  and if  you  were 

departing, you would have to pay your departure tax and get a stamp or a ticket before you depart.  

Despite the  efforts of previous Governments  in  trying to incorporate the  departure tax into the 

ticket, there was  great reluctance from the likes of Air New Zealand in particular to do this.  I 

</span><span>remember very distinctly some of their comments were, “if you incorporate this departure tax into 

</span><span>the ticket, your tourism industr</span><span>y will collapse.”   This will led to again this Government compelling 

</span><span>the airlines to do that by changing the departure tax law and forcing the airlines to incorporate this 

tax into their tickets and rather than our tourism collapsing, the opposite occurred of course and 

over the last ten years, we have experienced the significant tourism boom. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We did not just incorporate the departure tax into the ticket, we also incorporated an annual amount 

of increase or indexing of the departure tax each year and I do not recall the amount but it is a 

small amount of probably two percent or less.  Our team will dig up on that but each year, that 

departure tax increases by a little bit to keep up with the pace of inflation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, while today, the departure tax is calculated at $77.68.  From 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, it will be a slight increase 

to $79.23.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
