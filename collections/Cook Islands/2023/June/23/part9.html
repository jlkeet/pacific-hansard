</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:  </span><span> Kia Orana Mr Speaker,  Clerk and staff and Honourable Members.  Kia 

Orana again to our people listening in.  I stand to share my thoughts on the Vote Item for Cultural 

Development, on our </span><span>maori</span><span> traditions and practices. 

One of those practices is what we have seen from Puaikura last night when our people from the 

Puaikura Ekalesia reopened Ziona Tapu Church.  The opening ceremony for the Church is one of 

our  traditional  practices  today.    It  was  so  beautifully  organised  and  planned;  thank  you  to  the 

Members of Parliament  from  Puaikura for inviting us.  Before  I depart today, on behalf of the 

people of Titikaveka, I would like to invite all of you watching and listening to this Sitting, to the 

opening ceremony of the Church in Titikaveka next week.  This is not from me, but the Member 

for Matavera and Ngatangiia suggested that when you attend, to ensure you have an envelope and 

to make sure that it is full. 

</span></div><div><span>So, at 4.00 p.m. on Friday next week will be the reopening of the Betela Church at Titikaveka.  To 

the Honourable Prime Minister, because of this trip that you are sending me on, you will act on 

my  behalf  as  my  Assistant  Deacon  at  the  reopening  in  Titikaveka  and  your  mother-in-law  is 

waiting for you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, coming back to the Vote Item for Cultural Development.  I heard the Leader of the 

</span><span>Opposition enquiring to what plans the Government has to help enhance our nation’s economic 

</span><span>diversity.  What other means that we can diversify when we are at the mean time concentrating on 

Seabed Minerals and Tourism?   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe the Prime Minister will understand when we talk about Cultural and Creative 

Industries.  I would like to dwell a little more on the Business Plan for the Ministry of Culture 

Development,  1.3  Culture  and  Language.    Cultural  Creative  Industry,  which  is  to  promote  our 

cultural industry in a safe and sustainable manner to support and stimulate economic activities for 

our indigenous Cook Islands people.  

</span></div><div><span>This is one of the points that mentioned by the Prime Minister in the Economic Summit.  In those 

</span><span>days, back in 2011, a meeting took place to look at what economic streams that our country can 

</span><span>get into.  The idea of Cultural Creative Industries emerged in selling our creativity, our intellectual 

properties, to the world and this is through our music, our designs, patterns and expressions.   

</span></div><div><span>To provide you with a classic example of this, just look at the latest videos available on Netflix, 

you will see them there.  This is a classic example of the United States selling their intellectual 

properties  to  the  world,  making  billions  and  billions  of  dollars.    New  Zealand  started  with  the 

</span><span>Movie Director Peter Jackson’s filming of the </span><span>Lord of the Rings</span><span>; other programmes such as the 

</span><span>Survivors series were filmed here.  We hear about country songs and rap music all over the world.  

</span><span>An example of Culture and Creative Industries, which we actually excel in through music, songs, 

dancing and so forth.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Back in 2010, I worked with the Member Tingika Elikana from Pukapuka.  In those years, I think 

he was the Secretary for the Ministry of Justice or the Solicitor General and I was the Head of the 

Ministry of Cultural Development and along with the Head of Foreign Affairs at that time, Myra 

Moekaa  created  the  legislative  base  for  our  Cultural  Industries.    There  were  two  laws  that  we 

brought  to  Parliament,  which  Parliament  had  passed.    One  on  Copyright  and  the  other  on 

Traditional Knowledge.   

</span></div><div><span>With this legal framework in place, we had the legal basis to push this industry forward, passed in 

2013  in  this  House.    All  it  needed  was  the  Ministry  of  Cultural  Development  to  create  the 

Regulations under the Act to bring these acts into force.  Unfortunately, since then, this had not 

moved ahead so I intend to work through with these Ministries to keep pushing these aspects for 

Cultural Creative Industries.  In their Business Plan, they identified selling products and marketing, 

promoting our drumming, our weaving, costumes-</span><span>tapa, </span><span>and others.  However, Mr Speaker, they 

stopped at highlighting; we want to move ahead to actually create an industry production, selling 

this so that the people who created this will benefit.   

</span></div><div><span>I  acknowledge  and  commend  </span><span>Motone  Productions</span><span>  here  in  the  Cook  Islands.    This  company 

</span><span>Motone Productions,</span><span> the owner is Glen and Tuaine and they promote our culture and music to 

make our people benefit from music. 

</span></div><div><span>I think the Clerk has given me the signal that I have come to the end of time.  I fully support this 

Vote Item but it needs a lot of work.  I intend to be part of that work going forward.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Robert Heather; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in the House this afternoon.  

</span><span>Greetings to you Mr Speaker and all your staff of Parliament.  Greetings to the Prime Minister, 

</span><span>your  Cabinet  Ministers  and  all  your  Government  Members.    Greetings  to  the  Leaders  on  the 

Opposition side of the House, the Democratic Party, our United Party and the One Cook Islands 

Member. 

</span></div><div><span>I bring this message to this House from the organisers of the special event last evening in Puaikura.  

Through me, I convey the appreciation of our Reverend, the Servant of God, his assistant and the 

company of deacons and all the CICC Church members of Arorangi, to thank you all for attending 

</span><span>and making the opening ceremony of our Church Ziona a special event.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to the debate of the House on the Cultural Development Vote Item and to what has 

been mentioned by the Member of Temurimotia on our traditions and customs.  Of course, the 

message from the Secretary for the Titikaveka CICC Church to the Government of today.  You all 

heard the message and I will leave that into your capable hands. 

Secondly, I would like to speak on the matter before the House.  The Member for Titikaveka was 

pointing  out  the  importance  of  our</span><span>“Reo”,</span><span>  our  language  and  traditions  and  customs.    We  are 

speaking our language in here, but out there, it is a different story.  The language problem starts in 

our  own  homes.    In  regards  to  our  schools  on  this  issue,  we  have  spoken  about  in  one  of  our 

previous Sittings.  I will leave that to the two Ministers of Cultural Development and Education to 

promote our language in the schools. 

</span></div><div><span>Our customs and traditions have differently changed; the way we look, the colour of our skin and 

our  Churches  now,  we  will  be  commemorating  the  200-year  anniversary  of  the  arrival  of 

Christianity.  We cannot stop these changes but accept it and this acceptance must begin in this 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>Another considering for this Ministry is our historical sites or places.  These are our </span><span>Marae</span><span> and 

special sites in our country.  Many families or landowners are creating issues with these traditional 

sites and I know that when the </span><span>Marae</span><span> is lost, the family will be gone and the island people will be 

lost.  Recently, there was an argument between families about a particular </span><span>Marae</span><span>; this problem 

has not been resolved.  It has reached the Office of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Cultural 

Development.  We will wait for the outcome from these high offices. 

</span></div><div><span>On this Vote Item, I give my strong support.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Tukaka Ama; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Members of this Honourable House, Kia Orana to all of us in the 

</span><span>Name of the Lord.  Not to take too much of our time, I will be brief on the talk on this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I give my strong support to this Vote Item for the Ministry of Cultural Development. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, for the next Budget for next year which I have discussed with the Minister Responsible, 

which I feel is important to this Ministry to be included next time around.  I was surprises that my 

Honourable friends, Vaitoti Tupa and Sonny Williams did not raise this issue of what I am about 

to put forward.  The drumming culture of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>We,  Sonny,  Vaitoti  and  I  are  keen  drummers  and  experts  too.    This  is  one  of  our  best-known 

cultural identity and which distinguishes us from the other pacific cultures, our drumming.  Singing 

</span></div><div><span>311 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>is not our best-</span><span>known culture, which belongs to the Tahitians and New Zealand Māori.  But we 

</span><span>are the best drummers in the pacific region and I personally know that other culture cannot compare 

with us. 

</span></div><div><span>I am proud today that there are three drumming experts or </span><span>“ta’unga”</span><span> in this Honourable House, 

the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa, the Honourable Sonny Williams and myself, Honourable Tukaka 

Ama.  We all love our drumming; it is our food.  I would like to be included in the next Budget an 

allocation in the Ministry of Cultural Development for teaching our youth and children our specific 

arts or traditions of drumming. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the reason, when the annual period for the Constitution Celebrations (Maire Maeva Nui) 

approaches, one of the things that dance groups will look for are good drummers.  When there are 

</span><span>cultural events in our villages, a common question will be asked if “we have any good drummers.”  </span></div><div><span>Quite recently, there was a graduation ceremony at Pa Ariki Marae for adult graduates.  I, Member 

of Parliament, had to go and drum at this ceremony, which made it very special. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that we need to show our support for this vital cultural feature of our race and the way 

we treat this important aspect of our culture, our drumming.  We get the drummers to drum at an 

event and then after that, without thinking ahead, we dismiss them.  Drumming is a talent that we 

need to foster in our children and youth.  Drumming also identifies you as a Cook Islander. 

</span></div><div><span>Quite recently, George George of CITC hosted a drumming competition for our youth that our 

young people had learnt from it.  Why was he able to do this?  There was funding.  As the Minister 

for Cultural Development is absent, I can guarantee that funding will be made available for this 

program in the next Budget.  I will not ask for much, it will not reach a million dollars, only a few 

hundred thousand and that is all. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that this program should be taught in schools and the staff of the Ministry of Cultural 

</span><span>Development should go through the villages to teach our children.  I know there are many young 

</span><span>people in the villages wanting to learn this skill but the only problem is that there are no teachers 

to teach them.  Just as well we have dance groups who perform in hotels who takes these youth 

and teach them the drumming skills.   

</span></div><div><span>That is all I have to say in support of this Vote Item and to assure you that there will be an increase 

in this Vote Item in the next Budget.  Mr Speaker, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  would  recommend  the  three  of  you 

</span><span>Honourable Members to host a workshop every  month for that purpose.    I see the  Honourable 

Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>(Member recites a chant)</span><span>.  Greetings to all Members of the House in the Name of 

our Lord.  The reason Mr Speaker why I recite this ancient chant is I want to confirm that this 

chant comes from the island of Aitutaki.  I know that some people are saying that this is their chant.  

The proof of this is, when you look at the genealogy of Tamatoa Ariki, you will find this ancient 

chant in it.  So, to the people of Nga-Pu-Toru, sorry, this chant is not ours but it belongs to Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to speak on the appropriation for the Ministry of Cultural Development.  Firstly Mr Speaker, 

I support this Vote Item and also support the suggestion that some funds should be found from the 

appropriation of this year to teach our youth in drumming. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when you look at Output 1, in there it shows a section on teaching drumming.  As 

stated  by  the  Member  for  Ngatangiia,  the  problem  is  that  there  are  no  funds  allocated  for  this 

program.  I will not dwell on that because the Member for Ngatangiia have already spoken on that 

matter. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to tell you that all the promotion from Tourism, it is the Member Tukaka Ama 

and the Member for Matavera Vaitoti Tupa, that promotes our country as a destination for tourists.  

I will not talk about the dancers, I will just talk about the drummers.  The dancers are all beautiful 

individuals both girls and boys and one of the men is the husband of the Minister Vainetutai Rose 

Toki-Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>The good thing is that we get mixed together with other Pacific Islands but when the drums of the 

Cook Islands is played, I can assure you all that the visitors forget the other groups like Fiji, Samoa 

and others and they congregate to the Cook Islands stage.  The tourists also like to watch the male 

dancers and the female dancers.  I am not skiting about the Cook Islands but I believe that our 

culture when we go to the festival of arts, when our drums are played, people always appear. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  an  example  Mr  Speaker  when  we  went  to  Guam,  the  Leader  for  the  Government  was 

</span><span>Papatua and I was the Leader of the dance team.  We went to represent the Cook Islands at the 

</span><span>Festival  of Arts.   On the program,  the first  group to  perform is Cook Islands.  Everywhere we 

dance, it is always the Cook Islands who starts first.  But when reached the third venue to perform, 

</span><span>the organizers realized when the Cook Islands’ performance finishes and then relocates to another 

</span><span>stage, the crowd will follow the Cook Islands team.  We were happy to perform first. 

</span></div><div><span>We performed 18 times and when we arrived at the fourth venue, I looked at the program, it was 

changed and the Cook Islands were placed last to perform.  I understood why the Cook Islands 

</span><span>were put last.  They knew when the Cook Islands finish performing and when we leave, the people 

</span><span>also leave.  I believe Mr Speaker that our culture is strong in dancing and drumming. 

</span></div><div><span>313

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I want Mr Speaker to touch on our language.  Maybe I will speak on this topic when it comes to 

the Vote Item for Education.  What I want and also, the other islands and I congratulate the island 

of Pukapuka because they have completed a book on their language.  This is what I want for the 

islands of Nga-Pu-Toru, for a book to be written in their dialect and also for the island of Mangaia.  

What  I  like  about  the  Mangaia  dialect  is  the  way  it  sounds  and  their  pronunciation.    Their 

pronunciations sounds like songs when people sings.  This is what I want the Ministry of Cultural 

Development to do, to write a book about the languages of these islands.  That was the reason why 

I congratulated the people of Pukapuka because they have completed their book.  I believe that the 

responsibility lies with the Ministry of Cultural Development, to encourage this. 

</span></div><div><span>I have asked the Leader of our Nation and the Minister George Angene and also the Associate 

Minister  Sonny  Williams  regarding  this  which  they  are  going  to  an  important  meeting.    The 

meeting they are attending, one of the topics that will be discussed is regarding the Festival of 

Arts.  I believe that next year, the Festival of Arts will be held in Hawaii. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Member,  I  will  interrupt  you.    When  I  look  at  the  three  of  you 

Members, I wondered what type of drumming that you are good at.  I see the Honourable Albert 

Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  These two speakers before me mentioned that 

an allocation is required to train our children on drumming.  My recommendation is there is no 

need for any allocation because these two are being paid by the nation, therefore, you two can train 

our children.  Thank you for your contribution.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we all know that in this House that one of the main part of our culture is the dancing 

competition among the schools.  We all know that this is one of the biggest events in our country 

which is in support of the cultural performances by our children in the schools.  Another part that 

we  are  supporting  is  the  drumming  competition  within  the  schools.    Another  big  event  is  the 

cultural celebrations competitions on Rarotonga during the Constitution period.  I think we would 

</span><span>all agree with this Vote Item that this is one of the biggest activities in our country.  It is much 

</span><span>stronger than sports, stronger than rugby league, so Mr Speaker, this is a sign that indicates to me 

that the Ministry of Cultural Development is doing a lot of work.  

</span></div><div><span>So, on behalf of our Minister, I give our support to the Appropriation for this Ministry for this 

Financial Year.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you have 

</span><span>the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I want to share a short thought on this 

Vote Item.  I support the views of the Honourable Minister Albert Nicholas on the standings of 

our  school  children.    I  would  like  to  reiterate  that  this  is  one  of  the  highlights  and  also  an 

outstanding outcome in the responsibilities of the Cultural Development.  However, I want to share 

that this year, the Minister invited me to an event held by our school children at the Auditorium.  

This event by our school children was so enjoyable because in some of the schools, you would 

think the children are adults and the children really enjoyed what they were doing.   

</span></div><div><span>It is different when adults performs because they are in a competition mode, there is no fun and it 

is not about enjoying it but all about winning.  I think I have mentioned to the Minister of Education 

that this is the type of competition that we should encourage and enhanced and include those from 

the Pa Enua.  

Imagine when the school  children from  the Pa Enua especially our children from  the Northern 

Group so that we can enjoy the traditions from the Northern Group.  

</span></div><div><span>However, during the recess that evening, I was talking to the Minister of Cultural Development 

and the Member Sonny Williams, the Minister was complaining because there were only two of 

them occupying the seats on their side and I was the only person occupying a seat on our side.  So, 

I am surprised at Minister Albert Nicholas saying that the performances were entertaining because 

that evening, he was not there.  This is a request to the Minister of Education and the Minister of 

Cultural Development, to consider an allocation in the next budget to bring our school children 

from the Pa Enua to Rarotonga for the performances. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to our language, yes, I know the program was led by the Cultural Development two 

years ago was very productive.  We know that each island was allocated a segment and for us, 

from Rakahanga, was successful.  It was interesting because you can recognize the expertise our 

youth have in teaching our language.  For those of us that speaks English most of the time, this is 

a good class to attend and to learn something. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  Page  72  of  Book  2  of  the  Budget  Estimates.    I  am  looking  at  the  significant 

</span><span>achievements by the Ministry of Cultural Development.  Looking at 1, 2 and 3, seems fine and 

when  I  look  at  4,  I  am  not  sure  why  the  Dome  at  the  Tupapa  Sports  field  is  under  Cultural 

Development.  I am very lucky the Minister of Cultural Development is not here today, yes, I am 

jealous because they have a dome and we do not.  But putting aside all that, I must recognise that 

the Ministry of Cultural Development is working hard. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to our drummers, I could hear some Members bragging about being good at drumming.  

</span><span>If you want to learn how to beat the drums, then come to my island of Rakahanga.  We started 

</span><span>drumming once we reach the age of four or five years.  Usually, in our tradition, when visitors 

arrive on the island of Rakahanga, everyone will come together and eat.  There will be drumbeats 

</span></div><div><span>315 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>and when you look at who are beating the drums, you can guess their ages.  They have never done 

any workshops or trainings and there is no appropriation for that.  Their appropriation is a pot of 

rice  at  home.    But  when  they  beat  those  drums,  they  are  very  good.    So,  do  not  brag  about 

yourselves. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally,  there  is  one  thing  I  noticed  and  this  is  also  on  drumming.    At  any  event,  it  will  be 

announced that this is a team from Ngatangiia or a team from Takitumu and when they start to 

beat the drums, you could hear a tin mixed in the drumbeats and that type of drumming only comes 

from the Northern Group.  So, those who are boasting about their drumming talents, please if you 

do your training, do not do an appropriation and do not teach your children the use of a tin in your 

drumming because that is not your drumming culture.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you to the Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Minister Mac 

Mokoroa. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I will not speak long on the Vote Item for the 

Ministry of Cultural Development. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand to ask the Honourable Members that are boasting about their drumming abilities because 

the invitation has come to me to open the drumming competition (Tangi Kaara) next Friday.  You 

should come not only with your drumming sticks but also with an envelope to donate towards the 

competition.  This will start at 8.00 a.m.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to express my sincere joy because I know 

in the months ahead especially in November; we will be hosting the Pacific Island Leaders.  Our 

team is ready for the host. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  the  expert  traditional  chant  Member,  the  drumming  expert  Members  and  the  Lady 

Members for our dancing group. 

</span></div><div><span>They are in the Rauti-Para dancing group, it will be great.  The uniform is already in place for the 

Members  and  everything.    The  way  I  see  it,  we  will  save  many  funds  for  the  hosting  of  this 

conference of the Leaders of the Pacific. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give my strong support to the Appropriation for the Ministry of Cultural Development.
