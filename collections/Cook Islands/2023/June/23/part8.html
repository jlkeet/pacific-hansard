<div><span>CROWN LAW: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,414,001 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker for the opportunity to talk on the Vote Item for Crown 

</span><span>Law.  When we look at the Appropriation for Crown Law, we will note of an increase especially 

on the wages for Personnel and Administrative Payments is $50,000 to carry out their work.  Mr 

Speaker,  I  give my support to  this Vote  Item,  however,  I have a bit of  a  problem; perhaps the 

Minister can clarify this.  

</span></div><div><span>I have no issues on their work outputs; my problem is the staff turnover where staff are leaving.  I 

believe in a short period, three of our young lawyers left.  I am unsure why they left, I believe they 

</span><span>nurtured and had gain experience in their time at Crown Law.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I believe there is a decline of labour with Crown Law and maybe they had their reasons for leaving.  

When  you are loaded with  the work at  Crown  Law, and what  they do is for the benefit of our 

country.  We need more of our youth with law degrees to step in and help Crown Law.   

Mr Speaker, I am a proud parent because my daughter graduated with a Bachelor of Law degree 

last year on 22 April/February 2022.  When the Honourable Tingika Elikana and I went to New 

Zealand on a Public Accounts Committee visit back in 2018, he encouraged my daughter not to 

give up. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I have to interrupt you.  It is time for a break.  You may 

continue after when you come back.  I would like to invite those in the Public Gallery to join us 

for lunch.  I will suspend the Sitting until 12.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.26 a.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting is resumed at 12.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please be seated.  I call Parliament to Order.  Before we went for our lunch 

break,  the  Honourable  Member  Vaitoti  Tupa  was  speaking.    I  now  call  upon  you  Honourable 

Member to continue with your speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I will not take too long but just want to express my 

appreciation  to  the  Honourable  Tingika  Elikana,  Member  for  Pukapuka-Nassau  for  his 

encouragement for my daughter Maneuneu to become a lawyer as she completes her studies with 

her Masters in Law. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister of Crown Law, especially regarding many of our 

young people working in various Government Ministries and departments who have law degrees, 

I know of one young woman working at Environment who has a law degree; she is part Solomon 

Islands and part Cook Islands.  These young lawyers working for various Government Agencies 

</span><span>may  form  a  consortium  and  may  submit  their  support  for  the  formation  of  our  legislation  to 

</span><span>Parliament.  This way, it will ensure that our legislations are reflective of the need and order of our 

country. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  know  of  six  young  lawyers  working  in  the  different  Government  departments, 

maybe the Minister of Crown Law can second them to assist our Crown Law office.   

</span></div><div><span>An area in Government that requires reviving is the drafting of our legislations.  The people that 

</span><span>we use for drafting our laws are now old and even New Zealand helps with the drafting of our 

</span><span>laws.  Our young lawyers can secure our future for this specific task.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I know my time is up and I want to say, I support this Vote Item and thank you very 

much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to share my thoughts on this 

Vote Item.  Firstly, when we consider the Crown Law Office and its functions, this can be found 

on Page 66 of the Budget Estimate book.  Going forward, I want to ask the Minister or the Attorney 

General, because we in the office of the Opposition has an issue with the law.  We thought the 

functions of Crown Law also extends to providing legal service to the office of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>However, when the Solicitor General at the time explained this matter with us that the Office of 

the Opposition will not fit in the definition of the Statutory Body or Corporation.  I would like to 

ask the Attorney General or the Minister of the Crown Law office to look into this area because it 

makes  sense  to  me  that  the  Crown  Law  office  also  provides  legal  advice  to  the  Office  of  the 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>In addition, it is because that office has an allocation in the Budget.  I agree however that where 

</span><span>there  is  a  conflict  between  Government  and  the  Opposition’s  O</span><span>ffice,  then  the  advice  to 

Government must take priority.  That is my first point. 

</span></div><div><span>My second point is, if you look under the significant achievements and milestones, you will see a 

paragraph 4 and 5.  It seems to suggest that the staff departures have slowed down.  That seems to 

be inconsistent with what is happening right now.  We know recently, when I say recently, earlier 

this year, there were about three of our local lawyers that departed from Crown Law. 

</span></div><div><span>We do not know the reasons why and I do not think it is relevant for us to inquire into the fact is 

that they left.  My understanding is  one of them; we have lost to New Caledonia.  She is  now 

</span><span>working for SPC and that is a loss.  I would say is a loss because she is a very good worker in the 

</span><span>Crown Law’s</span><span> office.  She is the daughter of the late Navy and Florence.  The other girl is now 

with Matysik &amp; Marshall and then the last one; I think she is just at home considering what is she 

going to do next. 

</span></div><div><span>The shortage is really important especially to Government and especially to us during this year 

because of what we have now.  The Business Committee has determined that we will be sitting 40 

days of this year.  And, an important role of Crown Law is to provide us or draft Bills for this 

</span><span>Parliament to consider.  In addition to that, I am aware that the court fixtures in the criminal court 

</span><span>and the civil court are quite heavy this year. 

</span></div><div><span>305 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>And where the Crown Law office is involved with the prosecution in the criminal court and that 

takes away the Solicitor General and one another from the Office.  Inevitably, part of their work 

is  going  to  be  affected  and  this  House  the  other  day  would  have  noticed  that  we  have  now  a 

Members Private Bill.  One of the triggers of that Private Bill is the workload of the Crown Law 

office and the inability to bring Bills into Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>And the reason is no other but the fact that they are under resourced.  My friend earlier spoke about 

</span><span>those who are working in  the Crown Law’s office and perhaps engaging  with  drafts people.   I 

</span><span>would like to make a suggestion, which I hope is going to be helpful.  We do have some drafts 

people who are retired and we have some lawyers who do drafting and have actually in the past 

been part of the drafting team for example, Infrastructure.   

</span></div><div><span>The  three  people  I  am  talking  about  is  no  other  than  Tony  Manarangi,  who  is  an  ex-Solicitor 

General,  Tim  Arnold  who  was  involved  in  the  infrastructure  when  that  Act  was  brought  into 

Parliament and Brian Mason who was involved with To Tatou Vai. 

</span></div><div><span>I note from the chart, their structure is that they will retain the New Zealand Parliamentary Office 

to assist.  That is not a bad thing at all but what I am suggesting is that if there continues to be a 

lack of resources as far as drafting of Bills is concerned, maybe there should be some delegation 

to our locals who can assist with it. 

</span></div><div><span>I have to congratulate the current Solicitor General who is relatively new on the island and I must 

say that he has had to land while running.  I recall that he was involved in the Electoral Petitions 

shortly after he arrived and with the departure of Members of his staff, it is not a good position to 

be in. 

</span></div><div><span>When  I  look  at  their  Budget  and  if  I  can  refer  to  Page  17  of  the  PAC  Report,  there  is  a  brief 

summary there.  Their increases include $110 thousand for Program Personal Funding.  There is 

an additional personnel increase of $60 thousand and there is a $50 thousand for Administered 

</span><span>Payments for Legal Provisions.   

</span></div><div><span>I am not sure whether the positions have been advertised overseas and whether the $60 thousand 

is to cater for an applicant that may not be a local.   

</span></div><div><span>This Office in my view is an extremely significant and important office for the country and the 

responsibilities of the Solicitor General is immense.  In addition to being a Solicitor General, not 

only does he provide advice to Government and that advice must be given normally promptly and 

</span><span>because he is a Solicitor General,  as his position as a Solicitor General,  he is a member of the 

</span><span>Central Agency Committee, he is a Member of the High Court Rules Committee, he is a member

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>of the Anti-Corruption Committee, a Member of the National Security Committee and a Member 

of the Governance Group. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition, I have to interrupt you as your time is up.  

I see the Minister for Crown Law, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  As pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition that 

</span><span>Crown  Law  Agency  is  one  of  the  Government’s  central  agencies  and  it  plays  a  key  role  in 

</span><span>representing the Government on legal matters.  This Office also acts as the Prosecutor on Crown 

Court cases and this Office is responsible for the drafting of legislation and regulations. 

</span></div><div><span>Yes, the Office this year has been through some staffing changes with the number of very good 

young legal officers moving on and the three young lawyers, very good lawyers I have to say, that 

have left the Crown Law Office, left for a variety of different reasons and for some of them, we 

know that some of the reasons relate to remuneration.  I certainly do not blame them for taking up 

an offer from somebody else, not just for better remuneration but also if provides new opportunities 

as well. 

</span></div><div><span>It is particularly attractive if it is a posting to one of the Regional Offices to be employed there 

such as the SPC or the Forum or the UN Agencies or any International Agency.  An opportunity 

to work in these agencies, I would actually encourage our people to take them up. 

</span></div><div><span>The reality is, Mr Speaker that in this particular field, the salaries have to be looked at from an 

International or Regional standard.  We have to be competitive internationally with what we pay 

good lawyers which is  one of the reasons  why we have increased the Personnel  adjustment by 

$170  thousand  and  we  can  see  in  Schedule  1  of  the  Appropriation  that  for  Crown  Law,  the 

Personnel appropriation is just over a million dollars and that might not be enough if we want to 

either attract  local  lawyers or if we  want  to  retain our local  lawyers.  We may need to  look  at 

increasing that appropriation for Personnel to make the position in the Crown Law Office attractive 

</span><span>to them. 

</span></div><div><span>I do know one of the benefits of working in the Crown Law Office is the variety and the level of 

legal work that you are sometimes exposed to that  you would otherwise not receive either in a 

private law firm or in one of the other Government Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I would encourage any young lawyers, graduates that are looking for employment in the legal 

profession to spend some time in the Crown Law Office to give you exposure to a wide range of 

</span><span>different legal experiences. 

</span></div><div><span>You could be involved in:

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 23 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>1.</span><span>The  drafting  of  legislation  for  new  and  emerging  industries  like  the  Seabed  Minerals 

</span></div><div><span>industry; 

</span></div><div><span>2.</span><span>Drafting access agreements into fisheries across a whole wide jurisdiction of countries; 

3.</span><span>Criminal and civil cases which would take you not just to the High Court but also possibly 

to the Court of Appeal and recently in our jurisdiction to the Privy Council in London. 

</span></div><div><span>These are some of the experiences Mr Speaker working in a Crown Law Office.  The jurisdiction 

is so wide in our representation on the international arena is so broad that you would not get this 

sort of exposure if you were working in a Crown Law Office in New Zealand or in Australia. 

</span></div><div><span>While we have lost some of our good lawyers just recently, in our office there are also some new 

good young lawyers and graduates that are currently employed and I have to say that I am also 

very happy with our Solicitor General in his approach to try and fill our office, our Crown Law 

Office  with  good qualified Cook  Islanders.   But  if that is  not  the case, then we must fill  those 

vacancies and if it is with lawyers from overseas and so be it. 

</span></div><div><span>I am hopeful that these increases in the Appropriation for the Crown Law Office particularly in 

the personnel will enable the Solicitor General to be able to recruit much needed personnel into 

the Office.  No doubt, as pointed out by previous speakers, we have a busy year ahead of us, we 

have  a busy term ahead  of us as a Government,  and a lot of that work will  involve legislative 

drafting, regulation drafting and so forth.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,414,001 for Crown Law Office stands part the Schedule?
