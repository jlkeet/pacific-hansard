<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Yes, but I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition that if the question 

is easy then the answer should easy.  But to bring my answer to a very short conclusion then Mr 

Speaker, how is this change in the tax going to benefit the people on Rakahanga?  Yes, the benefit 

is only to a few today when we just look in front of our nose but the benefit will be great to many 

when we look to the horizon.  Thank you.
