<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Speaker.  My question is  directed to  the  Leader of the nation.  

Maybe the Minister for Culture can reply but I will direct the question to the Leader of the nation.  

The question is because our Minister and his Associate will be attending a conference and I believe 

they depart this weekend, can you please explain to us about this conference because I believe in 

the conference, the Cook Islands has been nominated to chair?  Can you please explain the nature 

of the conference because I believe this is an important meeting that we are chairing plus we have 

a festival coming up?

<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor.
