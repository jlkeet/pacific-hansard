<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>Yes, I want to clarify my question first.  The Prime Minister stated that the 

Opposition was not in support of this tax system for the Outer Islands.  I want this House to know 

that I am not on the Opposition; I am in the middle.  I was one of the first Member to support this 

tax reform because I represent the Outer Islands. 

 My  question  to  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  can  he  explain  again  to  this  House  whether  a 

discussion with New Zealand regarding New Zealand Pensioners here in the Cook Islands took 

place?  I wonder whether our people will face any issues in the future regarding this. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I remember back in 2013, it is an income for those who collecting the pension. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see that you have the same shirt as your two 

colleagues from Aitutaki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
