<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all the Honourable Members of this 

House.  Before I ask my question, I have a humble request to make Mr Speaker, a moment for me 

to convey my condolences to a family from my village for a sudden death of a family member, 

which have occurred here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To the family of Mama Metu Aurupa for the passing away of your daughter Mama Moeroa Pinaki, 

my deepest condolences to you all.  This is my next-door neighbour in the village of Tamarua.  

Therefore, to the </span><span>Papa Orometua</span><span>, the husband and all the families, may the Lord blesses you all 

during this time.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday,  there  were  two  very  popular  Members  on  that  side  of  the  House,  the  Minister  for 

Finance and the Minister for ICI.  Today, sitting between them is a beautiful rose, which balances 

the atmosphere in their setting. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is going out to the Minister of Health and Agriculture.  At this time, the island of 

Mangaia is preparing to plant their crops to be ready for the Bicentennial next year.  This is my 

direct  question  as  encouraged  by  the  Speaker  yesterday  to  the  Honourable  Minister.    The 

excavator, which you have promised for Mangaia, when will that arrive on the island of Mangaia?  

I want the people of my island to hear the answer directly from you.
