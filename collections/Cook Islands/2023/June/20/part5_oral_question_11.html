<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>We know at the time when Queen Elizabeth II passed away, Government announced that a holiday 

be given to everyone.  It was later discovered that the Government had no rights to declare a public 

holiday for that day which caused a major problem.  I can see with this request that we will face 

another problem  if the  Government  attempts  to  make this a public holiday  because  we will be 

breaking the laws of this country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>A solution to this is, because before the Bicentennial for Rarotonga, there is also Nga-Pu-Toru.  

We cannot declare a public hol</span><span>iday for the 200 Year’s celebration for each of the Outer Islands.  

Not under the Public Holiday’s Act.</span></div>
<div><span>This is our proposal, on our Outer Islands especially the Nga-Pu-Toru islands which are holding 

their celebrations almost one day after the other and because on these islands, nearly everybody 

will be involved in the celebration.  It is much easier for the public service on each of these islands 

to be involved in the work of the island as a workday, whether they are part of the ceremony or 

whether they are part of the participants of the celebration.  There is justification for this because 

the Government is part of the celebrations on each of the islands.  There is not much private sector 

on these islands but even if there is private sector, we know that the private sector will allow and 

will be part of the celebrations as well with their staff. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Especially on Atiu because their day of celebration is during the week and on Mitiaro and Mauke 

there day of celebration is during the weekend.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, for Rarotonga it is really difficult to declare a Public Holiday because it would mean 

affecting our private sector hotels and businesses where the private sector would be required to 

pay double time to their staff.  Therefore, the suggestion here is if you are involved in this 200 

Year celebration and you feel strongly about it you should have your Annual Leave sorted out to 

allow you to participate if you are a public servant.  If you are in the private sector that is a matter 

between you and your employer whether you will have Time Off even if it is a Public Holiday 

whether you have Time Off or whether you will attend.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So, the short answer my friend, the Member of Parliament for Murienua is, no there will be no 

declaration of a Public Holiday but we encourage our people to utilise their Annual Leave to be 

able to participate in the Rarotonga celebration.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR. T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, can I be given a short time to explain what I meant?  200 years 

only comes once and we have not seen the 100 years.  The spirit of the request here is not from the

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>people of Puaikura who welcomed Christianity.  Mr Prime Minister, the spirit and essence here is 

we all know that this House is responsible for amending the laws of this country to suit the purposes 

as times goes by.  This is the spirit and essence of the request for one day as a commemoration of 

the arrival of Christianity on our shores.  

</span></div>
<div><span>This request is not only from the people of Puaikura but inclusive of the Members of Parliament 

and under the umbrella of the Religious Advisory Council.  We also have the recognised national 

observance of the arrival of Christianity every year on 26</span><span>th</span><span> October, the Constitution Day on 4</span><span>th</span><span>

August and the Ariki Day on every first Friday of July.  I humbly request on behalf of the Religious 

Advisory Council and the Christian people of this country to you Prime Minister and Government 

to reconsider your reply and if not, to let your yes be a yes and no be a no.  Thank you.
