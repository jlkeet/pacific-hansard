<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I sympathise this request made by the Member.  As 

he has mentioned, we have already set down the day to commemorate the arrival of Christianity 

on our shores and that is the Gospel Day on 26 October.  In the past, we know that each island 

celebrates their own arrival of the gospel on their islands.  However, you the Member of Murienua 

</span><span>during your time as a Minister cancelled the individual islandsâ€™ Gospel Day and have it replaced 

</span><span>as the Ariki Day.  I applaud you for introducing that Bill into the House during that year and think 

it was in 2015 because so then our three Pillars, the Government, the Land and Religion are now 

commemorated.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So, this is my reply to the second portion of your request.  If you believe in God and if you believe 

in your faith, you will make the time to attend those celebrations.  Do not wait for Government to 

create a law or a day for you to go and celebrate.  You go and do it yourself.  Put your feet where 

your faith is.  Thank you.
