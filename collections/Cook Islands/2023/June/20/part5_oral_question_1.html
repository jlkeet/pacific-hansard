<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  to  each  Member  in  this  House, 

greetings to you.  I will comply with your flexible direction Mr Speaker and will ask my question 

of the Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Last Wednesday in Auckland, New Zealand officially announced that they were in recession.  This 

means of course that the GDP has been shrinking in the last two successive quarters. My question 

is, Mr Prime Minister our Budget was put together some months ago, was a recession a possible 

</span><span>recession in New Zealand forecasted and the reason why I am asking this is because we religiously 

</span><span>followed the New Zealand model during COVID and if spending in New Zealand is now shrunk 

this would obviously affect our tourism.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>New Zealand has another hope for recovery because New Zealand earns quite a bit from students 

</span><span>studying in New Zealand which we donâ€™t.  So, Mr Prime Minister can you please explain to us 

</span><span>whether we are looking down the barrel similar to New Zealand or not.
