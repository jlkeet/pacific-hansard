<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Members,  we  have  come  to  Question  Time.    Before  our  Question  Time  expired 

yesterday,  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Tina  Browne  was  on  the  Floor  putting  a 

question to the Prime Minister.  You have the Floor Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  to  each  Member  in  this  House, 

greetings to you.  I will comply with your flexible direction Mr Speaker and will ask my question 

of the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Last Wednesday in Auckland, New Zealand officially announced that they were in recession.  This 

means of course that the GDP has been shrinking in the last two successive quarters. My question 

is, Mr Prime Minister our Budget was put together some months ago, was a recession a possible 

</span><span>recession in New Zealand forecasted and the reason why I am asking this is because we religiously 

</span><span>followed the New Zealand model during COVID and if spending in New Zealand is now shrunk 

this would obviously affect our tourism.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>New Zealand has another hope for recovery because New Zealand earns quite a bit from students 

</span><span>studying in New Zealand which we don’t.  So, Mr Prime Minister can you please explain to us 

</span><span>whether we are looking down the barrel similar to New Zealand or not. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member, I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition in 

regards to the recession that was announced in New Zealand.  

</span></div><div><span>Economists in New Zealand actually refer to this as a technical recession and as the Leader of the 

Opposition correctly pointed out, a recession is declared when you have two consecutive quarters 

of  negative  GDP  growth.    Therefore,  the  December  quarter  in  New  Zealand  was  0.7  percent 

negative  and  the  March  quarter  was  0.1  percent  negative;  just  crossing  the  threshold  for  the 

definition of a recession.  It would have been difficult to see how New Zealand could have been 

in a recession other than the fact that in January, there was significant flooding in Auckland and 

in February of course, cyclone Gabrielle, which was the biggest natural disaster that New Zealand 

has incurred. 

</span></div><div><span>So despite these two major events at  the beginning  of the  year, Mr Speaker, the New  Zealand 

</span><span>economy contracted by only 0.1 percent.  In addition, New Zealand’s unemployment figure is 3.4 

</span><span>percent,  a  historical  low  for  New  Zealand,  which  means  that  the  majority  of  the  working  age 

population is significantly employed. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, the question is what impact does this have on our own economy here.  We have seen 

impacts in the last year or so as mentioned by some of our Members on the impacts of inflation 

but the March quarter of New Zealand shows inflation reducing, lower than expected and we have 

seen fuel prices also reducing and some of that we are seeing the early signs of that occurring also 

in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>In the preparation of our Budget Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Finance also does modelling on what 

the expected impacts are if we had a lower than the expected number of tourist arrivals coming 

into the country.  The number of scenarios that we would prepare for in the event that tourism 

numbers were plus or minus five or 10 percent of what we expect. 

</span></div><div><span>In addition, our Tourism Ministry also does its work in part to make sure that we can mitigate 

against any potential impacts of reductions of tourist.  Of course, to combat impacts of recession 

in our tourist markets in New Zealand, one of the key answers has been to diversify our tourism 

market, which we have seen recently with the arrival of flights coming out of Hawaii.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Today, I just signed the air </span><span>license’s agreement for Air Tahiti to commence its service at the end 

</span><span>of this month.  Of course, the Jetstar service which kicks off next week on Thursday, coming into 

the country. 

</span></div><div><span>Also,  we  can  expect  it,  if  there  are  recession  pressures  on  New  Zealand,  tourist  that  they  may 

consider rather than going further afield for their holidays like Hawaii, or to Bali, or to Asia.  That 

they may choose to holiday more in the Pacific and Rarotonga of course, is one of the favourite 

destinations.  

</span></div><div><span>I am confident Mr Speaker that despite the declaration of a recession in New Zealand that this will 

not have a great impact on the ability of New Zealanders and Kiwis and their discretionary fund, 

and discretionary spending to be able to take a holiday.  That coupled with the new flights coming 

in, where we expect to see 18 percent increase in the number of Australians coming in via JetStar 

and the additional northern hemisphere market coming from Tahiti via the two Air Tahiti flights 

and the one Air Rarotonga flight a week. 

</span></div><div><span>I think our tourism forward numbers gives us confidence that we can overcome any impact that 

this declaration of a recession has in New Zealand.  I think despite New Zealand figures and if we 

look at our own figures on our GDP, we started from a position of very low level as a result of the 

contraction of our economy when we closed our borders. 

</span></div><div><span>Since the opening of our borders, our GDP levels have grown significantly in double-digit figures 

to where we are today.  So, two different and very different scenarios and I hope that answers the 

question raised by the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo 

from Mangaia; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all the Honourable Members of this 

House.  Before I ask my question, I have a humble request to make Mr Speaker, a moment for me 

to convey my condolences to a family from my village for a sudden death of a family member, 

which have occurred here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>To the family of Mama Metu Aurupa for the passing away of your daughter Mama Moeroa Pinaki, 

my deepest condolences to you all.  This is my next-door neighbour in the village of Tamarua.  

Therefore, to the </span><span>Papa Orometua</span><span>, the husband and all the families, may the Lord blesses you all 

during this time.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday,  there  were  two  very  popular  Members  on  that  side  of  the  House,  the  Minister  for 

Finance and the Minister for ICI.  Today, sitting between them is a beautiful rose, which balances 

the atmosphere in their setting. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is going out to the Minister of Health and Agriculture.  At this time, the island of 

Mangaia is preparing to plant their crops to be ready for the Bicentennial next year.  This is my 

direct  question  as  encouraged  by  the  Speaker  yesterday  to  the  Honourable  Minister.    The 

excavator, which you have promised for Mangaia, when will that arrive on the island of Mangaia?  

I want the people of my island to hear the answer directly from you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members in this House.  Kia Orana 

to you Mr Speaker, your staff, and the Leaders of our Parties. 

</span></div><div><span>Let  me  answer  your  question  Honourable  Member  by  explaining  our  present  situation.    Our 

problem at this time is that our barge is not here in the Cook Islands, it is currently sitting overseas 

for service.  Therefore, we do not have a barge to ship the excavator to Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>The Minister of ICI wants to use this excavator here on Rarotonga but I am holding on to it for 

Mangaia as promised to help our growers there.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I think the barge will be back in the Cook 

Islands at the end of the month.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather, Leader of the United Party; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I think I had enough telling stories yesterday; today 

I am going to sing.  Because of your instructions, I will ask my question to the Honourable Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>My question Mr Prime Minister, I believe a letter has been sent to you and your Cabinet regarding 

the 25</span><span>th</span><span>July, if this date can be declared as Public Holiday for commemorating the 200 Year’s 

</span><span>Celebration.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  The Honourable Prime Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  of 

Murienua for your question. 

</span></div><div><span>225 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We know at the time when Queen Elizabeth II passed away, Government announced that a holiday 

be given to everyone.  It was later discovered that the Government had no rights to declare a public 

holiday for that day which caused a major problem.  I can see with this request that we will face 

another problem  if the  Government  attempts  to  make this a public holiday  because  we will be 

breaking the laws of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>A solution to this is, because before the Bicentennial for Rarotonga, there is also Nga-Pu-Toru.  

We cannot declare a public hol</span><span>iday for the 200 Year’s celebration for each of the Outer Islands.  

Not under the Public Holiday’s Act.</span></div><div><span>This is our proposal, on our Outer Islands especially the Nga-Pu-Toru islands which are holding 

their celebrations almost one day after the other and because on these islands, nearly everybody 

will be involved in the celebration.  It is much easier for the public service on each of these islands 

to be involved in the work of the island as a workday, whether they are part of the ceremony or 

whether they are part of the participants of the celebration.  There is justification for this because 

the Government is part of the celebrations on each of the islands.  There is not much private sector 

on these islands but even if there is private sector, we know that the private sector will allow and 

will be part of the celebrations as well with their staff. 

</span></div><div><span>Especially on Atiu because their day of celebration is during the week and on Mitiaro and Mauke 

there day of celebration is during the weekend.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, for Rarotonga it is really difficult to declare a Public Holiday because it would mean 

affecting our private sector hotels and businesses where the private sector would be required to 

pay double time to their staff.  Therefore, the suggestion here is if you are involved in this 200 

Year celebration and you feel strongly about it you should have your Annual Leave sorted out to 

allow you to participate if you are a public servant.  If you are in the private sector that is a matter 

between you and your employer whether you will have Time Off even if it is a Public Holiday 

whether you have Time Off or whether you will attend.  

</span></div><div><span>So, the short answer my friend, the Member of Parliament for Murienua is, no there will be no 

declaration of a Public Holiday but we encourage our people to utilise their Annual Leave to be 

able to participate in the Rarotonga celebration.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, can I be given a short time to explain what I meant?  200 years 

only comes once and we have not seen the 100 years.  The spirit of the request here is not from the 

</span></div><div><span>226 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>people of Puaikura who welcomed Christianity.  Mr Prime Minister, the spirit and essence here is 

we all know that this House is responsible for amending the laws of this country to suit the purposes 

as times goes by.  This is the spirit and essence of the request for one day as a commemoration of 

the arrival of Christianity on our shores.  

</span></div><div><span>This request is not only from the people of Puaikura but inclusive of the Members of Parliament 

and under the umbrella of the Religious Advisory Council.  We also have the recognised national 

observance of the arrival of Christianity every year on 26</span><span>th</span><span> October, the Constitution Day on 4</span><span>th</span><span>

August and the Ariki Day on every first Friday of July.  I humbly request on behalf of the Religious 

Advisory Council and the Christian people of this country to you Prime Minister and Government 

to reconsider your reply and if not, to let your yes be a yes and no be a no.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I sympathise this request made by the Member.  As 

he has mentioned, we have already set down the day to commemorate the arrival of Christianity 

on our shores and that is the Gospel Day on 26 October.  In the past, we know that each island 

celebrates their own arrival of the gospel on their islands.  However, you the Member of Murienua 

</span><span>during your time as a Minister cancelled the individual islands’ Gospel Day and have it replaced 

</span><span>as the Ariki Day.  I applaud you for introducing that Bill into the House during that year and think 

it was in 2015 because so then our three Pillars, the Government, the Land and Religion are now 

commemorated.  

</span></div><div><span>So, this is my reply to the second portion of your request.  If you believe in God and if you believe 

in your faith, you will make the time to attend those celebrations.  Do not wait for Government to 

create a law or a day for you to go and celebrate.  You go and do it yourself.  Put your feet where 

your faith is.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Question Time has come to an end.
