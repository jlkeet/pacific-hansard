<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition in 

regards to the recession that was announced in New Zealand.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Economists in New Zealand actually refer to this as a technical recession and as the Leader of the 

Opposition correctly pointed out, a recession is declared when you have two consecutive quarters 

of  negative  GDP  growth.    Therefore,  the  December  quarter  in  New  Zealand  was  0.7  percent 

negative  and  the  March  quarter  was  0.1  percent  negative;  just  crossing  the  threshold  for  the 

definition of a recession.  It would have been difficult to see how New Zealand could have been 

in a recession other than the fact that in January, there was significant flooding in Auckland and 

in February of course, cyclone Gabrielle, which was the biggest natural disaster that New Zealand 

has incurred. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So despite these two major events at  the beginning  of the  year, Mr Speaker, the New  Zealand 

</span><span>economy contracted by only 0.1 percent.  In addition, New Zealand’s unemployment figure is 3.4 

</span><span>percent,  a  historical  low  for  New  Zealand,  which  means  that  the  majority  of  the  working  age 

population is significantly employed. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, the question is what impact does this have on our own economy here.  We have seen 

impacts in the last year or so as mentioned by some of our Members on the impacts of inflation 

but the March quarter of New Zealand shows inflation reducing, lower than expected and we have 

seen fuel prices also reducing and some of that we are seeing the early signs of that occurring also 

in our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In the preparation of our Budget Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Finance also does modelling on what 

the expected impacts are if we had a lower than the expected number of tourist arrivals coming 

into the country.  The number of scenarios that we would prepare for in the event that tourism 

numbers were plus or minus five or 10 percent of what we expect. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In addition, our Tourism Ministry also does its work in part to make sure that we can mitigate 

against any potential impacts of reductions of tourist.  Of course, to combat impacts of recession 

in our tourist markets in New Zealand, one of the key answers has been to diversify our tourism 

market, which we have seen recently with the arrival of flights coming out of Hawaii.

</span></div>
<div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Today, I just signed the air </span><span>license’s agreement for Air Tahiti to commence its service at the end 

</span><span>of this month.  Of course, the Jetstar service which kicks off next week on Thursday, coming into 

the country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Also,  we  can  expect  it,  if  there  are  recession  pressures  on  New  Zealand,  tourist  that  they  may 

consider rather than going further afield for their holidays like Hawaii, or to Bali, or to Asia.  That 

they may choose to holiday more in the Pacific and Rarotonga of course, is one of the favourite 

destinations.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I am confident Mr Speaker that despite the declaration of a recession in New Zealand that this will 

not have a great impact on the ability of New Zealanders and Kiwis and their discretionary fund, 

and discretionary spending to be able to take a holiday.  That coupled with the new flights coming 

in, where we expect to see 18 percent increase in the number of Australians coming in via JetStar 

and the additional northern hemisphere market coming from Tahiti via the two Air Tahiti flights 

and the one Air Rarotonga flight a week. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I think our tourism forward numbers gives us confidence that we can overcome any impact that 

this declaration of a recession has in New Zealand.  I think despite New Zealand figures and if we 

look at our own figures on our GDP, we started from a position of very low level as a result of the 

contraction of our economy when we closed our borders. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Since the opening of our borders, our GDP levels have grown significantly in double-digit figures 

to where we are today.  So, two different and very different scenarios and I hope that answers the 

question raised by the Leader of the Opposition.
