completed his speech before the adjournment.  

</span></div><div><span>Before I open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak, we have two hours remaining to debate

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I will now open the Floor to other Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of 

the Appropriation Bill 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR.  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker,  Clerk,  Deputy  Clerk  and  staff  of  the  House.  

Honourable  Ministers  and  Members  of  the  Crown,  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Party  and  your 

Members, Honourable Member Toa Isamaela under the umbrella of the One Cook Islands Party, 

Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to our people in the Northern and Southern groups coming down to Rarotonga.  To our 

House of Ariki, Traditional Leaders and all our people in the nation, Kia Orana.  Not forgetting 

the island of Managaia, to Numangatini Ariki, the Governor General and all the people of Mangaia, 

Kia Orana.  Also, reaching out to our people in the business sectors on Rarotonga and in the Outer 

Islands, Kia Orana.  Special Kia Orana goes out to our elderly people in our Nation. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to all of our people, those who are in hospitals and even the Creative Centre, to our 

disabled children, Kia Orana to you all.  Kia Orana to all the children of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>President John F. Kennedy quoted in 1970, </span><span>“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what 

you can do for your country.”</span></div><div><span>Therefore  Mr  Speaker,  before  I  give  my  support  to  our  Bill  on  the  principle  and  merits  of  the 

Budget, I will support and give thanks to what the Government have provided for us today which 

is shown before us. 

</span></div><div><span>If I may Mr Speaker have an opportunity to address my Constituency of Puaikura?  From Tuoro 

to Toreaiva, from the width and breadth of our village, your three Members of Parliament that you 

had voted for would like to say Kia Orana to you all.  You entrusted your faith in us to work for 

you so that you may benefit.  Since the Election and up to today, we have been working on our 

Church, Ziona Tapu, refurbishing the Church for the opening day on 22 June. 

</span></div><div><span>Our work will still continue after the 22</span><span>nd</span><span> June, including the cleaning of our village; it is looking 

good so far.  

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned by the Honourable Prime Minister today, that we should act what we believe in, 

well, we did not wait for ICI, our community got together to do the work.  In true Puaikura spirit, 

last  Saturday,  although  it  was  raining  and  windy,  it  did  not  prevent  our  people  from  working 

because they wanted to have the village cleaned up.  I wanted to thank the people of Murienua,

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Akaoa and Ruaau for  your generous hospitality in supplying lunch for the people that worked; 

there was plenty of food.  Although our request was not granted by the Government, let this be a 

classic example to show them what Puaikura is doing.  But we still want to thank the Government 

of the day. 

</span></div><div><span>As I have mentioned, 200 Years Bicentennial only comes around once.  I am aware that the Outer 

Islands will celebrate their own commemoration, but  the majority  of the Outer  Islands lives in 

Rarotonga and we glorify God for the 200 Years commemoration. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, to the people of Puaikura, I ask that you stand today and get involved in the work of 

our Church.  This is not for our CICC members only, but for everyone from every denominations 

of our village, including people from outside.  Let us remember this day when we renovated the 

Church as we await the Opening of Titikaveka and Avarua Churches.  There goes this Parable, 

</span><span>“The last shall be first and the first last.”</span></div><div><span>This is a special day for us and we will wait for 25</span><span>th</span><span> July, which is also a special day for us. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I will now come back to the Appropriation before this House.  Congratulations to the 

Members of the PAC Committee, the Chairman and to all the Members who have been elected to 

look into our financial matters.  This Committee consists of people who have served as Heads of 

Ministries for many years, including Members who have worked in the Private sector.  We know 

who they are.  Today, we can see that there is a </span><span>rose </span><span>amongst the </span><span>thorns</span><span> and that is the Honourable 

Tina Browne.  I am not expressing these Members as thorns but just an illustration. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  read  their  Report  and  I  appreciate  their  input  because  it  gave  me  an 

understanding of the budget presented before the House.  I would like to thank them for their good 

work as this is the first time that this has ever happened.  Keep up the great work for this has helped 

Members of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>I would compare this Budget to a Ficus tree.  We know that this is  a beautiful tree with  green 

leaves, the only problem is that it does not bear fruits.  This is mentioned in the Budget.  The only 

problem that I have encountered is what the Prime Minister had stated.  He had stated that there 

are  two  budgets;  2023/24  and  2024/25  Budgets.    We  can  predict  that  these  Budgets  are  Lean 

Budgets,  therefore,  we  would  need  to  nurture  these  Budgets  for  that  purpose.    This  is  why  I 

compared these Budgets to a Ficus tree because the green part represents Public Servants.   

</span></div><div><span>When we review the Appropriation, we will notice the increase of Personnel; we would say that 

the Personnel is not too much.  But when we look at the figure of $325 million from 2010, 2011, 

we  would  say  that  we  have  reached  triple  the  amount  generated  by  this  nation.    Hence  why  I 

mentioned earlier that this tree bears no fruits for our people.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>With regards to the cargos that is being shipped here from New Zealand, we are paying freights 

that will benefit the New Zealand economy because we are finding today the freights of our cargos 

are always increasing.  Even the freight to the Outer Islands is more. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today when you contact the office of many Ministries and ask to speak to the Heads, 

we are told that they have gone overseas.  For how long?  Maybe two or three weeks.  That is why 

I am saying the status of our Government is good because of the benefits available to some of our 

Public Servants.  But for our ordinary people, they are not good. 

</span></div><div><span>Right up to the Cabinet Ministers, they are overseas for most of the year, maybe four or five times 

a year.  Last year and even this year, they travelled a lot overseas.  That is why I am saying that 

this Ficus Tree is not bearing fruits for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I see that my time is up Mr Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>For an extension of speaking time for the Honourable Teariki Heather for 10 minutes 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister, George Angene 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  Honourable Teariki Heather, you have the Floor with the support 

of your friend from the other side of the House.   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and the Honourable Member for Matavera and thank 

you to the Eunuch as mentioned in our Devotional Text for today, to  you  Honourable Minister 

</span><span>George Angene for your support towards my 10 minutes’ extension of speaking time.</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  there  are  numerous  examples  for  us  in  this  House.    I  have  a  request  for  you  Mr 

Speaker.  In fact, I have many requests for you.  I would like to request that the funds spent on our 

lunch during our Sitting be cut off.  This will show our support for our people by cutting out our 

meal allowances for their sake.  We can afford a tin of corned beef and sandwiches to bring with 

us  to  Parliament  for  our  meals.    This  is  a  recommendation  from  the  United  Party  for  you  Mr 

Speaker to show our people that we are servants of this country and for us not to be served.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  the  spirit  that  I  am  promoting,  as  indicated  by  the  Prime  Minister  to  serve  the  “mo</span><span>st 

</span><span>vulnerable.”  I am promoting our people especially the most vulnerable and if we do away with 

</span><span>this cost, this will prove to the people of our intentions of serving for their benefits. 

</span></div><div><span>The inflation is still going and I would like to give an example to this matter.  About three years 

ago, regarding the diesel that are imported into our country, for example, 22,000 litres and in those 

days, it would cost $23,000 for one tank container to be imported.  Today, it is $52,000 for the 

same tank container of diesel from the same company.  This is not the only item that have increased 

in cost.  I think this will have an impact on all the business people. 

</span></div><div><span>There is also building materials like timbers, cements and so forth, prices have doubled.  According 

to the Appropriation Budget, it is targeted for the most vulnerable which is good.  But we can see 

today with the increase of goods in the shops, these people cannot afford it.  That is the reason 

why I said earlier that Public Servants reaps a lot; what about our people? 

</span></div><div><span>Allocations  should be increased on welfare services at the Ministry of  Internal  Affairs and the 

Ministry of Agriculture.  We should reduce the expenditures that are being paid for overseas trips. 

</span></div><div><span>Our major stores like CITC and Prime Foods are importing products that our people can provide, 

for example, eggs. 

</span></div><div><span>We are not complaining about the Government, no, we are not.  But it seems that the Government 

has not considered our local people to make businesses in this sector. 

</span></div><div><span>“Credit should be given</span><span>where it is due.”</span></div><div><span>I have a question on the situation of our people leaving our country?  Why? 

</span></div><div><span>Even the condition of our hospital, it is very poor. 

</span></div><div><span>So, to the Minister of Health, the services in the hospital is very appalling especially the services 

provided for our elderly people.  They have paid taxes, and yet, they are not treated the same.   

</span></div><div><span>This is an encouragement for our Government because I have seen it myself. Government has been 

promoting for many long years about good healthy lives and I do not see that happening. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe my time is up.  I will finish here before the Honourable Minister points out a </span><span>Point of 

Order.   

</span></div><div><span>We, Members of the United Party supports the Appropriation Bill.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister,  Vaine 

Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  MOKOROA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  your  staff  in  this 

Honourable House.  To the Prime Minister, Honourable Cabinet Ministers, fellow Members within 

this House, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the United Party and our Member from One 

Cook Islands, Kia Orana to all as well.   

</span></div><div><span>I also extend this afternoon a warm welcome to the capital of Rarotonga, Oire Nikao, Kia Orana 

to all those who are listening in to this live broadcast.  To those watching on Facebook, a warm 

Kia Orana to all of you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I know you have mentioned this in your opening comments, but I would like to pass 

on  my  personal  condolences  to  those  who  are  grieving  in  the  loss  of  their  mother,  father  and 

families in the village of Nikao.  My condolences go to Aunty Maara Kenning and family, Mama 

Taria Terupe and family and Takave Manea and the family. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would also like to congratulate the four Kings Award which are all from Nikao as 

well.  I suppose this is a divine intervention hence these people were selected from Nikao to receive 

the Kings Award.  The Former Registrar of Justice and Ombudsman, Papa Nono Tearea and one 

of the Ministry of Health Doctors and currently, a Private Practitioner, Dr Teariki Noovao.  To our 

hot mix expert and TRIAD Petroleum, Papa Chris Vaile and P</span><span>apa Bill ‘Landholding’</span><span> Doherty, 

congratulations to all for being recognised for these prestigious Awards for the services rendered 

not only in the village of Nikao, but also for the Government and the Cook Islands as a whole.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to support and comment on our budget in this Honourable House.  

</span></div><div><span>Before doing so, let me thank the Prime Minister as Minister of Finance, Financial Secretary Garth 

</span><span>Henderson  and  your  good staff at  MFEM, the  Budget  Support  group, Heads of Ministry’s  and 

</span><span>those involved in the preparation of all these Business Plans that is tabled before us.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I was very disappointed when the Member Vaitoti Tupa stood up to say the Outer 

Island Members of Parliament are struggling to understand the Budget Book.  I see the Member 

from Mangaia giving a thumb up.  So, this is quite saddening as a former HOM for 15 years, he 

did not offer to teach the Leader of the Opposition from the island of Rakahanga or come to explain 

to the Member of Parliament from Tautu, Teokotai Herman, on whatever he is thinking that is

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>difficult.  However, if you listen to all our Members from the Outer Islands, one is confident that 

the issues they are raising are issues that are covered in this Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the offer from the Minister of Finance and MFEM is, if in doubt, to come and ask 

MFEM or the Minister or his Associate so he will guide you.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as stated, this budget is called the Budget of Nurturing. What does nurturing means?  

Ephesians 6:4 says, </span><span>“nurture indicates caring and providing support.</span><span>” </span></div><div><span>The best meaning within the dictionary says that nurturing is to take care for, feed, support and 

protect  someone  or  something  as  they  grow  and  develop.    In  the  context  of  our  society  and 

economy,  nurturing  is  important  because  it  lays  the  foundation  for  our  future  progress  and 

wellbeing. 

</span></div><div><span>If we look at the budget, the Government is and has focused on nurturing our people especially 

education, our health and our vulnerable community, which includes our children, persons with 

disability and our senior citizens. I will not repeat what the MP for Ngatangiia, Tukaka Ama have 

highlighted  that  the  Government  is  nurturing  our  people  through  increasing  the  budget  for  our 

Caregivers, for our islands tax incentives, for our improvements on the islands of Atiu and Mauke 

and the tourism sector. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would however give out some other ways of our Government nurturing our people.  

Two weeks ago, I was humbled to be present in Atiu to witness the launching of their Sanitarium 

breakfast program assisted and supported by the SDA. In this regard, I would like to congratulate 

the MPs for Atiu, the Minister of Health Rose and the MP Tehani and I would like to ask other 

schools and would encourage them to take it up.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, here we see the Government is nurturing our school kids through promoting healthy 

breakfasts on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  This is over and above the $100 monthly Child 

Benefit that our Government is paying.  So, as a word of encouragement to our parents, please 

ensure that our children are allocated that monthly $100 Child Benefit and not to be used for other 

purposes.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our children and our young people are the future of our country and we need to support 

them with the right tools to succeed.  This is done by investing in our education, trade, vocational 

and skills development programs.   

</span></div><div><span>This  government  is  also  investing  in  both  sports  and  cultural  activities  to  foster  a  rounded 

personality in our young people.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as many previous speakers have stated, we have come through a disastrous period 

globally affected by the COVID pandemic.  This disastrous period has affected our small economy 

and through guided instructions from MFEM, all Ministries were fortunate to be given as is and 

as  was  in  their  2022/23  budget  appropriation.    Normally,  in  a  disastrous  situation,  all  budgets 

should be cut.   However, in  our situation given the prioritised project  programs  or activities, a 

slight increase was given for some Government Ministries.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  in  closing,  nurturing  i</span><span>s  essential  for  our  society  and  economy’s  growth.  Our 

</span><span>Government have been humbled, coordinated right across the board, to remain within their existing 

appropriation,  however,  to  be  more  responsible  in  focusing  on  our  people,  on  our  tourism, 

infrastructure and environment.  Only by nurturing the right values and practices can we build a 

better future for ourselves and our people.      Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  It is time for a break. We will continue when 

we come back after the break.  I will suspend the Sitting until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.57 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Parliament is now resumed.  Before the break, the Honourable Vaine Mokoroa 

was speaking.  The Floor is now open again and I see the Honourable Tingika Elikana; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I speak on the Budget, can I please be allowed 

to give my condolences, together with those who have already spoken before to the families who 

have gone through bereavement?  On my islands of Pukapuka and Nassau, we had two loved one 

passed  away.    From  me  to  you  and  the  families  who  have  lost  their  loved  ones,  I  give  my 

condolences and those of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I would also like to give thanks to you Mr Speaker, the Clerk, Deputy Clerk and the staff of 

Parliament for the help that you are giving us Members of Parliament.  Above all, I would like to 

give a special thank you from the Public Accounts Committee to the Secretary Margret Numanga 

and also the Clerk and Deputy Clerk for being patient during the time we held our meetings.  The 

Report of the Committee has been tabled before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>I think it is only right that I name the people on the Committee so our people will know who these 

persons are who did this work.  From the Government side, I am the Chairman of the Committee, 

Member of Parliament for the  Island of Pukapuka and Nassau.  Also, on the Committee is  the 

Member for VAIVAITAU, Teokotai Herman and another member is the Member for Titikaveka,

</span></div><div><span>and that is Sonny Williams.  Beside us, a </span><span>rose</span><span> to beautify the Government side, is the Member for 

Tengatangi/Areora/Ngatiarua, the Honourable Tehani Brown.  From the Opposition side, we have 

another </span><span>rose,</span><span> the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Member for Rakahanga, Tina Pupuke 

Browne.  The next Member on the Committee is the Deputy Chairman and it is my assumption 

that he is the spokesman for the Budget from the Opposition, and that is the Member for Matavera, 

Vaitoti  Tupa.    We  have  one  representative  from  the  United  Party  and  I  believe  he  is  the 

spokesperson for that Party on the Budget, and that is the Honourable Robert Heather from Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span>Their Report has been presented to Parliament and included are the suggestions they believe will 

help future Budgets. 

</span></div><div><span>I have heard that some Heads of Ministries in control of different divisions of Government are not 

happy with the suggestions that are in this Report.  I want to thank this Committee because they 

did not change their minds on the Recommendations they made.  We must all be aware, if you 

know these types of people called the A1, when they are programed to do what is right, they will 

carry that out.  This is what happened, they have looked at the Budget and they have given their 

decisions and the suggestions made for future Budgets.   

</span></div><div><span>For the people who are not happy with it, I just want to remind you that Parliament have given you 

the funds to use and it is only right that you report back to Parliament how the funds are spent.  If 

we follow these steps, we will all be happy and we will know how our money is being spent. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to remind those people who are not happy with the Recommendations that these are 

new guidelines that lead Parliament and so, we are following these guidelines on how we spend 

public funds. 

</span></div><div><span>We are finding now that there are many Departments and Agencies that presents their Reports to 

show how they spend public funds.  For the Department Heads who have not filed their Reports, 

please make an effort to complete your Reports before we take other actions. 

</span></div><div><span>We have seen the Report that has been given by the Public Accounts Committee and I want to 

remind  us  of  how  we  dealt  with  the  budget  in  past  years.    When  I  first  became  a  Member  of 

Parliament, we called the Budget the Budget of Blessings.  We know our country was flourishing 

during those years and we Praised God for the blessings.   

</span></div><div><span>When we came through COVID times, we called our Budget the Budget of Faith.  Last year when 

we came to the end of COVID period, we called our Budget the Budget of Revival.  This year, our 

Budget is called the Budget of Nurturing.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Leader of our country and all the staff from the Ministry of Finance and 

Economic Management for his leadership in guiding us on how we can control our finances.  As 

</span><span>mentioned, according to the allocation for this year’s Budget, we have looked at the livelihood of 

</span><span>our people. 

</span></div><div><span>We have noticed the increase of the Minimum Wage given to our people.  I know some of our 

people are not happy with this.  I am happy that they are not responsible for the control of our 

finances.  I believe the current person holding the leadership of our finance is the right person. 

</span></div><div><span>The leadership of our Government’s </span><span>finance have to consider both the Government side and the 

Private Sector.  The Government have worked together with our business Private Sector to come 

up with this Minimum Wage.  Another example is the support given to our Caregivers, especially 

for our elderly.  Our Prime Minister have also looked into this area. 

</span></div><div><span>This includes our tax system, especially the Outer Islands.  Let us be thankful that we have the 

ability to reach this position.  Our Government did not forget the Rarotonga situation.  If you can 

recall to the statement given by the Prime Minister, he mentioned that he has considered those 

people that have two or more income sources.  If we consider these strong people and their income 

situation, they will be happy with the Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my views on our Budget at this time Mr Speaker, maybe later on during the Vote Item 

debate, I will have more to say.  Thank you much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister Rose Brown; 

you have Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BORWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all our people and to all in 

this Honourable House this afternoon; greetings in the Name of our Lord.  Greetings to our Prime 

Minister,  all  the  Cabinet  Ministers  and  the  Members  of  the  Government.    The  Leader  of  the

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I greet all the people of the Cook Islands in all the three sectors of our nation, even 

the woman folks of the islands, our elderly people, our young people, our children and even those 

who are disabled.  Kia Orana to our people in our hospitals who are ill and even in our homes and 

our inmates in our prison. 

</span></div><div><span>My greetings go to the Heads of our different Government Ministries and all the Public Servants 

here in Rarotonga and the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before us today is  our Budget  for the country.  We should thank the  Lord for the 

wisdom that He has given to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and all the staff of the 

Ministry of Finance for putting this Appropriation Bill together.  This is not an easy task to put 

together. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I just came back from a Government trip overseas and I want to inform our people 

</span><span>about our nation’s status.  If we compare our country to the other countries of the world, we are 

</span><span>better than those countries.  I want our people to know that these travels overseas are not a holiday 

for us.  Some of these travels are funded by these organisations for us to attend.   

</span></div><div><span>I am proud of our leaders, the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers travelling to represent our 

country overseas at these important meetings because these travels are not an easy mission with 

the  flying  here  and  there.    We  are  committed  to  do  our  country  proud.    These  are  times  when 

attending  in  person  that  we  express  our  appreciation  to  these  international  agencies  for  the 

sponsorship and donations to our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>Nevertheless, we should be proud of our Government for the Appropriation that have not been cut, 

allocated  for  our  people  and  their  needs,  our  elderly  and  our  children.    I  wish  to  extend  an 

appreciation  to  the  Committee,  your  Chairman  and  all  the  Members  on  the  Committee  for 

undertaking this task. 

</span></div><div><span>I wish to extend an appreciation to the Committee, your Chairman and all the members on the 

committee for putting together this Appropriation to nurture our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  happy  at  the  Leader  of  the  United  Party  for  stating  a  famous  quote,  </span><span>“Ask  not  what  your 

country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country.”</span><span>  This is a fitting saying for the 

troublesome times we are going through, but there are a lot of progressives for our nation.  There 

are more benefits in this Appropriation Bill than negatives.  However, despite this, any undesirable 

thoughts brought into the House are accepted.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, we in the Outer Islands can see the benefits such as cutting wage taxes for employees 

earning less than $60,000.  In Atiu today, I want you to know that our people are returning onto

</span></div><div><span>the island.  I really appreciate the initiative that we have achieved and on top of that is the increase 

of the Minimum Wage from $8.50 to $9.00.  Although this is a small increase, I believe that every 

year under the guidance of this Government, there will always be a gradual increase.  We can also 

see the improvement of the infrastructure in the Outer Islands.  This shows our care for the Outer 

Islands.  We can see in the allocations the benefits that are being acquired by the Outer Islands and 

trust that I would not name these improvements individually.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to raise an important matter for our people to hear and this is on our mentally 

disadvantaged people.   In particular,  I would like to  thank Government  for building a Ward to 

house our mentally unstable patients.    In  a WHO meeting, it was noticed how people who are 

mentally unstable are on the increase.  This is an important area.  There are also the problems with 

NCD, seen throughout the world.  Nowadays, there is an increase of health issues around the world.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the different Ministries for using their allocations.  Mr Speaker, the spirit of 

the Appropriation before the House is  to nurture our nation.  The Minister of Finance is  smart 

because I can recall when I first entered Parliament; the Appropriations Bill had no names.  Under 

his guidance, he gave names to the Appropriations based on our Christian beliefs.  Therefore, from 

all the people of the two Constituencies on Atiu, we strongly support the Appropriation Bill in the 

House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  the 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana again to us this evening.  

Before I address the Budget, I wanted to make two points.  The first, I too from our side of the 

House want to congratulate the recipients of the Kings Award.  I too, am very proud they all come 

from Nikao.  However, I wanted to ask the Minister Mac Mokoroa because one of them, Mr Chris 

Vaile is into tarsealing.  I am in no doubt Mr Minister that our backroad in Nikao will soon be 

tarsealed.   

</span></div><div><span>The second point I wanted to make is to also, to refer to the Public Accounts Committee.  I was 

very  proud  to  be  part  of  that  Committee,  even  more  so  proud  because  the  objective  of  the 

committee was to assist the Government and improve our system.  So, we looked at the current 

governance  and  the  aim  was  to  make  recommendations  that  would  improve  governance  in  the 

Cook Islands and if those recommendations came with the bad, the ugly and the good, so be it.   

</span></div><div><span>My response to the Budget Speech is in the same vein and as the Chairman of the Public Accounts 

Committee referred to; there may be some of us in this House who may not be happy with my 

response.  It is our job in the Opposition to provide a good aggressive opposition so that it will 

improve governance in our country.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  many  important  matters  arise  from  the  Budget  Speech  presented  by  the  Prime 

Minister that has focused on resilience and Government taking much of the credit over how this 

country  reacted  and fared when we  were in  economic decline brought  about  by the worldwide 

pandemic.   

</span></div><div><span>My colleagues in the Opposition and I believe that the two demonstration of resilience when our 

economy  was  suffering  and  at  its  lowest  financial  point,  was  our  people.    The  ordinary  Cook 

Islander  deserves  the  accolades.    They  should  be  respected  for  weathering  the  financial  storm 

during the pandemic, for continuing to put food on the dinner tables, for turning up to work and 

despite the stresses and financial strain, keeping the home fires burning and a level head.  We even 

saw  how  small  businesses  admirably  became  so  creative,  thinking  outside  the  square  and 

reinventing themselves to stay afloat.   

</span></div><div><span>It is the ordinary Cook Islander who emerged the hero of an extremely tough time.  And as the 

current lean, and I stress, lean Budget shows there are uncertainties ahead.  It will again be the 

ordinary Cook Islander who will rise as the hero and again help our Nation ride through the storm.  

We must, Prime Minister, given ample credit to whom it is due, our people.   

</span></div><div><span>Sadly, however, it must be acknowledged that so many of our young people, our able workforce, 

are leaving our shores, requiring replacement by foreign workers.  This raises the question whether 

they are leaving out of desperation to survive in a country where the cost of living is very high and 

climbing, wages are low and not increasing by comparison.  There is nothing in the Budget that 

indicates that this outward flow of our productive and vibrant workers is being addressed.  That 

concerns me greatly. 

</span></div><div><span>The Prime Minister has said that for our country to be truly resilient, we must look beyond tourism 

</span><span>to  grow  our  economy  over  the  long  term,  nurture  the  private  sector’s  ability  to  invest  in  new 

</span><span>businesses and having the right economic foundation in place.  Nice words, but in the main, vague. 

</span></div><div><span>The Prime Minister absolutely needs to be clear on what he defines as economic recovery given 

the world  has  changed so much from  pandemic times.  What  new industries specifically?  We 

already have industries that once flourished in our country, bringing in considerable yearly revenue 

from exports and contributing much to this country.  But sadly, these industries agriculture exports 

and black pearl exports from the Norther islands of Manihiki and Penrhyn have been allowed to 

flounder and become static.  Exports from these two sectors barely register a blip on the national 

chart of exports. 

</span></div><div><span>Today,  we  see  that  Government’s  focus  for  economic  recovery  appears  to  be  enhancing 

</span><span>investments in deep sea mining and marine resources.  I have asked this question before and I am 

</span></div><div><span>239 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>going  to  ask  it  again.    Has  the  Government  done  a  return  on  investment  analysis  with  the 

investment that has so far going into the Seabed Minerals Authority?  It needs to be asked whether 

this Agency is going to replicate the former Pearl Authority.  The expectation being was that the 

Pearl  Authority  would  support  pearl  farming,  conduct  intense  internationally  marketing  of  our 

black pearls, would eventually revive our pearl farming industry and see it thriving again. 

</span></div><div><span>After years of investment and of course the virus in the lagoon in Manihiki, the return has been 

pretty much zero, with  this  agency now absorbed into the Ministry of Marine Resources.  The 

Seabed  Mining  Authority  gives  all  the  signs  of  resembling  the  former  Pearl  Authority,  great 

expectations with no real, consistent results in terms of revenue generation for the country. 

</span></div><div><span>We are aware that during the pandemic many financial grants of varying amounts were issued to 

the  Private  Sector.    These  grants  were  intended  to  boost  economic  growth  in  a  program 

administered by MFEM with the assistance of the Chamber of Commerce.  Mr Speaker, the public 

needs to know whether these grants given to existing and start-up businesses were a success or 

not, and do no</span><span>t tell me it is on the MFEM’s website because I have been there and it is not there.  

</span><span>There  must  be  accountability.    This  accountability  needs  to  be  fulfilled  given  that  this  is 

Government looking to implement measures that promote sustainable growth. 

</span></div><div><span>Honorable Colleagues I have noted collective funding from development partners of $112 million 

over  the  last  four  years  plus  an  additional  $40  million.    The  New  Zealand  Government  has 

generously contributed $107 million over the last four years with an additional $21.4 million in 

the current year for budgetary support.   

</span></div><div><span>Page 24 of the Budget Estimates has general budget support from the New Zealand Government 

at $15 million for the 2022/23 financial year, so it must be clarified if the residual of $6.42 million 

is now in the 2023/24 financial year and was this support a grant or borrowed because if borrowed, 

our actual fiscal deficit would be worse off than the reported $8.2 million. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I can see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That an extension of speaking time of 10 minutes be granted to the Honourable Leader of

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, in 2019, the Government in typical retrospective 

thinking, finally realized that it would be a great idea, to establish a stabilisation account.  In other 

</span><span>words, setting aside funds for when it’s critically needed and this is what helped fund the country’s 

</span><span>pandemic response. 

</span></div><div><span>The Government is now and I have just heard some murmuring on the other side, congratulating 

itself and boasting what a wise decision it was to create a stabilization account.  The fact is, this 

prudent move should have been done years ago.  At the very outset.  Fact is, every responsible 

Government should have an emergency fund, a stabilisation account and of course my advisor to 

my left has just advised me, that in fact, it was the Opposition that initially proposed that. 

</span></div><div><span>Having now established the account, the Opposition is calling on Government to ensure that this 

stabilisation account is iron-clad to prevent it from ever being milked for pet projects that do not 

meet the criteria of an emergency. 

</span></div><div><span>The Democratic Party Opposition wants to see stricter measures in place to protect the Stabilisation 

Account and any other existing Emergency Fund from being foolishly tampered or misused.  The 

public needs to have the confidence that the Stabilisation Fund will be absolutely free from being 

milked  for  any  purpose  other  than  national  emergencies.    The  Opposition  calls  on  the  Public 

Accounts  Committee  to  give  greater  scrutiny  to  these  emergency  funds,  ensure  that  there  are 

checks  and  balances,  complete  transparency  and  accountability  and  make  recommendation  if 

stricter controls are needed.  And PAC, having filed its Report, is on its way to doing exactly that. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in recent times we have seen the effect that inflation is having on the cost of goods 

imported into our country.  Global inflation surges are beyond the control of Government.  It was 

really extraordinary how the cost of a tin of corned beef almost doubled in price overnight.  I am 

confident that all colleagues at least on our side of the House want to see our people treated fairly, 

and this is where I say that Government can do something.  We do have the Government appointed 

Price  Tribunal,  mostly  people  appointed  from  the  Private  Sector  who  are  charged  with  the 

responsibility of keeping an eye on the price of imported goods and ensure that any price increases 

are justified and fair. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Opposition  would  like  to  see  the  Price  Tribunal  become  more  active,  more  effective  and 

publicly vocal to represent the interest of the Cook Islands people and to ensure that our people 

are getting a fair and reasonable deal.  The Opposition is calling for a greater advocacy from the 

Price  Tribunal,  for  Internal  Affairs  officers  who  are  charged  with  price  checking  to  be  more 

scrupulous and consistent with the checking of prices.  After all, their first responsibility is to the 

Cook Islands consumer and tax payer.

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  more  to  say  but  like  the  Member  for  Pukapuka-Nassau,  I  will  reserve  my 

comments on the other Vote Items during the Consideration in Detail of the Vote Items.  If I started 

now, I will not finish it.  So, thank you and thank you especially to the other side, the opposing 

side of the House for listening to my magnificent speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition and I see the Honourable Prime 

Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Just to correct the Leader of the Opposition we are 

not the opposing side, you are the opposing side; we are the for-side. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, thank you to all the Members for the comments in regards to the preparation of this 

Budget  and  I  know  that  you  had  a  couple  of  weeks  to  look  through  the  Appropriation  and  to 

indicate to the Board all the comments that were made both for and oppose, not against but oppose. 

</span></div><div><span>From the outset Mr Speaker, this is a Budget that has taken a lot of time to prepare and I have to 

congratulate the team of Officials and our Budget Committee who spent months working on the 

Budget, taking into account all the Ministries requests for an increase but also managing to put 

together a fiscally responsible Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>Some Members were comparing this Appropriation to a skinny lean pig with no meat.  Mr Speaker, 

it means that due to the closure of our borders for the last two years, at that time, we were feeding 

the pigs with food scraps and not with proper pig food. 

</span></div><div><span>That is right!  Because of these tourists coming into our country with their money, it is the real pig 

food.  However, Mr Speaker, with the Appropriation that has not fully recovered, we were able to 

cater and look after the most vulnerable in the country.  We took into account the facts of inflation 

and we have managed to increase our Minimum Wage by a little bit.  Even though it is a small 

increase Mr Speaker, our Minimum Wage is the second highest in the Pacific, behind Australia 

and New Zealand.  We can only do this Mr Speaker because our Private Sector and businesses are 

able to generate the economy to be able to pay these wages.   

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition says we should give the credit to our people.  Of course, that is what 

we have been doing, giving credit to our people because it is our people and our Private Sector 

that have the appetite to risk their money, that have ability to be creative in how they are going to 

make a business and how they are going to generate income.  They were of course able to do that 

under the tremendous leadership and guidance of this Government.   

</span></div><div><span>Running  a  weighed  subsidy  for  nearly  two  years  to  allow  people  to  put  food  on  their  table, 

</span><span>negotiating  with  the  banks  to  enable  a  subsidy  on  the  interest’s  payments  on  all  loans  not  just

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>business loans but private loans, home loans, car loans; it was through this good leadership of our 

Government.  The firm decisions that we have to take, the understanding of when to draw line 

when there is too much Government involvement and not enough having that understanding.  It is 

those  sorts  of  decisions  Mr  Speaker  that  saw  us  as  one  of  the  best  performing  country  during 

COVID. 

</span></div><div><span>This Budget Mr Speaker demonstrates that this Government has been a very good manager of our 

</span><span>country’s resources and when I say our resources, I am talking about the fund that we were able to 

</span><span>put away for a number of years; our stabilisation fund.  Also, the people that we have within our 

country utilizing them to their fullest because we could not bring anybody in during that period 

when our border closed.  We had to rely on ourselves.  The one thing that COVID has taught us 

Mr Speaker is that we must be able to develop our own solutions to our own challenges, to our 

own issues in our country.  We must find ways ourselves to help our country move ahead.  That is 

why we passed the legislation Mr Speaker, despite some concerns about making the Outer Islands 

having a different tax regime than Rarotonga.  

</span></div><div><span>We know that these changes will benefit our people.  We may not benefit all our Outer Islands at 

the same time but we know there will be immediate benefits from those of our islands that have 

small economic activity and those that will pick up their economic activity.  They will benefit as 

well from having a tax-free threshold of $45,000.  

</span></div><div><span>Tax expert will tell you that this is not normal tax policy.  Some of these tax experts and economic 

experts apply their knowledge to countries and economies like theirs and not like ours.  That is 

why, not in our Budget here that we are debating but it will become a matter that we will discuss 

on how we help our labour force here in our country and how we can help our businesses look for 

extra workers.  

</span></div><div><span>I have asked my tax team that I want a review of the secondary tax that we apply here in Rarotonga.  

I want to make sure that we are not applying a tax regime on the secondary tax that is a disincentive 

for our people to go out and work a second job.  Maybe it is that we just apply a very low flat rate 

of tax for anybody who takes a second job, 10 percent to 15 percent, that maybe one way where 

we maximize the labour pool that we have in our country without putting in place a disincentive 

for people who are wanting more money, who are able to work a second job but currently, will not 

do so because of the secondary tax applied to their income.  

</span></div><div><span>This is why we must be bold Mr Speaker in this House as Members, as leaders of our country, to 

be able to explore things that we may be told by experts from overseas that it is not a good idea.  

Maybe not a good idea in their country, but a good idea in our country.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We have been busy Mr Speaker since our borders opened, to look at ways of how we can fast track 

the recovery of our economy.  We know we have a good tourism product in the region Mr Speaker 

and  talking  to  the  new  President  of  French  Polynesia  just  recently,  he  was  surprised  that  our 

numbers of tourism before COVID was 180,000 </span><span>visitors a year; was close to French Polynesia’s 

</span><span>number of 270,000 visitors a year going to French Polynesia.  

</span></div><div><span>I am very confident our tourism product will rebound this year Mr Speaker, with next week the 

start of the three weekly flight direct from Sydney with Jetstar and also at the end of this month, 

the commencement of two additional flights to Tahiti with Air Tahiti of which I have signed the 

Air License Agreement today.  

</span></div><div><span>So,  while  the  opposition  Democratic  Party  might  be  a  bit  confused  or  concerned  about  our 

economy and not sure how we are going to perform I can assure you Mr Speaker I have every 

confidence that our economy is already bouncing back and will perform very well this year.  

</span></div><div><span>In terms of agriculture being an industry that we can look forward to maybe developing, I just have 

to say that agriculture is still a big industry for us domestically as we can attest to it; people are 

making money selling their products here at the market, at the hotels, at the restaurants. 

</span></div><div><span>As an exporter myself b</span><span>ack in the 90’s when I was still in my twenties, I know that the biggest 

</span><span>earner of our export industry was not the growers, it was the airline who was collecting a great 

amount of money for every kilo that we shipped to New Zealand on airfreight.  Until we find ways 

to overcome those costs of production and the cost of export of our products, Mr Speaker, our 

people make far more money selling their pawpaw or their local product locally, rather than trying 

to  get  it  onto  a  place  to  export  to  New  Zealand  as  we  have  seen  recently  the  difficulties  with 

keeping up with the export </span><span>taro</span><span> supply. 

</span></div><div><span>I know there are some that have benefitted from the AgriTech grants that have been mentioned 

yesterday and this is approach using technology to see how we can maximize returns and reduce 

cost.  That is the key to making agriculture a successful industry for us. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly Mr Speaker, let me make a mention of our industry that holds great promise for us which is 

of  course  our  seabed  minerals  industry.    I  encourage  all  of  our  Members  to  attend  the  Seabed 

Minerals presentation which will be next week for all Members of Parliament to be held here, to 

get an update on the latest on where we are in terms of our Seabed Minerals Industry. 

</span></div><div><span>We have taken a guided and a precautionary approach into gaining a better understanding of our 

deep sea and our deep ocean.  We are on a journey of discovery right now to gain understanding 

and knowledge of what impacts will happen to our deep ocean if we undertake activities, especially 

around harvesting our nodules that sit on the bottom of the ocean; and I use that word harvesting

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 20 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>deliberately because when you use the word mining, it tends to put into minds that we are into 

blasting, we are into excavating, that we are into digging and that is not the case in terms of our 

minerals.    We  are  not  at  that  stage  yet  of  harvesting  Mr  Speaker,  we  are  still  at  the  stage  of 

exploration which is about gaining knowledge and understanding and not until we complete our 

exploration phase and we have been able to  test  certain  equipment; will  we be able to  make a 

decision or do we take the next step to harvest it? 

</span></div><div><span>This exploration phase Mr Speaker is being funded by the Licensing Companies themselves, the 

exploration  companies  themselves  to  the  extent  of  nearly  $200  million  that  will  be  spent  on 

exploration by these companies over the next five years. 

</span></div><div><span>We have positioned ourselves as now seen as leaders in the seabed minerals industries.  So, as a 

country and as a people, we should not be making comments that undermine the genuine efforts 

that our country is making to understand our seabed but also to ensure the protection of our ocean.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I invite all Members to make sure that we attend this presentation that will be given by 

our team to gain a better understanding.  I see our time is running short, Mr Speaker, I think that 

concludes my comments on the principles and merits of the Appropriation Bill and I hand over 

back to you.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  Honourable Members, we have reached 

our time limit of two hours for the debate on the principles and merits of the Bill, so bear with me.  

I will just finish this part before we end our Sitting.
