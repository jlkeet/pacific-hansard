<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members in this House.  Kia Orana 

to you Mr Speaker, your staff, and the Leaders of our Parties. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  answer  your  question  Honourable  Member  by  explaining  our  present  situation.    Our 

problem at this time is that our barge is not here in the Cook Islands, it is currently sitting overseas 

for service.  Therefore, we do not have a barge to ship the excavator to Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Minister of ICI wants to use this excavator here on Rarotonga but I am holding on to it for 

Mangaia as promised to help our growers there.  Thank you.
