<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUUKE BROWNE:</span><span> Thank  you Minister. I think, first,  I wanted to congratulate the 

Ministries because as we saw yesterday, there were Papers received from the Ministries and this 

morning, I saw four papers from the Ministry of Agriculture.  This is a very good response to the 

PAC  Report.    I  am  very  happy  about  the  Ministers  invitation  to  meet  with  the  Secretary  of 

Agriculture and the workers but  I wanted to say, if only the Ministries files their Reports as is 

required under the law, perhaps no questions will be asked as to what work are they doing in the 

Ministry.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So, when we look at yesterday to today and in reference to page 27 of the PAC Report, we will 

see the reporting is on the rise and less non submissions.  I wanted to clarify for the benefit of the 

Minister on my question because I was in New Zealand last week and I know in our last Parliament 

Sitting about a month ago that the price of lime was $40 a kilo.  Then last week, because it is 

winter, I think it was about $52 a kilo.  I think, if you are a farmer and you know there are avenues 

of exporting lime to New Zealand, then you should look after your lime trees to get a good yield 

to export to New Zealand.  This what I am seeing.  But it might be Minister that the reply to my 

question is in our Annual Report, I will read it and take it to PAC to get some answers.
