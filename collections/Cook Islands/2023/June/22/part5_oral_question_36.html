<h3>Oral Question 36</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much to the Honourable Member 

for Matavera for your question.  I understand that two of your inmate friends told you that there is 

not enough sleeping areas in prison.  Since I became the Minister Responsible for the Prison in 

2018,  there  were  68  inmates.    In  those  days,  they  were  sleeping  in  beds.    Today,  there  are  27 

prisoners in our prison.  I cannot understand your question Honourable Member as to whether your 

claim is from prisoners in prison or just friends out of prison. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To answer your question, there is enough sleeping rooms in our prison today.  The prison is good 

and it does not need any more appropriation for its management.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
