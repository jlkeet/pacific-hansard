<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Honourable Speaker, and your staff.  Greetings 

to  all  the  Members  of  this  Honourable  House.    The  Government  Members  and  Oppositions 

Members and to all our people listening and watching our Parliament Sitting, Kia Orana. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I do not really understand where the Leader of the Opposition is directing her question because I 

am not aware of any difficulties or barriers that the Ministry of Agriculture is going through.  The 

only  issue  as  reported  in  our  newspaper  is  in  regards  to  the  policy  set  by  the  government  for 

importing food and goods from overseas.  We are required to negotiate with this overseas market 

for  the  reduction  of  the  cost  or  prices  of  these  goods  and  the  paperwork  required  to  clear  the 

importation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>With regards to the exporting of our produce overseas I see that the Ministry of Agriculture has 

</span><span>been successful in clearing some of these obstacles and are exporting some of these goods.  For 

</span><span>example, our taro is now being exported to overseas market and the problem we face now is that 

the supply is not meeting the demand.  Our Ministry of Agriculture is making negotiation with 

overseas agencies for the exportation of our pawpaw fruits to New Zealand.  I truly believe that 

our Ministry of Agriculture is supporting our growers to provide seedlings and other agriculture 

needs. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Maybe I will ask the Leader of the Opposition if we can have a time together to meet with the 

</span><span>Head of the Ministry of Agriculture where she will show you what the Ministry of Agriculture are 

</span><span>actively doing.  There is also the agricultureâ€™ website where </span><span>they display the operation that they 

are doing even in the biosecurity area.
