<h3>Oral Question 44</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  To answer the question from the Member for 

Matavera, the expert of the prison is telling me he was only 14 when he was put into prison and 

today, he is the Honourable Minister of that Prison.  Under our law, when you are 16 years, the 

lawyer can ask the offender to stand in the higher court.  Under our law also, when you are 16 

years, your case can be heard in the delinquent court.  If you are 18 years old, then your case will 

be taken to the high court. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I know my time is up but if I can explain the case further.  Under the administration 

of the Ministry of Justice today, they are working towards the revival of the Delinquent Court.  I 

want to assure this House the appropriation of the Ministry of Justice in this Budget will assure 

the revival of this Childrens Court in the near future. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.
