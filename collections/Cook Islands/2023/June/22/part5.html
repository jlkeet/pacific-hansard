</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 64: 

</span></div><div><span>Annual  Performance  Review  2021/2022  for  the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 229 (6), Papers No. 61 through to 64 are hereby classified 

for referral to the Public Accounts Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Clerk.    We  have  now  come  to  Question  time.    Today,  being 

Thursday, Question time is for 1 hour.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  directed  to  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition.    Yesterday,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  posed  a  question  to  the  Minister  of 

Agriculture where she mis-represented what the Minister of Agriculture had said in reference to 

Ministerial travel. 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Minister of Agriculture had stated that Ministerial 

travels are </span><span>“fully funded”.</span><span>  Upon perusal of the Hansard record, Mr Speaker, it quite clearly states 

in the Hansard of Page 16 that the Minister stated, </span><span>“some of these travels are funded.”</span><span>  So my 

question to the Leader of the Opposition is, is she going to apologize to the Minister of Agriculture 

and to this House for mis-representing the statement made by the Minister of Agriculture? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister and I see the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members 

this afternoon in this Honourable House.  Kia Orana to all our people listening to our radio and 

watching the livestream this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to the question by the Prime Minister, I do not see any mistake that I have said.  I do 

not believe that I said that all the expenses of all the travels of the Ministers are funded.  I asked 

</span><span>the question because when the Minister of Parliamentary Services spoke yesterday, she said that 

</span><span>some ministerial travels are fully funded.  And I asked her to explain what is the meaning of fully 

funded because if our people are listening to the radio, the people will think there are no money 

spent from the Parliamentary Services. 

</span></div><div><span>That is my question because we all know, if the travel is fully funded, the Ministers and Members 

of Parliament under the Civil List Act are entitled to be paid travelling allowances.  That is the 

intention of my question for a clarification, as to what is the meaning of </span><span>“fully funded.”</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  There is a Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>275 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  If I may, Mr Speaker, a Point of Order!  As I pointed out and looking at the 

Hansard,  again,  the  Honourable  Leader  is  casting  aspersion  on  the  Minister  for  Parliament  by 

saying that she said some of the travels are </span><span>“fully funded.”</span><span>  She did not say that but Hansard clearly 

said </span><span>“some of the travels are funded.”</span></div><div><span>Fully funded is a word from her, not the word from the Parliamentary Minister.  So, by suggesting 

that  the  Minister  of  Parliamentary  Services  said  that  these  travels  are  fully  funded  again, 

misrepresents what the Minister actually said. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  Honourable Leader of the Opposition, 

are you going to tender your apology or not? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  No, Mr Speaker.  I do not see a need to apologise.  The responses 

should  have  then  been,  </span><span>no  there  is  money  been  paid  out  of  the  Parliamentary  Services  to 

compliment the travel cost</span><span>.  That was supposed to have been the response to sort me out. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I think we will leave that as it is.  Thank you 

Honourable Members.  Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor.  Do you have a 

question? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This is a question, yes!   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you! 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This is a question to the Minister of Agriculture.  That is because 

yesterday we heard a very healthy debate on the Agriculture Vote Item.  And I say healthy debate 

because at the end of the day, the time ran out and I know there were a few of us that missed out 

on making a comment on the Vote. 

</span></div><div><span>It  was  also  a  healthy  debate  because  we  heard  a  few  solutions  being  suggested  and  the  spirit 

</span><span>appeared to me to be some suggestions being made to the Ministry of Agriculture to improve the 

spending in the Vote Item.  And of course, agriculture is particularly important during this hard 

time.  Not only for the household but also  for our domestic needs to supply the hotels  and the 

businesses. 

</span></div><div><span>And some of the solutions we heard from the various Members of Parliament that spoke were lack 

of  work  force,  lack  of  assistance  for  seedlings,  and  lack  of  support  for  the  Outer  Islands, 

</span><span>particularly Mangaia.  And the suggestion from the Member of Parliament for Akaao was that they 

</span><span>are starting schooling, the young people to learn how to plant. 

</span></div><div><span>276 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>All those really local solutions.  The question that I have, is that we have heard in this parliament 

questions being posed as to what exactly it is that the agriculture is doing to clear the protocols for 

our produce to be exported to New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me just give you a very short context about a month ago we read in the Cook Islands news that 

the Prime Minister was responsible for fast forwarding the protocols in relation to meat.  And this 

was in response to request from the owner of Prime Foods, Mr Forsythe, who have been trying for 

some years to assist with reducing the cost of meat to our people. 

</span></div><div><span>And my question Minister is this, if the Ministry of Agriculture or the staff at Agriculture is having 

difficulty  in  organising  the  pathway  for  our  export,  would  a  viable  option  be  to  talk  to  your 

neighbour on  your left?  Or, what  exactly it is  that  the Ministry is  doing  to  assist  with  finding 

markets for our produce? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Minister 

of Agriculture; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Honourable Speaker, and your staff.  Greetings 

to  all  the  Members  of  this  Honourable  House.    The  Government  Members  and  Oppositions 

Members and to all our people listening and watching our Parliament Sitting, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I do not really understand where the Leader of the Opposition is directing her question because I 

am not aware of any difficulties or barriers that the Ministry of Agriculture is going through.  The 

only  issue  as  reported  in  our  newspaper  is  in  regards  to  the  policy  set  by  the  government  for 

importing food and goods from overseas.  We are required to negotiate with this overseas market 

for  the  reduction  of  the  cost  or  prices  of  these  goods  and  the  paperwork  required  to  clear  the 

importation. 

</span></div><div><span>With regards to the exporting of our produce overseas I see that the Ministry of Agriculture has 

</span><span>been successful in clearing some of these obstacles and are exporting some of these goods.  For 

</span><span>example, our taro is now being exported to overseas market and the problem we face now is that 

the supply is not meeting the demand.  Our Ministry of Agriculture is making negotiation with 

overseas agencies for the exportation of our pawpaw fruits to New Zealand.  I truly believe that 

our Ministry of Agriculture is supporting our growers to provide seedlings and other agriculture 

needs. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe I will ask the Leader of the Opposition if we can have a time together to meet with the 

</span><span>Head of the Ministry of Agriculture where she will show you what the Ministry of Agriculture are 

</span><span>actively doing.  There is also the agriculture’ website where </span><span>they display the operation that they 

are doing even in the biosecurity area.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you Honourable Minister.   I see the  Leader of  the Opposition  on the 

Floor; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUUKE BROWNE:</span><span> Thank  you Minister. I think, first,  I wanted to congratulate the 

Ministries because as we saw yesterday, there were Papers received from the Ministries and this 

morning, I saw four papers from the Ministry of Agriculture.  This is a very good response to the 

PAC  Report.    I  am  very  happy  about  the  Ministers  invitation  to  meet  with  the  Secretary  of 

Agriculture and the workers but  I wanted to say, if only the Ministries files their Reports as is 

required under the law, perhaps no questions will be asked as to what work are they doing in the 

Ministry.  

</span></div><div><span>So, when we look at yesterday to today and in reference to page 27 of the PAC Report, we will 

see the reporting is on the rise and less non submissions.  I wanted to clarify for the benefit of the 

Minister on my question because I was in New Zealand last week and I know in our last Parliament 

Sitting about a month ago that the price of lime was $40 a kilo.  Then last week, because it is 

winter, I think it was about $52 a kilo.  I think, if you are a farmer and you know there are avenues 

of exporting lime to New Zealand, then you should look after your lime trees to get a good yield 

to export to New Zealand.  This what I am seeing.  But it might be Minister that the reply to my 

question is in our Annual Report, I will read it and take it to PAC to get some answers. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  You are correct; we can see 

a change because of the PAC Report.  Maybe because it was chaired by the Honourable Tingika 

Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Toanui Isamaela; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR.  T.  ISAMAELA:  </span><span>  Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  extending  to  the  Government  and  the 

Opposition.  I want to applaud the Member Vaitoti Tupa because he is not here or else he will take 

</span><span>most of the talking time.  

</span></div><div><span>My question is directed to the Leader of the country, the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Prime  Minister,  I  want  you  to  explain  to  the  House  concerning  our  people  collecting  the  New 

Zealand  pension  on  whether  they  are  being  taxed  or  not?    I  am  asking  in  relation  to  all  Cook 

Islanders because in the last Parliament Sitting, we passed a law on the tax-free threshold for the 

Outer Islands.  Is it then only the pensioners from the Outer Islands that will not be taxed? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you for the question Honourable Member.  I can see the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>278

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  the  Member  from  AU.    Yes,  this  Old  Age 

Pension is under the New Zealand scheme.  It is up to you the person collecting the pension to 

decide whether the pension will be taxed in New Zealand or here in the Cook Islands.  I can see 

the  majority  of  our  people  collecting  this.    Pensioner  prefers  to  be  taxed  here  because  the  tax 

imposed is less than the New Zealand tax. 

</span></div><div><span>So, your question is whether they qualify under the new law we passed on the tax free threshold 

of $60,000 per annum.  I applaud you Honourable Member because this is a very good question.  

This question you asked never came across my mind.  I will refer this thought to our lawyers at 

RMD to find out whether those collecting the New Pension qualifies under this tax-free threshold 

for the Outer Islands.  Thank you very much, we will be awaiting the advice from the RMD team 

seeing that this new law commences on 1</span><span>st</span><span> July this year.  I am sure if they qualify under this tax 

free threshold, a lot of our people will relocate to the Outer Islands to take advantage of this law.  

It is sad because I do not qualify under this law.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    When  I  look  on  that  side,  those 

Honourable  Members  look  dangerous  seeing  how  they  ask  their  questions  this  afternoon.  

Honourable Member you may raise your question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. ISAMAELA: </span><span> Mr Speaker, I have a Supplementary Question but because I did not get an 

answer, I will then wait for the advice before I ask my question.  Thank you Prime Minister for 

the reply. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Robert Heather; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I wish to seek leave of absence for 

the Honourable Teariki Heather the Member for Murienua.  Secondly, on behalf of the Member 

for Ruaau, the Honourable Tim Tunui Varu and myself, I would like to ask if we may be excused 

</span><span>for the second half of the Session for today.   

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  ask  my  question,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  Minister  for  Internal  Affairs, 

Honourable Rose Brown for this far, she seems to be the only Minister that gets things done. The 

question was posed in one session and one week later, we received the required assistance.  My 

question is to the same Minister again and this is for Welfare.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  not  sure  whether  I  am  the  only  person  facing  this  problem,  I  believe  this  is  happening 

</span><span>throughout the country.  This is in respect of the Child Benefit.  I will not take long however, I 

</span><span>will briefly talk on it before my question. 

</span></div><div><span>279

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>This is a young couple with a child about to turn two soon.  Their neighbours came asking for 

support to help and look at the wellbeing of this family.  The problem here is this baby does not 

have any food in this home because the parents are always drinking.  I opened the food cabinet 

and there was no food in there.  Nevertheless, I was obliged to help not because of the parents but 

for </span><span>the child’s sake.  Two years have now passed but still there has been no change.  I have helped 

</span><span>this family three times but now it is time to ask for intervention from the Child Welfare.   

</span></div><div><span>So, this is my question to you Honourable Minister, are nurses still carrying on the program of 

visiting homes to make sure that children are being cared for?  I can assure you that this child does 

not attend the Welfare Clinic.  Perhaps you can answer my question.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member but before the Minister replies, your seeking 

for leave is granted and the two of you Honourable Members may leave before lunch if you wish 

to; no, after lunch, thank you.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you and thank you to the Honourable Member for Akaoa 

for the question that you have raised.  To give you a short answer, yes there is help and according 

to the law, Internal Affairs have a right to take children who are not being cared for properly but 

before they can do this, there are other steps that need to be taken before the child is taken away 

from the home. 

</span></div><div><span>I ask all Members who come cross these situations to call the Ministry of Internal Affairs but if 

not, call me direct and I will give the instructions for these homes to be visited.  I will ask you 

Honourable Member to give me the name of this family so we can look into the matter and give 

them assistance. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>A question for the Prime Minister.  We talked about recession 

</span><span>the other day in New Zealand.  I understand that one of the factors or one of the aspects that has 

shrunk in New Zealand is the exports.  I took that to mean, Prime Minister that the level of export 

from New Zealand to the receivers have dropped.   

</span></div><div><span>Is there any thinking of negotiating with New Zealand to get better deals for us if they are not able 

to export to their normal recipients?  Would they be considering off-loading to us at cheaper prices? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  thank  you  to  the  Leader.    In  terms  of  New 

Zealand  exports  declining,  I  can  only  put  that  to  the  fact  that  as  New  Zealand  is  primarily  an 

agricultural based exporting country and exports primarily around meat, either beef or lamb and 

also dairy products are significant export commodities for New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  not  sure whether the decline in  exports has been due to  the  recent flooding that occurred 

which damage quite a large area of production and affected many of the farms in New Zealand, 

but  I do know that recently, exporters have been encouraged by the  exchange rate of the New 

Zealand dollar to the US dollar which means, they are now getting a better return for their exports.   

</span></div><div><span>So I cannot say for sure as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition whether there is a glut of 

exports that New Zealand would look to off-load, I have really no information on that.  But I do 

know  that  the  volumes  that  we  would  import  represent  only  a  very  tiny  fraction  of  what  New 

</span><span>Zealand’s  exports  are  and  whether  as  a  Government  or  even  as  a  Ministry  would  be  able  to 

</span><span>negotiate on behalf of our businesses who are much better placed to negotiate with suppliers in 

New Zealand for pricing for their goods. 

</span></div><div><span>A question was raised to me a number of years ago regarding a similar situation but with fuel; 

could we get a better price from suppliers if we were able to negotiate a large bulk volume and the 

answer to that was no, simply because of the economies of scale. 

</span></div><div><span>To get the benefit of a lower fuel price with fuel being brought in by a big MRT tanker would 

</span><span>mean that we would have to buy ten years’ worth of supply of fuel.  So, that be</span><span>came impossible 

due to the volume, the storage and so forth.  I think a better solution is through a question raised 

by the Leader of the Opposition earlier about within the process of procurement are there ways 

that we can reduce costs and thereby get a better price for our products when it lands here and in 

that regard our private sector, Mr Speaker are best place to also find ways on how we can get these 

cheaper prices.   

</span></div><div><span>The reduction in meat import prices was due to a matter raised by the owner of Prime Foods which 

</span><span>allowed the Ministry of Agriculture then to work with New Zealand authorities to change the way 

that the administration of paper work is done which resulted in a significant reduction in the price 

of meat that we bring in from New Zealand and Australia. 

</span></div><div><span>One commodity that New Zealand does produce and exports globally quite well of which we are 

also a recipient of, is wine.  Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition and myself could lead a Trade 

Delegation to negotiate a bulk purchase of wine, may</span><span>be not ten years’ worth but something that 

</span><span>will drop the value down to make it more affordable.  Thank you Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  That  will be a good idea Honourable Prime Minister.   I see the Honourable 

Tetangi Matapo and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is going to the Minister of Health.  I 

believe this is not something new but I was asked to follow this up so that is what I am doing.  

During the time of COVID, our disabled children classroom was asked to give this chamber to the 

Ministry of Health. 

</span></div><div><span>The disabled children took their leave and moved to another place for their meetings.  The request 

that  I  convey  from  our  disable  management  in  Mangaia;  if  the  Ministry  of  Health  or  the 

government  can reimburse the amount  of money, they  spent  in  renovating the place which the 

Health is using; an amount of $8,000.  This money was raised through a telethon. 

</span></div><div><span>The question to you Minister is if the money can be paid to our disabled children because these 

children are meeting for their special classes on the veranda of one of the homes in the village.  

There is a vacant house that they can use but it needs to be renovated to be a healthy place for our 

disabled children to have their special classes.  If the funds can be made available, we will be able 

to  properly  fix  this  house  to  be  a  permanent  meeting  place  or  classroom  for  our  special  needs 

children on Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>That is the question to you Minister; thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you to the Honourable Member 

for your good question.  I would like to ask you to give me some time so I can investigate this 

matter, which you have already raised with me before and because I was busy, I was not able to 

come back to you with a solution. 

</span></div><div><span>Allow me some time and I will come back to you with an answer tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Minister of Corrective Services.  

The reason this question is coming to you Minister because I have visited two of my friends in 

</span><span>prison.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The question to you Minister is, are you considering or planning to extend the space of the prison 

building because at present, there is not enough rooms at our current prison?  My friends had told 

me that inmates have to share rooms.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister,  George 

Angene. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much to the Honourable Member 

for Matavera for your question.  I understand that two of your inmate friends told you that there is 

not enough sleeping areas in prison.  Since I became the Minister Responsible for the Prison in 

2018,  there  were  68  inmates.    In  those  days,  they  were  sleeping  in  beds.    Today,  there  are  27 

prisoners in our prison.  I cannot understand your question Honourable Member as to whether your 

claim is from prisoners in prison or just friends out of prison. 

</span></div><div><span>To answer your question, there is enough sleeping rooms in our prison today.  The prison is good 

and it does not need any more appropriation for its management.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Agnes 

Armstrong; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in the House today.  To 

the Prime Minister seeking a confirmation, a reply to my question to you in April by someone in 

the public and this is to do with departure tax.  If you could confirm the amount of departure tax 

that we pay.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you Honourable  Member.  Honourable Prime Minister,  you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you for reminding me of the question.  I myself have forgotten but 

</span><span>our departure tax is indexed annually to a small percentage increase so I have to go and find out 

</span><span>what the actual amount is as of today.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My second question, I direct to the Minister of Justice.  

I noticed today that there are many crime issues especially with our youth in our community.  I 

know that under the Delinquent Act, in regards to  youth under the age of 16 or 18, if they are 

</span><span>charged with a crime, they cannot be put in prison.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>They are specifically under the power of the youth court.  The offences they are committing is bad 

because this  actually has happened to  me.  The reason  I am  asking my question because these 

youth who are committing these crimes are under the age of imprisonment.  Is the Ministry of 

Justice considering changing the age of imprisonment to the age of 18 years?  These youth need 

to know that they cannot commit these offences and not be punished. 

</span></div><div><span>The  question  again  Honourable  Minister  is,  is  there  a  proposal  for  a  change  of  the  age  of 

imprisonment for the youth by the Ministry of Justice?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  To answer the question from the Member for 

Matavera, the expert of the prison is telling me he was only 14 when he was put into prison and 

today, he is the Honourable Minister of that Prison.  Under our law, when you are 16 years, the 

lawyer can ask the offender to stand in the higher court.  Under our law also, when you are 16 

years, your case can be heard in the delinquent court.  If you are 18 years old, then your case will 

be taken to the high court. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I know my time is up but if I can explain the case further.  Under the administration 

of the Ministry of Justice today, they are working towards the revival of the Delinquent Court.  I 

want to assure this House the appropriation of the Ministry of Justice in this Budget will assure 

the revival of this Childrens Court in the near future. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.
