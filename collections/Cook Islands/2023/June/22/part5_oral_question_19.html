<h3>Oral Question 19</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  the  Member  from  AU.    Yes,  this  Old  Age 

Pension is under the New Zealand scheme.  It is up to you the person collecting the pension to 

decide whether the pension will be taxed in New Zealand or here in the Cook Islands.  I can see 

the  majority  of  our  people  collecting  this.    Pensioner  prefers  to  be  taxed  here  because  the  tax 

imposed is less than the New Zealand tax. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, your question is whether they qualify under the new law we passed on the tax free threshold 

of $60,000 per annum.  I applaud you Honourable Member because this is a very good question.  

This question you asked never came across my mind.  I will refer this thought to our lawyers at 

RMD to find out whether those collecting the New Pension qualifies under this tax-free threshold 

for the Outer Islands.  Thank you very much, we will be awaiting the advice from the RMD team 

seeing that this new law commences on 1</span><span>st</span><span> July this year.  I am sure if they qualify under this tax 

free threshold, a lot of our people will relocate to the Outer Islands to take advantage of this law.  

It is sad because I do not qualify under this law.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
