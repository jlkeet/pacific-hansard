<h3>Oral Question 28</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  thank  you  to  the  Leader.    In  terms  of  New 

Zealand  exports  declining,  I  can  only  put  that  to  the  fact  that  as  New  Zealand  is  primarily  an 

agricultural based exporting country and exports primarily around meat, either beef or lamb and 

also dairy products are significant export commodities for New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  am  not  sure whether the decline in  exports has been due to  the  recent flooding that occurred 

which damage quite a large area of production and affected many of the farms in New Zealand, 

but  I do know that recently, exporters have been encouraged by the  exchange rate of the New 

Zealand dollar to the US dollar which means, they are now getting a better return for their exports.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So I cannot say for sure as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition whether there is a glut of 

exports that New Zealand would look to off-load, I have really no information on that.  But I do 

know  that  the  volumes  that  we  would  import  represent  only  a  very  tiny  fraction  of  what  New 

</span><span>Zealand’s  exports  are  and  whether  as  a  Government  or  even  as  a  Ministry  would  be  able  to 

</span><span>negotiate on behalf of our businesses who are much better placed to negotiate with suppliers in 

New Zealand for pricing for their goods. 

</span></div>
<div><span>A question was raised to me a number of years ago regarding a similar situation but with fuel; 

could we get a better price from suppliers if we were able to negotiate a large bulk volume and the 

answer to that was no, simply because of the economies of scale. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To get the benefit of a lower fuel price with fuel being brought in by a big MRT tanker would 

</span><span>mean that we would have to buy ten years’ worth of supply of fuel.  So, that be</span><span>came impossible 

due to the volume, the storage and so forth.  I think a better solution is through a question raised 

by the Leader of the Opposition earlier about within the process of procurement are there ways 

that we can reduce costs and thereby get a better price for our products when it lands here and in 

that regard our private sector, Mr Speaker are best place to also find ways on how we can get these 

cheaper prices.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The reduction in meat import prices was due to a matter raised by the owner of Prime Foods which 

</span><span>allowed the Ministry of Agriculture then to work with New Zealand authorities to change the way 

that the administration of paper work is done which resulted in a significant reduction in the price 

of meat that we bring in from New Zealand and Australia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One commodity that New Zealand does produce and exports globally quite well of which we are 

also a recipient of, is wine.  Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition and myself could lead a Trade 

Delegation to negotiate a bulk purchase of wine, may</span><span>be not ten years’ worth but something that 

</span><span>will drop the value down to make it more affordable.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
