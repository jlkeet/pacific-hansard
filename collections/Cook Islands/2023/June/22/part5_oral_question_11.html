<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This is a question to the Minister of Agriculture.  That is because 

yesterday we heard a very healthy debate on the Agriculture Vote Item.  And I say healthy debate 

because at the end of the day, the time ran out and I know there were a few of us that missed out 

on making a comment on the Vote. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It  was  also  a  healthy  debate  because  we  heard  a  few  solutions  being  suggested  and  the  spirit 

</span><span>appeared to me to be some suggestions being made to the Ministry of Agriculture to improve the 

spending in the Vote Item.  And of course, agriculture is particularly important during this hard 

time.  Not only for the household but also  for our domestic needs to supply the hotels  and the 

businesses. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And some of the solutions we heard from the various Members of Parliament that spoke were lack 

of  work  force,  lack  of  assistance  for  seedlings,  and  lack  of  support  for  the  Outer  Islands, 

</span><span>particularly Mangaia.  And the suggestion from the Member of Parliament for Akaao was that they 

</span><span>are starting schooling, the young people to learn how to plant.

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>All those really local solutions.  The question that I have, is that we have heard in this parliament 

questions being posed as to what exactly it is that the agriculture is doing to clear the protocols for 

our produce to be exported to New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Let me just give you a very short context about a month ago we read in the Cook Islands news that 

the Prime Minister was responsible for fast forwarding the protocols in relation to meat.  And this 

was in response to request from the owner of Prime Foods, Mr Forsythe, who have been trying for 

some years to assist with reducing the cost of meat to our people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And my question Minister is this, if the Ministry of Agriculture or the staff at Agriculture is having 

difficulty  in  organising  the  pathway  for  our  export,  would  a  viable  option  be  to  talk  to  your 

neighbour on  your left?  Or, what  exactly it is  that  the Ministry is  doing  to  assist  with  finding 

markets for our produce?
