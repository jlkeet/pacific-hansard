<h3>Oral Question 30</h3>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is going to the Minister of Health.  I 

believe this is not something new but I was asked to follow this up so that is what I am doing.  

During the time of COVID, our disabled children classroom was asked to give this chamber to the 

Ministry of Health. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The disabled children took their leave and moved to another place for their meetings.  The request 

that  I  convey  from  our  disable  management  in  Mangaia;  if  the  Ministry  of  Health  or  the 

government  can reimburse the amount  of money, they  spent  in  renovating the place which the 

Health is using; an amount of $8,000.  This money was raised through a telethon. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question to you Minister is if the money can be paid to our disabled children because these 

children are meeting for their special classes on the veranda of one of the homes in the village.  

There is a vacant house that they can use but it needs to be renovated to be a healthy place for our 

disabled children to have their special classes.  If the funds can be made available, we will be able 

to  properly  fix  this  house  to  be  a  permanent  meeting  place  or  classroom  for  our  special  needs 

children on Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>That is the question to you Minister; thank you. 

</span></div>
