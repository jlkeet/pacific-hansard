<h3>Oral Question 27</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>A question for the Prime Minister.  We talked about recession 

</span><span>the other day in New Zealand.  I understand that one of the factors or one of the aspects that has 

shrunk in New Zealand is the exports.  I took that to mean, Prime Minister that the level of export 

from New Zealand to the receivers have dropped.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Is there any thinking of negotiating with New Zealand to get better deals for us if they are not able 

to export to their normal recipients?  Would they be considering off-loading to us at cheaper prices? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor.
