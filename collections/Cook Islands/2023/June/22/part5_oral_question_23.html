<h3>Oral Question 23</h3>
<div><span>MR. R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I wish to seek leave of absence for 

the Honourable Teariki Heather the Member for Murienua.  Secondly, on behalf of the Member 

for Ruaau, the Honourable Tim Tunui Varu and myself, I would like to ask if we may be excused 

</span><span>for the second half of the Session for today.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  ask  my  question,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  Minister  for  Internal  Affairs, 

Honourable Rose Brown for this far, she seems to be the only Minister that gets things done. The 

question was posed in one session and one week later, we received the required assistance.  My 

question is to the same Minister again and this is for Welfare.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I  am  not  sure  whether  I  am  the  only  person  facing  this  problem,  I  believe  this  is  happening 

</span><span>throughout the country.  This is in respect of the Child Benefit.  I will not take long however, I 

</span><span>will briefly talk on it before my question.

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is a young couple with a child about to turn two soon.  Their neighbours came asking for 

support to help and look at the wellbeing of this family.  The problem here is this baby does not 

have any food in this home because the parents are always drinking.  I opened the food cabinet 

and there was no food in there.  Nevertheless, I was obliged to help not because of the parents but 

for </span><span>the childâ€™s sake.  Two years have now passed but still there has been no change.  I have helped 

</span><span>this family three times but now it is time to ask for intervention from the Child Welfare.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, this is my question to you Honourable Minister, are nurses still carrying on the program of 

visiting homes to make sure that children are being cared for?  I can assure you that this child does 

not attend the Welfare Clinic.  Perhaps you can answer my question.  Thank you.
