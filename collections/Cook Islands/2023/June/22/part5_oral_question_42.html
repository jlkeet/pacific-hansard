<h3>Oral Question 42</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My second question, I direct to the Minister of Justice.  

I noticed today that there are many crime issues especially with our youth in our community.  I 

know that under the Delinquent Act, in regards to  youth under the age of 16 or 18, if they are 

</span><span>charged with a crime, they cannot be put in prison.

</span></div>
<div><span>They are specifically under the power of the youth court.  The offences they are committing is bad 

because this  actually has happened to  me.  The reason  I am  asking my question because these 

youth who are committing these crimes are under the age of imprisonment.  Is the Ministry of 

Justice considering changing the age of imprisonment to the age of 18 years?  These youth need 

to know that they cannot commit these offences and not be punished. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  question  again  Honourable  Minister  is,  is  there  a  proposal  for  a  change  of  the  age  of 

imprisonment for the youth by the Ministry of Justice?  Thank you.
