<h3>Oral Question 25</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you and thank you to the Honourable Member for Akaoa 

for the question that you have raised.  To give you a short answer, yes there is help and according 

to the law, Internal Affairs have a right to take children who are not being cared for properly but 

before they can do this, there are other steps that need to be taken before the child is taken away 

from the home. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I ask all Members who come cross these situations to call the Ministry of Internal Affairs but if 

not, call me direct and I will give the instructions for these homes to be visited.  I will ask you 

Honourable Member to give me the name of this family so we can look into the matter and give 

them assistance. 

</span></div>
