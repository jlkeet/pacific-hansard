</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span> I now open the Floor to any speakers who wishes to speak.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti 

Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker for this opportunity to air my views on this Appropriation 

for CIIC.  Mr Speaker, I do not have any problems on this Vote Item and I give my support it.  

However, I do have one query on mind and this is as a result of the discussions during the Public 

Accounts Committee meeting on their operations.  I note that some Agencies, although they have 

Boards, they still have meetings with CIIC regarding their operations. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, on the nature of their work, I am not too happy about this because although there are 

policies in place for them, when they recently appeared before the PAC, it took amongst other 

things for them, nine years to complete their Report.  They gave the Report to the Audi office and 

Audit found the Report was for the period 2014 to 2021.  I felt sorry for this Report because it has 

been modified.  During my time as a Head of the Ministry, it was qualified. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stated that I do not understand the definition of </span><span>qualified</span><span> because I thought that my 

Report was  good.   But  no,  </span><span>unqualified</span><span> indicates that  you have a  good Report.  But  when  your 

Report is marked </span><span>qualified</span><span>, it is worse.  Nowadays, it has changed to </span><span>modified</span><span> and </span><span>unmodified</span><span>.  

Mr Speaker, from 2014 to 2021, this is a span of nine years, why is this Report marked as </span><span>modified</span><span>

from 2014 to 2021? 

</span></div><div><span>If I am a Head of Ministry and if my Reports were marked as </span><span>modified</span><span> from 2014, I will ensure 

that within three years, my Reports are </span><span>unmodified.</span><span>  When I read the programmes under Output 1 

and 2 and so forth, there is no problem with the programme, but when you look at the programme 

for 2014-2021, it seems as if it was just a cut and paste.  Yes, the work is completed, but according 

to the Report, it is not.  

</span></div><div><span>In Book 2, you will see that these Programmes and looking at these Programmes from 2019 to 

2021, you will notice of some slight changes.  According to Audits, it is still </span><span>modified.</span></div><div><span>I would like to touch on the Appropriation Mr Speaker.  I have no problems in the past because 

we have agreed to the Appropriations for the projects.  My only concern is the expenditures on the 

projects.  In Book 2, there are two projects where funds has been allocated for 2021-2022, but they 

were not completed.  The Minister Responsible for CIIC and PAC may need to review this because 

the Report  for 2022-2023 is  yet  to be  received.   When they  presented themselves  to  PAC, my 

request which I trusted them was that by 2024, their Reports will be marked </span><span>unmodified</span><span> when it is 

submitted  to  Parliament.    I  believed  when  the  Report  for  2022-2023  is  received,  it  will  be  a 

</span><span>modified</span><span> Report.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we, Members of Parliament, Government Members and Minister for CIIC and the 

Opposition are reviewing allocation of funds for this Ministry.  I do not have any problem if they 

were to request for top-ups for new projects, but I do have a problem when there are unfinished 

projects.  This is why I wanted to comment on this Vote Item, for both Rarotonga and the Outer 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>However, I support this Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  It is time for a break and when we come back, 

I will allow another Member on the Floor to speak.  I will suspend the Sitting until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.28 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please be seated.  Parliament is now resumed.  Before we debate the Vote Item, 

I have a humble request to make to all Members of Parliament that on Monday, when we come to 

Parliament that the men wear a jacket and tie and the ladies formal attire because the Governor 

General of Australia will be paying a visit to our Parliament.  That is my request to all Members 

today, thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>We are still on the Vote Item for the Cook Islands Investment Corporation and the Floor is still 

open  to  any  Members  who  wish  to  speak.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>Thank  you Mr Speaker.   I wish to  give my thoughts  on this 

Agency of government.  I have a concern with this Agency because it has taken them a long time 

to table their Report and it was only at the beginning of this year that they tabled their Reports for 

2014 to 2021 and all those Reports on their financial position was modified. 

</span></div><div><span>My concern is because this Agency controls all the assets of the country.  I believe that the reason 

why their Report is modified because the list of assets and the value of those assets are unsure.  I 

believe that if you do not do well in 2014, you will try hard to improve on the next year and the 

next year; but I can see that there has not been change at all. 

</span></div><div><span>This is one of the Agency who is reported in the PAC Report, who do not follow the rules for 

Agencies, Ministries, State Owned Enterprises to file their Report on a timely basis. 

</span></div><div><span>The  PAC  Committee  was  not  happy  so  a  meeting  was  held  with  employees  from  Investment 

Corporation.  The Public Accounts Committee raised their frustrations in regard to this Agency 

</span></div><div><span>286 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>and the good result that came out of that meeting, they assured us, their Board Chairman and their 

Chief Executive Officer, that they will work closely with the Audit Office so they can improve on 

their reporting and maybe unmodified their financial status. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe this is the proper time that I should address this issue because this is not just one of the 

agencies that does not follow the rules on reporting.  Most of the Ministries have not filed their 

Reports.    Most  of  the  State  Owned  Enterprises  and  Agencies,  there  is  no  Report.    The  Island 

</span><span>Administrations did not file any Report.  The Minister’s Offices and the Lea</span><span>der of the Opposition, 

no report.  This is why it was suggested in the PAC Report that we should follow what the Law 

says. 

</span></div><div><span>I am not sure about the other Ministers, but my Office, the Office of the Leader of the Opposition 

is working hard on our Report so it can be tabled.  But ours cannot be compared to other Ministries 

who have not  tabled theirs for many  years.   So it  is  only  right  that Ministers Offices  file their 

Reports and encourage their Ministries to file their Reports.   

</span></div><div><span>According to the recommendations in the PAC Report, if your Report is not good and if PAC does 

not accept  your explanation why your report is overdue, the Committee will recommend to the 

Prime Minister that he not give any funds for those Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>I think this is a good move Mr Speaker because we can see since the beginning of our Parliament 

Sitting, many Reports have been filed by the Ministries.  I am sure that we all understand that it is 

us Members of Parliament who support their allocation and yet next year, they ask for more funds 

but they have not reported to Parliament how they spent the funds for the previous year.  When 

they ask for more funds, we say YES.  So, I guess it is only right that we say WAIT.  This money 

belongs to our taxpayers, our people and it is only right that you report how you spend the money.  

I truly believe that what I am saying is not only for this Vote Item but for the many allocations that 

we will be giving. 

</span></div><div><span>When  I  look  at  the  Budget  estimates  of  the  Investment  Corporation  at  page  42,  it  shows  the 

</span><span>infrastructure  work  in  the  Outer  Islands.    The  islands  that  are  mentioned  is  Aitutaki,  Mangaia, 

Manihiki and Penrhyn.  I guess Rakahanga is not part of the Outer Islands.  Maybe Rakahanga is 

a city of Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>I am reading the concern of PAC which I refer you to page 15 and I want to state that this report 

from PAC is accepted by all the Committee, including the Chairman because he signed the Report.  

</span><span>Here is the concern of the PAC Committee and I read: “</span><span>the PAC further noted with concern an 

</span><span>apparent  concentration  of  capital  projects  in  certain  Pa  Enua  represented  in  Parliament  by 

</span><span>Government and independent Members of Parliament and suggest more equitable distribution of 

</span><span>capital budget support for the other Pa Enua in future appropriations.”</span></div><div><span>287 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I am happy with this concern of the PAC and I am sure that PAC was mindful of Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>When  we  look  at  the  Budget  Estimates,  we  will  ask  whether  there  is  a  plan  for  the  island  of 

Rakahanga because many people go to inspect the work to be done on Rakahanga.  The news will 

arrive on the island that a delegation will arrive from the Investment Corporation to see how many 

sheets  of  iron  roofing  and  timber  will  be  required  to  renovate  the  Office  of  the  Council  and 

Administration and repair the schools. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, I will interrupt  you as  your time has expired.  But the 

good thing is, the Minister for CIIC has heard your concerns.  I now see the Honourable Member 

Toanui Isamaela. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to all of us Honourable Members in this Honourable 

House.  Before I give my support to this Vote Item, I just wanted to talk about my views to this 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>I am especially highlighting the issues that we have on Aitutaki.  I am speaking about our electric 

supply  and  our  water  supply  because  these  projects  are  under  this  Vote  Item.    I  see  a  lot  of 

allocation in this Vote Item a figure of $4 million.  I do not see an allocation for power supply of 

Aitutaki in this Vote Item in any of the budget books.  Maybe Mr Speaker there is an allocation 

for the Aitutaki power supply in this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>I know for sure Mr Speaker there is an allocation for the Aitutaki harbour in this Appropriation.  I 

also noticed the allocation is for the year 2023 to 2025, and then this tells us that this is a long-

</span><span>term Appropriation.  I am not criticising the Government’s plan on this Appropriation, I am only 

</span><span>concerned about the intention and the love of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Like what I have told this House earlier about the power supply generators we have in Aitutaki, 

</span><span>these are old and are out of date.  It is not operating properly and it needs to be replaced.  Our solar 

</span><span>system is also not working properly.  My request to the Government for our power supply is for 

some funds, an appropriation to help restore a good maintainable power supply for Aitutaki.  We 

would also like to request for a water pump to be supplied as well. 

</span></div><div><span>If  we  do  not  have  any  appropriation  in  this  Budget,  maybe  the  Government  has  some  money 

somewhere, to help us.  I am the type of person that makes noises and speak my mind so I am 

asking the Government to please, help my people.  We need your financial assistance.  I understand 

</span><span>the Member for Rakahanga, Leader of the Opposition making noises for her people to Government 

</span><span>and if they do not use their funds, to divert it to Aitutaki instead. 

</span></div><div><span>288 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Aitutaki is a tourist destination; once they arrive on Rarotonga, they transit straight to Aitutaki.  

The Government  will agree with  this  because tourists that comes to Aitutaki generates a lot of 

revenue for this country.  Our power supply cannot be stopped, neither our water because we have 

tourists to cater for.  Not to mention, our road problems, they are well taken care of.  When the 

Ministers  comes  over,  all  the  potholes  are  covered  with  sand.    Once  they  go  back,  potholes 

reappears again. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker,  I will never quit moaning to  Government  for the needs  of my island  Aitutaki 

because I represent the entire island and not just my Constituency.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, my request to CIIC and to the Government, please come and help Aitutaki.  My time is 

up; I give my support to this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Wesley 

Kareroa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. KAREROA:</span><span>  Kia Orana Honourable Speaker and every Honourable Members present in 

the House this afternoon.  I just wanted to speak on this Vote Item for CIIC.   

</span></div><div><span>In our Budget Book, I see some projects listed that started in 2001 for the renovations of public 

buildings like hospitals.  I know that some of the work has been carried out and the infrastructure 

staff had started working on it, but not all the materials required arrived on time.  The workers 

were not happy because they could not complete the work they were tasked to do. 

</span></div><div><span>The carpenters from Rarotonga that came to work on the hospital in Mangaia could not finish it 

because of the lack of materials.  They stayed in the Women Affairs accommodation and when 

they came back to Rarotonga, they were in rental debt of up to $20,000.  They never paid it and to 

date, still nothing has come through.   

</span></div><div><span>We are now renovating this building in preparation for the 200 years anniversary celebration next 

</span><span>year.  I am asking if some funds can be used from this Ministry to help with this project of ours. 

</span></div><div><span>My  second  submission  to  the  Government.    I  am  aware  there  has  been  a  discussion  for  the 

tarsealing of the roads in Mangaia before the 200-year anniversary next year.  Personally, I cannot 

see this project being completed because the time is now very short.  When I look at the current 

leaders of our country, they all have Mangaia roots.  One has a Mangaia wife, one has roots in 

Mangaia  George  Maggie  and  the  Prime  Minister  is  from  Oneroa.    Minister  Rose  married  to  a 

</span><span>Mangaia man and Albert has Chief blood from Numangatini.  Honourable Tingika’s family is my 

</span><span>next-door neighbour. 

</span></div><div><span>289 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I am requesting to all of you because of your Mangaia connections, to consider the needs of our 

Mangaia people before I get thrown out of Parliament.  There is no harm in asking humbly. 

</span></div><div><span>I also see in our Budget Book the allocation of $22,000 for CIIC, for diesel fuel.  Perhaps this fuel 

is for the sport field for the children because this project is still not complete.  In this Book, it 

indicates that this amount will be given to Mangaia in July.  If this is the case, which I do not 

believe, the project will be completed and the handover will have effect. 

</span></div><div><span>I also noticed the problem with our water supply, which it is under this Vote Item for CIIC.  Yes, 

water is running well but I tell  you, it is dirty and you cannot drink it; it is not safe.  We have 

filtered water stations and this had helped the people in the villages get clean water.  All the villages 

on the island shares the same problem with this water issue we have. 

</span></div><div><span>Nevertheless,  I  support  this  Vote  Item  in  a  way  but  the  work  has  been  started  and  yet  to  be 

completed.  That is all I have to say; thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  from  Mangaia,  Wesley  Kareroa.    I  see  the 

Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  By right, I should not complain about 

things  not  completed  in  Rakahanga.    I  believe  this  is  a  fitting  time  to  give  thanks  for  things 

completed.  This is not under the Investment Corporation but we have the same Minister for the 

Investment Corporation and Infrastructure as well. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to the water tanks in Rakahanga erected by the Infrastructure, I give my thank you to 

the  Minister  of  Infrastructure.    At  times,  I  get  confused  in  regards  to  the  housing  renovations 

carried out by these Ministries.  Now I know that all inspections and itemisations of the building 

materials for the housings are under the Investment Corporation.  I want to remind the Minister 

that we are still waiting for the renovations to the Administration building, the hospital and the 

</span><span>school.  I truly believe Minister this request will not be hindered financially because this is only a 

</span><span>repair job.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I now see the Honourable Minister for CIIC. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I had my closing remarks prepared but when 

these Members made their speeches, I was lost and do not know what to say.  Nevertheless, Mr 

Speaker, I noted the remarks and concerns of our Members across the Floor.  I must admit, I do 

</span><span>share a number of their concerns and why I say that Mr Speaker was I was part of a team that 

</span><span>visited Aitutaki recently and have met with various groups and agencies on Aitutaki concerning a 

number  of  their  issues  that  are  being  revealed  to  us  this  afternoon.    But  I  must  remind  the

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 22 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members and although I share their concerns, I feel this is not the forum for it Mr 

Speaker as we are just about to pass the budget.  But I would appreciate catching up with them in 

the later months in case we need to financially imbed their concerns into the next financial budget.  

</span></div><div><span>I have no issues with their request and concerns Mr Speaker but I am sure they would agree with 

me that in any cases, many of their concerns do not apply to this current budget that we are just 

about to pass.  I am pretty sure they will understand that a lot of the works will take a bit of time, 

a bit of research and a bit of work to put together before implementation.  But in this forum Mr 

Speaker, the guarantee I can give each and every Member in this House, which will be the same 

guarantee that I gave the Aitutaki Island Government and the Members of Parliament of Aitutaki 

is that I will work hard for each and every Member in this House provided that each one of you 

are prepared to carry the load on your end.  And if yes is the answer, then I am giving my guarantee 

that I will be happy and honoured to do my end. 

</span></div><div><span>CIIC Mr Speaker is  a statutory corporate entity  established under the Cook  Islands  Investment 

Corporation Act 1988 with two main responsibilities Mr Speaker.  One, to administer and manage 

Crown  assets  and  shareholding  interests  and  two,  to  control  and  manage  the  undertakings  of 

Statutory  corporations.    Mr  Speaker,  some  of  the  fantastic  projects  for  the  nation  that  were 

concluded by CIIC or in partnership with CIIC in recent times is the Puna Tiaki Wellness Centre 

at  the  Rarotonga  hospital,  the  Manihiki  Administration  building,  the  Nikao  Cyclone  Centre 

</span><span>redevelopment…</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, I have to interrupt you.  I suggest when we come back 

tomorrow, you may continue with your closing remarks.  I am sure you will not forget the last part 

of your speech, which you will continue.  

</span></div><div><span>Let us finish for today. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  And that is just to name a few Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I will give you two minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  And like I said earlier Mr Speaker, I will repeat my commitment to each 

and every Member of this House. You do your heavy lifting and I guarantee you, I will be here to 

do the rest.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister for your sympathy.
