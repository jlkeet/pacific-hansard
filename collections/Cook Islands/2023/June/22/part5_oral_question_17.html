<h3>Oral Question 17</h3>
<div><span>MR.  T.  ISAMAELA:  </span><span>  Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  extending  to  the  Government  and  the 

Opposition.  I want to applaud the Member Vaitoti Tupa because he is not here or else he will take 

</span><span>most of the talking time.  

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is directed to the Leader of the country, the Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Prime  Minister,  I  want  you  to  explain  to  the  House  concerning  our  people  collecting  the  New 

Zealand  pension  on  whether  they  are  being  taxed  or  not?    I  am  asking  in  relation  to  all  Cook 

Islanders because in the last Parliament Sitting, we passed a law on the tax-free threshold for the 

Outer Islands.  Is it then only the pensioners from the Outer Islands that will not be taxed? 

</span></div>
