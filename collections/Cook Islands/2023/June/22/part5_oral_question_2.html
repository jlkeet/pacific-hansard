<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  directed  to  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition.    Yesterday,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  posed  a  question  to  the  Minister  of 

Agriculture where she mis-represented what the Minister of Agriculture had said in reference to 

Ministerial travel. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Minister of Agriculture had stated that Ministerial 

travels are </span><span>“fully funded”.</span><span>  Upon perusal of the Hansard record, Mr Speaker, it quite clearly states 

in the Hansard of Page 16 that the Minister stated, </span><span>“some of these travels are funded.”</span><span>  So my 

question to the Leader of the Opposition is, is she going to apologize to the Minister of Agriculture 

and to this House for mis-representing the statement made by the Minister of Agriculture? 

</span></div>
