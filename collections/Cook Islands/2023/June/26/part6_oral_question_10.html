<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Just a few weeks ago, I was in New Zealand, I 

met up with Tauraki Rongo.  He explained to me their situation in New Zealand and one of their 

biggest problem is our mother tongue or our language.  They are looking at how they can find 

</span><span>ways to improve the way our people speaks our language, especially in New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I was happy because our leaders and Cook Islands people in New Zealand are trying to find ways 

as to how they can support our own people in speaking or using our own language.  One solution 

is to involve our young people in the Maire Nui festival. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In our newspaper this morning, the New Zealand Government have allocated about $13 million 

for the promotion of pacific island languages to be taught in the various pacific communities.  The 

</span><span>question that has been asked by the Member of Matavera is in line with what Tauraki Rongo in 

</span><span>New Zealand asked me.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I praised our people from Pukapuka because they have translated the Bible into their own island 

language.  So, that is a challenge that I would leave with all the other islands to translate the Bible 

</span><span>into  your  own  islandâ€™s  dialect  or  language.    </span><span>If  the  Pukapuka  community  have  done  their  own 

language translation, why can the rest of the islands not do the same?  Irrespective of that, the part 

that is played by the Ministry of Education is to incorporate into their curriculum all our languages 

spoken here.  We will try to encourage the education system on each individual islands to support 

their own language.  Without a doubt, I do believe that the Secretary for the Ministry of Education 

will support what I have said.  I do believe in what has been raised by the Member of Ngatangiia 

in regards to teaching our children on how to beat the drums because this support will all support 

our community in regards to our culture.  As I have already mentioned that in this 10-year Master 

Plan, the thought raised by the Member for Matavera will be incorporated.  Thank you.
