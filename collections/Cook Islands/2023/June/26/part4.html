<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Members  for  attending  the  presentation  by  the  Seabed 

Mineral Authority this  afternoon.  It was an informative presentation and we thank the Seabed 

Mineral Commissioner, Alex Herman and her team for providing us an update report on the seabed 

</span><span>mineral activities. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I would like to remind Honourable Members about the visit by the Australian Governor 

General, His Excellency David Hurley this afternoon.  The arrangement for us is that when the 

Governor General arrives at 2.20 p.m., he will be escorted by the </span><span>Sergeant-at-Arms</span><span> to his seat in 

the Public Gallery while the business of the House is progressing.   

</span></div><div><span>I will acknowledge His Excell</span><span>encyâ€™s presence in the Chamber and will then suspend Parliament 

</span><span>for lunch.  I will ask Honourable Members to remain upstanding while the Governor General is 

being greeted by myself, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, before departing 

for his bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister.
