<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question.  Honourable Minister, 

you said that the Ministry of Education is working on the new Master Plan for the next 10 years.  

Mr Speaker, I have gone and study the allocation for the Ministry of Education and the distribution 

of their allocation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  propose  a  recommendation  to  the  Minister  and  the  Secretary  of  Education,  if 

dialects and languages of each islands can be included in this Master Plan and to be taught in our 

schools.  The schools in the Northern Group islands to teach their island languages, the islands in 

the Southern Group to each their dialects and even on Rarotonga, to teach their dialect. 

</span></div>
<div><span>For example, the Pukapuka language to be taught from Grade 1 to Form 2 on the island.  I was 

told by one of the Members that the language spoken in Mangaia is  a total  mixture.  So, I  am 

asking the Minister and  the Secretary of Education to  include our islands dialects  in  your new 

Master Plan.  The Northern Group languages, the Southern Group and the Rarotonga dialects to 

be taught in our schools. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question to the Minister is, whether this request can be included in your new Education Master 

Plan for the next 10 years?
