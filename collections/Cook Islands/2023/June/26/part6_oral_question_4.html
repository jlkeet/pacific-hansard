<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister for your answer 

to my question.  I believe that this is an important question because we were just discussing about 

the Vote Item for this Ministry. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question now Mr Speaker is to the Minister of Education.  According to the Report sent to the 

Public Service Commission, it is a g</span><span>ood Report because it is classified as ‘unmodified’.  According 

</span><span>to this Report, their Strategic Master plan for the schools will come to an end in 2023. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The  question  to  the  Minister  is,  what  is  your  Master  Plan  that  you  have  for  the  future  of  our 

education? 

</span></div>
