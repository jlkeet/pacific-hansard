which is for half an hour.  Before Question Time expired last Friday, the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa 

</span><span>put a question to the Prime Minister and the question was, if the Prime Minister can explain the 

</span><span>nature of the conference that the Minister of Cultural Development is attending, together with the
