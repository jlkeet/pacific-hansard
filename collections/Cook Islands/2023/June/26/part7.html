<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Standing Order 48 (1).   

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Appropriation Bill 2023 </span><span>–</span><span> Consideration in Detail, Day 4  

</span></div><div><span>We are now on the Vote Item for the Ministry of Education and that will be for an hour and a half 

hour or less.  I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,491,271 for Education stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open.  I see the Honourable Member Robert Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone in this Honourable House; 

the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Members  of  the  Government  side,  Kia 

Orana.  To this side of the House (Opposition side), the three Leaders and Members of Parliament, 

Kia Orana to you also. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give my views on the Vote Item of the Ministry of Education.  I do not really support 

this allocation for this reason.  First, I would like to say that we are having some problems in the 

two schools in my village, Arorangi and Rutaki schools. 

</span></div><div><span>Last year, there was an allocation of $33,000 for the renovation of Apii Nikao.  We know that in 

2018, $14 million was spent on this school.  The problem we are facing today is the parents in our 

village  are  taking  their  children  to  the  schools  in  Te-Au-o-Tonga.    The  reason  for  this  is  the 

classrooms and school yard is not up to standard in these two schools in Arorangi.  Several requests 

have been made in the past but our requests have not been granted. 

</span></div><div><span>What I understand is the more students you have attending school, more money will be granted to 

</span><span>that school.   That  could  be the case today  where funds will be provided  to  schools with  many 

</span><span>students.  We cannot blame the parents because they are the ones that decides where to take their 

children to for a good education. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, I know that one of the early childhood classes are closing at Arorangi School and these 

children are now attending Black Rock and Apii Nikao.  I am very sad to see this because it appears 

that our two schools in Arorangi are not being supported. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, I have to interrupt you.

</span></div><div><span>Before I acknowledge the Governor General, I would like all Honourable Members to stand later 

when I finish acknowledging the Governor General.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge the presence of our special guest in the Public Gallery this afternoon, 

the Australian Governor General, His Excellency David Hurley.  It gives me great pleasure and 

honour to welcome  you to this Honourable House today Your Excellency and your good wife, 

Honourable Linda Hurley, along with your Delegations and the Australian High Commissioner, 

Ms Phoebe Smith.  Together with the Members of Parliament of this Honourable House and staff 

of Parliament, I convey to you a warm Kia Orana and greetings in the Mighty Name of our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>I bid  you  good wishes as  you continue with the rest of  your official businesses today and may 

success and prosperity follow you wherever you go.   

</span></div><div><span>Good luck and Kia Manuia.  I would like to ask the Honourable Prime Minister and the Leader of 

the Opposition to accompany me to the Public Gallery area. 

</span></div><div><span>It is time to suspend for lunch.  We will continue with our business when we return from lunch.  

This Sitting is suspended until 3.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.42 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.30 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Please  be  seated.    Before  we  took  our  lunch  break,  the  Honourable  Robert 

Heather was speaking.  

</span></div><div><span>So, I give the Floor to him to continue with his speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  R.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  have  a  question  to  ask  you,  because  you 

</span><span>interrupted my speaking time, will you be giving me an extra 10 minutes to speak? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  That is not a problem.  When you are ready, I will give you three minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>Thank you.  I would like to quote from the Ministry of Education’s Vote 

</span><span>Item description, </span><span>“equitable, access to education of high quality.”  </span></div><div><span>Under  that  section,  it  is  written,</span><span>“To  build  the  skills,  knowledge,  attitudes  and  values  of  Cook 

</span><span>Islanders.”</span></div><div><span>325

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 26 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I believe Mr Speaker that these quotation from the budget book goes with the thoughts that I am 

bringing to the House today.  There is an issue I see taking place in Arorangi and I believe the rest 

of our island nation.  The issue is, there is no internet or wifi accessible in our Arorangi School.  

Unfortunately, the teachers that are using their personal data to access internet during the IT subject 

period of study. 

</span></div><div><span>And also, in regards to the infrastructure of our school.  Our classrooms are leaking through the 

roof during stormy and rainy days.  This problem is not a current problem, it has been for over five 

years now.  The question we must ask ourselves is how our children is going to learn properly with 

all these distractions taking place around them. 

</span></div><div><span>We must remember that our schools have prepared many of our people who became Members of 

Parliament, lawyers and many good business people in our country.  The request here is, for our 

schools to be assisted properly with these requirements; the WIFI and the infrastructure to enable 

our children to learn properly and to be cared for. 

</span></div><div><span>I support the request for the subject of our languages to be taught in our schools and the Ministry 

of Education should partner with the Ministry of Cultural Development on this vitally important 

learning of our identity.  Even in our village, our language can be taught or can be practiced at 

Sunday Schools.  But the best place to teach our children with our languages should have started 

in our homes. 

</span></div><div><span>To  end  my  speech,  I  would  like  to  encourage  our  Government  through  the  Minister  and  the 

Secretary of Education to look at the needs of our schools and children.  I only support this Vote 

Item partially, not fully.  Maybe in the near future, my concerns for our schools, even the Arorangi 

school can be attended to and make things better.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I express my views on this Vote Item for the 

</span><span>Ministry of Education, I would like to encourage the Honourable Members for Ngatangiia and 

Titikaveka, Tukaka Ama and Sonny Williams, to show their support for our young drummers who 

will be competing at the drumming competition this Friday because we have children who have 

entered this drumming competition.  I am referring to the Takitumu Primary School drumming 

team. 

</span></div><div><span>This school drumming team includes all the levels of the primary school from grade 1 to grade 6.  

</span><span>The other levels of the schools like Form 1 to Form 7 will be part of this drumming competition.  

</span><span>That is why  I am proud to state that the Takitumu Primary School drumming team is from the 

lowest level in our schools; they are brave to compete even with the older school children.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 26 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, coming back to the Vote Item for the Ministry of Education.  My views are different 

</span><span>from the Member of Akaoa.  My first thought is that I support this Vote Item’s allocation.</span></div><div><span>I have listened and have taken notes to the issues raised by the Member of Akaoa; I took notes of 

the allocations in this Vote Item for Output 1, 2, and 4.  In these Outputs, there is an allocation 

which  I  believe  will  help  the  suggestion  that  the  Honourable  Member  for  Akaoa  was  putting 

forward, especially the issues in our schools. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when you consider Output 1, the administrative funding, under that allocation, there 

is  an  appropriation  of  $876,628.    In  Output  2,  for  administrative  funding,  the  appropriation  is 

$2,514,397.  Now, when we look at Output 4, also under administrative funding, the appropriation 

is $800,952.  Mr Speaker, despite of these funds being allocated to certain areas, the purpose for 

these funds are for school administration. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, if we look at Output 4, the amount of funds in this Output can be used to help our 

schools in our country.  The Honourable Member Robert Heather spoke about Rutaki and Arorangi 

Primary  Schools.    I  believe  the  Minister  and  the  Secretary  of  Education  can  work  around  this 

allocation to help the schools mentioned.  Output 4 lists the areas that these funds are appropriated 

for. 

</span></div><div><span>It says, </span><span>“Output 4 </span><span>- </span><span>infrastructure and support funding appropriation.”</span></div><div><span>I believe we all understand what this appropriation is about.  Here it refers to, infrastructure, which 

means, an allocation to assist the infrastructure of the schools.  It is covered under Output 4. 

</span></div><div><span>I come back to the allocations of Output 1.  Output 1 is reserved to promote our </span><span>maori </span><span>language, 

as stated in this budget book, </span><span>“national monitoring of Maori Literacy.”</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, if we look at Output 4, it is written here that this amount of funds can be used to help 

</span><span>the need of our schools in the country.  The Honourable Member Robert Heather in his speech was 

specifically referring to the Rutaki and Arorangi Primary Schools.  I believe the Minister and the 

Secretary of Education can look at this allocation to help the schools mentioned.  Output 4 list the 

area it is appropriated to be used. 

</span></div><div><span>It says, “Output 4 </span><span>- </span><span>infrastructure and support funding appropriation.”  </span><span>I think we are clear on the 

meaning  of  this  because  it  says  infrastructure,  which  means  there  is  an  allocation,  which  can 

</span><span>improve the problem areas in these schools.   In addition, set out in the Program Mr Speaker is an 

</span><span>indication that this allocation provides the assistance under Output 4.   

</span></div><div><span>327 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 26 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I now come back to the allocation under Output 1 because the preservation of our </span><span>maori</span><span> language 

is under this Output which says the National monitoring of </span><span>maori</span><span> literacies.  I think then, it is only 

right that within this Ten Year Master Plan, we incorporate as a way to strengthen our language 

for the Northern Group languages and as well as our Southern Group languages.  

</span></div><div><span>That has been one of the key thoughts in the years gone by.  Mr Speaker, all the Programs they 

have laid out are very important programs on their Outputs from 1 to 4.  Although some of the 

increases are for personnel, it is fitting because it is about time they have a wage increase.  We 

know that the hold up for the wage increase was the result of the COVID pandemic back then.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> I will interrupt you Honourable Member. You time is up. Thank you.  I can see 

the Honourable Member Tukaka Ama you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. AMA: </span><span> Mr Speaker, Members of this House Kia Orana.  I cannot just sit down listening 

to the debate; I have to stand up because there are five schools within my constituency.  I also want 

to  support  this  Vote  Item.    The  names  of  the  schools  are  Akatemia  School,  Takitumu  Primary 

School, Te Uki Ou School, Cook Islands Trade Training Institute and a new school started by Pa 

Ariki called the Takitumu Performing Arts School, otherwise known as Te Vananga Are Tapere o 

Takitumu.  

</span></div><div><span>I am also happy for the support given by the Minister on our drumming traditions to which I and 

the Honourable Members Vaitoti Tupa and Sonny Williams has a keen interest in.  During my 

discussion with the Minister of Education, we raised some of the traditional ideas that could be 

included in all our schools.  We can see that the Takitumu Performing Arts School is teaching all 

our traditions and customs in Takitumu.  The Minister besides the Secretary of Education both 

supported my request and ideas.  One idea of mine is to set aside one day in a week just to teach 

our traditions and customs.  I cannot see any barriers in this because we can see that whenever 

there is a sporting event or any other event, a day is readily given for the event to take place.  So, 

I cannot see where the wrong is if we nominate one day a week to teach our children about our 

</span><span>tradition and customs. 

</span></div><div><span>To  me,  a  lot  can  be  achieved  in  that  single  day.    From  the  morning,  lessons  can  cover  </span><span>maori 

</span><span>speaking, drumming, weaving and so forth for one day.  We can also teach them about the structure 

of our ariki and mataiapo lineages because the children nowadays do not know who is Pa Ariki, 

Kainuku or even Tinomona.  

</span></div><div><span>I recall in my early days when I went to school, we learnt songs about traditional leaders in our 

</span><span>districts.  I also recall during my time, by the time you leave school, your knowledge of who the 

</span><span>traditional chiefs are becomes second nature.  But today, only a few children knows it.

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 26 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I know there are some who will say that there is no allocation to train our children on our traditions, 

I will say it does not matter because we have many teachers capable of teaching our children in 

this field.  We have been talking about this repeatedly on how we should teach our children on our 

traditions.   

</span></div><div><span>I truly support at what the Member Robert Heather was saying that everything starts in the home.  

Let us not just rely on the education system to teach everything to our children.  We have to teach 

our  children  from  home  before  they  go  to  school  to  learn  about  reading,  writing  and  speaking 

English.    Therefore,  those  are  my  thoughts  on  this  Vote  Item  and  I  commend  the  Minister  of 

Education  together  with  the  Secretary  of  Education  for  our  discussions  on  the  benefits  for  our 

children.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I can see the Honourable Agnes Armstrong; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS. A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everybody in the House today.  

I just wanted to speak briefly on the Education allocation for the Pa Enua.  

</span></div><div><span>It is disappointing to see that the budget for Education has been cut but it is what it is and we have 

to work with it.  But especially, I would hope that the cut does not jeopardise education in the Pa 

Enua  and  this  does  not  affect  the  allocation,  process  and  distribution  of  educational  materials, 

resources designated for the Pa Enua schools, teachers and students alike.  

</span></div><div><span>Over the last few years, we have noticed the lack of resources and upskilling of our teachers in the 

Pa Enua and we have heard in this House the request for the Teachers Training College to be re-

established. 

</span></div><div><span>We can look at potential teachers from the Pa Enua to come to the Training College and help out 

with our labour shortage in this area. 

</span></div><div><span>It has also been identified or talked about that the basic training schools in the school have sort of 

in these last few years have been left behind with the new curriculum that has been passed or that 

is in the schools now because of technology. 

</span></div><div><span>The basic training or basic teaching skills such as time tables, reading and the likes are the basics 

for our young people and this I think we should try and reinstate in our schools to bring up the 

standard plus the basic skills of home craft because not everyone can be lawyers, politicians or 

</span><span>doctors.  So, we need these basic skills in our Nation. 

</span></div><div><span>329 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 26 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We have heard that the Education Department is going around with the Master Plan consultation 

to the Pa Enua and one of the big future teaching skills that they are pushing is online teaching.  

</span><span>So, here is another issue in having our teachers’ upskilled to ensure that they are capable of using 

</span><span>this tool of technology to maximize the learning in the classroom. 

</span></div><div><span>This also poses another issue in the Pa Enua is the poor internet connectivity.  As we all know the 

Pa Enua connectivity is not that great so, this is an area that we need to improve on so it does not 

compromise the online learning. 

</span></div><div><span>NCEA exams will no longer be paper exams and these will be online so this is an issue that we 

need to address and that is the internet connectivity which also needs to have upskilled people in 

the Pa Enua in the IT person. 

</span></div><div><span>These are the major issues that I foresee in the near future for our education and I think these are 

things that we should look at as a Nation to help our people in the Pa Enua. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to give my thoughts on this Vote 

</span><span>Item but first I just want to congratulate the Ministry.  Yes, it has had an ‘unqualified’ Audit Report 

</span><span>for the last successive nine years.  That is a very rare thing in Government Ministries and I think 

it fares well for the Secretary of Education and her staff. 

</span></div><div><span>The other day I also congratulated the Minister of Education for the way that the schools culture 

festivals have been run and I am not sure whether there are funds in your budget or whether it is 

</span><span>in the Ministry of Cultural Development’ budget, but I think there is a very strong feeling there 

</span><span>that perhaps we should direct the funds to bringing in the schools in the Pa Enua to celebrate the 

schools culture festival.  I attended the festival here and it was very, very enjoyable. 

</span></div><div><span>I  note  from  the  Budget  that  the  Ministry  of  Education  was  in  the  group  that  received  some 

increases.  The increases accommodated the minimum wage increase for the private schools, the 

minimum  wage  adjustment  approved  for  private  and  public  schools  and  the  $150  thousand 

personnel increase for 2023/24. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  for  the  last  three  or  four  years,  I  have  been  an  advocate  of  teachers  being  properly 

remunerated.  The issues for me were education and health.  I felt that our teachers and our health 

</span><span>workers were severely underpaid.  And while this is a small amount, it is nevertheless an indication 

</span><span>of the direction that Government is moving and giving the teachers in their tranche 3, an increase.

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 26 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>And why is education important?  It is important because that is where we get our future leaders 

from.  We provide good education, or children will move along the right path and become leaders 

in their day. 

</span></div><div><span>I  agree  with  previous  speakers  that  advocates  that  education  starts  in  the  home  and  when  the 

children  go  to  school,  that  is  an  additional  education  for  them  and  we  parents  should  be 

encouraging  the  children  to  go  to  school  and  do  whatever  we  can  to  assist  them  with  their 

homework. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, in today’s Cook Islands News, there is a letter to the Editor written by Sammy Mataroa and 

</span><span>I think it is a good letter.  Any letter, critical letter is good in my view.  He is not only being critical, 

he is also offering some suggestions to improve and it is suggestions like that or letters like that, 

that we should pay a lot of attention to. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I want to talk about the Rakahanga School.  It is no secret that the roll has dropped from I 

think previously 21 to  about  14 or 15 today  and  I heard the Member for Akaoa talk  about  the 

infrastructure or the lack of infrastructure work in the Rutaki and Arorangi Schools.   

</span></div><div><span>In  the  Pa  Enua  or  certainly  in  Rakahanga,  that  is  something  that  is  the  responsibility  either  of 

Infrastructure  or  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  or  the  two.    While  it  is  not  a  direct 

responsibility of Education, I would imagine that Education should be interested to query whether 

the children are being educated in proper environment and proper buildings. 

</span></div><div><span>I say this because for the last four years, there’s been delegations going to Rakahanga to list the 

</span><span>items or the materials that is needed for the school and of course one of the repair work that was 

targeted was the re-roofing of the school. 

</span></div><div><span>First we have the list compiled and then we have the equipment and materials ordered.  And then 

we had it shipped and then it did not arrive, so that the building is still there not repaired and the 

</span><span>old roofing is still there. 

</span></div><div><span>But unlike Arorangi and Rutaki s</span><span>chools the children in Rakahanga don’t have another school to 

</span><span>go to.  So, they  remain  being  taught  in  the same building that  requires repairs.   And what  has 

helped  the  school  in  the  meantime,  we  have  a  Northern  Group  Education  Trust  and  that  trust 

provides allowances for Northern Group students, small allowances like when they start going to 

Tereora College.  And they also get a term small allowance and each school gets an amount that 

is provided by the trust for anything to do with the school. 

</span></div><div><span>And so, the principals of the Northern Group Islands put in an application for fundings each year.  

And  I know in  Rakahanga, the trust  has provided the school  with  sufficient  funds to  put  basic

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>things like a sink and tap to wash the children hands, and things like baking dishes for their cookery 

classes in Rakahanga.   

</span></div><div><span>I am not sure Minister whether these matters are reported to Education, but these are the assistance 

that the Northern Group and only the Northern Group gets from the Northern Group Education 

Trust. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    I  have  to  interrupt  you  Honourable  Member  as  your  time  is  up.    I  see  the 

Honourable Minister for the Ministry of Education; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I am pleased to present the Education Budget 

and would like to thank those Members who spoke strongly in support of this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>Education  is  the  fundamental  pillar  of  development  in  any  nation  and  investing  in  this  sector 

remains a top priority for the government of the day.  This budget is additionally a reflective of 

</span><span>this year’s budget theme of nurturing a nation.</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  budget  appropriation  for  the  Education  sector  for  the  next  financial  year  is 

$20,491,271.  It is the third largest Government appropriation behind MFEM and Te Marae Ora.  

And to clarify to our Members, the Ministry of Education as a whole did not receive any budget 

cut, but receive an extra $11,000 increment. 

</span></div><div><span>The  medium-term  expenditure  ceiling  for  the  Ministry  of  Education  will  ensure  our  financial 

support reaches all Cook Islands learners whether across our 31 schools or those studying within 

our vocational and tertiary providers and more importantly, our people delivering educations such 

as our teachers, tutors, aides and education staff. 

</span></div><div><span>And on that note, I would like to acknowledge and thanks the Secretary of Education, Ms Danielle 

Cochrane and her good stuff at the Ministry of Education.  Mr Speaker as mentioned before we 

</span><span>have come a long way in recent years to improve teachers’ salaries but we it is still a long way to 

</span><span>go. 

</span></div><div><span>This education budget for 2023 ensures that the Ministry of Education can continue to honour the 

</span><span>teacher’s  remuneration  adjustment.    This  was  commenced  in  September  2021  and  best  third 

</span><span>tranche valued at $150,000 will be rolled out in the next budget.  Since 2021, a total of $936,344 

</span><span>across both Government and private school teachers has been accorded as the teachers’ salaries at 

</span><span>the Ministry and the Ministry of Education will continue to work with partner agency and mainly 

</span><span>with the Ministry of Finance that the level of sustainability when recognizing teacher qualification 

</span><span>and years of service.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  we  have  mentioned  about  current  school  infrastructure  suffered  by  some  of  the 

classroom.  A critical assessment conducted by both the CIIC and the Ministry of Education in 

April  this  year.    An  estimate  of  approximately  $2.5  million  worth  of  infrastructure  repair  and 

maintenance is needed.  And to date with CIIC the following project have been completed.  And 

unfortunately, Apii Rakahanga is not on this list. 

</span></div><div><span>Apii  Nassau  toilets,  Apii  Araura,  Mitiaro  and  Mangaia  renovations  and  improve  wash  facility, 

Apii  Arorangi  toilets,  Apii  Tetautua  electrical  upgrade  and  refurbishment.    Apii  Nikao  sound 

proofing,  and  in  relation  to  the  iron  roofing  mentioned  by  the  Member  of  Parliament  for 

Rakahanga, those materials are currently sitting at the Avatiu harbour and it will be leaving for 

Rakahanga at the next shipment and Rakahanga school will be a priority for this government. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, within the Ministry of Education</span><span>’s budget we are also providing additional operating 

</span><span>budget to schools reflecting recent changes in the school operating policy.  This change will mean 

there will be a $25 per student increment across the board.  I suspect this is where the Member of 

Ivirua is highlighting that there is a slight decrease in some of the Outer Islands operational budget. 

</span></div><div><span>It is because the number of school rolls has reduced and budget to the Outer Islands schools is 

based on the number of students.  The Member of Ivirua have highlighted about the challenges of 

NCEA  about  going  online.    $60,000  of  operating  and  a  further  one-off  budget  of  $100,000  of 

CAPEX will be invested to extend the scope of digital devices and IT integration. 

</span></div><div><span>With the sustain CAPEX budget of $300,000 the Ministry will continue to priorities IT devices 

and  equipment  as  well  as  school  furniture  replacement.    It  was  also  mentioned  about  Internet 

Connectivity.    Collaborations  with  Vodafone  Cook  Islands  and  key  agencies  to  ensure  IT  in 

education remains safeguarded continuous.  Working with Vodafone will ensure that our schools 

and providers will continue to utilize uncapped date services as a feature of learning in the Cook 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  my  understanding,  Government  has  also  allocated  a  sum  of  about  $200,000  to 

</span><span>Vodafone to improve all Outer Islands to have the capacity of 4G.  

</span></div><div><span>Amongst other education initiative is a further extension of our Pa Enua Scholarship Grant.  We 

have  currently  36  Pa  Enua  scholars  continuing  their  senior  level  studies  in  Rarotonga.    This 

Government and this Ministry will continue to support the scholarships from the Pa Enua.  Rest 

assured,  the  comments  raised  on  the  Floor  last  week  and  this  week  urging  for  more  dedicated 

learning  to  be  incorporated  such  as  our  </span><span>reo,  </span><span>traditional  knowledge  and  practices,  IT  and 

</span><span>technology, trends and career pathways, these have all been heard.  Our curriculum is already at 

</span><span>full capacity but it is structured in a way to provide our teachers with flexibility of achievements

</span></div><div><span>and  learning  of  outcomes  to  </span><span>areas  of  students’  interest.    New  trends  as  mentioned  before 

</span><span>technologies and advances can be incorporated.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there has been some statements made about our 10-Year Master Plan and what this 

next  strategy  provides  is  an  opportunity  for  ourselves  and  our  community  to  put  forward  our 

aspirations which will further decide what learning will look like for the Cook Islands student.  As 

Minister of Education, I am excited about the strategies potential.  Mr Speaker, earlier in the week, 

the Member of Parliament for Matavera highlighted the shortage of teachers within the Ministry.  

I now have the official version in front of me.  Instead of 27, we have 25 vacancies and of these 

25, there are 12 teaching positions and 6 teacher-aides and the other 13  comes  from  vacancies 

within the Ministry of Education headquarters and for the CITTI tutor position.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there is also mention to reintroduce our Teachers Training College.  It is in the best 

</span><span>interest  of  the  Cook  Islands  that  teacher’s  education  be  </span><span>delivered  through  an  accredited  higher 

</span><span>education provider.  This is so that the given minimum qualification for teachers is at a Bachelor’s 

</span><span>Degree.  For those who train to become a teacher, they will be awarded a degree for studying at 

the university.  The Ministry of Education is currently working with the University of the South 

Pacific to ensure that our three-year bachelor of education program will become our accreditation.  

This opportunity will allow our school leavers and those wishing to retrain or diversify their skills 

to complete their degree qualifications domestically or by extension studies.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  in  conclusion,  I  thank  all  your  support  for  the  proposed  budget  for  the  Education 

sector.  This investment will not only lead to vast improvements in education quality but will also 

benefit the nation as well by shaping and equipping future generations with the knowledge and 

skills needed to succeed.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,491,271 for Education stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
