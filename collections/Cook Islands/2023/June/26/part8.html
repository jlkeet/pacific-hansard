</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $2,472,783 for Environment stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, I would like to commend the Minister for the 

National  Environment  Services  because  he  is  instrumental  in  increasing  the  appropriation  for 

Environment.  It is not only about increasing the appropriation for Environment but also looking 

for some Environment officers in the Pa Enua.  I believe a lot of appropriation has been allocated 

</span><span>for the personnel’s in the Pa Enua, which adds up to $90,000. </span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, looking at the Budget Book, an increase of $50,000 has been allocated to cater for the 

National Environmental Policy.  In addition, related to that Mr Speaker is looking at the disposal 

of our waste.  Government had allocated $360,000 for 2023 and 2024 for ways of disposing old 

vehicles and white ware refuses.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  wish  to  tell  the  House  that  back  in  2010,  I,  Vaitoti  Tupa,  was  the  Head  of 

Environment and that was the first time a request was put forward to Government, if an allocation 

can be appropriated for the disposal of these old vehicles and white ware trashes.  I am happy that 

</span><span>it is now over 10 years’ and Government had allocated some money to dispos</span><span>e of these trashes.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Minister and Government have appropriated about $400,000 to find ways and 

means to protect our foreshore on Rarotonga and also Aitutaki.  If this Vote Item is passed this 

project will happen this year.  This is why I am happy to give my support for this appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a suggestion that I want to give to the Minister of Conservation and all Members of this 

House.  I am not running down the business who is bringing this into our country, I am not denying 

them of what they are doing but if it will be possible for Government to do anything about big 

companies importing big trucks, cars and other vehicles; but then there are also small companies 

importing vehicles as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  companies  like  Pickering  Motors,  Motor  Centre,  Raro  Cars,  they  are  importing 

vehicles  and  small  companies  are  also  importing  vehicles  into  our  country.    I  am  asking  Mr 

Speaker, if this can be controlled.   

</span></div><div><span>The problem here Mr Speaker is, when these cars are old and broken down, who is responsible for 

disposing of these cars?  Will they be responsible or will it be Government?  That is why I am 

happy that Government has allocated $360,000 for disposing of these wrecks and also whitewares.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I support the programs being run by the Environment Services.  I acknowledge the 

work being done by the Head of Environment Halatoa Fua and his staff.  The Director Halatoa has 

revived some of the programs that has not been completed.  

</span></div><div><span>One example is the program on bio-diversity.  I can see my time is up so I support this Vote Item 

and the work being carried out by the Environment Services.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  Vaitoti  Tupa  and  I  see  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  am  happy  with  this  Vote  Item  especially  the 

$360,000 that has been allocated for the removal of waste.  During the past couple of years, when 

you ring the Cook Islands General Transport, they will not collect your whiteware but they will 

tell you to keep it and maybe to wait for this to happen.  We know that if we leave the whiteware 

out in the rain, it becomes a breeding ground for mosquitos.  That is why I am happy that there is 

an allocation to make sure that these things will be removed and taken to the appropriate places. 

</span></div><div><span>However, as there has been no mention in the Budget Speech of the Prime Minister, I am then not 

sure if this $360,000 for removal will be extended to the Pa Enua because waste is not only on 

Rarotonga but there is plenty in the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Minister, if there is no allocation for removal of waste for the Pa Enua, will it be possible to 

also look at the Pa Enua and especially the island of Rakahanga?  I humbly ask that Rakahanga be 

included in the definition of Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>I am a bit unhappy because I am not sure where the Report from the Environment Services is or 

</span><span>when their Report is due.  If we look at Page 27 of the PAC Report, it says ‘report is in progress’ 

</span><span>so I am not sure what Report.  I would like to ask the Minister to please explain what year is being 

referred  to  as  in  progress.    Those  are  my  thoughts  on  this  Vote  Item  and  I  am  happy  for  the 

</span><span>allocation that has been set aside for the disposal of waste.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member for Rakahanga.  I see the Honourable Albert 

Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>If the Honourable Member from Rakahanga just give me some time to 

seek some clarification on the said Report that was referred to in the Budget Statement.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker, I stand here before you with a 10 page speech statement and statement or 

</span><span>speech  was  designed  in  a  way  which  was  pretty  much  to  convince  your  support  for  the 

Appropriation and the speech is riddled with so many beautiful words and statements.  I feel it is

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 26 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>a waste of effort to the speech writer if I do not read this 10 page speech.  But because I see the 

purpose  of  the  statement,  all  the  speech  was  designed  to  procure  your  support  for  the 

Appropriation.  But I can see that everyone in the House supports the proposed appropriation for 

NES. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I do not see any reason whatsoever to read this 10 page statement or speech.  What a waste of 

an effort.  But if I may say thank you to the Honourable Members for your support and I note we 

are just about to run out of time as well, Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>So if I may end by saying that on behalf of NES, thank you Ladies and Gentlemen for your support 

for our Appropriation for NES 2023/24.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I suggest you give a copy to each of the MPs.  

I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $2,472,783 for Environment stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have come to the end of our business for today.  Parliament will now 

adjourn until tomorrow Tuesday, 27</span><span>th</span><span> June at 1.00 p.m.  May I ask an Honourable Member to say 

our Closing Prayer please?

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Parliament is now adjourned.
