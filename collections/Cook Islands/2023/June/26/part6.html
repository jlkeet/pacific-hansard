<div><span>PRESENTATION OF PAPERS 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK AT THE TABLE:  </span><span>Standing Order 229 (2), I hereby present the following Papers: 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 69: 

</span></div><div><span>Management Report: 2019 </span><span>–</span><span> 2022 Financial Statement Audit for the 

Office of the Honourable Minister George Angene. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 70: 

</span></div><div><span>Financial Statement for the Office of the Leader of the Opposition 

for the Year Ended 30</span><span>th</span><span> June 2021. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 71: 

</span></div><div><span>Financial Statement for the Office of the Leader of the Opposition 

for the Year Ended 30</span><span>th</span><span> June 2022. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 229 (6), Paper No. 69 through to 71 are hereby classified 

for referral to the Public Accounts Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Clerk.  Honourable Members, we have now come to Question Time, 

which is for half an hour.  Before Question Time expired last Friday, the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa 

</span><span>put a question to the Prime Minister and the question was, if the Prime Minister can explain the 

</span><span>nature of the conference that the Minister of Cultural Development is attending, together with the 

Honourable Sonny Williams, in Noumea.  He understands how a nomination was made for the 

Cook Islands to chair the meeting.  Honourable Prime Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to all of us here this afternoon.  Thank 

you very much for the question.  Our two warriors left on the flight on Friday to attend what is a 

Pacific Countries Ministerial meeting on culture in Noumea.  As such, it is a senior level meeting 

</span><span>requiring ministerial participation and of the Minister of Cultural Development, the Honourable 

</span><span>George Angene who will be there in this meeting in his capacity as a Minister.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>However,  due  to  a  PERCA  investigation  currently  underway  in  the  Ministry  of  Cultural 

Development,  the  suspended  Secretary  of  Cultural  Development  cannot  attend  the  meeting  to 

support  the  Minister.    Therefore,  it  is  decided  that  a  senior  member  of  our  Caucus  would 

accompany the Minister to help him fulfill the roles, not just representing our country at Ministerial 

level,  but  also  chairing  the  meetings  and  that  is  of  course,  the  former  Head  of  the  Ministry  of 

Cultural  Development  and  now  the  Member  for  Titikaveka,  assisting  the  Minister  of  Cultural 

Development in this particular portfolio. 

</span></div><div><span>So, we feel that we will have very good strong representation at the political level Mr Speaker at 

</span><span>this  very  important  culture  Minister’s  meeting  which  is  currently  underway  in  Noum</span><span>ea,  New 

Caledonia.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti 

Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister for your answer 

to my question.  I believe that this is an important question because we were just discussing about 

the Vote Item for this Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>My question now Mr Speaker is to the Minister of Education.  According to the Report sent to the 

Public Service Commission, it is a g</span><span>ood Report because it is classified as ‘unmodified’.  According 

</span><span>to this Report, their Strategic Master plan for the schools will come to an end in 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>The  question  to  the  Minister  is,  what  is  your  Master  Plan  that  you  have  for  the  future  of  our 

education? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Honourable Speaker and all your staff of Parliament 

</span><span>this afternoon.  I would like to thank the Honourable Member for Matavera for his good question. 

</span></div><div><span>Just as I have mentioned earlier that this Master Plan that we are referring to is for the next 10 

years going forward.  As he had mentioned in his question, at the end of this year 2023 will be the 

end of the previous Master Plan.  Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Education have 

</span><span>been  doing  their  research,  consultation  and  planning  for  the  next  10  years’  Master  Plan.    The 

</span><span>proposal is for this Master Plan to be finalized and completed in November.   

</span></div><div><span>So, this is a plea to the public, if you have any recommendation to be included in the Ministry of 

</span><span>Education’s Master Plan.  Please go and see the Ministry of Education or attend the consultation

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>meetings that they are running in the villages.  That is my answer to the question and I hope that 

satisfied the Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see again the Member Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question.  Honourable Minister, 

you said that the Ministry of Education is working on the new Master Plan for the next 10 years.  

Mr Speaker, I have gone and study the allocation for the Ministry of Education and the distribution 

of their allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  propose  a  recommendation  to  the  Minister  and  the  Secretary  of  Education,  if 

dialects and languages of each islands can be included in this Master Plan and to be taught in our 

schools.  The schools in the Northern Group islands to teach their island languages, the islands in 

the Southern Group to each their dialects and even on Rarotonga, to teach their dialect. 

</span></div><div><span>For example, the Pukapuka language to be taught from Grade 1 to Form 2 on the island.  I was 

told by one of the Members that the language spoken in Mangaia is  a total  mixture.  So, I  am 

asking the Minister and  the Secretary of Education to  include our islands dialects  in  your new 

Master Plan.  The Northern Group languages, the Southern Group and the Rarotonga dialects to 

be taught in our schools. 

</span></div><div><span>The question to the Minister is, whether this request can be included in your new Education Master 

Plan for the next 10 years? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Honourable Minister, you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Just a few weeks ago, I was in New Zealand, I 

met up with Tauraki Rongo.  He explained to me their situation in New Zealand and one of their 

biggest problem is our mother tongue or our language.  They are looking at how they can find 

</span><span>ways to improve the way our people speaks our language, especially in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>I was happy because our leaders and Cook Islands people in New Zealand are trying to find ways 

as to how they can support our own people in speaking or using our own language.  One solution 

is to involve our young people in the Maire Nui festival. 

</span></div><div><span>In our newspaper this morning, the New Zealand Government have allocated about $13 million 

for the promotion of pacific island languages to be taught in the various pacific communities.  The 

</span><span>question that has been asked by the Member of Matavera is in line with what Tauraki Rongo in 

</span><span>New Zealand asked me.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I praised our people from Pukapuka because they have translated the Bible into their own island 

language.  So, that is a challenge that I would leave with all the other islands to translate the Bible 

</span><span>into  your  own  island’s  dialect  or  language.    </span><span>If  the  Pukapuka  community  have  done  their  own 

language translation, why can the rest of the islands not do the same?  Irrespective of that, the part 

that is played by the Ministry of Education is to incorporate into their curriculum all our languages 

spoken here.  We will try to encourage the education system on each individual islands to support 

their own language.  Without a doubt, I do believe that the Secretary for the Ministry of Education 

will support what I have said.  I do believe in what has been raised by the Member of Ngatangiia 

in regards to teaching our children on how to beat the drums because this support will all support 

our community in regards to our culture.  As I have already mentioned that in this 10-year Master 

Plan, the thought raised by the Member for Matavera will be incorporated.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I can see the Member Tim Varu; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. VARU: </span><span> Thank Mr Speaker.  Firstly, greetings to the staff of this House.  To the Prime 

Minister and Members on the Government side, to us the Opposition and our Leaders, Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Member for RAPPA.  But before I do so, if I can briefly 

explain on the foundation of my question. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, last  week Thursday, we saw that a tree fell onto the road in  the Member Albert’s 

</span><span>electorate and this also reflected what has happened in Puaikura.  We can see that the trees are now 

pruned and trimmed.  The fortunate thing  about  this fallen tree is  that no one was hurt.   Also, 

beginning of this year, a tree fell onto the road in front of the Cook Islands Christian Church.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to remind us Members in the House that just in case you and your family wants 

to  go  for  a  drive  around  the  island  and  a  tree  falls  on  you  or  your  vehicle,  as  Members  of 

Parliament, how would you feel?  The question to the Minister is, I believe that ICI is responsible 

</span><span>for the clearance of roadways?  All it is Mr Speaker is the safety of our people driving on the roads.  

</span><span>So, Mr Speaker, if the Minister can explain to the House whether this is the ICI’s responsibility to 

</span><span>trim the trees or is it the responsibility of the Member of Parliament from each constituencies?  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I can see the Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  SRF </span><span>–</span><span> the SRF for this Financial Year has increased and I am sure that 

</span><span>this is adequate to trim the trees on the sides of the road.  But Puaikura is fortunate because the 

</span><span>trimming came at no cost.  On a serious note, Mr Speaker, just for clarification, firstly the tree that 

</span><span>the Member was  referring to  fell in the Minister Mokoroa’s constituency and not mine.</span><span>  Some

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 26 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>problematic trees are the ones on the road at the Nikao Christian Church where a branch broke off 

and fell onto a car.  

</span></div><div><span>I commend Puaikura and the three Members of Parliament for taking the initiative to take care of 

this issue in their district from Tuoro to Toreaiva.  But to be absolutely clear to the Honourable 

</span><span>Member from Ruaau, under the current ICI Act, it is ICS’s responsibility to ensure the safety and 

</span><span>clearance  of  our  roads  around  the  island,  and  for  the  safe  keeping  of  our  roads  as  well.    That 

includes tree branches that impedes the right of way of the road.  

</span></div><div><span>Briefly, that answers the Honourable Members question.  But may I also add, we do have a small 

emergency fund within ICI that helps support this responsibility.  I must stress the point that this 

</span><span>fund is minimal and it is only drawn upon once an issue is brought to ICI’s at short notice.  But to 

</span><span>formulate a program  or  a works program  to  clear the roadway of these impending branches or 

trees, that is going to require a much larger budget or some form of fund in the future Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>Since the issue in Nikao a couple of months ago and after contracting T&amp;M to trim these trees in 

Nikao,  the  HOM  of  ICI  and  I  have  taken  a  closer  look  at  this  issue.    I  hope  that  answers  the 

</span><span>Members’ questi</span><span>on.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I can see the Leader of the Opposition; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister 

</span><span>of Immigration.  On the front page of today’s Cook Islan</span><span>ds Newspaper, we have an article there 

that  includes  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  the  Tourism  industry  chair.    I  will  shorten  my 

question, given that we are reliant on tourism to help us get out of a situation that we are in and 

the difficulties that has been explained that is being encountered by those in that industry.  My 

question to the Minister is that will there be an appetite on behalf of Government to have a good 

look or to review the Regulations that was passed as a result of the Principal Act that was passed 

</span><span>in 2021? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; our time is up. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, the short answer to this question is that I have spoken to my 

officials in the Ministry of Education to give me an explanation of why people do not understand 

these Regulations.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    We  have  come  to  the  end  of  our 

</span><span>Question Time and I would like to thank you Honourable Members.
