<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister 

</span><span>of Immigration.  On the front page of todayâ€™s Cook Islan</span><span>ds Newspaper, we have an article there 

that  includes  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  the  Tourism  industry  chair.    I  will  shorten  my 

question, given that we are reliant on tourism to help us get out of a situation that we are in and 

the difficulties that has been explained that is being encountered by those in that industry.  My 

question to the Minister is that will there be an appetite on behalf of Government to have a good 

look or to review the Regulations that was passed as a result of the Principal Act that was passed 

</span><span>in 2021? 

</span></div>
