<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to all of us here this afternoon.  Thank 

you very much for the question.  Our two warriors left on the flight on Friday to attend what is a 

Pacific Countries Ministerial meeting on culture in Noumea.  As such, it is a senior level meeting 

</span><span>requiring ministerial participation and of the Minister of Cultural Development, the Honourable 

</span><span>George Angene who will be there in this meeting in his capacity as a Minister.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>However,  due  to  a  PERCA  investigation  currently  underway  in  the  Ministry  of  Cultural 

Development,  the  suspended  Secretary  of  Cultural  Development  cannot  attend  the  meeting  to 

support  the  Minister.    Therefore,  it  is  decided  that  a  senior  member  of  our  Caucus  would 

accompany the Minister to help him fulfill the roles, not just representing our country at Ministerial 

level,  but  also  chairing  the  meetings  and  that  is  of  course,  the  former  Head  of  the  Ministry  of 

Cultural  Development  and  now  the  Member  for  Titikaveka,  assisting  the  Minister  of  Cultural 

Development in this particular portfolio. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, we feel that we will have very good strong representation at the political level Mr Speaker at 

</span><span>this  very  important  culture  Ministerâ€™s  meeting  which  is  currently  underway  in  Noum</span><span>ea,  New 

Caledonia.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
