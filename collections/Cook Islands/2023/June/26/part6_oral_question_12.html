<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>MR. T. VARU: </span><span> Thank Mr Speaker.  Firstly, greetings to the staff of this House.  To the Prime 

Minister and Members on the Government side, to us the Opposition and our Leaders, Kia Orana.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Member for RAPPA.  But before I do so, if I can briefly 

explain on the foundation of my question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, last  week Thursday, we saw that a tree fell onto the road in  the Member Albert’s 

</span><span>electorate and this also reflected what has happened in Puaikura.  We can see that the trees are now 

pruned and trimmed.  The fortunate thing  about  this fallen tree is  that no one was hurt.   Also, 

beginning of this year, a tree fell onto the road in front of the Cook Islands Christian Church.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to remind us Members in the House that just in case you and your family wants 

to  go  for  a  drive  around  the  island  and  a  tree  falls  on  you  or  your  vehicle,  as  Members  of 

Parliament, how would you feel?  The question to the Minister is, I believe that ICI is responsible 

</span><span>for the clearance of roadways?  All it is Mr Speaker is the safety of our people driving on the roads.  

</span><span>So, Mr Speaker, if the Minister can explain to the House whether this is the ICI’s responsibility to 

</span><span>trim the trees or is it the responsibility of the Member of Parliament from each constituencies?  

Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I can see the Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  SRF </span><span>–</span><span> the SRF for this Financial Year has increased and I am sure that 

</span><span>this is adequate to trim the trees on the sides of the road.  But Puaikura is fortunate because the 

</span><span>trimming came at no cost.  On a serious note, Mr Speaker, just for clarification, firstly the tree that 

</span><span>the Member was  referring to  fell in the Minister Mokoroa’s constituency and not mine.</span><span>  Some

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>problematic trees are the ones on the road at the Nikao Christian Church where a branch broke off 

and fell onto a car.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I commend Puaikura and the three Members of Parliament for taking the initiative to take care of 

this issue in their district from Tuoro to Toreaiva.  But to be absolutely clear to the Honourable 

</span><span>Member from Ruaau, under the current ICI Act, it is ICS’s responsibility to ensure the safety and 

</span><span>clearance  of  our  roads  around  the  island,  and  for  the  safe  keeping  of  our  roads  as  well.    That 

includes tree branches that impedes the right of way of the road.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Briefly, that answers the Honourable Members question.  But may I also add, we do have a small 

emergency fund within ICI that helps support this responsibility.  I must stress the point that this 

</span><span>fund is minimal and it is only drawn upon once an issue is brought to ICI’s at short notice.  But to 

</span><span>formulate a program  or  a works program  to  clear the roadway of these impending branches or 

trees, that is going to require a much larger budget or some form of fund in the future Mr Speaker.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Since the issue in Nikao a couple of months ago and after contracting T&amp;M to trim these trees in 

Nikao,  the  HOM  of  ICI  and  I  have  taken  a  closer  look  at  this  issue.    I  hope  that  answers  the 

</span><span>Members’ questi</span><span>on.
