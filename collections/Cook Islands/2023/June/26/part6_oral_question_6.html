<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Honourable Speaker and all your staff of Parliament 

</span><span>this afternoon.  I would like to thank the Honourable Member for Matavera for his good question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Just as I have mentioned earlier that this Master Plan that we are referring to is for the next 10 

years going forward.  As he had mentioned in his question, at the end of this year 2023 will be the 

end of the previous Master Plan.  Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Education have 

</span><span>been  doing  their  research,  consultation  and  planning  for  the  next  10  years’  Master  Plan.    The 

</span><span>proposal is for this Master Plan to be finalized and completed in November.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, this is a plea to the public, if you have any recommendation to be included in the Ministry of 

</span><span>Education’s Master Plan.  Please go and see the Ministry of Education or attend the consultation
