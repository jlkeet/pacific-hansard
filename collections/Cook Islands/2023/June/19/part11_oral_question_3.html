<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for Matavera for the 

question.  We recall during COVID when our boarders closed, the Government looked for ways 

to respond and to try and create an economic activity in the absence of any tourism industry.  One 

of the initiatives was to encourage people to use technology to try and find ways to be innovative 

and create business.  One of the ways Mr Speaker was to develop agriculture industries, but using 

new modern technology.  These were designed as support in terms of grant funding for individuals 

or entrepreneurs to be able to come up with some projects and I do believe that there was a number 

of our people who put forward applications to the Committee that was established to try and receive 

some of this grant funding to get their projects up and running. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now  those  were  one-off  fundings  that  we  have  in  terms  of  response.    We  know  that  once  our 

borders opened we shifted our focus to economic recovery.  So, the question is if I am right that 

</span><span>are  there  any  funding’s  going  towards  the  AgriTech  Sector  in  this  budget.  The  reports  on  the 

</span><span>AgriTech  funding  Mr  Speaker  are  available  to  any  Member  in  the  House  on  the  Ministry  of 

Finance MFEM website and the Members will be able to have a look at who received these funding 

and what sort of projects were developed.  

</span></div>
<div><span>However, in terms of what funding is available in this Budget towards AgriTech Mr Speaker, the 

budget  is  before  the  House  in  debate  and  the  Bill  before  the  House  in  debate  should  not  have 

questions asked for it in Question Time.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Teariki 

Heather, Leader of the United Party; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR. T. HEATHER: </span><span> Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker and to all of us in the House including our 

</span><span>people listening in.

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is directed to the Minister of ICI.  This is both a question and a request.  In January 

this year, the Arorangi Congregation commenced renovating their Church in hope to complete it 

before the commemoration of the 200 years of the arrival of Christianity.  That is the Arorangi 

Cook  Islands  Christian  Church,  called  Ziona  Tapu.    Last  week  and  unbeknown  to  me  and  the 

Ekalesia members, the Triad company was engaged to tarseal, I would say 70 metres of the road 

way in front of the Church.  

</span></div>
<div><span>If the Minister is aware that on the 22</span><span>nd</span><span> of this month, which is coming up this week, the Church 

will be opened Mr Speaker.  Our problem is, this is Gods House and for a very long time now, this 

House  is  now  being  renovated  and  about  three  weeks  ago,  the  opening  of  the  Church  was 

confirmed for the 22</span><span>nd</span><span> June 2023, which is coming up soon.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The opening will be at 5.00 p.m. on Thursday evening.  The program and decoration of the Church 

are done in the hope that this will last for a very long time.  This is what is happening in our village 

these days and this is a very big day for the House of God.  We all know that road tarsealing creates 

</span><span>a lot of dust and we are on the final coat of painting …. (Interrupted)</span></div>
