<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Tina  Pupue  Browne.    I  agree  with  you  and  first 

opportunity tomorrow, I will give the Floor to you and not the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  as  this  is  Question  Time,  I  think  the  problem  here  is  you  Honourable 

Members; your questions and answers are like stories.  It is up to you; you either ask your question, 

either a closed-ended question or open-ended question, so that we can get a simpler answer. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But then again, we Polynesians are not like Europeans who asks close-ended questions.  We like 

to tell long stories and when the answer is given, it comes with more stories.  We are different 

from the European ways and thinking.  Nevertheless, I will leave it to you to decide.  I feel sorry 

for the Leader of the Opposition because she did not have time to ask her question.  Therefore, 

Honourable Members, this is an encouragement to you all to be wise with our Question Time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So,  do  not  Point  of  Order  any  Member  who  have  the  Floor  because  it  will  complicate  our 

procedures.  Thank you Honourable Members. 

</span></div>
