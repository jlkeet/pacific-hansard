<div><span>OBITUARIES 

</span></div><div><span>We also have bereavement notices from the past few days and our first one, Mrs Maara Kenning, 

who is a hardworking individual of Titikaveka and Rarotonga also.  Her husband had also passed 

away, who is also a hardworking JP of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Second of all, our condolences to the family of Mr Takave Manea who had passed away last week.  

On behalf of the Cook Islands, we convey our condolences to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly,  to  Mama  Tapu  Temata  Andrew  from  Arorangi,  another  hardworking  individual  from 

Akaoa in Arorangi; may the Lord comfort you all during this time. 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth of all, our condolences to Mama Taria Tereva, wife of a former employee of Te Aponga 

Uira, please accept our sincerest condolences for the sudden passing of this Mama.  If I was to 

</span><span>announce the husbandâ€™s real nam</span><span>e, nobody will understand, hence why I used his nickname, Sluby, 

everyone will know who he is. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  to  the  families  of  our  beloved  who  had  passed  away,  we  would  like  to  convey  our 

deepest condolences to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask our Members of Parliament, for any bereaved members of your constituency, 

please bring them fourth so that our people will know that you still care for them.
