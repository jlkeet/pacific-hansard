<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON.  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    My  question  is  directed  to  the  Minister  of  ICI  and  it  goes  with  an 

explanation so he will understand the reason of my question, and not to the Minister of Corrective 

Services.    Continuing  with  my  line  of  questioning  is  whether  it  is  possible  to  delay  the  road 

tarsealing until after the opening of the Church?  I could see the Minister travelling up and down 

</span><span>the road yesterday.  Maybe he did not realise it is a Sunday and is a day of worship for us.   

</span></div>
<div><span>There are work machineries parked in the Church compound at Arorangi Mr Speaker.  The request 

Honourable  Minister  for  ICI  is,  if  it  is  possible  to  cease  the  sealing  today  and  remove  the 

machineries so we can carry on with setting up the Church for the Opening?  I am asking on behalf 

of the Congregation to cease the work and to pick up again on 25</span><span>th</span><span> June 2023.  This would then 

give us ample time to set up for the opening of the Church and then come on Thursday you will 

see what I am talking about.  That is my request Honourable Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor.
