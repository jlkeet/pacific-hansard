for your understanding. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I would like to convey our congratulations to Mr Papaterai William for being appointed 

as the new Editor of Debates for Parliament; may our Heavenly Father continue to bless you and 

provide you the knowledge and wisdom as you serve in your new role.  As you may have noticed, 

the Sub-</span><span>Editor of Debates’ position has been advertised.</span></div><div><span>Finally, we also o our congratulations to our Parliament IT Consultant, Mr Joe Wichman for being 

awarded  a  Certificate  of  Excellence  in  UAV  Piloting  Certification  from  Aviation  Training
