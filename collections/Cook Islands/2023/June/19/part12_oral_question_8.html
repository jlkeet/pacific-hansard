<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member;  I  was  happy  to  hear  your  views.    My 

suggestion to you is you go and sit in the middle of them. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I think we have come to the end of our Sitting for today.  I would like to thank you all for your 

contributions and thoughts that you have shared in regards to the Appropriation 2023/24.  Maybe 

it  was  good  to  refer  the  Appropriation  Bill  to  a  Committee  first  before  presenting  it  back  to 

Parliament. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Parliament will adjourn until 1.00 p.m. on Tuesday 20</span><span>th</span><span> June 2023. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to ask one Honourable Member to close our Sitting with a Prayer. 

</span></div>
