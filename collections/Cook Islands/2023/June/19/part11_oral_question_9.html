<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Before  I  respond  to  the  question  from  the  Honourable  Member  from 

Murienua, if I may Mr Speaker say a brief comment to you this afternoon.  If I may say, Kia Orana 

Mr Speaker and your staff this afternoon.  A Kia Orana to all of us in the House, to us Members 

of  Parliament  who  have  been  elected  to  serve  our  people.  Also,  Kia  Orana  to  all  our  people 

listening in to us this afternoon. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  in  respond  to  the  question  from  the  Honourable  Member,  may  I  give  a  short 

explanation so we can all be in the same picture of how this situation arose.  Mr Speaker, a few 

weeks ago, I was paid a visit by Mama Tinomona Ariki, accompanied by her orator Tere Taio and 

one of the Deacons of the Church, Smiley Heather.  This is the request by Mama Tinomona to me, 

</span><span>“My boy, is it possible with your approval if the road can be sealed in time for the upcoming 200</span><span>-

</span><span>year commemoration?”  I did not hesitate to reply Mr Speaker, straight away, I said “yes.” </span></div>
<div><span>I then asked Mama Tinomona that morning to give me at least a day in order for me to look into 

how this request will become a reality.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, the reason why I did not hesitated in responding is because when I looked at Mama 

Tinomona, I saw her as a Mama for all of Puaikura.  In my belief, her request was so influential.  

So, this is what happened.  As we know, I managed to speak to Chris Vaile of Triad, asking for 

assistance in request from Mama Tinomana.   

</span></div>
<div><span>However, during this discussio</span><span>n, I found out that one of Mama Tinomona’s Mataiapo had already 

</span><span>approached Chris Vaile for assistance on sealing the road.  This Mataiapo is one of the landowners 

of the quarry where the aggregates are being mined by Triad.  Chris Vaile assured me not to worry 

as there is an agreement between him and the Mataiapo to seal the road.  He also assured me that 

it will not cost the taxpayers a cent on the Mamas request for the road sealing. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is the plan Mr Speaker on this special request at this short notice; we have to act immediately 

</span><span>because there is not enough time for us to do this upgrade for this period.  This is the plan; ICI will 

</span><span>facilitate the program and we will manage the project using our ICI engineers to get this project 

done as requested by Tinomana Ariki.  TRIAD and Papa Tauei Solomona will take care of the rest 

of the project. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  this  is  our  current  situation  hence  we  had  started  immediately  because  there  is  not 

enough  time  to  do  this  work  in  preparation  for  the  200  Years  Celebration.    I  would  like  to 

apologise, not to the Honourable Member but to the village of Puaikura.  For any inconvenience 

</span><span>caused, please bear with me and I apologised for this was a request from Mama Tinomana Ariki.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>In  response  to  the  question  by  the  Honourable  Member,  Mr  Speaker,  initially  in  our  work 

programme, we were supposed to complete this project on Wednesday; however, I can see that 

there  is  a  delay  with  this  request.    I  hope  that  tomorrow,  we  will  finish  the  project  where  the 

machineries will be removed so that Puaikura will have time to celebrate the opening ceremonial 

of their Church.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I did not say that “we will try our best”, we will look at finishing this tomorrow.  After the Opening 

</span><span>Ceremony of our Church in Puaikura, we will come and complete the roadwork in time for the 200 

</span><span>years’ celebration.</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  I stand Mr Speaker to give my appreciation for the apology extended by the 

Minister of ICI for the problem on this project and thank him and his Ministry for their hard work 

on this project.  Thank you very much Honourable Minister, Kia Orana and God bless. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the 

Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Members  of  Parliament  on  the 

Government side, Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Cook Islands Party, Independent 

Members, Kia Orana.  To Members of Parliament on our side of the House, Democratic Party, 

United and One Cook  Islands Party, Kia  Orana to  you  all.  To the people of the Cook  Islands 

watching us on livestream and listening to our radio broadcast, Kia Orana.   

</span></div>
<div><span>First, I would like to extend our condolences to all the people that you Mr Speaker have read earlier 

that have passed away.  Firstly, to Mrs Maara Kenning, this mother is originally from Titikaveka 

but her home is in Avatiu, Panama.  She does not play netball for Avatiu but her children plays.  I 

</span><span>convey condolences to the Hosking family and families in Titikaveka. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, to Takave Manea, I heard you Mr Speaker saying that this gentleman is from Nga-Pu-

Toru.  I wish to correct you Mr Speaker because this man is from the Matauia family, from the 

line  of  William  Marsters  and  his  wife  Matauia,  a  lady  from  Penrhyn.    This  gentleman  is  a 

Palmerston and a Penrhyn gentleman.  My time is nearly up and I think you were talking about the 

wife.  Therefore, we would like to extend our condolences to this family because this is from my 

side of family, from the Matauia family. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Tapu Andrew.  Mama Tapu is a Rarotongan woman from the village of Arorangi but her 

husband is from my side of the family, my Aitutaki family.
