</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have now come to Question Time and Question Time is for half an hour.  

I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have a question for the Prime Minister.  You may not 

</span><span>be able to provide an answer today but I will ask the question.  I hope that you will have an answer 

tomorrow.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We all know that MFEM has many criteria and the one that I would like to enquire is AgriTech.  

This special fund have been appropriated for our people to borrow from it.  This funding was in 

our Budget for 2001-2002 and from 2002-2003.  However, as far as I can see, there is none in this 

Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>Can  the  Prime  Minister  please  explain  the  situation  of  this  appropriation  for  AgriTech?    Mr 

Speaker, our people wanted me to ask this question because they know that I am good at asking 

questions in Parliament and that is why I am asking this question Prime Minister.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister of the 

Cook Islands, Honourable Mark Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for Matavera for the 

question.  We recall during COVID when our boarders closed, the Government looked for ways 

to respond and to try and create an economic activity in the absence of any tourism industry.  One 

of the initiatives was to encourage people to use technology to try and find ways to be innovative 

and create business.  One of the ways Mr Speaker was to develop agriculture industries, but using 

new modern technology.  These were designed as support in terms of grant funding for individuals 

or entrepreneurs to be able to come up with some projects and I do believe that there was a number 

of our people who put forward applications to the Committee that was established to try and receive 

some of this grant funding to get their projects up and running. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  those  were  one-off  fundings  that  we  have  in  terms  of  response.    We  know  that  once  our 

borders opened we shifted our focus to economic recovery.  So, the question is if I am right that 

</span><span>are  there  any  funding’s  going  towards  the  AgriTech  Sector  in  this  budget.  The  reports  on  the 

</span><span>AgriTech  funding  Mr  Speaker  are  available  to  any  Member  in  the  House  on  the  Ministry  of 

Finance MFEM website and the Members will be able to have a look at who received these funding 

and what sort of projects were developed.  

</span></div><div><span>However, in terms of what funding is available in this Budget towards AgriTech Mr Speaker, the 

budget  is  before  the  House  in  debate  and  the  Bill  before  the  House  in  debate  should  not  have 

questions asked for it in Question Time.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Teariki 

Heather, Leader of the United Party; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. HEATHER: </span><span> Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker and to all of us in the House including our 

</span><span>people listening in.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My question is directed to the Minister of ICI.  This is both a question and a request.  In January 

this year, the Arorangi Congregation commenced renovating their Church in hope to complete it 

before the commemoration of the 200 years of the arrival of Christianity.  That is the Arorangi 

Cook  Islands  Christian  Church,  called  Ziona  Tapu.    Last  week  and  unbeknown  to  me  and  the 

Ekalesia members, the Triad company was engaged to tarseal, I would say 70 metres of the road 

way in front of the Church.  

</span></div><div><span>If the Minister is aware that on the 22</span><span>nd</span><span> of this month, which is coming up this week, the Church 

will be opened Mr Speaker.  Our problem is, this is Gods House and for a very long time now, this 

House  is  now  being  renovated  and  about  three  weeks  ago,  the  opening  of  the  Church  was 

confirmed for the 22</span><span>nd</span><span> June 2023, which is coming up soon.   

</span></div><div><span>The opening will be at 5.00 p.m. on Thursday evening.  The program and decoration of the Church 

are done in the hope that this will last for a very long time.  This is what is happening in our village 

these days and this is a very big day for the House of God.  We all know that road tarsealing creates 

</span><span>a lot of dust and we are on the final coat of painting …. (Interrupted)</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE: </span><span> Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order Honourable Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  It is Question Time and not story time.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    My  question  is  directed  to  the  Minister  of  ICI  and  it  goes  with  an 

explanation so he will understand the reason of my question, and not to the Minister of Corrective 

Services.    Continuing  with  my  line  of  questioning  is  whether  it  is  possible  to  delay  the  road 

tarsealing until after the opening of the Church?  I could see the Minister travelling up and down 

</span><span>the road yesterday.  Maybe he did not realise it is a Sunday and is a day of worship for us.   

</span></div><div><span>There are work machineries parked in the Church compound at Arorangi Mr Speaker.  The request 

Honourable  Minister  for  ICI  is,  if  it  is  possible  to  cease  the  sealing  today  and  remove  the 

machineries so we can carry on with setting up the Church for the Opening?  I am asking on behalf 

of the Congregation to cease the work and to pick up again on 25</span><span>th</span><span> June 2023.  This would then 

give us ample time to set up for the opening of the Church and then come on Thursday you will 

see what I am talking about.  That is my request Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Before  I  respond  to  the  question  from  the  Honourable  Member  from 

Murienua, if I may Mr Speaker say a brief comment to you this afternoon.  If I may say, Kia Orana 

Mr Speaker and your staff this afternoon.  A Kia Orana to all of us in the House, to us Members 

of  Parliament  who  have  been  elected  to  serve  our  people.  Also,  Kia  Orana  to  all  our  people 

listening in to us this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  in  respond  to  the  question  from  the  Honourable  Member,  may  I  give  a  short 

explanation so we can all be in the same picture of how this situation arose.  Mr Speaker, a few 

weeks ago, I was paid a visit by Mama Tinomona Ariki, accompanied by her orator Tere Taio and 

one of the Deacons of the Church, Smiley Heather.  This is the request by Mama Tinomona to me, 

</span><span>“My boy, is it possible with your approval if the road can be sealed in time for the upcoming 200</span><span>-

</span><span>year commemoration?”  I did not hesitate to reply Mr Speaker, straight away, I said “yes.” </span></div><div><span>I then asked Mama Tinomona that morning to give me at least a day in order for me to look into 

how this request will become a reality.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the reason why I did not hesitated in responding is because when I looked at Mama 

Tinomona, I saw her as a Mama for all of Puaikura.  In my belief, her request was so influential.  

So, this is what happened.  As we know, I managed to speak to Chris Vaile of Triad, asking for 

assistance in request from Mama Tinomana.   

</span></div><div><span>However, during this discussio</span><span>n, I found out that one of Mama Tinomona’s Mataiapo had already 

</span><span>approached Chris Vaile for assistance on sealing the road.  This Mataiapo is one of the landowners 

of the quarry where the aggregates are being mined by Triad.  Chris Vaile assured me not to worry 

as there is an agreement between him and the Mataiapo to seal the road.  He also assured me that 

it will not cost the taxpayers a cent on the Mamas request for the road sealing. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the plan Mr Speaker on this special request at this short notice; we have to act immediately 

</span><span>because there is not enough time for us to do this upgrade for this period.  This is the plan; ICI will 

</span><span>facilitate the program and we will manage the project using our ICI engineers to get this project 

done as requested by Tinomana Ariki.  TRIAD and Papa Tauei Solomona will take care of the rest 

of the project. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  this  is  our  current  situation  hence  we  had  started  immediately  because  there  is  not 

enough  time  to  do  this  work  in  preparation  for  the  200  Years  Celebration.    I  would  like  to 

apologise, not to the Honourable Member but to the village of Puaikura.  For any inconvenience 

</span><span>caused, please bear with me and I apologised for this was a request from Mama Tinomana Ariki.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>In  response  to  the  question  by  the  Honourable  Member,  Mr  Speaker,  initially  in  our  work 

programme, we were supposed to complete this project on Wednesday; however, I can see that 

there  is  a  delay  with  this  request.    I  hope  that  tomorrow,  we  will  finish  the  project  where  the 

machineries will be removed so that Puaikura will have time to celebrate the opening ceremonial 

of their Church.   

</span></div><div><span>I did not say that “we will try our best”, we will look at finishing this tomorrow.  After the Opening 

</span><span>Ceremony of our Church in Puaikura, we will come and complete the roadwork in time for the 200 

</span><span>years’ celebration.</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  I stand Mr Speaker to give my appreciation for the apology extended by the 

Minister of ICI for the problem on this project and thank him and his Ministry for their hard work 

on this project.  Thank you very much Honourable Minister, Kia Orana and God bless. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the 

Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Members  of  Parliament  on  the 

Government side, Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Cook Islands Party, Independent 

Members, Kia Orana.  To Members of Parliament on our side of the House, Democratic Party, 

United and One Cook  Islands Party, Kia  Orana to  you  all.  To the people of the Cook  Islands 

watching us on livestream and listening to our radio broadcast, Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>First, I would like to extend our condolences to all the people that you Mr Speaker have read earlier 

that have passed away.  Firstly, to Mrs Maara Kenning, this mother is originally from Titikaveka 

but her home is in Avatiu, Panama.  She does not play netball for Avatiu but her children plays.  I 

</span><span>convey condolences to the Hosking family and families in Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, to Takave Manea, I heard you Mr Speaker saying that this gentleman is from Nga-Pu-

Toru.  I wish to correct you Mr Speaker because this man is from the Matauia family, from the 

line  of  William  Marsters  and  his  wife  Matauia,  a  lady  from  Penrhyn.    This  gentleman  is  a 

Palmerston and a Penrhyn gentleman.  My time is nearly up and I think you were talking about the 

wife.  Therefore, we would like to extend our condolences to this family because this is from my 

side of family, from the Matauia family. 

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, Tapu Andrew.  Mama Tapu is a Rarotongan woman from the village of Arorangi but her 

husband is from my side of the family, my Aitutaki family.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 19 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My question is to the Prime Minister, sorry my time is running out.  I was in New Zealand last 

week;  it  was  officially  announced  that  New  Zealand  is  into  recession.    I  have  a  concern  but 

tomorrow, I will complete my question to you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Tina  Pupue  Browne.    I  agree  with  you  and  first 

opportunity tomorrow, I will give the Floor to you and not the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Members,  as  this  is  Question  Time,  I  think  the  problem  here  is  you  Honourable 

Members; your questions and answers are like stories.  It is up to you; you either ask your question, 

either a closed-ended question or open-ended question, so that we can get a simpler answer. 

</span></div><div><span>But then again, we Polynesians are not like Europeans who asks close-ended questions.  We like 

to tell long stories and when the answer is given, it comes with more stories.  We are different 

from the European ways and thinking.  Nevertheless, I will leave it to you to decide.  I feel sorry 

for the Leader of the Opposition because she did not have time to ask her question.  Therefore, 

Honourable Members, this is an encouragement to you all to be wise with our Question Time. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  do  not  Point  of  Order  any  Member  who  have  the  Floor  because  it  will  complicate  our 

procedures.  Thank you Honourable Members.
