<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister and thank you for the clarification.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Prime Minister, Mark Brown 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div>
<div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  now  open  the  Floor  to  Honourable  Members  to  speak  on  the  Principles  and  Merits  of  the 

Appropriation Bill 2023.  The Floor is open.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Vaitoti  Tupa,  as  mentioned  by  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  we  can  share  the 

speaking time from either side.  Are you allowing me to finish?  I see the Honourable Member 

Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  With regard to the Appropriation that is before this House 

to debate but firstly, may I have some time to speak to my Constituency?  Firstly, I want to greet 

my people in Matavera.  To our Church Ministers of the five Churches in Matavera, traditional 

leaders of Matavera and all the people of Matavera.  This village is traditionally known as the head 

of the fish of Tangiia.  Surely, it is correct that this village is the head of the fish of Tangiia because 

people who are well spoken derives from this village.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Secondly Mr Speaker, to the bereaved families of Matavera including the two deceased who had 

</span><span>been brought back from New Zealand and buried in Titikaveka, Papa Taki and his wife who is the 

sister of Anau Pukeiti.    This  couple is  one hardworking  couple  when they  used to  manage the 

Matavera Trades back in the olden days.  They supported the five denominations of Matavera, 

including Apii Takitumu.  They also supported families who had lost their loved ones in those 

days.  I, as Member of Parliament of your Constituency, would like to convey our condolences to 

you all.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, my thoughts on the Budget before the House.  Mr Speaker, I am not boasting about 

</span><span>myself but in the years that I have been in this Honourable House, I have been reading the Budget.  

I would like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister for giving us the opportunity to go through

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>each item that has been allocated.  Unlike the Appropriation Bill for 2022/23, they would give us 

the Budget on a Friday and expects us to debate on it on Monday.  I am not worried about myself 

but for the Members who did not have time to go through these Books especially the Members 

from  the  Outer  Islands.    I  believe  that  this  year,  they  had  plenty  of  time  to  go  through  each 

allocations for the Outer Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, in terms of the Principles and Merits of the Bill, as we can see, the Appropriation 

have reached about $300 million.  The Prime Minister also clarified the purpose of this $300+ 

million.  I was excited when he said that this budget will be of beneficial for our people.  It was 

not for Rarotonga only but for the Outer Islands as well. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank this Appropriation for what has been allocated in reconstructing our main 

road  of  Rarotonga.    In  this  budget,  I  can  see  that  the  roads  on  Rarotonga  will  continue  to  be 

improved.  I am very thankful to the Minister of ICI for the work that they have done on the roads 

in Matavera as we see that today. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Last year I asked the House and I also asked the Minister to try and complete the work on the road 

from Ngatangiia to Titikaveka and also eventually reaching Puaikura. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But in regards to some of the allocations for Ministries, I noticed that some Ministries was not 

given an increase in their budget.  Maybe there is a good reason why they did not get an increase 

because some of the reports that have been given to us, we can see some failure in them. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When  we  go  through  the  Budget  for  this  year,  you  will  see  the  Ministries  that  deserve  to  get 

increases in their budget.  There are some Ministries that need to perform better and this is the 

</span><span>same for SOE’s and other agencies and other</span><span>s.  Some agencies are performing well but there are 

</span><span>some agencies and SOE’s and some of them are big SOE’s but they are not performing well but 

</span><span>you will notice that the amount that has been allocated to them is a great number.  I do believe that 

these  State  Owned  Enterprises  will  improve  their  performance  because  of  the  notice  that  were 

</span><span>given to them. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to point out part of the allocation to what the Honourable Prime Minister had presented 

in developing projects, especially the Outer Islands.  There is an allocation for upgrading Nassau 

and the project in Aitutaki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  have  looked  at  the  Appropriation  for  this  year,  they  are  very  lucky  because  there  is  funding 

appropriated for them.  Maybe this is to complete the projects, I am not sure.  However, this project 

</span><span>needs to be completed because the funding belongs to the people.  Also Mr Speaker, the plan for 

</span><span>appropriating these funds for developing our country.  There are countries like New Zealand and

<div><span>Monday, 19 June 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>others that we should thank and we need to thank New Zealand for they have given us a sum of 

money to help the projects of this country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We also heard that the government of Australia is keen to give support in our developments.  We 

can also see in the Appropriation the support they are giving under these organisations. There is 

the funding under the Japanese Grant, the funding under Global Environment Facility Fund, the 

funding under the Indian Grant, we are also waiting whether the European Union will be funding 

our country again. I am talking about the European Union because today we are under the OECD.  

To enlighten our people, we under the OECD qualifies as a Developed Country in terms of our 

economic status.  So, I then believe that the European Union will look into how they will be able 

to give funding to our country.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I appreciate the allocations in this Appropriation concerning the businesses on the 

Rarotonga.  We know during this time of the steady increase in our economy.  I am appreciative 

of the business on Rarotonga and not only here but on Aitutaki as well.  I am also aware that Atiu 

is picking up on tourism.  I am grateful to the Leader of the country on this Appropriation as this 

will  strengthen  the  businesses  on  Rarotonga,  Aitutaki  and  Nga-Pu-Toru  reaching  out  to  the 

northern islands.  My request to the Leader of the country is to look at Mangaia because there are 

motel sites on Mangaia but we are not encouraging tourism on Mangaia.  I feel sorry for these 

motels  sitting  idle  as  they  are  not  occupied.    May  be  through  an  Appropriation  of  this  nature 

tourism will expanded throughout the outer islands.  I know Mr Speaker under this Appropriation 

of  the  part  that  BTIB  is  playing  today.    Under  BTIB  there  is  an  allocation  to  help  these  small 

businesses  on  Rarotonga,  in  the  southern  and  northern  Cook  Islands.    Although  there  is  no 

allocation  increase  on  this,  this  is  however  a  request.  If  the  Leader  of  the  country  can  give  an 

allocation increase for the sake of our people both in the southern and norther Cook Islands.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I heard that a business will be started in Mauke and this is what I wanted to happen.  

This is what we wanted. Not just for Rarotonga and Aitutaki to have businesses but also to extend 

to the other islands.  It has been shown through the budget given by the Prime Minister of how we 

</span><span>can spend this money.  

</span></div>
<div><span>My time is up and in conclusion, I give thanks to the Prime Minister and the Government and the 

Opposition for making this budget a good budget for our country.
