</span></div>
<div><span>We all know that MFEM has many criteria and the one that I would like to enquire is AgriTech.  

This special fund have been appropriated for our people to borrow from it.  This funding was in 

our Budget for 2001-2002 and from 2002-2003.  However, as far as I can see, there is none in this 

Budget. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  Prime  Minister  please  explain  the  situation  of  this  appropriation  for  AgriTech?    Mr 

Speaker, our people wanted me to ask this question because they know that I am good at asking 

questions in Parliament and that is why I am asking this question Prime Minister.  Thank you.
