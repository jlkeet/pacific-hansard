<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, Clerk of Parliament and all your 

staff and Members of this Honourable House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Kia Orana to our Cook Island people here in the Cook Islands, New Zealand and Australia, God 

bless to you all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to ask you Mr Speaker for some time for me to greet the people of my Constituency 

of Titikaveka. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Kia  Orana  to  all  my  people  of  Titikaveka.    Traditional  leaders,  the  Denominations  in  our 

Constituency,  Public  Servants  and  Private  Sector  employees,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    God  bless 

everyone.  To our elderly, infirmed, children, Kia Orana in the Name of our Lord. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I also wanted to convey my condolences to the Ngati Raina family for your loss, Mama Maara 

Kenning, which we buried last week; please accept our sincerest condolences to you all.  Also, my 

deepest condolences to the Lazaro family, Papa Taki Lazaro and his beautiful wife, Mama Pukeiti 

Lazaro.  Our Church Minister was saying that this is the first time he had buried a husband and 

wife together, which he had stated that this is the mark of true love. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Papa Taki Lasaro was said to be a well-liked popular and productive man in his young days on 

Mangaia.  His wife was in </span><span>the teacher’s union and she has travelled overseas to represent the Cook 

</span><span>Islands on behalf of the teacher’s profession of our country.  Therefore, our deepest condolences 

</span><span>to you all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to mention that on Friday 30</span><span>th</span><span> June will be the opening ceremony of our CICC Church 

in Titikaveka at 4.00 p.m. in the afternoon and I would like to invite every Honourable Members 

of this House to this Opening Ceremony.  Yesterday, I apologised to our Church as I will not be 

here for this occasion.  I do believe that with God, this project will be completed.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Our only issue at this time is the cement from T&amp;M as we have to wait for the cargo ship from 

</span><span>overseas.    So,  please  T&amp;M,  as  soon  as  you  receive  your  cement,  please  deliver  it  quickly  to 

Titikaveka so we can complete our Church project.

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>As for the 200 Years’ Celebration, we have started our </span><span>Nuku-Nui </span><span>practice every Sunday at 5.00 

p.m., it is open to anyone wanting to join.  So, if you want to be part of this great event come to 

Titikaveka and join us. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, in reference to the Appropriation Bill, I rise to give my full support to this wonderful 

</span><span>Budget.  I read the New Zealand Budget was termed, “Bread and Butter Budget.”  This means that 

</span><span>they  are providing sustenance,  food and  ensuring that their people  are  well catered for in  their 

everyday life. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our Prime Minister mentioned that our Budget is the “Nurturing Budget.”  Yes, and if  you go 

</span><span>through the Budget, that is exactly what this Budget is doing.  For example, when you look in the 

increases in wages, a lot of ministries like Health, Education and Police are receiving allocation 

for increasing wages for their staff.  They are also given the capacity now that they got enough to 

retain good staff. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When you look at their staffing, they are also able to hire new staff.  So to me, that is a good vision 

for Ministries in terms of personnel across the Public Sector.  Also, with Welfare Services, there 

are increases that the Minister of Finance will elaborate on when we go through each Vote Item. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr Speaker there is an impact on our people from this Budget at grassroot level, at employment 

level, welfare and there are many more in this Budget, Mr Speaker I will not go into detail.  We 

have  already  talked  about  the  tax  special  amendment  for  the  Outer  Islands.    That  is  why  I  am 

</span><span>saying, the Minister of Finance have rightly called this Budget, “The Nurturing Budget.”</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, I fully support this Budget.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Sonny Williams.  I now see the Honourable Leader of 

the One Cook Islands, Honourable Toanui Isamaela. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker Kia Orana to you, your wife and your family.  To the staff of 

this Honourable House and those outside of this Honourable House, Kia Orana to you all.  Kia 

Orana to the Government side, the Prime Minister and your Cabinet Ministers and Members on 

the Opposition, Leader of the Opposition Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne, Leader of the United 

Party and the Captain of One Cook Islands Party, Kia Orana 

</span></div>
<div><span>A special greetings going out to our people listening over the radio, watching our livestream, those 

</span><span>from the Northern Group and the Southern Group islands, greetings to you all.  Greetings to our 

</span><span>people in Tumutevarovaro and all our leaders, greetings to you.

<div><span>Monday, 19 June 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, if I can have some time to address my people of Aitutaki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Kia  Orana  to  my  people  of  Aitutaki  listening  to  our  debate  today.    A  special  greetings  to  my 

Constituency  of  Amuri/Ureia  and  all  my  people  living  there,  my  Committee  Members,  the 

different Church Denominations, Private Sectors, our elderly people, our members of the sports 

clubs and our children, Kia Orana in the Name of our Lord. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to come back to the Budget but before I do so, I want to give some thoughts 

which I think will be helpful to the people of Aitutaki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  on  our  island  today,  government  is  only  focusing  mostly  on  tourism  and 

infrastructure.  There are some projects like the solar and the project on the harbour development, 

it is not known how much has been spent and how much will be required to finish this project and 

we do not know when this project will be completed.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to speak on the problem of the island and the first priority I can see is water 

supply.    Today  we  have  problems  with  water  going  off  all  the  time,  the  Minister  knows  this 

problem because he has been to Aitutaki so I want to reiterate this point that it is a big problem on 

my island. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Today there are three water pumps on the island and they have reached the end of their life as they 

have been in use for many years.  They are always breaking down and being repaired so there is 

never enough water being pumped into the tanks to be distributed to the whole island.  The EO 

says there is not enough money and MFEM says they have not received any request for more funds 

so I do not know who is telling the truth. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I have spoken to the person who repair these three pumps and he told me that $120,000 

will be required to repair them including freight.  This is my request to the Government today; I 

know that the Budget has been set and there is no change but because of this problem, I am putting 

</span><span>this problem on the table today so that this House can think about it.  I am therefore requesting our 

</span><span>two other Honourable Members of Parliament, Tai Herman and Tereapii Maki-Kavana, to join me 

today in putting this problem through to Government for their assistance. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, there are six more months till we reach the end of this year when our people from 

New Zealand, Australia and Rarotonga return to Aitutaki.  We know that this is the season when 

people will return for the </span><span>Koni Raoni (Round the Island dancing)</span><span>, for weddings, reunions and other 

events.  If we cannot address this problem, it is better off that we cancel all tourism activities to 

</span><span>preserve our water for the people living on Aitutaki today.  This is the reason why I am putting 

</span><span>this issue through to the House today. 

</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>Monday, 19 June 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, I would like to talk about our power supply, the Mana Uira of Aitutaki.  In the past few 

months Mr Speaker, we have had a power-cut problem.  I have mentioned this in the past and I 

want to keep reminding the Honourable Prime Minister, Minister of CIIC, to consider this issue 

because Mr Speaker, there are three generators that provides electricity to the island and they are 

very old. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Let us not talk about Solar because we do not make profit out of it.  I understand that the second 

stage will cost $8 million.  The Minister is well aware of this problem because our </span><span>Aronga Mana 

</span><span>had raised these issues with him during the first stage of the Solar Power.  We need to purchase 

three new generators for the island of Aitutaki.  I can see that my time is nearly up so I will put 

that topic on the side and will focus on Public Sectors of the island. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, we have Public Servants  on the island and their output service is  required for the 

people.  I do not think that they are performing their duties properly, especially for our infirmed 

individuals; I do not think that they are getting the required assistance. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There is a house in my Constituency; I am sure that you know this couple.  When it rains, it rains 

into their house.  This issue was brought to the attention of these Public Servants to sought help 

from Rarotonga and I know that there is help; nothing was done.  Therefore, my question is, what 

are these Public Servants doing on our island? 

</span></div>
<div><span>During our last Sitting when I came over, I did my very best to find some help.  Today, Mr Speaker, 

this  home  is  looking  good  because  the  people  that  renovated  this  house  were  volunteers;  they 

helped renovate the house to improve the living condition of the people that lives in it.  But they 

still continue to call me for help. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  believe  that  Ministers  should  come  to  Aitutaki  to  see  whether  Public  Servants  are  actually 

performing their duties and to review their pay if underpaid. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When we look at the development here on the island of Rarotonga, it has improved.  When I look 

</span><span>at the appropriation for 2023/24, it is mainly for development on Rarotonga.  I hope that equal 

consideration for the Outer Islands is considered to help improve our living standards. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, this is what I am talking about because the top up for Aitutaki is $14,000 and yet, is 

is the second largest revenue earning island in the Cook Islands and the top up is only $14,000?  I 

am not blaming the Government, I am just showing the situation of the island.</span></div>
<div><span>The  Member  for  Matavera  was  saying  earlier  that  some  funding  may  have  been  reallocated  to 

</span><span>Aitutaki for the harbour project.  May I suggest allocating some funding to be spent on the water 

supply and the generators?  This is what I am asking, for Government to be fair in the distribution

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>of funding for Rarotonga and the Outer Islands.  My time is almost up and these are my thoughts.  

These are also the issues that I wanted to raise in this House.  Therefore, I support the allocations 

of this Budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member for Ngatangiia, 

the Honourable Tukaka Ama; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR. T. AMA:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker, Member of this House, salutations have gone before in 

the House.  I will not waste my time on the salutations because the people in my Constituency said 

</span><span>to me, “do not go in Parliament and be talkative but tell us what you can do for us.”  So, this is 

</span><span>what I am going to do now.   Despite that, a big Kia Orana to those in Ngatangiia, Pa-ma-Kainuku, 

the people of Ngatangiia from Tauaroa to Teraoia.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I stand to give my support to this Appropriation because I believe our country just came through 

hard times because of COVID and followed by recession.  In spite of this, I believe Government 

did its obligation in looking after our people.  That is why the Prime Minister calls this budget the 

Budget of Nurturing.  I trust the Government managed to look after all our people as we were the 

only nation in the Pacific that were given wage subsidy, power subsidy and so forth.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Through the competence of our Economists, the Prime Minister who is also the Minister of Finance 

carefully guided us through the hard times we have been through.  It did not only stop there and 

as we look around today, Government is looking at increasing the pay for Caregivers and Old Age 

Pensioners.  I know we are facing hard times, food prices are increasing, fuel cost are going up 

</span><span>and there are more.  The Government’s intention is to look at ways to improve the livelihood of 

</span><span>our people.  This  not only on Rarotonga but  also  on the Outer Islands.  An example is the tax 

threshold cuts on people earning less than $60,000.  There is no other country with an approach 

like this.  I strongly believe this is a huge saving for our people in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would come back to Rarotonga and touch on the allocations for the projects being done by ICI.  

</span><span>I  am  happy  and  would  like  to  commend  the  Minister  for  ICI,  the  Prime  Minister  and  our 

</span><span>Government on the allocation for my Constituency of Ngatangiia.  This is an immense spending 

on  the  beautification  of  our  village.    Do  not  say  because  I  am  now  the  Member  hence  why 

Ngatangiia is  getting more money, no, do not  be like that.  Look at  the culvert  projects  that is 

completed in the village.  For so many years we have been for wanting these.  During a downpour, 

you cannot cross through Aroko, and the Muri area is always flooded.  So, a big thank you to the 

Ministry of ICI.  I am entitled to be praiseworthy of my Constituency because we can see today it 

is  a  hub  for  tourism  and  therefore  I  can  say  that  revenue  is  also  being  generated  from  my 

</span><span>Constituency.

</span></div>
<div><span>Monday, 19 June 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I stepped into this House, I said to the people in my Constituency that Ngatangiia deserves 

more.  From what we can see today starting from our road where Vaitoti Tupa came seeking for 

help, I said to Vaitoti not to worry, I will complete the road sealing project in Matavera.  I am also 

looking at improving our sewage waste management, which is affecting our lagoon.  The Prime 

Minister and Minister for ICI assured me this project is still active and still inside the pipeline.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Government  is  also  looking  at  options  for  implementing  power  subsidies  for  the  destitute  and 

pensioners.  Like what we have discussed on our Radio Talk Show last Friday that with this power 

subsidy, there are certain criteria that are involved, it is not an automatic situation whereby you 

get to go this power subsidy automatically but there are criteria involved in which the Ministry of 

Internal Affairs will consider your situation whether you will qualify or not. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, I fully support this Budget because it is the Budget that will provide for all our people 

in the Cook Islands both elderly, the destitute and widows.  It will greatly help all of our people in 

the Cook Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There  are  other  support  that  I  can  see  in  this  Budget  for  our  people  even  the  people  of  my 

Constituency of Ngatangiia.  We will look carefully into these projects in due course.  There is 

also  a  lot  of  talk  that  is  floating  around  regarding  the  roads  in  Ngatangiia  that  are  still  to  be 

upgraded  whether  these  will  be  done.    But  I  want  to  assure  you  all  today  in  this  House  this 

afternoon that this road project will be completed before the end of this year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I believe that in this Appropriation Bill for this year, an allocation is set for that road project and I 

believe that ICI has a surplus allocation, which will assist this particular Ngatangiia road upgrade 

even for next year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I also would like to mention that our water intakes in Ngatangiia which are actually the two biggest 

intakes on Rarotonga in Turangi and Avana; ICI will be taking care of these project in this Budget 

also. 

</span></div>
<div><span>That is the reason why I am so happy of this Budget before the House and I fully support it because 

it will better the lives of our people and especially the people of my Constituency of Ngatangiia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  refer  to  our  200  Year’s  Anniversary  Celebration.    Ngatangiia  are  into  the 

</span><span>preparation stage and I hope that the Government can assist us with our requests. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To end my speech this afternoon, I would like to express my appreciation to the Minister of ICI 

</span><span>and Finance and the Government for your support in this Budget for Ngatangiia.  Thank you and 

</span><span>Kia Orana.

Heather and you have the Floor.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker and to both side of 

this Honourable House, the Clerk and staff of Parliament.  Greetings to the Prime Minister, Cabinet 

Ministers and all the Members of the Government. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Kia Orana to the Leader of the Opposition and all your Honourable Members, including the Leader 

of the One Cook Islands and my United Party Members, greetings. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Please permit me Mr Speaker some time to extend my greetings to my Constituency. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Kia Orana to all my people Akaao-Vaiakura, Tinomana Ariki, Aronga Mana, traditional Leaders 

in  our  village,  greetings  to  you  all.    To  all  the  Denominations  and  Church  Minister,  and  your 

Church members in our village, greetings to you all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I extend greetings to all Public Servants and Private Sector employees.  To our elderlies in our 

village and all the families.  Our young people and sport active youth, greetings to you all.  We 

have young people who are leading out in different organisations, greetings to you all and thank 

you for your support in your various organisations. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to extend my special condolences to the two families who are grieving the loss of their 

loved  ones.    Firstly,  to  Mama  Tapu  Temata  Andrew  and  your  families.    When  we  arrived  to 

Parliament this afternoon, we got told that she had passed away including Mama Pukeiti.  We, 

Members  of  Parliament  would  like  to  extend  our  deepest  condolences  and  comfort  to  all  the 

families.  These two women are well-known in  Puaikura because they are both teachers in our 

Arorangi Primary School.  They are also very good supporters in both Church and the village sport 

activities.  May the Good Lord bless the family and comfort you all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I come back to our Appropriation Bill, Mr Speaker.  I cannot remember where I got this talk about 

</span><span>this Ap</span><span>propriation being labelled, “Lean Budget.”  Please correct me; my understanding of this 

</span><span>word lean is in relation to a pig.  A pig who has gone very skinny.  There is no goodness or meat 

in this pig.  This is my input to this debate, not an accusation but a sharing of my view to this 

Honourable House about this Appropriation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We thank the Honourable Prime Minister who is responsible for the Budget and what you have 

prepared for the development of our country.  In reference to this lean budget, I would compare it 

</span><span>to a mother pig with no milk in its tits, no fats and no meat.  The Member for Titikaveka mentioned 

</span><span>earlier that this is the ‘Nurturing Budget’, claiming that there are many good things and blessings 

</span><span>in it.

<div><span>Monday, 19 June 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>When we talk about this pig, it is a lean pork.  We would not want to eat this pig because there is 

no fats or meat in it.  The same applies to a lean budget. 

</span></div>
<div><span>At this time, I would like to speak about our elderly, as mentioned earlier by previous speakers.  

We have seen the allocation provided by the Government to help our Welfare Pensioners.  There 

is an increase from $6,240 to $8,640 a year.  In this allocation, we will see of what the Government 

is  doing  for  our  people,  especially  our  destitute  and  elderly  people  as  mentioned  earlier.    The 

</span><span>question is,  a phrase in  English, “Quality  of life”, if this is  the right  thing  for our  elderly.   As 

</span><span>mentioned earlier about some problems, I am not talking about for today but for the future.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The reason I wish to raise this with us today is that we are seeing many of our elderlies dying 

today, and they are dying without reaping the benefits of this nation.  We are not predicting at 5-

10 years into the future, just imagine how many people will be gone by that time.  Therefore, I 

would like to ask the Government to consider our request because we want our elderly people to 

enjoy the remaining days of their lives.  

</span></div>
<div><span>At this stage, I would like to speak about our disabled people.  I have spoken to some agencies that 

provides support in this area.  This problem still stands today.  They will collect about $5,000 and 

under annually. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, the problem here is the caregivers.  They are still being paid at $8.50 per hour.  We 

can now see of how the Government had increased it to $9 an hour.  I am sharing this because this 

problem seems to be getting out of hand especially with our people facing stress.  We should not 

forget these children of ours and our elderly people who are also struggling in life. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In my electorate Akaoa/Vaiakura, 56 percent of employees earn less than $20,000 per annum.  This 

is not a large amount when we look at the inflation of 12 percent.  Two weeks ago, I purchased an 

article for $11 and today it has risen to $19.  That is the difficulty that I have discovered but maybe 

</span><span>for us we are not facing that problem but I know that our people outside this House are crying. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It has been mentioned earlier that there is not enough money and if the Member for Ngatangiia 

can forget his golden mile and give the money to help the welfare section.  The welfare of our 

people is our prime concern and not infrastructure. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In closing my thoughts, Mr Speaker we can see that the price of goods in the shops are rising as 

mentioned before.  What the three of us in Puaikura are doing is helping our people in our Puna.  

</span><span>Our  Constituency  Fund  is  not  enough  so  this  45  percent  increase  that  you  have  given  to  us 

</span><span>Members of this House, we are making use of it for the benefit of our people.  May God Bless us 

all and I stand in support of this Budget.

<div><span>I  would  like  to  greet  the  people  of  Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara.    To  all  the  Ministers  of  the 

Churches and your members, thank you for your Prayers.  To the Ariki Tamatoa and Teurukura, 

Kia Orana to you and also to the Councilors, Kia Orana to you all and all your people.  I would 

also like greet our elderly and children. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I stand in support of the Budget before the House.  May God bless you Prime Minister and the 

staff who works under your guidance for the good work that you all do.  I know this is not an easy 

job to look after the finances of a country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I asked myself, how did we manage to come through the difficulties in the past?  Our Budget of 

last year, the Budget of Faith and this year our Budget is a Nurturing Budget.  This Budget looks 

after all the people right across the board from the elderly to a young person. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In my hand right now, I can see the expenditure for my island of Aitutaki.  It says total government 

funding  from  general  revenue  allocated  for  Aitutaki  through  the  Island  Administration, 

</span><span>Government agencies’ spending and Capital Project $12.6 million year 2023/24.  Some people in 

</span><span>Aitutaki are saying that we should keep our tax money, our power money and our money from the 

Port Authority; but let me remind the people of Aitutaki that we cannot earn $12 million.  We 

should not say that we will keep our tax money, we cannot do that. 

</span></div>
<div><span>At present, work is still progressing on the wharf, it has not stopped.  The only time it stopped is 

</span><span>when the machine broke down but the money allocated by the Government will still available.  

</span><span>There is an amount of $980,000 top-up this year.  This work is going ahead and next year if it is 

not  completed  there  will  be  another  top-up  and  I  thank  our  Government  for  looking  after  this 

project.  Our Government of today want its projects to be completed and let us make it happen. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Some people are saying why waste money on this project and why not improve the water supply?  

Yes!  As mentioned by the Honourable Member for Amuri/Ureia, this is a big problem on our 

island, water supply.  The Government has not forgotten about this problem but it is in the pipe 

</span><span>line, to find ways to improve it.

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Some days ago the Minister for ICI was on the island and he knows of the problems on our island 

so Mr Minister you have not completed your work and you will need to come back to Aitutaki as 

there are other problems that need to be addressed so people will not complain.  The main thing 

here is that the Island Administration and the three Members of Parliament work together and that 

</span><span>is when our island will get ahead.  If they don’t work together with us then we will not get ahead.</span></div>
<div><span>I know that people of my Constituency will ask of what good things has this Honourable Member 

done for his Constituency.</span></div>
<div><span>In our harbour project from Arutanga to Nikaupara we can expect to see big changes and we should 

be prepared for this.  Mr Speaker, once this project is completed I assure you the stretch of beach 

will be covered with white sand and tourists will not be going out onto the </span><span>motu</span><span> but will be making 

use of these white sandy beaches.  This will however be a disadvantage for the businesses taking 

tourist out onto the </span><span>motus</span><span>.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Back  in  Aitutaki,  we  see  private  jetliners  flying  direct  into  Aitutaki  without  transiting  through 

Rarotonga.  This is a benefit for Aitutaki and so there is a need for Government to improve and 

upgrade Immigrations and Customs in Aitutaki.  I am happy because in this budget, an Allocation 

has been set aside by MFEM where Border Control Officers can be flown in from Rarotonga to 

look after this area.  We just have one person in Aitutaki looking after Immigration, Customs and 

Tax.  We need another officer to assist with visiting foreign ships and aircrafts to the island.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I note like other speakers before me mentioning the increase in pay for caregivers, 

destitute and power subsidy I would like to commend the Government.  I think we are forgetting 

about the allowance for newborns maybe that is why we are having a population decline because 

of the low allowance.  I think we should increase it to $3,000 and we may see the increase of our 

population.  It is just up to my friend the Leader of the House to move a motion for the increase 

then we can increase the newborn allowance to $3,000.  I look at the Prime Minister may be he 

forgot to increase the Old Age Pension seeing we have turned 60 years this year.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the allocation for Agriculture and especially for Aitutaki, when I look at the personnel 

for  fruits  it  is  five  and  for  root  crop  only  one.    I  think  it  is  better  to  relocate  the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture in Aitutaki to Rarotonga because we are we are wasting our time going overseas to 

teach others.  I know with Agriculture on Rarotonga they have a plan to send staff to the outer 

islands to teach them but I can see this is on the decline.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to commend the government because I can see they have an initiative to 

</span><span>bring in a boat to boost up interisland travels.  Lastly, Mr Speaker I strongly support the 2023-

</span><span>2024 Appropriation.  Thank you very much.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member for Ruaau; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR. VARU:  </span><span>Greetings to you Mr Speaker.  The Clerk, Deputy Clerk and all staff of this House.  

The Prime Minister, your Cabinet and Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and Members and 

to  us  the  two  United  Party  members,  our  Leader  has  left  for  other  commitments  and  to  the 

Honourable Member Toa Isamaela from the One Cook Islands Party.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker if I may be given an opportunity to address my constituency.  Before doing so I would 

like to commend the people within Puaikura because on Saturday we had a road clearance working 

bee from one end of Puaikura to the other end.  This project was organised by us the two Members 

</span><span>of Parliament and our Leader in preparation for the commemoration for the 200 years’ celebration.  

</span><span>I would like to add this working bee is not politically motivated, the elections are done with and 

this is a way to bring us the people of Puaikura together.  This began with the beating of the drums 

from  one  end  of  Puaikura  to  the  other  end.    I  believe  this  a  tradition  used  by  our  ancestors  in 

rallying people when there is an activity to be done.  Therefore, our Leader thought this is a suiting 

way of summoning up the people.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, what I saw on Saturday is that many people were in attendance and working together.  

I sure Mr Speaker you would have been astonished had you drove through Puaikura on that day 

and may have been surprised as what was going on.  A plane can land on our road today and you 

can see from one end to the other end.  Thank you very much to the people of Puaikura today. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Kia  Orana  to  the  people  in  my  constituency  Ruaau.    This  is  me,  the  one  you  have  elected  to 

represent you in this House.  Thank you for trusting me.  Thank you to our elderly people, our 

youth members and children from within  you Ruaau; Kia Orana to  you all in the Name of our 

Lord. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  in  our  Parliament  meeting  today,  I  can  see  we  have  two  Members  who  are  very 

</span><span>popular today.  First, our Prime Minister, the Honourable Mark Brown.  It is because he is the 

</span><span>Minister  for  Finance.    Our  country  will  not  progress  properly  with  no  fundings.    Second,  the 

Member for Ruatonga-Avatiu, for he is the Minister Responsible for ICI.   

</span></div>
<div><span>In my Constituency, I want both of them.  I have a big request to ask them.  This appeal is from 

the people of Ruaau, in which they have asked this for so many years.  Our roads in Ruaau, I would 

like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert  Nicholas  for  upgrading  the  road  in  Inave.    My 

observation tells me that about 200 metres was upgraded. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore Honourable Minister, please help us and finish this project.  There are many roads in 

Inave that needs to be looked at.  When we look at my Constituency of Ruaau, especially in the 

</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>area of the Edgewater Resort, this is one of the big hotels on Rarotonga.  I know that your office 

is in Ruaau, ICI, including the Ministry of Agriculture.  Our prison also is in Ruaau.  I believe that 

our Hospital is in Ruaau.  Our waste management complex and landfill are also in Ruaau. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe that this area requires a desperate upgrade in terms of renovation.  Therefore, 

Honourable Prime Minister and Honourable Minister Albert Nicholas, I think it is not too late to 

include this in the allocation of our Budget.  I am sure you can do something about this. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Regarding Agriculture, there is many sections in Ruaau that are overgrown by rubbish.  This is 

one of my objectives to make use of these vacant and unused land section that is overgrown with 

rubbish.  I know our biggest problem in this area is that we do not have a tractor.  Maybe you can 

look in this area to provide for Ruaau and Inave. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker and directly to you Honourable Prime Minister in the many countries that you have 

been to, I know in Ruaau, it is where our wastes are disposed and there is an increase of plastic 

waste being disposed.  This amount of waste was not built by God but by us humans.  I know that 

when it rains, this area will be flooded where waste will stream down from the top.  This could be 

a  medication  for  our  seafood  to  prevent  our  fish  from  being  poisoned.    Therefore  Honourable 

Prime Minister, please look into this.  Sometimes, when we are cooking or barbecuing, we get 

many flies.  We believe that these flies are from the waste grounds. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore Honourable Ministers, please consider our needs for Ruaau. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  will  now  humble  myself  with  my  requests  for  you  two.    This  afternoon  before  I  entered 

Parliament, I was told that this would be the first time where I have not accomplished anything.  I 

have already done the work.  Therefore, my request to you two Honourable Ministers to help me.  

There are many outstanding projects required for Ruaau. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I would like to mention that when there is a drought and shortage of 

</span><span>water on the island, this is one of the first areas on the island to be affected.  The saddest part is 

</span><span>that the main road to the hills will be the first area to be affected.  I am  surprised because our 

Deputy Clerk never calls me for water because her home is up the hills.  I thought to myself, maybe 

it was the Member for Ngatangiia who had been shutting the main water pipes or the Member for 

Titikaveka because they have the main water intakes in their jurisdictions.  Therefore, I ask for 

these two Members of Parliament to stop switching these water pipes off.  I am sure that the water 

system has improved because the water system around the island has been upgraded. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker in regards to our Appropriation Bill, I give my support to this Budget.  Even if I stand 

</span><span>before this House to object, nothing much can be done about it, as this budget will still go ahead.
