<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON.  V.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you.    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker,  Clerk  and  all  your  staff 

including all our people and us Members.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In response to the question from the Leader of the Opposition, I can recall mentioning yesterday 

that some of the overseas travels are paid.  I also believe this is not confidential because they are 

included in the allocations under the Civil List in the House.  This also goes to the travels of Heads 

of Ministries.  However, some of the travels are funded from abroad.  Some also come from within 

their allocated budgets.
