<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  This is one of the Agencies or Ministries 

that had no change in their Budget allocation.  We should not however take that to mean that this 

</span><span>is not an important arm of Government.  In fact, during these hard times, we should be looking at 

</span><span>BTIB to step up on the promotion of foreign investments. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I understand that the focus is on the local and that has been the focus in a normal climate and this 

is  not  a  normal  climate.   I  would  ask  the  Minister  if  there  is  an  opportunity  to  have  the  BTIB 

Officials meet with the various stakeholders to talk about a way forward for foreign investments 

and in particular with looking at the barriers that are in place that may be made flexible a bit. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I say this, Mr Minister because recently, I had some discussions with representatives of one of the 

</span><span>mining companies who has an exploratory license and it became plain to me that there may be

</span></div>
<div><span>either little understanding of how the certainty in the company needed to expand to inject money 

back into the company to be able to be floating out there. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And because we already have rules in place and there was no discretion to bend the rules a bit to 

accommodate the situation in this climate, it became very difficult.  And so, while I support the 

allocation  for  this  Vote Item,  my  request  maybe  in  the  next  four  years  starting  now  is  that  we 

should have a look at the rules and try and accommodate situations that will assist us get out with 

our recovery plan. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  note  the  comments  and  the  views  of  the 

Honourable Member across the Floor and I must say that I totally concur with her views. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But  may  I  share  with  this  Honourable  House  Mr  Speaker,  what  I  truly  believe  is  the  spirit  of 

</span><span>BTIBâ€™s r</span><span>ole.  Whether it is legislated like this, but this is what I believe, what its role is.  I believe, 

Mr Speaker the role of BTIB is to open its doors and our doors to foreign investment and at the 

same time, safeguarding the interest and businesses of our own people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And we so have challenges Mr Speaker, like the Honourable Member has shared just earlier.  But 

may I share with us that those challenges are challenges because we have hit certain brick walls in 

our regulations or policies that are put in place pretty much to safeguard our own people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But I agree Mr Speaker, we are moving into the future and we must find common ground for both 

the foreign investor and the local partnership.  Mr Speaker, BTIB has three core outputs as outlined 

by  the  Development  Investment  Act  1995/96  and  these  core  outputs,  Mr  Speaker  are  foreign 

</span><span>investments, business development and trade.  And may I touch on these outputs Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our foreign investment, Mr Speaker, we have currently 118 foreign investors in country and this 

is  12 percent  reduction  Mr Speaker,  from  the start of this financial  year and that reduction Mr 

Speaker is a result of the awarding of PRs that we had last year.  As you are probably aware Mr 

Speaker that once you are awarded a PR status, you no longer fall under foreign investment. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And so, that is part of the cause of the 12 percent reduction Mr Speaker.  As we are also aware that 

</span><span>there are only two islands in the Cook Islands that have predominantly foreign investors, which is 

</span><span>Rarotonga and Aitutaki.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr Speaker, investment continue to focus on the tourism industry but recently, investments in 

other areas such as the Seabed Minerals and Telecommunications areas have taken interest from 

foreign investors.  So, I note Mr Speaker we are running out of time, so I think we all understand 

what BTIB is about and I will bring this conversation to an end, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker and thank you to all of us for supporting this appropriation.
