<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to announce in the House this afternoon about the presentation by the Seabed Mineral 

Authority to the Members of Parliament next Monday, 26 June at 12.00 p.m. in our dining room.  

The presentation will provide an update of significant developments over the last year.  Members 

may  recall  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  mentioned  about  this  presentation  in  the  House 

yesterday.  Light lunch will be provided for Members to have while the presentation is progressing. 

</span></div><div><span>The arrangement for us in terms of our Sitting for next Monday is that, when we adjourn on Friday 

23 June, a Motion will be put to the House for the House to adjourn until 1.30 p.m. Monday 26 

June.  This will allow the Seabed Mineral Team one hour for their presentation. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, please if you Honourable Members could make time during our Session or lunch break 

</span><span>to have your individual photos taken for your official profiles, so comb your hair properly.  Please 

see Unuia and Marina for these to be taken.  Thank you again Honourable Members.
