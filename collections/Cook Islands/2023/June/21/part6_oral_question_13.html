<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This is a Supplementary Question.  Sorry, Minister, I did not 

hear the second part you mentioned in your reply.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Despite that the reason I asked the question is because we are aware that in the budget, the sum of 

$200,000 has been allocated for Ministerial travels.  However, in half the year or during the course 

of the year in the last three years, it appears Parliament has to ask for another top up of $200,000 

or more.  So, to me, when you mentioned the fully funded travel for Ministers, that did not sound 

right to my ears because we all know that Parliament keeps a schedule on Ministers and Members 

travels.  So, there is no reason for Parliament to come back asking for another top up of $200,000 

or so.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I was intending to ask you to explain to us regardless if it is fully funded but under the Civil List, 

the Ministers and Members of Parliament are entitled to allowances above the fully funded trips.

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I am saying some of the Ministers and Members travelling overseas are accumulating expenses 

in excess of $60,000 even up to $100,000.  So, please, if this can be explained so our people can 

hear and understand when we say fully funded, that it does not mean that money from the Civil 

List is not being used.
