<h3>Oral Question 21</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  So,  it  appears  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is 

bothered  and  tried  to  disguise  a  question  based  on  information  that  has  been  provided  by  the 

Parliamentary Services.  Which trip was that that incurred these costs is my question to the Leader 

of the Opposition?
