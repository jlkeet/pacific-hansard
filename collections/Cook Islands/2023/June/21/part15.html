</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,455,081 for the Ministry of Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is now open to Honourable Members to speak on this Vote Item.  If you do not want to 

speak, do not stand up. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the United Party, Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and your staff and all Honourable Members of this 

House.  To our people listening in to our debate from the Northern and Southern Group islands 

and Rarotonga, Kia Orana in the Name of the Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a request Mr Speaker.  Each Vote Items has been limited with a time, we the Opposition 

would  like  to  ask  the  Government  to  refrain  from  speaking  and  to  give  us  the  entire  allocated 

speaking time for these Vote Items.  I believe they understand the process of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You speak for one hour so that they will not speak. 

</span></div><div><span>(Laughter in the House) 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  The reason why I requested for this is because the 

debate for these Vote Items is very crucial when it comes to the Appropriation Bill for each year. 

</span></div><div><span>The budget for this year on this Vote Item is $1,455,081.  Mr Speaker, I would prefer $2,500,000.  

Not for Rarotonga only, but for the Outer Islands as well.  We have come out from a year and a 

</span><span>half of recovery from this lockdown.   

</span></div><div><span>I propose for a higher allocation for our people to recover properly from it and, the rise of living 

cost.  I visited the Southern Group islands to check on their egg productions as eggs have become 

a norm in our homes in which we have adopted for breakfast, bacon and eggs.   

</span></div><div><span>I have seen in the past with the allocation for Agriculture.  Our people requires our support with 

their agricultural ventures in land and animal farming and with egg production as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Government  have  reduced  tax  charges  for  Agriculture;  it  was  supposed  to  help  our  people  but 

instead, it ended up importing more eggs from New Zealand and Samoa.  John Scott, one of our

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>local egg farmers, for many years, he has been supplying eggs.  He had now given up because of 

the competition from eggs imported from overseas. 

</span></div><div><span>There are many strong local agricultural producers in the Outer Islands.  Mitiaro, Mr Tokai and 

Teina  Bishop  in  Aitutaki.    The  Government  should  assist  these  hard-working  people  to  enable 

them with the production of their agricultural produces and for them to be able to stand on their 

own two feet.   

</span></div><div><span>There are many strong farmers here on Rarotonga and we know who they are especially in egg 

production.  The problem is, chicken would not feed on our coconuts, and they would need special 

chicken food from overseas, which will enable them to lay eggs. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to give time to the other Members to speak but I want to emphasise on our eggs and would 

like to ask the Government to consider a subsidy for our egg farmers especially the importation of 

the chicken food for their farms.   

</span></div><div><span>I know that there is a subsidy for pigs feed, we could do the same for the chicken feed.  Maybe 50 

percent to be subsidised by the Government and 50 percent by the chicken farmers.   

</span></div><div><span>There are less people on Rarotonga planting vegetables and their big problem is the availability of 

chemicals and fertilizer because these crops will need to be protected from pests otherwise they 

will not grow. 

</span></div><div><span>My last comment, Mr Speaker, and I have said this in the past and yesterday I mentioned Public 

Servants  to  do  their  work  according  to  what  they  are  being  paid.    This  appropriation  for  the 

Ministries, this is an investment and the people of this Nation want to see what the return is from 

the investment.  That is enough for now, Mr Speaker, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Leader  of  the  United  Party.    Before  the  Member  for  Matavera 

</span><span>commence his speech, I wish to remind Honourable Members at this time, if you wish to speak, 

</span><span>you have 10 minutes and if at the end of that time you have not completed your thoughts, then you 

sit down and stand up again and continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for the opportunity to speak on the Agriculture Vote Item.  

I have no problem with this Vote Item and I support it.  When we look at the trading revenue, this 

has increased to $50 thousand.  But when you look at the figures that is shown, it does not amount 

to $50 thousand. 

</span></div><div><span>256 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>When you compare the trading revenue for last year which is $250,738, this year, it is $140,535.  

So, I am asking for the $50 thousand to remain because this is under the trading revenue for last 

year. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I give my approval to the Schedule for Agriculture but this is the area that I want us to 

concentrate our discussion especially carrying out the work.  Mr Speaker, when you look at the 

structure  of  this  Ministry,  they  have  one  problem  and  that  is  with  bio-security.    So,  on  their 

structure, I want us to look at this. 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at Output No. 4 in regard to Corporate Services, they are responsible for receiving 

the money and paying the workers.  But when you look at the number of workers under this section, 

there  are  nine  personnel.    There  is  one  Information  Officer,  Communication  Officer,  Project 

Adviser,  Project  Officer,  Policy  Adviser,  Senior  Administration,  two  Security  Officers  and  an 

Administration Officer and that adds up to nine and yet, their job is to prepare the money and pay 

the workers and receive the revenue. 

</span></div><div><span>What I really want is for the program for sowing seeds and sell to the growers to be improved.  Mr 

Speaker, in their program, it does not show that they are going to grow this area of growing plants. 

</span></div><div><span>And there is another difficulty that they mentioned in their Report to PSC about bio-security.  But 

when you look at the Report from PSC, they have high regard for this department.  What I really 

want is for them to strengthen Output 1 in regards to giving plants to grown in our country and I 

would like to recommend for a reduction of the number of workers in this section.  I think three 

personnel will be sufficient for the Corporate Services to do the work and the others should go to 

bio-security.  We will not send them home but direct them to the area of growing seedlings. 

There is a new section that has been created to get personnel, who will be able to give advice to 

the growers.  Mr Speaker, before I support the suggestion from the Leader of the United Party that 

we should increase their salaries. I want the workers to be looked at and that there should be a 

restructure of the whole Ministry.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I support this allocation.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Wesley 

Kareroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. KAREROA:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to you and all Members of the House.   

</span></div><div><span>I want  to  refer to  the allocation in  front  of us  now.   In the past,  we have always  asked for the 

</span><span>allocation for Agriculture to be increased.  I can see that the increase is happening but very slow.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>This year, I think there is only an increase of $50 thousand for Rarotonga, but nothing for the Outer 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>When I look at the figures for Mangaia, it is the same trading revenue but notwithstanding that 

Government has given some help through SRF funding and I want to give you a historical sitting 

of how this support by Government is happening on my island. 

</span></div><div><span>In Oneroa, we started up a market.  At first, one but now, there are three.  One is at the Fishing 

Club, one at the Makatea and one at the office.  These markets are really helping the growers and 

fishermen to  sell their produce and fish on different  days  and this is  going well in  helping our 

people.   

</span></div><div><span>I have sought assistance from Government to set up these markets through my HR fund to purchase 

tables,  chairs,  grass  cutters,  wheelbarrows  and  the  building  materials.    I  would  say  this  is  the 

assistance given by Government and nothing else.   

</span></div><div><span>We are seeking sponsors to get fertilisers to help our planters as pests are infesting their crops.  In 

my village, some planters send their produces here to Rarotonga.  I would say the lowest they have 

sent to Rarotonga is around 200 to 300 kilograms of produce.  The highest produce they can reach 

is 700 kilograms a week. 

</span></div><div><span>We have had a pilot project a couple of years ago and was sponsored by Climate Change fund to 

help our youth with planting.  Unfortunately, this is not active today because these youths have 

started families and most have travelled overseas.  When these youths started in the project, it was 

really a success because we were reaping about 2 tons of produce every fortnight and we were 

supplying the Prime Food store.  Unfortunately, during these times, everything has changed.  We 

were told the produces sent over were damaged and no good, therefore the planters are not getting 

any income.  So, these are one of the difficulties our planters are facing.  

</span></div><div><span>We would like to see the Agriculture set up a plan for us where we can take the produces and get 

</span><span>paid at the same time.  As of today, the level of planting has declined on Mangaia and I know this 

is a time for us to find ways to improve.  At the moment, we are just relying on our own local 

market.  There is nothing much we can discuss about on our budget but there are certain crops we 

are  producing.    We  do  have  the  resources  but  we  are  not  making  use  of  it.    However,  we  are 

recovering slowly.   

</span></div><div><span>Those are my thoughts and I am giving the opportunity to others.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member from Mangaia.  I see the Honourable Member 

Toanui Isamaela from Aitutaki.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR.  T.  ISAMAELA:  </span><span>  Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  all  those  in  the  House.    I  will  keep  my 

salutations very short.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker I rise to voice my thoughts on agriculture.  Like the previous speakers, I am in the 

same situation because the allocation has already been made and there is nothing much we can do 

to  change  it.    But  I  am  airing  my  views  on  the  next  appropriation  and  that  is  to  increase  the 

appropriation for agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when I look at the Appropriation for Agriculture, I would say that these allocations 

will be mostly be spent on Rarotonga.  That is why I said when it comes to agriculture, to consider 

the Outer Islands and to find ways to improve the Outer Islands.  I will take us back some years 

Mr Speaker when there was a nursery in Aitutaki where plant seedlings were established.  Once 

the seedling sprouts and ready to be transplanted, the planters will come and buy them to plant 

back on their plantations.  Mr Speaker, those times, the fertilisers allocated for Aitutaki arrives in 

shipping containers and it is affordable and cheap for the planters to buy.  Just a couple of years 

ago, these all disappeared.  I do not know what happened, maybe it our organisers in Aitutaki or 

the lack of money generated so the system may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>During this time, I would like to commend on the constituency funding that is helping us.  To what 

I know is $10,000 and I nearly lost $5,000.  Luckily, I asked around and I ended up with $15,000.  

Now, I am hearing that this will be increased to $20,000 and this puts Members of Parliament in a 

good position to help in their constituencies.  So, to all of us Member, we are servants of our people 

and I  yearn for it to be increased to $50,000 so our people will know where to seek assistance 

especially in terms of planting on our lands.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my constituency fund has just been spent and it was spent on significant purposes.  I 

heard my colleague mentioning that agricultural trainers from Rarotonga are coming to Aitutaki 

and it is a waste of time to teach our people because no work will ever be done.  I am not saying 

</span><span>bad things about the trainers but the reason I am saying this is because if you come, you have to 

</span><span>walk the talk.  You teach and you give the support.  Not just to talk and the paper will grow into a 

watermelon.  When they come to Aitutaki, they should bring the seedling and teach the people 

how to grow these seeds. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I will interrupt you.  It is time for our break.  We will 

suspend the Sitting until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.29 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting is resumed at 3.15 p.m.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please be seated.  I bring the House to Order.  Before we went for a break, the 

Honourable Member for Amuri/Ureia was speaking.  Honourable Member; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I was speaking about the Members constituency 

fund.  This allocation assists us in our Constituency.  This assisted me in purchasing plant seeds 

like capsicum, watermelon and other various seeds for the farmers in my Constituency.  I am not 

</span><span>against the Ministry of Agriculture’s staff coming to our is</span><span>land to undertake workshops that will 

assist our farmers.  My problem with this is that this is only a training with no actual practical 

training.  This is one of the biggest problem, our farmers do not get any seedlings to plant on their 

lands  and  the  chemicals  needed  to  keep  the  pests  away.    The  boat  that  just  left  for  Aitutaki 

yesterday, I have sent 25 bags of fertilisers for the farmers for my constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>When I distribute the plant seeds, it comes with a bag of fertiliser for my planters.  The problem 

here  Mr  Speaker  is  that  we  have  to  personally  come  to  Rarotonga  to  acquire  these  agriculture 

materials for our farming.  The demand here on Rarotonga is greater than the Outer Islands and 

the need for these agriculture materials like fertilisers are greater and they are using it more. 

</span></div><div><span>I  purchased  50  bags  of  fertilisers  for  my  farmers  in  Aitutaki  but  Rarotonga  asked  for  25  bags 

because of their demand so I gave it to them.  Later then will reimburse my other 25 bags and I 

will eventually have the 50 I intended to purchase.  I stand therefore to ask the Government if these 

necessary agriculture materials can be distributed to us in the Outer Islands.  I tell this will help 

our farmers in the Pa Enua very much. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe Mr Speaker that I have run out of time.  I give this time for other Members to share their 

view on this Vote Item.  Thank You. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  from 

Ngatangiia, Tukaka Ama and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Members of the House.  I stand today because I think;  I have the 

shortest presentation today.  Not to condemn but to support this Vote Item allocation and to provide 

my views on a solution for our agriculture problems that we have in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that this is not just about a workshop, training, policy, tractor; we have many tractors on 

our islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe the solution for our agriculture problems is the hands of people.  We are hearing that our 

</span><span>agriculture produce or supply demands are not met here on Rarotonga and the reason for this in 

my view is that there are not enough hands to carry out the work.  I was discussing this issue with 

</span></div><div><span>260 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>the  Minister  of  Agriculture  Rose  Brown  and  we  were  of  the  same  mind  to  recommend  to 

Government to bring workers from overseas especially to help our growers and farmers here on 

Rarotonga.    Our  growers  have  all  the  machines  they  need,  fertilisers  and  plant  seedlings  are 

available from the Ministry of Agriculture; what is needed are hands for planting the seedlings and 

for maintaining the plantations. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe the same issue applies to our Outer Island agriculture work; they need extra hands to do 

the farming work.  As I have already mentioned, we have many machines for our growers but what 

we lack the most are the hands to do the farming work.  I know one of the major problems of our 

growers is the harvesting of their crops because they need extra hands. 

</span></div><div><span>Our local growers do not have a group of workers to help their planting program, maybe one or 

two have people to help them but most cannot afford it, they only have themselves and their family.  

This is my recommendation for this Vote Item for the future Mr Speaker, and that is for more funds 

to help our growers in this area so they can produce and supply more for our country. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Robert Heather; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of our people listening in to our 

Parliament.  Kia Orana also to all the Honourable Members of this House and staff of Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>My talk will not be long but I just want to say, I support the allocation for this Vote Item.  However, 

as mentioned by previous speakers, it is not enough and there is a need for this allocation to be 

</span><span>increased.  This is my thought on this and it is for “full security in self</span><span>-susten</span><span>ance.”</span></div><div><span>We have the issue of “imports” on what is brought into our country.  Over $190 million, worth of 

</span><span>import into our country but our export out of the country is only $1 million.  The problem we have 

</span><span>today is that our shops have run out of rice and this have been going on for many weeks.  We have 

many Asian foreign workers in this country and there are over a thousand of them living here; we 

should engage them to plant rice. 

</span></div><div><span>Earlier, there was a mention of eggs, pigs et cetera, and not for chicken because there is a need for 

these  to  increase.    We  should  consider  reducing  some  of  the  agriculture  projects  and  maybe 

concentrate on areas that needed for the benefit of our people.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We have seen some people who have formed a cooperative in planting for many years; it is their 

way of helping our </span><span>taro </span><span>growers, as there are no markets here, it is easier to export thousands of 

kilos on international flights. 

</span></div><div><span>The difference here is that they give you cash, you give them the </span><span>taro</span><span> and the growers are happy. 

</span></div><div><span>A Member spoke earlier about a solution and that is a good idea.  But I would prefer my solution 

be first.  There are many growers today and the saddest thing about it is that our youth do not want 

to do this kind of work. 

</span></div><div><span>In my Constituency, for the past four years, we have had 28 youth members from 5 to 16 years 

old.  This idea was initiated to get the children out of the house and away from their phones and 

television sets.  This initiative is to teach them how to plant.  The good news about this is that they 

can work together with their parents and not rely on </span><span>me</span><span> to teach their kids where and the parents 

are not involved.  I can see that these children are enjoying working with their parents.  They grow, 

they weed, and they harvest and reap the benefit from this work. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I will interrupt you Honourable Member as your time is up and our time is up.  

</span><span>Now, the Honourable Minister is  allowing the Member for  Ivirua to  speak;  “five minutes” she 

</span><span>said. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS. A. ARMSTRONG:  </span><span>Kia Orana</span><span>Mr Speaker and thank you to the Minister.  Kia Orana to 

everybody in the House today.  I did have a bit of a moan on the Budget cuts so I think I will 

change my tactic.  Seeing we have a lean Budget, I think the focus that we should do in agriculture 

is to try and educate our young people coming up. 

</span></div><div><span>We have the program that agriculture or the schools are currently have introduced in the schools 

the  gardens  in  the  school  so  I  think  we  should  encourage  that  a  lot  more  so  that  our  young 

generation can get their hands dirty. 

</span></div><div><span>When we were all growing up and going to school we had that opportunity to take these basic 

lessons  at  school  like  cooking,  sewing,  woodwork  and  gardening  and  I  think  our  Education 

Department should try and re-introduce these into the school curriculum so that we can encourage 

our children to part-take in these things.  

</span></div><div><span>We should also encourage our growers, the Agriculture Department should encourage our growers 

or would be growers to look at different ways of growing.  Instead of everyone growing the same 

</span><span>crop each time and we have a flood of the same vegetable, stagger these crops.  Introduce a way 

</span><span>of having different crops growing.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I do agree that we have a labour shortage and if we are to bring foreign workers in then we have 

another  issue  of  how  we  are  going  go  keep  them  here  because  they  will  look  to  go  to  greener 

pastures and that is an expense on our people.  So I think we need to look at our own people and 

educate them in this area. 

</span></div><div><span>Pesticides, I congratulate the Agriculture department for keeping an eye on what pesticides come 

</span><span>into our country and that’s one thing that we need to ensure that the right pesticides are used so 

</span><span>that we do not poison ourselves having this in the ground.  I think I will sit down so the next person 

can speak.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, can you please clarify?  My understanding is that 

under Standing Orders, the Minister has unlimited time but for us, 10 minutes? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I have been told that our 1 hour is up on this Vote Item and we only have five 

minutes left.  As I mentioned earlier, some Vote Items are 1 hour, some are one and a half hours 

and we can see the time on the screen.  The Leader of the Opposition is correct that the Minister 

for that Vote Item has unlimited time to speak.  I do believe that the Minister will not take a long 

time.  Now, Minister, the Floor is yours. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to all Honourable Members 

of this House for your contribution, your thoughts and your recommendations that you have shared 

so that it will encourage us to carry out the work that have been assigned to us. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  Head  of  the  Ministry,  Temarama  Anguna  for  her  leadership  in  this 

Ministry and all her staff.  I also want to thank all our Managers responsible for each Ministry on 

each island.  A special greetings to all our growers throughout our country who are contributing to 

the economy, especially in this field. 

</span></div><div><span>I would now like to give some thoughts for our discussion and as indicated in this Vote Item, all 

</span><span>the allocations that has been itemized.  Let me remind you that in this Vote Item, the Outer Islands 

</span><span>is not included and for each individual island, their Vote Item for agriculture falls under the Island 

Council and the income that each island receives is utilized on their individual island. 

</span></div><div><span>Apart  from  what  has  been  allocated,  there  are  also  funding  that  is  available  from  overseas  to 

support  our  agriculture.    The  support  come  in  various  forms  and  some  of  these  funds  goes  to

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Some Members have mentioned earlier that some of our children today do not want to put their 

hands in the soil.  We are trying to revive the planting programs in our Primary Schools and also 

the Secondary schools.  These programs have been introduced in our primary schools. 

</span></div><div><span>On  Rarotonga,  our  staff  are  doing  a  good  job  in  running  the  nursery  and  there  are  over  50 

employees, both males and females helping to grow seedlings and flower cuttings.  Apart from the 

planting area, there is also the livestock area, the biodiversity division responsible for pest control 

and our borders.  I would like to correct the Member of Parliament for Matavera that there are only 

four staff responsible for the Corporate Services.   

</span></div><div><span>I welcome every contribution, recommendation and solutions  that has  been put  forward in  this 

House by the Members.  Thank you.
