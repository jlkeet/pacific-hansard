<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you to the Member for Tamarua for this question.  In short, the 

current  budget  that  we  have  does  not  entertain  the  thought  about  re-introducing  our  </span><span>Teacher’s 

</span><span>Training College.  However, staff within the Ministry are currently consulting the next 10-year 

plan for the Ministry of Education.  If the appetite and the emphasis within the next 10-year plan 

is encouraging our Government of the day to re-introduce our Teachers Training College, then I 

can anticipate that happening in the next master plan for the Ministry of Education.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, my understanding is the Ministry of Education is travelling around the Outer Islands to 

</span><span>undertake the consultation for this 10-year plan and if our Members in the Outer Islands or anybody 

</span><span>listening  to  this  discussion  to  please  see  our  Ministry  of  Education  and  encourage  them  to  re-

</span><span>introduce the Teacher’s Training College.  I hope this answers the question.  Thank yo</span><span>u. 

</span></div>
