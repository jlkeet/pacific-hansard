<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Speaker and greetings to all Members of this House.  

I have a Supplementary Question for the Minister of Education but before that, thank you for your 

explanations for what is being done for our education system.  My question Minister is, if there 

are any plans to re-start the Teachers Training College.  At the moment, the training and the studies 

are coming out of USP and I believe that this is a good thing.  But the idea that I want to raise is 

that the students should start off with the thought that they want to become teachers.  That is the 

question that I want to ask.
