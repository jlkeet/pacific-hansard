<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister for Education.  I 

was listening to his financial statement report from his office and they were excellent.  It was an 

indication to the Minister of Finance for an increase in my allocation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is regarding the training of our teachers for our schools.  I believe that this is a problem 

faced by our schools with over 27 vacancies for teachers. 

</span></div>
<div><span>According to the Report by the Ministry of Education, an allocation is available to sponsor only 

</span><span>three individuals for a teacherâ€™s training.  What about the remaining 20 plus vacant positions that 

</span><span>needs refilling? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore  Honourable  Minister,  are  you  going  to  recruit  more  teachers  and  is  there  funding 

</span><span>available to sponsor for teachers training for these vacancies?
