<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>Question Time is for half an hour.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister for Education.  I 

was listening to his financial statement report from his office and they were excellent.  It was an 

indication to the Minister of Finance for an increase in my allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is regarding the training of our teachers for our schools.  I believe that this is a problem 

faced by our schools with over 27 vacancies for teachers. 

</span></div><div><span>According to the Report by the Ministry of Education, an allocation is available to sponsor only 

</span><span>three individuals for a teacher’s training.  What about the remaining 20 plus vacant positions that 

</span><span>needs refilling? 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore  Honourable  Minister,  are  you  going  to  recruit  more  teachers  and  is  there  funding 

</span><span>available to sponsor for teachers training for these vacancies?

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and  I see the Honourable Minister and  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Good afternoon to you and thank you very much 

to the question from the Member of Matavera.  Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Education has one of 

the highest staffing level all over the Cook Islands.  At present, we have 405 registered staff within 

the Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the biggest challenges for not only the Ministry of Education right across the board is the 

recruitment  and  staffing  level  of  each  Government  Ministry.    While  we  are  worried  about  27 

teachers within the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health is looking for about 80 staff to 

fulfil their role. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  in  terms  of  recruitment,  the  recruitment  process  for  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  always 

ongoing.  We have heard all the complaints and concerns of our people moving overseas to New 

Zealand and Australia; they are there to seek greener pastures. 

</span></div><div><span>We have heard the Prime Minister say that we are third behind Australia and New Zealand in terms 

of the Minimum Wage rate, so in comparison with every other Pacific island, while we are the 

third within the region  in  terms  of Minimum Wage, we will always have this challenge of our 

young people migrating. 

</span></div><div><span>We are now in the situation where we are importing teachers from overseas.  Some from Fiji, some 

from Samoa and some, from Tonga.  The Deputy Principal for Tereora now is from Fiji.  This is 

not to look down on our friends from overseas, but this is to send a strong message to our people 

that we are truly short of staff within the Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>I have met with the Minister of Education for Fiji, Honourable Aseri Radrodro and when I asked 

him that we have a shortage of teachers here in the Cook Island</span><span>s, his straight answer was, “how 

</span><span>many do you want?  Thirty or 40?  What level of teachers would you want?  Secondary, Primary 

</span><span>or Early Childhood?  Would you want single teachers or married teachers?”  Therefore, for the 

</span><span>information of our people, the help from our friends if we look at our regional relations, we will 

get help if we ask for those help. 

</span></div><div><span>If you look at what we are doing locally, we do have our ongoing USP extension studies where 

some of our teachers are currently undertaking educational courses through extension.  Some are 

</span><span>undertaking their teacher’s application course with New  Zealand.   However, that still does not 

</span><span>resolve the shortage that we have in the Ministry of Education.  It is best for our Ministry to work 

</span><span>with the Form 7 or Year 13 students of our Tereora College and to recruit as many as they can 

from these students that are in Year 13.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today, as we speak, there is a Careers Day at the Auditorium.  This is the door for 

entry where all of our Government Ministries are enticing and encouraging new and our young 

people to apply for any of these positions within Government. 

</span></div><div><span>So in short, to answer my good friend’s question, we need to encourage our people to work, to 

</span><span>study, work and apply within the Cook Islands.  I hope that have clarified my answer.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Tetangi 

Matapo; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Speaker and greetings to all Members of this House.  

I have a Supplementary Question for the Minister of Education but before that, thank you for your 

explanations for what is being done for our education system.  My question Minister is, if there 

are any plans to re-start the Teachers Training College.  At the moment, the training and the studies 

are coming out of USP and I believe that this is a good thing.  But the idea that I want to raise is 

that the students should start off with the thought that they want to become teachers.  That is the 

question that I want to ask. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister Mokoroa. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you to the Member for Tamarua for this question.  In short, the 

current  budget  that  we  have  does  not  entertain  the  thought  about  re-introducing  our  </span><span>Teacher’s 

</span><span>Training College.  However, staff within the Ministry are currently consulting the next 10-year 

plan for the Ministry of Education.  If the appetite and the emphasis within the next 10-year plan 

is encouraging our Government of the day to re-introduce our Teachers Training College, then I 

can anticipate that happening in the next master plan for the Ministry of Education.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, my understanding is the Ministry of Education is travelling around the Outer Islands to 

</span><span>undertake the consultation for this 10-year plan and if our Members in the Outer Islands or anybody 

</span><span>listening  to  this  discussion  to  please  see  our  Ministry  of  Education  and  encourage  them  to  re-

</span><span>introduce the Teacher’s Training College.  I hope this answers the question.  Thank yo</span><span>u. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and all Members of this House, greetings 

</span><span>to you all.  To those people listening to the radio and watching the livestream, Kia Orana.  My 

</span><span>question is directed to the Minister Responsible for Parliamentary Services.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday  there  was  a  mention  in  the  House  on  Ministerial  travels  overseas  on  Government 

businesses. The comments were that these travels are fully funded.  Therefore, my interpretation 

is that there are no expenditures from the Government coffer to cover any travel expenses.  I am 

requesting the Minister to give an in-depth explanation on this because when we look at the budget, 

funds have been put aside for Ministerial travels.  However, if I may assist in that, I am aware that 

all Ministers and Members travelling overseas have to account for and declare any expenses they 

make to Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>So, I stand to be corrected Minister on what I heard you said in the House yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you.    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker,  Clerk  and  all  your  staff 

including all our people and us Members.  

</span></div><div><span>In response to the question from the Leader of the Opposition, I can recall mentioning yesterday 

that some of the overseas travels are paid.  I also believe this is not confidential because they are 

included in the allocations under the Civil List in the House.  This also goes to the travels of Heads 

of Ministries.  However, some of the travels are funded from abroad.  Some also come from within 

their allocated budgets. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This is a Supplementary Question.  Sorry, Minister, I did not 

hear the second part you mentioned in your reply.  

</span></div><div><span>Despite that the reason I asked the question is because we are aware that in the budget, the sum of 

$200,000 has been allocated for Ministerial travels.  However, in half the year or during the course 

of the year in the last three years, it appears Parliament has to ask for another top up of $200,000 

or more.  So, to me, when you mentioned the fully funded travel for Ministers, that did not sound 

right to my ears because we all know that Parliament keeps a schedule on Ministers and Members 

travels.  So, there is no reason for Parliament to come back asking for another top up of $200,000 

or so.  

</span></div><div><span>I was intending to ask you to explain to us regardless if it is fully funded but under the Civil List, 

the Ministers and Members of Parliament are entitled to allowances above the fully funded trips.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So, I am saying some of the Ministers and Members travelling overseas are accumulating expenses 

in excess of $60,000 even up to $100,000.  So, please, if this can be explained so our people can 

hear and understand when we say fully funded, that it does not mean that money from the Civil 

List is not being used. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  The Honourable Leader of the Opposition, as stated that there are Ministers 

receiving allowances of $70 thousand, $80 thousand, $100 thousand.  Can she please verify those 

instead of just throwing figures in this House and who these Ministers are? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Prime  Minister.    That  is  a  question  on  top  of  a 

question.  Prime Minister, I want to explain to you that I did ask Parliament Services to prepare a 

spreadsheet  showing  all  the  expenses  of  everyone  that  travelled  overseas.    I  do  have  that 

spreadsheet and it supports my $100,000 figure, my $70,000 figure but I can name them if you 

want me to name them.  You, yourself Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can we leave that between you two? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  No, I think the public is entitled; he has asked the question and 

I am answering the question and the public is entitled to know.  Your total allowance including 

everything is about $85,500 plus $27,300.  That makes it to about $110,000-$112,000.  And, yours 

Minister of Parliamentary Services is about $74,300 and that is the reason why Prime Minister I 

was bothered with the statement of fully funded because it suggests that there is no money coming 

</span><span>out of the Government’s pocket.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Leader. I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  So,  it  appears  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is 

bothered  and  tried  to  disguise  a  question  based  on  information  that  has  been  provided  by  the 

Parliamentary Services.  Which trip was that that incurred these costs is my question to the Leader 

of the Opposition? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span> I just wanted to clarify that the request to Parliament came from 

me.    And  the  reason  for  that  Prime  Minister  is  our  new  Standing  Orders  requires  the  PAC  to 

</span><span>investigate spending’s of Parliamentary Services.  It is not yet on our agenda, but it is one of the 

</span><span>duties that we have to perform.  But let me answer your question, the issue is not about how many 

</span><span>trips, the issue here is that there is money coming out of the Government’s purse to pay for the 

</span></div><div><span>252 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>trips.  I am not complaining about the trips, that is not the issue.  Well, what we should be telling 

our public is although trips are fully funded, they are nevertheless entitled under the Civil List to 

certain entitlements.  And that is why we allow $400,000 from our purse to meet those cost.  I 

hope I answered the question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    We  have  come  to  the  end  of  our  Question  Time.    Thank  you  Honourable 

Members.
