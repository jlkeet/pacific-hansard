</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $636,267 for Business Trade and Investment Board stands part of the 

Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand before you to give my support to this Vote Item 

for the Business Trade and Investment Board and all the work that will be carried out under this 

Vote Item.   

</span></div><div><span>I was thinking of asking a question to the Minister of BTIB during the Oral Questions, however, 

we are now debating this Appropriation now.  When I look at Output 1, it says:  

</span></div><div><span>Ensure that the revolving fund is sustainable and encourage and support local business. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  had  a  look  at  the  programs  under  the  appropriations  for  the  years 

2019/2020/2021/2022.  

</span></div><div><span>Under Program 1 for those years, it says: 

</span></div><div><span>Agriculture Development Fund and also under this program is Sustainable Export Fund.  

</span></div><div><span>Why I am looking at the past Appropriations is at the allocation for the Vanilla Fund.  Therefore, 

the question that  I  was  going to  ask the Minister was whether anything  has been done for this 

setup, especially the soft loan of the Agriculture fund.  During the COVID pandemic era, we know 

that 3 percent were allocated to those who take out loans under BTIB.  When we were actually hit 

by COVID, the Government dropped that to 1 percent.  Today, I believe our people are taking out 

</span><span>loans and this applies to the Outer Islands on the allocations of the Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>I am happy Mr Speaker that BTIB has reintroduced this program so our people can take out loans 

to develop and improve their businesses.  I know with the influence of the Minister, he was able 

</span><span>restore the allocations in this year’s Appropriation.  I want to thank the Min</span><span>ister Albert Nicholas 

on finding solutions since the COVID outbreak to help our people by reintroducing this allocation.  

However, what I am looking at now is the BTIB Board; perhaps the Minister can review the value 

and qualifications of their Board Members in providing the required assistance for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I give my support for this Vote Item for BTIB.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Tetangi 

Matapo; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, I give my support for BTIB.  Secondly, I 

would also like to thank the BTIB trainers for the workshops held in the Outer Islands especially 

in Mangaia.  I support the contents of their booklet because I went to their workshop and inside it, 

it states, </span><span>The Significant achievements.</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  increase  of  quality  business  training  in  the  Outer  Islands  is  one  of  the  main 

objectives taught by the trainers at the beginning of this month.  The trainers were happy at the 

introduction phase of the workshop and during the follow up phase afterwards.  In the past, after a 

workshop, that is it, there are no follow-up. 

</span></div><div><span>These days, we see a change, which aligns to what they are saying about this Ministry; to support 

those that attends the workshops.  We learnt the breakdowns on appropriations when managing a 

small business.  I believe that assistance is required for this area in the Outer Islands.  Therefore, I 

am support the allocations for this Vote Item, especially the support provided for small businesses 

in the Outer Islands.  My request is for this to continue and for those needing assistance in the 

future.  Therefore, I wanted to thank Mama Teroro, Papa Seta and Mama Rima for the work you 

did in Mangaia.  Surely, carrying out these tasks by our people when opening up small businesses 

can be demanding because of lack of funding but resources are available on the island.  

</span></div><div><span>This is why I support this Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  This is one of the Agencies or Ministries 

that had no change in their Budget allocation.  We should not however take that to mean that this 

</span><span>is not an important arm of Government.  In fact, during these hard times, we should be looking at 

</span><span>BTIB to step up on the promotion of foreign investments. 

</span></div><div><span>I understand that the focus is on the local and that has been the focus in a normal climate and this 

is  not  a  normal  climate.   I  would  ask  the  Minister  if  there  is  an  opportunity  to  have  the  BTIB 

Officials meet with the various stakeholders to talk about a way forward for foreign investments 

and in particular with looking at the barriers that are in place that may be made flexible a bit. 

</span></div><div><span>I say this, Mr Minister because recently, I had some discussions with representatives of one of the 

</span><span>mining companies who has an exploratory license and it became plain to me that there may be 

</span></div><div><span>271 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>either little understanding of how the certainty in the company needed to expand to inject money 

back into the company to be able to be floating out there. 

</span></div><div><span>And because we already have rules in place and there was no discretion to bend the rules a bit to 

accommodate the situation in this climate, it became very difficult.  And so, while I support the 

allocation  for  this  Vote Item,  my  request  maybe  in  the  next  four  years  starting  now  is  that  we 

should have a look at the rules and try and accommodate situations that will assist us get out with 

our recovery plan. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  note  the  comments  and  the  views  of  the 

Honourable Member across the Floor and I must say that I totally concur with her views. 

</span></div><div><span>But  may  I  share  with  this  Honourable  House  Mr  Speaker,  what  I  truly  believe  is  the  spirit  of 

</span><span>BTIB’s r</span><span>ole.  Whether it is legislated like this, but this is what I believe, what its role is.  I believe, 

Mr Speaker the role of BTIB is to open its doors and our doors to foreign investment and at the 

same time, safeguarding the interest and businesses of our own people. 

</span></div><div><span>And we so have challenges Mr Speaker, like the Honourable Member has shared just earlier.  But 

may I share with us that those challenges are challenges because we have hit certain brick walls in 

our regulations or policies that are put in place pretty much to safeguard our own people. 

</span></div><div><span>But I agree Mr Speaker, we are moving into the future and we must find common ground for both 

the foreign investor and the local partnership.  Mr Speaker, BTIB has three core outputs as outlined 

by  the  Development  Investment  Act  1995/96  and  these  core  outputs,  Mr  Speaker  are  foreign 

</span><span>investments, business development and trade.  And may I touch on these outputs Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Our foreign investment, Mr Speaker, we have currently 118 foreign investors in country and this 

is  12 percent  reduction  Mr Speaker,  from  the start of this financial  year and that reduction Mr 

Speaker is a result of the awarding of PRs that we had last year.  As you are probably aware Mr 

Speaker that once you are awarded a PR status, you no longer fall under foreign investment. 

</span></div><div><span>And so, that is part of the cause of the 12 percent reduction Mr Speaker.  As we are also aware that 

</span><span>there are only two islands in the Cook Islands that have predominantly foreign investors, which is 

</span><span>Rarotonga and Aitutaki.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker, investment continue to focus on the tourism industry but recently, investments in 

other areas such as the Seabed Minerals and Telecommunications areas have taken interest from 

foreign investors.  So, I note Mr Speaker we are running out of time, so I think we all understand 

what BTIB is about and I will bring this conversation to an end, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker and thank you to all of us for supporting this appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>   Thank you Honourable Minister and for your understanding. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $636,267 for Business Trade and Investment Board stands part of the 

Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have come to the end of a very busy day.  Parliament will now adjourn 

until tomorrow, Thursday 22</span><span>nd</span><span> June 2023 at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>May I ask an Honourable Member to close us with a Prayer please? 

</span></div><div><span>CLOSING PRAYER
