<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday  there  was  a  mention  in  the  House  on  Ministerial  travels  overseas  on  Government 

businesses. The comments were that these travels are fully funded.  Therefore, my interpretation 

is that there are no expenditures from the Government coffer to cover any travel expenses.  I am 

requesting the Minister to give an in-depth explanation on this because when we look at the budget, 

funds have been put aside for Ministerial travels.  However, if I may assist in that, I am aware that 

all Ministers and Members travelling overseas have to account for and declare any expenses they 

make to Parliament.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I stand to be corrected Minister on what I heard you said in the House yesterday. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you.
