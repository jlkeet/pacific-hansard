<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Good afternoon to you and thank you very much 

to the question from the Member of Matavera.  Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Education has one of 

the highest staffing level all over the Cook Islands.  At present, we have 405 registered staff within 

the Ministry. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One of the biggest challenges for not only the Ministry of Education right across the board is the 

recruitment  and  staffing  level  of  each  Government  Ministry.    While  we  are  worried  about  27 

teachers within the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health is looking for about 80 staff to 

fulfil their role. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So,  in  terms  of  recruitment,  the  recruitment  process  for  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  always 

ongoing.  We have heard all the complaints and concerns of our people moving overseas to New 

Zealand and Australia; they are there to seek greener pastures. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We have heard the Prime Minister say that we are third behind Australia and New Zealand in terms 

of the Minimum Wage rate, so in comparison with every other Pacific island, while we are the 

third within the region  in  terms  of Minimum Wage, we will always have this challenge of our 

young people migrating. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We are now in the situation where we are importing teachers from overseas.  Some from Fiji, some 

from Samoa and some, from Tonga.  The Deputy Principal for Tereora now is from Fiji.  This is 

not to look down on our friends from overseas, but this is to send a strong message to our people 

that we are truly short of staff within the Ministry. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I have met with the Minister of Education for Fiji, Honourable Aseri Radrodro and when I asked 

him that we have a shortage of teachers here in the Cook Island</span><span>s, his straight answer was, “how 

</span><span>many do you want?  Thirty or 40?  What level of teachers would you want?  Secondary, Primary 

</span><span>or Early Childhood?  Would you want single teachers or married teachers?”  Therefore, for the 

</span><span>information of our people, the help from our friends if we look at our regional relations, we will 

get help if we ask for those help. 

</span></div>
<div><span>If you look at what we are doing locally, we do have our ongoing USP extension studies where 

some of our teachers are currently undertaking educational courses through extension.  Some are 

</span><span>undertaking their teacher’s application course with New  Zealand.   However, that still does not 

</span><span>resolve the shortage that we have in the Ministry of Education.  It is best for our Ministry to work 

</span><span>with the Form 7 or Year 13 students of our Tereora College and to recruit as many as they can 

from these students that are in Year 13.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, today, as we speak, there is a Careers Day at the Auditorium.  This is the door for 

entry where all of our Government Ministries are enticing and encouraging new and our young 

people to apply for any of these positions within Government. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So in short, to answer my good friend’s question, we need to encourage our people to work, to 

</span><span>study, work and apply within the Cook Islands.  I hope that have clarified my answer.  Thank you.
