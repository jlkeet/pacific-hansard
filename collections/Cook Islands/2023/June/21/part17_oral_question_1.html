<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand before you to give my support to this Vote Item 

for the Business Trade and Investment Board and all the work that will be carried out under this 

Vote Item.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I was thinking of asking a question to the Minister of BTIB during the Oral Questions, however, 

we are now debating this Appropriation now.  When I look at Output 1, it says:  

</span></div>
<div><span>Ensure that the revolving fund is sustainable and encourage and support local business. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  had  a  look  at  the  programs  under  the  appropriations  for  the  years 

2019/2020/2021/2022.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Under Program 1 for those years, it says: 

</span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture Development Fund and also under this program is Sustainable Export Fund.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Why I am looking at the past Appropriations is at the allocation for the Vanilla Fund.  Therefore, 

the question that  I  was  going to  ask the Minister was whether anything  has been done for this 

setup, especially the soft loan of the Agriculture fund.  During the COVID pandemic era, we know 

that 3 percent were allocated to those who take out loans under BTIB.  When we were actually hit 

by COVID, the Government dropped that to 1 percent.  Today, I believe our people are taking out 

</span><span>loans and this applies to the Outer Islands on the allocations of the Appropriation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I am happy Mr Speaker that BTIB has reintroduced this program so our people can take out loans 

to develop and improve their businesses.  I know with the influence of the Minister, he was able 

</span><span>restore the allocations in this yearâ€™s Appropriation.  I want to thank the Min</span><span>ister Albert Nicholas 

on finding solutions since the COVID outbreak to help our people by reintroducing this allocation.  

However, what I am looking at now is the BTIB Board; perhaps the Minister can review the value 

and qualifications of their Board Members in providing the required assistance for our people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I give my support for this Vote Item for BTIB.  Thank you.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Tetangi 

Matapo; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MRS. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, I give my support for BTIB.  Secondly, I 

would also like to thank the BTIB trainers for the workshops held in the Outer Islands especially 

in Mangaia.  I support the contents of their booklet because I went to their workshop and inside it, 

it states, </span><span>The Significant achievements.</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  increase  of  quality  business  training  in  the  Outer  Islands  is  one  of  the  main 

objectives taught by the trainers at the beginning of this month.  The trainers were happy at the 

introduction phase of the workshop and during the follow up phase afterwards.  In the past, after a 

workshop, that is it, there are no follow-up. 

</span></div>
<div><span>These days, we see a change, which aligns to what they are saying about this Ministry; to support 

those that attends the workshops.  We learnt the breakdowns on appropriations when managing a 

small business.  I believe that assistance is required for this area in the Outer Islands.  Therefore, I 

am support the allocations for this Vote Item, especially the support provided for small businesses 

in the Outer Islands.  My request is for this to continue and for those needing assistance in the 

future.  Therefore, I wanted to thank Mama Teroro, Papa Seta and Mama Rima for the work you 

did in Mangaia.  Surely, carrying out these tasks by our people when opening up small businesses 

can be demanding because of lack of funding but resources are available on the island.  

</span></div>
<div><span>This is why I support this Vote Item.  Thank you.
