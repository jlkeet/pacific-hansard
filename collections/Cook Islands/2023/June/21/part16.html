<div><span>AUDIT (PERCA): 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,272,654 stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open to any Members.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Vote Item.  

</span><span>Firstly, Mr Speaker, I give my support to this Vote Item.  I would like to give my thanks to the 

Head of this Ministry because he was also responsible in giving advice to the Public Accounts 

Committee in our meetings.  He was also responsible for guiding us on the layouts and extents of 

the reports especially on the allocation of funds and what is being done.  I believe this son of ours 

is very confident on his responsibilities in the Audit office.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  today  I  am  looking  at  the  responsibilities  of  PERCA  because  we  can  see  the 

</span><span>outstanding outputs by the PAC as this committee is closely scrutinizing the jobs that are being 

</span><span>done correctly and those done incorrectly.  It was explained to us that the function of PERCA is

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>just to investigate; but they cannot penalize any wrongdoings.  Maybe Government can look in 

what PERCA and Audit is doing.   

</span></div><div><span>Another thing we are closely watching Prime Minister is that I believe the Audit Office should be 

merged under Parliament Services because we can see the allocations we are considering is carried 

out by Parliament.  So, we can say the function of Audit is to investigate those spending money 

without accounting for it as opposed to those that are accounting for the spending.  This is my 

impression to Government to consider whether we should continue with PERCA or look at PAC 

who is actively looking into the spending of Government.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to commend the Chairman of PAC and the committee members because 

some excuses were received from of the Heads of Ministries on what authority does PAC have 

and the qualifications of the Members.  I want our people to know that within this committee, there 

are  two  lawyers,  the  Chairman  Honourable  Tingika  Elikana  and  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne.  Also, in this Committee are three former Heads of Ministries.  We have 

the Honourable Tingika Elikana, Former Solicitor General and Head for the Ministry of Justice, 

Honourable Sonny Williams a Former Head for the Ministry of Cultural Development and for a 

very  long  term,  and  then  we  have  myself,  Honourable  Vaitoti  Tupa,  Head  of  Ministry  for 

Environment Services for 15 years.   

</span></div><div><span>Some of the Members own businesses, who have also been running businesses.  For example, the 

Honourable Teokotai Herman, Honourable Tehani  Brown of Super Brown, Honourable Robert 

Heather, Mayor from Puaikura and also involved in the running of the T&amp;M Heather business.  

</span></div><div><span>What then is this question being asked on their ability to run this Committee?  To our people, you 

have heard that this a robust Committee that has been authorized by Parliament to look into the 

spending that this Parliament has allocated to the Ministries.  

</span></div><div><span>In closing Mr Speaker, I give my full support to Appropriation under this Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Tingika Elikana; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I offer my comments regarding this Vote 

Item, I would like to, with  your indulgence, say some words, which I should have said when I 

talked about the merits and principles of this budget.   

</span></div><div><span>My friend the Member for Matavera has crossed over it but I think it is better that I express our 

</span><span>sincere gratitude and thanks to the Director of Audit for the assistance that he has provided to the 

PAC Committee.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Like everybody that I have acknowledged previously, he had diligently provided the Committee 

with impartial advice.  Therefore, the Committee is very grateful and thankful to the Director of 

Audit, Mr Desmond Wildin. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my full support to the allocation, allocated for the PERCA Vote Item.  

Understanding our financial situation that we are facing now, and the fact that this is a Nurturing 

Budget,  as  we  work  our  way  out  of  the  difficulties  that  we  face  because  of  the  COVID-19 

pandemic, I think the allocation highlighted in the budget appropriation is sufficient and just for 

PERCA at this moment. 

</span></div><div><span>I, as Chairman for the PAC Committee, would have loved an increase in their appropriation but I 

am always guided by the principle of what our nation can afford.  As I previously said in my talk 

on the merits and principles, we have to live within our means and affordability is a major principle 

that we must look up to. 

</span></div><div><span>But it will be remiss of me if not to say something about the independence of the Audit office and 

the need of maintaining it and the need to eliminate perceptions that will make people think that 

this office is controlled by Government.  I am thankful for the Government of the day, particularly 

to the Minister of Audit and the previous Ministers that had the opportunity to provide and guide 

the Audit office, for they have not interfered with the operation and work of the Audit office. 

</span></div><div><span>Unfortunately, the structure for the office highlighted some areas of concern, particularly where 

there is a Minister for the Audit Department.  As I have alluded earlier on that in the misperception 

that Ministers influence the work of that office.   

</span></div><div><span>During our deliberations on our Report, we did seek the advice of the New Zealand Audit office 

and they have provided some very good advice as to how we avoid that misperception; and that is 

something we will be taking up with the Minister and Government concerning the structure of the 

</span><span>Audit office.   

</span></div><div><span>Notwithstanding the minimal increase in the Budget for the Audit office, its worth as dramatically 

increased because of the PAC review that has taken place.  You just have to look at page 27 of the 

PAC Report to know the compliance rate and the non-compliance rate amongst our Ministries, 

Government  entities  and  state-owned  enterprises.    As  these  are  new  developments,  we  look 

forward to the next round of the budget where we could present a more full report in terms of the 

</span><span>work of Audits’ department and its efforts to provide this Parliament with an up to date Report 

</span><span>regarding the financials of this country.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Notwithstanding that, Mr Speaker, I offer my full support for the allocation for the Audit Office.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I agree that because we have a lean 

budget, even though we would like to have a much better increase in the allocation for PERCA, 

but we need to live within our means.  There is not much we can do if the purse does not allow us 

to provide for that increase. 

</span></div><div><span>I am however pleased that the small increase of $50,000 given to PERCA to allow it to host the 

25</span><span>th</span><span> Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Conference later this year, has been allocated.  This is 

good for our country and it will upskill our Audit office. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, ever since I have been in Parliament, I have witnessed Reports after Reports made by 

PERCA  and  what  happens  is  that  PERCA  investigates  complaints  and  under  the  law,  they  are 

obliged to file a report that is to be tabled in Parliament.  Moreover, what was most interesting for 

me was that once it was tabled in Parliament, that is it.  No further discussions; into archives and 

dust sets in. 

</span></div><div><span>What is most interesting is that the Minister in Charge does not quite get up and say, “well look, 

</span><span>we nee</span><span>d to talk about this Report.”  Do not get me wrong, I am not criticising the Minister, I am 

</span><span>just saying that this is the process that has happened over the last three or four years. 

</span></div><div><span>I  think  one  would  say  what  a  waste  of  money  to  pay  the  PERCA  Committee  allowances  for 

investigating and then nothing happens.  Now, what has happened now is with the new Standing 

Orders, we have the first lot of PERCA Reports that were referred to PAC and is now become a 

part  of  the  PAC  Report  that  has  been  tabled.    It  has  resulted  in  recommendations  that  are  far 

</span><span>reaching. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, we see that it is now worthwhile for PERCA to investigate complaints and make a Report.  

I know that during one of the PAC meetings, I enquired as to what fees, the level of fees that is 

been paid to the PERCA Chairman and also, Members of that Committee because when I read the 

Reports, 

</span></div><div><span>To me, it seemed like a lot of work had been put into investigating the complaints and when it 

</span><span>came to the PAC having their discussions about the PERCA Reports it was really important to me 

</span><span>personally that there be a consequence otherwise waste of time, waste of money.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 21 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I too am pleased with the way the PAC did their report and I am particularly pleased with my 

adviser on my left announcing to the public the experience of Members of PAC.  He referred to 

all the qualifications except no one in the PAC has an accounting degree and it is not necessary 

</span><span>because our advisor is from the Audit Office.  And further I don’t believe that we needed to be 

</span><span>accountants because we also have our own businesses and we can count one dollar plus one dollar 

equals two dollars. 

</span></div><div><span>And whilst I would like given the matters that have been referred to in the PAC Report especially 

on page 27, it is just amazing what those stats show us; it says </span><span>Report not submitted, Report not 

submitted</span><span> and it is so repetitive. 

</span></div><div><span>So, there is going to be a lot of work going forward for the Audit Office and for PAC and I believe 

that the Audit Office and the Members on the PERCA Committee will have to consider working 

for the love of the country just to see us through these hard times and of course the end result that 

we are all hoping to achieve is that every Ministry will be compliant.   

</span></div><div><span>There is only one request that I would like to make, it is not a monetary request, unlike my friends, 

and one of the matters that keep arising or keep being mentioned in PERCA Reports is the non-

cooperation of people that are under investigation.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask the Ministers who are the bosses of these Ministries to get some assistance by 

directing  your  Officials  or  your  staff  members  to  co-operate  with  these  investigations.  

Unfortunately, the arrogance demonstrated by some of the Government Officials is just beyond 

me and a simple nudge from the Ministers in Charge I am sure will push the matter along.  Thank 

you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Leader of the Opposition; your Accountant is on your left.  I see the 

Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  After looking around and nobody want to stand 

</span><span>up, maybe because they had a big lunch so I thought I will stand.   

</span></div><div><span>Hon. Members, I thank you all for your comments and stand beside you to give full support to the 

Audit Office upcoming financial year.  As we are well aware the work of the Audit Office is crucial 

</span><span>in ensuring the accountability of public funds.  While I commend Hon. Member Vaitoti’s view to 

</span><span>bring PERCA under Parliament, we are reminded that the Audit Office must remain independent.  

In other words, they must remain separated from any public or State services.   

</span></div><div><span>Audit independence is part of the foundation of the auditing profession.  An independent, reliable 

and  ethically  sound  audit.    It  gives  the  Office  credibility  and  allows  the  public  to  trust  in  the

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>accuracy of the results and the integrity of the accounting and auditing profession and I would like 

to add that the Audit Office as many of the PAC Members have highlighted were part of the PAC 

Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Director, Mr Desmond Wildin and his good staff in taking all these tasks 

to hand. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I refer us to page 17 of Budget Book 2 and the most notable progressive achievement 

by Audit is the reducing of up to date audited financial statements from 41 in 2016 to 7 in 2022. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the proposed Budget before us for 2023/24 for the Office of Audit is $1,272,654 and 

as the Leader of the Opposition highlighted, $50 thousand of this will go towards the hosting of 

the PASAI Conference in June next year.  We anticipate about 80 plus delegates from 29 Audit 

Office in the Pacific Region including Australia and New Zealand visiting our shores. 

</span></div><div><span>This particular Organization is the regional organization that supports the development of Audit 

Office in the Pacific.  The last time the Cook Islands hosted this Conference was back in 2008. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, since 2017, our Office has been having a twining partnership with the Office of the 

Auditor  General  of  New  Zealand.    This  twining  partnership  helps  strengthen,  exchanges  of 

information and assistance and giving support to our local staff. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in February 2023, four of our Audit staff received their Certificate in Supreme Audit 

International Financial Certificate.  Another four staff will be graduating in August 2023.  Since 

2016 we have had six staff acquiring Chartered Accountant qualifications from within the Office.  

</span></div><div><span>Our Audit office will continue to work with Government entities in providing support and advice 

to improve Annual Reporting to Parliament to the Government Ministers.  

</span></div><div><span>On that note, I thank all for supporting this Budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,272,654 for Audit (PERCA) stands part of the Schedule?
