</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $5,870,267 for Internal Affairs  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I air my views on this Vote Item, I would firstly 

like to thank the Minister for ICI because of the question I asked yesterday and I was to tell you 

Mr Speaker that many people rang saying that this is the first time they have seen Government 

</span><span>being  so concerned  about  our waste management.  They  talked to  me about  the incinerator … 

</span><span>(interrupted) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can you come back on the Vote Item please?

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you.  Irrespective that the Vote Item for ICI has been passed, I give my 

appreciation  to  the  Minister,  so  our  people  can  hear  that  because  of  them  contacting  me,  I  am 

relaying that appreciation to the Minister of ICI. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I come back to the Internal Affairs.  Mr Speaker, I do not have any issues with this Vote 

Item, I truly give my support. 

</span></div><div><span>I have looked at this Vote Item for this period 2023/24 and I see that the Government have looked 

into  this  Appropriation  very  carefully  because  there  is  a  special  fund  appropriated  under 

beautification.  As we may be aware here on Rarotonga that the Government in the past allotted 

each Constituencies here the amount of $5,000 for beautification.  I know that the Government 

have withheld this appropriation this  year but  will reinstate it for the  years of 2025/26  and, an 

amount of $50,000.  I would like to urge the Government to not wait until 2025/26, but maybe for 

the next financial year 2024/25 and to distribute this amount to all the Constituencies of Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>This funding will pay those of our people responsible for cleaning our villages.  Mr Speaker this 

is one of the very beneficial allocations because they pay the people in our villages who are doing 

the cleaning of our roads and special sites.  This appropriation has helped pay those who cleaned 

our streams during wet and rainy season.  Also, the cutting of trees and clearing of the streams to 

prevent it from flooding. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, the Members of Parliament of the Constituencies are using their own money to clear the 

debris in their own villages.  I have four streams in my Constituency and I helped the Committee 

in funding for the clearing of these streams. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, to conclude, I fully support this Vote Item, believing that in 2024/25, the amount of 

$50,000 will be reinstated in our Budget to help the people in our villages for the beautification 

work they do.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Toanui 

</span><span>Isamaela; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  ISAMAELA:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  Kia  Orana  to  everyone  in  this  Honourable  House  this 

afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in regards to this Vote Item and before I give my support, I want to share my thoughts 

on this Appropriation.  I am not sure Mr Speaker if this allocation is enough for the Ministry but 

</span><span>we know that this is what the Government have proposed as the right amount for this year.  Maybe 

</span><span>the Government can consider an increase for next year?

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  thank  the  Minister  Albert  Nicholas  for  his  explanation  on  how the  Outer  Islands  are 

included in the plans for this Ministry; I am happy that my island of Aitutaki is in the pipeline.  

Therefore, I will patiently wait for this pledge for my island. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  work  carried  out  by  the  staff  of  this  Ministry  in 

Aitutaki, especially with what they do when requesting help from Rarotonga for our elderly and 

disabled people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, last month, we helped two families with their homes.  It is hard for me to explain the 

situation of this family and what their needs are but nevertheless, their homes has been renovated 

and it looks good.  This is exactly what I am talking about, the assistance that is needed from the 

Government.    Perhaps  the  issue  lies  with  the  staff  of  Internal  Affairs  in  Aitutaki,  they  need  to 

submit a submission to the Head Office of Internal Affairs for assistance for the people of Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>I am not accusing our Internal Affairs staff, maybe the problem is the people here in Rarotonga, 

and I cannot confirm where the problem is.  I am asking the Minister Responsible to hire more 

staff for Internal Affairs for Aitutaki.  My Honourable colleagues can confirm and will agree with 

me, on our island, there are homes with elderly people living inside these homes with no carers.  

There is a Disability van on our island with a driver whose job is to drive around the island and 

pick up our disabled clients to take them to the centre and to the hospital.  But what I am referring 

to Mr Speaker are the residential homes, for the elderly and disabled to be looked after and cared 

for. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I am asking the Government for someone, either a female or male to be caregivers to 

help these people and to keep their homes clean.  Mr Speaker, there are homes that we the three 

Members for Aitutaki are aware that is not in a living state for the elderly people.  I know of a 

young person in Are/Nikau when Pastor Charlie Taamo took a video of this person and posted on 

Facebook who was in need of help.  Hence why more staff is required for Internal Affairs so that 

they can visit and help these people. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  what  I  want  to  share  today,  the  problems  that  is  happening  in  Aitutaki  and  if  the 

Government can help.  Maybe the same situation applies for the other Outer Islands? 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, these are the things I want to share to the House and I support this Appropriation.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Tukaka Ama; you have 

</span><span>the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker and Members of this Honourable House, Kia Orana.  A special Kia 

Orana to my Constituency and the people of Ngatangiia and everyone else in the Cook Islands 

listening and watching to our Sssion today. 

</span></div><div><span>If I may Mr Speaker, I am reminded of our Devotion this morning by our Chaplain saying, </span><span>“I am 

</span><span>the Vine, you are the branches, if you remain in  me, we shall  reap and bear the fruits  of your 

</span><span>labour.”</span></div><div><span>I stand in support of this Appropriation for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  To be brief, I will just 

elaborate  on  one  of  the  most  important  changes  in  this  budget  which  I  note;  firstly,  a  $50,000 

increase in the Vaka Maintenance Programme.  Secondly, there is $25,000 increase in the power 

subsidy from 2023/24 to align with the current rates applied to the interium benefits. 

</span></div><div><span>Over  $250,000  increase  in  the  2023/24  and  over  $540,000  in  the  2024/25  to  support  increase 

payments  fo</span><span>r the  caregiver’s allowance.   And $76,746 increase in  the rate of destitute benefits 

</span><span>from 2023/24 to align with the current rates applied to the interium benefits.   

</span></div><div><span>That is the reason I have no hesitation to fully support this Vote Item for the Ministry of Internal 

Affairs.  Just as the Prime Minister has spoken about this budget, he said,  </span><span>“this is a Budget of 

Nurturing.”</span><span>  This is exactly what this Budget is allocations is doing and that is looking after our 

people. 

</span></div><div><span>On that note Mr Speaker, I support this allocation.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Robert Heather;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to all Honourable Members of this House, 

staff and all those listening in to our broadcast.  Sorry, Mr Speaker but it is obvious the Member 

</span><span>for Mitiaro and I never got the memo that it is a dark suit day today.  I only hope this has no effect 

</span><span>on our Appropriation today.   

</span></div><div><span>All jokes aside, I would like to briefly read something from  the Cook Islands Disability Policy 

</span><span>2020/25.  It states, ‘</span><span>People with disabilities up to recent times have been totally invisible in all 

areas and at all levels of development process of this country.  They are the most discriminated 

against  population  grou</span><span>p,  it’s  time  we  changed  some  of  our  values  and  understandings  with 

respect to those that have some form of disability’.</span></div><div><span>393

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My focus this afternoon Mr Speaker is we need to ensure and improve performance of service 

delivery.    We  have  difficulties  in  our  life  especially  with  our  elderly  people  and  our  disabled 

children.   

</span></div><div><span>To shorten my speech, I will just touch on some of the problems in this area which will help the 

Government to iron out these problems. 

</span></div><div><span>A new project has been established called the Rarotonga Home Health Care Services.  Some ladies 

from this organization are going into some homes to help look after our elderly folk.  There are no 

family members living with these elderly people so there is no one to care for them. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to thank Government for paying an allowance for caregivers to look after the sick and the 

elderly.  We know this is not sufficient as mentioned earlier by another Member.  I think more 

help should be forthcoming from government especially for people to go into the homes to help 

the vulnerable. 

</span></div><div><span>We have the NGOs, Creative Centre, Te Kainga Mental Health and others but they are not getting 

enough support in the way of funds and resources.  My time is up but I want to ask the Minister 

and person in charge of this area, to look into this because one day we will be in this situation.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Greetings Mr Speaker, Clerk of Parliament and your staff and all 

Honourable Members, greetings in the Name of our Lord and to all our people listening to the 

radio and watching the live stream, greetings to you all.  Greetings also to the Honourable Member 

for Penrhyn.  I also want to greet the two ladies from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  A special 

greeting  to  the  Secretary  of  Internal  Affairs  and  all  the  staff  on  Rarotonga  and  also  the  Outer 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  a  very  important  Ministry  in  our  country,  just  like  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  the 

Ministry  of  Health  and  the  main  aim  of  Government  in  allocating  this  sum  of  money  for  this 

Ministry is so it can provide good health and welfare for our people.  I think the name Nurturing 

Budget is very appropriate.   I thank all the views that have been expressed on this vote item and 

the support to improve and the views to make this Ministry even better. 

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  inform  the  House  that  the  sum  appropriated  for  Vaka  Maintenance  of  $450,000  per 

</span><span>annum is still in place.  I also wanted to inform the Member for Matavera that the $50,000 is an 

</span><span>increase on top but it will be available in the next budget.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I want to speak on the improvements that Government has given every year.  As of 1</span><span>st</span><span> July 2023, 

the Minimum Wage will increase by 50 cents to $9 per hour.  Even though this is only a small 

increase but still it is increasing slowly and now we have reached $9.00.  We will try and give an 

increase every year so our people can collect better wages. 

</span></div><div><span>There is also an increase in wages for the people caring for our elderly and disabled people.  This 

is not sufficient but an increase of another $100 per month have been approved and today they will 

collect $300 per month and next year there will be another increase of $100 and that makes $400 

for the caregivers. 

</span></div><div><span>For the widows, they will get an increase of $200 on top of what they are collecting now which is 

$200. 

</span></div><div><span>I want our people to understand there are many applications and there are also other areas that need 

to be increased but the Ministry is taking the slow approach because there is not sufficient funds 

but we are grateful for what Government is giving for these projects. 

</span></div><div><span>There are many branches under this Ministry.  This Ministry is also responsible for looking after 

</span><span>our NGO’s.  There are six NGO’s in the Cook Islands.  There is an amount of over $600,000</span><span> which 

will  be  shared  amongst  these  six  groups.    This  is  a  separate  amount  from  the  sum  that  is 

</span><span>appropriated for NGO’s every year.</span></div><div><span>So, I believe that the Government is looking after our people, our children, our elderly and disabled 

people.  There are some areas where we are not doing so well, as you have stated but this will help 

to improve matters.  The two ladies from the Internal Affairs is in the House and they will need to 

look into these important factors for the sake of the health of our people.  So, Mr Speaker I strongly 

support this increase for the Ministry of Internal Affairs that is in excess of $5,000,000 and also 

the allocations for the pensions.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $5, 870, 267 for Internal Affairs  

stands part of the Schedule?
