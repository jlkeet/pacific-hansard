</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I would have to say this is the first Budget where we have received such good collaboration with 

all  Members  of  the  House  especially  including  the  Members  of  the  Opposition.    I  think  this 

demonstrates, Mr Speaker the maturity that Members of this House have in ensuring that we put 

the interest of our country and our people first before ourselves. 

</span></div><div><span>So, allow me to offer my most gracious thanks to all Members of the Opposition for your support 

of this Budget that the Government has put through.  But I would also like to thank the Budget 

team who are listening in on this broadcast as they have over the last two weeks for their very hard 

work in preparing one of the toughest Budgets we have had to prepare even more so the fact that 

this Budget was prepared and driven by Cook Islanders, highly qualified in their field. 

</span></div><div><span>But that is not to say come Monday, let us take the gloves off and we are at it again.  And that is 

our job as the Government is to get the job done and the job of the Opposition is to make sure we 

get it done and keep us honest. 

</span></div><div><span>With those words Mr Speaker, I now move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Appropriation Bill for 2023 be now read a Third time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister, Vaine Mokoroa 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Clerk for the Third Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK:    </span><span>Long  Title:  An  Act  to  appropriate  certain  sums  of  money  out  of  the  Cook  Islands 

Government  Account  to  the  services  of  the  Year  Ending  on  30</span><span>th</span><span>  day  of  June  2024  and  to 

appropriate the supplies granted in this period.
