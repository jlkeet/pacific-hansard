<div><span>POLICE: 

</span></div><div><span>Police for 30 minutes.  

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6, 311, 333 for Police  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Good afternoon to all of us in the House.  

Those listening in on the radio and those watching on livestream, Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>Before I share my views on the Vote Item for Police, I would briefly like to mention on the previous 

Vote Item that has just been passed.  This is in appreciation to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for 

their assistance given to an elderly mama in Rakahanga.  I would like to commend the Internal 

Affairs Officer on Rakahanga for assisting this mama to fill in the application to build her a small 

shelter and also that it is self-contained. I think it is not appropriate that I should not complain but 

to give credit where it is due. So, thank you on behalf of the mama in Rakahanga.  

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to the Vote Item for Police. This is one Ministry I believe is underpaid.  When we 

look at the budget for this year, there is no increase for personnel.  Maybe because of the situation 

we are in where there is not enough money.  In terms of Policing, we need the Police and we need 

a good Police force.   

</span></div><div><span>What I like about the budget for Police is the $45,000 for training our police officers in the Pa 

Enua.  Even though the crime rate in the Pa Enua is low, we however have a new Police Officer 

appointed.  I am sure that he wants to go through a police-training program.  So, I am giving my 

</span><span>support to this Vote Item and I want the Minister to encourage the Commissioner to file in their 

</span><span>Performance  Reports  and  Financial  Statements.    I  say  this  particularly  in  respect  of  the  Police 

because we know that last year or the previous year, there were some activities in the Police maybe 

because their Financial Statements were not up to date.  Maybe that is a good reason why Financial 

Statements should be updated so that if anything goes wrong with the finance of the Ministry, it 

can  be  picked  up  very  early.    The  reason  why  I  am  saying  this  Minister  is  that  in  the  PAC 

Recommendations, any Ministry that is not performing will be referred to the Speaker and you 

will get a smack on the hand.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition. I see the Honourable Prime 

Minister; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much  Mr  Speaker.    I  think  for  the  comments  on  this 

particular Vote Item, I certainly agree that there are parts of the Police force that remain underpaid 

and certainly something that we look forward to rectify especially as we look to recruit new police 

officers  to  look  at  Police  as  a  career.    Of  course,  the  well  documented  issues  with  Police 

particularly in their  Finance Department  has highlighted some proper monitoring  and financial 

reporting to ensure these events do not occur again.  This is the importance of finance management 

Mr Speaker because it appears this year; the Police department have underspent their Personnel 

Allocation by a significant amount.  The underspending leads to poor financial control but this is 

something we are working with the Police department and Ministry of Finance to try and overcome 

this because the role of Police is not just their financial management.  

</span></div><div><span>Police have a very significant role in maintaining law and order in our country. The one thing we 

all need to understand is the In</span><span>dependence of Her Majesty’s Constabulary. The Police department 

</span><span>is  not  part  of  the  Public  Service  they  are  a  separate  establishment  so  that  their  function  of 

maintaining law and order is carried out with full independence so their hand cannot be smacked 

by  any  Members  of  these  Committees.    They  report  to  the  Minster  of  Police  and  it  is  the 

responsibility of the Police Minister to apply the appropriate measures required.  Thank you Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $6,311,333 for Police  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, it is time to suspend for lunch and we will continue with our business when 

</span><span>we return after the break.  The Sitting is suspended until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.29 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, please be seated.  I call the House to Order. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, the total time estimates debate has expired.  Pursuant to Standing Order 

</span><span>217, I forthwith put successively without debate the question of every departmental Vote not yet 

</span><span>disposed of.   All I need is your ‘aye’ from all the Members.</span></div><div><span>397
