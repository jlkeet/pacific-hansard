</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tim Varu.  I thought you are the leader of the United this afternoon.  I was 

supposing to call the Leader of the United Party because I promised him yesterday that I will call 

him first to finish his speech.  But I will have you Honourable Tim Varu; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your Parliamentary staff.  To all 

the Members in this House, greetings to you all.  Kia Orana to our Honourable Prime Minister and 

to us Members and Leaders on the Opposition side of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to all our people in the Cook Islands; those who are listening and watching our Sitting 

today. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  before  I  give  my  support  to  this  Vote  Item  for  Infrastructure  Cook  Islands,  I  am 

obliged to share my thoughts on this Vote Item because the headquarter office of this Ministry is 

in my Constituency of Ruaau.  In regards to this Ministry, they do a lot of development work for 

the island and they need to do much more for my Constituency.  

</span></div><div><span>But before I move to what I intend to share, I want to thank the Honourable Member for RAPPA, 

Honourable Albert Nicholas, the Minister and his ICI staff and the HoM.  We all know that this is 

one  of  the  hardworking  Ministry  in  Government.    We  know  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  is 

responsible for the maintenance of our public roads, the clearing of big trees that is a hazard to our 

public, our waste management; all located in my Constituency.  We know the work they do in 

renovating our roads around Rarotonga and other infrastructure works they do in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we know that many times when this Ministry have big projects in the Pa Enua, their 

staff would have to go and leave their families behind and the duration of being away could take 

a long time.  Mr Speaker, yesterday when I went passed the front of our CICC Church; the roads 

were  sealed  and  was  quite  smooth,  a  job  well  done  by  ICI.    The  road  was  only  half-complete 

yesterday and I think that they will complete the renovation today.  If only the road renovation 

started from Blackrock to the CICC Church, the road for my Constituency of Ruaau would have 

</span><span>been completed. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I can see the Minister Responsible for ICI walking out of the Chamber and I am not 

sure why he is  leaving  Parliament because my  query is  for him, which  concerns the people of 

Arorangi.  As you may have noticed, our roads in Arorangi are clear of debris and Arorangi looks 

so  clean  and  bright.    If  the  roads  were  properly  tarsealed,  Arorangi  would  have  looked  so 

magnificent.  Maybe, my comments will enlighten the Minister and the Government to consider 

our request for our village.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I want to inform the Minister and the Government that for any projects for my Constituency, I will 

not stop talking.  He might feel annoyed with me, but Mr Speaker, this is what the people of Ruaau 

and Puaikura are pleading for, the renovation of our roads and for our roads to be tarsealed. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  there  are  three  quarries  in  the  three  constituencies  of  Puaikura;  this  is  where  the 

gravels and metals are procured for the sealing of our Rarotonga roads.  Mr Speaker, our roads 

should be renovated and tarsealed first before the rest of Rarotonga because the metal gravels are 

from Puaikura.  Honourable Minister, you will be invoked with a special honour from Puaikura if 

you were to renovate our roads as this will create a historic memory because none of the previous 

Ministers from Government have carried out this development.  If you do it now, you will be the 

first to renovate our road, marking a good history for you.  This is why I keep repeating this and if 

this can be incorporated in the expenditure for July.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to support this Vote Item and if there is an increase later, I believe that it will be utilized to 

renovate the road.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Teokotai 

Herman; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, as per your salutation to our people watching our Sitting earlier, 

may that include mine as well.  

</span></div><div><span>I received a text message from a friend of mine in Aitutaki asking if I am present in Parliament or 

not as they have not heard me speak yet since Parliament convened today.  I told my friend that I 

am speaking to you now. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to speak on Output 4, Waste Management.  It says here that this Budget is to do with 

waste management for Rarotonga.  Although it did hint that they will be looking forward for this 

place to be a governing body for planning the waste management for all of the Cook Islands, but I 

</span><span>wanted  to  talk  about  the  waste  management  for  my  island  of  Aitutaki  and  ask  the  Minister  to 

</span><span>ascribe us to the waste management of Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>This morning, I had the opportunity to drive around the island with the Honourable Toa Isamaela 

and we ended up at the landfill and waste disposal centre in Arorangi.  I can see that Aitutaki will 

soon be in the same situation as Rarotonga where the area will soon be filled. 

</span></div><div><span>Our waste management was developed about 20 years ago.  There was a special plan for our waste 

</span><span>management.  A big hole was dug and a lining was put in.  The purpose of building this waste 

</span><span>management  of  ours  this  way  was  to  enable  the  water  that  will  fill  this  hole  pumped  into  the 

treatment plant.  However, Mr Speaker, from that day till today, that has never been done.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>It is very common for us in the Cook Islands that when that size of infrastructure is designed by 

the Government and then the project get handed to the Council with no support from Government 

to ensure the infrastructure is maintained properly.  This is our problem today Mr Speaker and I 

am sure that this problem is the same in all other outer islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I will not speak for a long time, but I just wanted to raise this issue and hopefully the Minister 

Responsible, who is a boy from Aitutaki but outside of this House, I am his Uncle.  I believe that 

he will look into this problem today and not tomorrow.  That concludes my speech Mr Speaker in 

support of this Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Wesley 

Kareroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. KAREROA:  </span><span>Greetings Mr Speaker and as mentioned before by the previous Speaker, 

may my greetings be added to his.  Right now, I have a special greeting for the Honourable Member 

Robert Tapaitau who is present in the House this afternoon.  I know that you have a Mangaian 

connection.  The Chief title for Mangaia is being held by one of your Ministers. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I want us to go through the appropriation for this Ministry.  I want to dig out some of the 

allocations that have not been spent.  There are four Outputs but I want to look at Output 2, the 

planning of projects for the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>When I look at this Output, there are a lot of money specified for this section for the Pa Enua.  The 

Output on Emergency Response Work, I will later clarify that this sum has been spent this week.  

The amount of $200 thousand has been set aside for emergency response.  The area of roads and 

drainage, a sum of $800 thousand has been set aside for this work and for administration, $700 

thousand.  I am looking at the $200 thousand and I believe it has not been utilized but I surely 

think that it fits this development for the island of Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>When I left Mangaia to attend this Parliament Sitting, my airport looks really good.  But when I 

</span><span>arrived here, the weather changed and it started raining and I believe that the surface of the airport 

had gone soft.  After one week of rain, the algae started to grow.  When the plane lands, it will 

skid  which is  very dangerous.  So, when  I look  at  this, it suits this allocation.  The chief pilot 

emailed me to say that the flights to Mangaia will be cancelled because of this problem.  They 

indicated  that  the  airport  will  be  closed  a  couple  of  days  ago.    When  I  received  this  email,  I 

immediately emailed our EO in Mangaia to look and to rectify this problem immediately.  Work 

began on the airport on that same day to remove the algae and then reopened again on Wednesday.   

</span></div><div><span>So, I believe that a report will be sent to the Minister.  I would like to thank the people who was 

involved in this work.  I will thank the people of Mangaia because they only have a small number

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>of  machines  to  carry  out  this  work.    I  want  to  thank  Anthony  White  and  our  Mayor  for  their 

contribution.  I also want to thank our Chief Pilot, Munro for his report in thanking our EO.  There 

are other matters I want to raise but my time is up. 

</span></div><div><span>I support this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert 

Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I sympathise the request from the Member for 

Oneroa, however, before the National Election, he was given an opportunity to move to this side 

of the House so that his road and the airport can be completed.  He does not want to move to this 

side, he stayed on that side.  Had he shifted to this side of the House, he would be standing here 

today saying that the work had started on the road and the airport.  Yes, it is right; we have many 

airports in the Pa Enua that requires maintenance. 

</span></div><div><span>Just to clarify to the Honourable Member on this type of requests, the allocations appropriated for 

the financial year is like this.  Every financial year, it is up to Cabinet and Government to allocate 

where the money is to be spent.  That is why we get to a point where we Members of Parliament 

steps to a higher level to take the initiative to address the many issues in our individual electorates.  

We  can  see  the  example  set  out  by  Puaikura  where  the  three  Members  of  Parliament  took  the 

initiative  to  address  a  problem  in  their  electorates  and  that  is  the  trimming  of  the  overhanging 

branches  onto  the  roads.    I  believe  when  they  did  this  project,  ICI  contributed  a  couple  of 

machinery to assist but most of the work was done by the three Members and the people from 

within the village from Tuoro to Toreaiva.  

</span></div><div><span>Like what I have said to the Member of Parliament from Oneroa and to you Member Tim Varu, it 

is what it is on your request for the road sealing.  It has been planned in the past that that road was 

to be tarsealed by the Minister of the time, however changes took place and we saw that the Tupapa 

</span><span>roads were tarsealed instead.  Now we can see the hot mix sealing all the way from Harley Street 

</span><span>out to Avana.  We can see in the budget before us this afternoon is the plan to which roads are to 

be  tarsealed  this  financial  year  and  this  is  from  Avana  right  to  the  boundary  where  Titikaveka 

begins.  I know in this Appropriation that Puaikura is not in the picture, but I want to assure the 

Member of Parliament for Ruaau that in our Cabinet Sitting and Governments vision that Puaikura 

would eventually be hot mixed sealed.  As you are aware, the sealing will be done here, there and 

</span><span>will come Puaikura’s way.  That is the plan for our hot mix sealing on our roads and I know you 

</span><span>understand this. 

</span></div><div><span>I would come back to the comments from the Member Teokotai Herman, this Uncle of mine here, 

anyways all of them are my uncles.  When I look at his comments and because of the economic

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 29 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>growth of tourism and visitors to Aitutaki, the time is right for ICI to take a leadership role in waste 

management in Aitutaki.  This also extends to other issues that we in the House could see and our 

people can hear on the radio, it is time for you Aitutaki, for Government to look into these issues.  

Like what I have said before when I visited Aitutaki, what I requested them is how important it is 

that the Island Government and the three Members of Parliament need to work together in order 

to enable me and ICI and CIIC to deliver on these concerns.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my time is almost over.  Therefore, I applaud all of you for supporting this Vote Item 

for </span><span>ICI.  You have copies of the program for ICI’s plans this year so take time to have a look at it.  

</span><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $5,524,000 for Infrastructure Cook Islands  

stands part of the Schedule?
