<div><span>HEALTH: 

</span></div><div><span>Vote Item on Health for one and a half hours. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $21,000,378 for Health stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open and I see the Honourable Robert Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Prime Minister, your Cabinet 

Ministers and Government Members.  Kia Orana to the three Leaders in the Opposition side and 

all of us the Members on this side.  A special Kia Orana to our people listening in and the Secretary 

of Health in the Public Gallery.  

</span></div><div><span>This is not a criticism or a blame but a thought that I want to share to help strengthen the standards 

in Health.  In the seven days of our Parliament Sitting, five out of those seven days, there were 

ambulances going pass on emergency calls.  This morning while we were coming to Parliament, 

an  ambulance  came  passed  us.    The  main  thought  here  Mr  Speaker  is  that  this  field  requires 

attention.  A few weeks ago, we called Health for an ambulance for one of our elderly papas who 

</span><span>not well. The issue here is that one of the ambulance was attending to an emergency callout and 

</span><span>another ambulance was available but with no driver.  So, we took the papa on a truck to the hospital 

</span><span>and because of the bumpy road by ICI, the papa’s illness</span><span> could have gone worse.  

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to touch on our two ambulance drivers.  Maybe it has changed today but I believe 

about  three  months  ago,  there  were  only  two  ambulance  drivers  working  for  Health.    So,  the 

concern is one driver has to work 12 hours and the other driver works the next 12 hours.  The main 

thing here is occupational safety because this is not an easy job and there is a saying that we have 

</span><span>to be alert at all times.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, this concerns the visiting times to see a doctor and according to the report, a waiting 

time of 99 minutes.  This is an estimate and in actual fact, it is a waiting time of four hours.  Our 

elderlies are complaining that it is too long to wait because a doctor is not available or they are 

working elsewhere.  Maybe the Secretary of Health can look into this area.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I have to interrupt you.  It is time to suspend for a break.  

We will continue with our business when we return from our break.  This Sitting is suspended until 

3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.28 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Parliament is now resumed.  Before we adjourned for lunch, the Honourable 

Member Robert Heather was talking.  However, I will give the Floor to the Prime Minister before 

the Honourable Robert Heather continues his speech. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    In  light  of  the  fact  that  we  have  a  couple  of 

Ministries to be discussed today and tomorrow, I would like to move: 

</span></div><div><span>As per Standing Order 216 Part 1, to shift the debate on the Police up the ladder so that it 

can be brought forward for discussion by the Members of this House to allow to be 

discussed after the Internal Affairs allocation 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister, is it Internal Affairs or Infrastructure? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Internal Affairs. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>If there are other Ministries that Members may prefer to be brought up in 

the order of discussion, I will be happy to accommodate those requests.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister, Albert Nicholas</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Question be agreed to?

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I now call the Honourable Robert Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I do not have much time left so I will be quick.  

Firstly, I thank the Ministry of Health and the Government for establishing the Puna Clinics and I 

believe this emerged during COVID.  This is important because doctors are attending to patients 

in these clinics. 

</span></div><div><span>Also, there are volunteers who had worked in these clinics during COVID and today, I believe 

they are still involved in these clinics.  I am talking about our Black Rock Clinic and two particular 

ladies who work in this clinic.  When you go for your appointment with the doctor, these two ladies 

are always there ready to take your blood pressure and other matters that need to be done.  These 

two ladies are always smiling and I believe this reduces your blood pressure.  After 10 minutes, 

you  meet  with  the  doctor  and  when  the  consultation  is  done,  you  feel  relaxed.    There  are  no 

problems with them, I am simply happy with what these ladies do.  I believe they are not nurses 

but  are  cooks  and  today,  they  can  perform  the  necessary  functions  at  this  clinic.    I  want  to 

congratulate these two ladies for the way they treat their clients.  This should be an example to us 

all and Public Servants of good customer service.   

</span></div><div><span>In the past, when you arrive at the airport, when Aunty Nan was still there, tourists feels happy 

and welcome when processing through arrivals; Aunty Nan is always smiling welcoming visitors.  

These are some of the things that we Members and workers in our country need to practice.   

</span></div><div><span>I support the Vote Item for Health but if only Government have added a few more zeros, it would 

be even better.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Robert Heather.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have no problems with the Vote Item for Health and I 

support this appropriation.  I am happy Mr Speaker because we have spoken about this in the past 

on Output 2 on Oral Health Services.  It tells us that the Dental Clinic will be upgraded.  They 

have made a plan and I believe this plan has been given to CIIC and I hope the Minister for CIIC 

knows about this plan.  This is what I am happy about. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to explain to the House that in 2019, there was a problem regarding Dental Doctors.  There 

</span><span>was a suggestion in 2019 to transport doctors to the islands.  We also talked about the premises 

</span><span>that these doctors work in.  That is why I am happy to see that this work will be commencing as 

we wait for CIIC to renovate the dental premises.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Another problem  Mr Speaker, when  you look  at  the roofing of this building, it is  made out  of 

asbestos.  This is a building to care for our teeth and health and yet, the roof of this building is full 

of asbestos.  I support the program under Output 2. 

</span></div><div><span>I wish to support what has been said by the Member for Akaoa regarding the Puna clinics in our 

villages.  The Puna in Matavera has really helped the people of my village.  I want to tell you Mr 

Speaker and also the Minister of Health that our elderly people are happy because they do not have 

to travel far to reach the Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I know of someone who has worked for a long time at this Puna and because she has 

done very well, she has been transferred to the Puna in Tupapa.  The Puna in Matavera is not just 

for Matavera but the people of Ngatangiia and Titikaveka, they also make use of this clinic and 

not the Outpatient Clinic in Tupapa. 

</span></div><div><span>I also support the program under Output 3.  My last thought, Mr Speaker, is to support the program 

for Output  4 because it shows here the effective and efficient  patient  referral.    I want  to  thank 

Government and also the Minister of Finance because there is an increase for referral patients. 

</span></div><div><span>This year, under administered funding, the figure is $2 million.  These funds will help our people 

when they get sick, they get referred to New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when we look back to the budget for 2021/22, the patient referral allocation is less 

than  the  allocation  for  this  year.    This  </span><span>year’s</span><span>  Budget,  the  Government  has  increased  the 

appropriation to $2 million for referrals to New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>The medical programs that they have set for last year and this year had prompted that Te Marae 

Ora is doing well and is helping our people.  To conclude my speech Mr Speaker, I give my strong 

support to this allocation of $300,000 to support the health workers, the remuneration adjustment 

for Te Marae Ora. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  want  to  express  my  appreciation  to  the  Head  of  Ministry  for  Te  Marae  Ora  because  Mr 

Speaker,  this  House  have  been  deliberating  on  the  Vote  Items  of  the  many  Ministries  of 

Government but only two Heads of Ministries have shown their face in this Honourable House; 

the Secretary of Education yesterday and today the Secretary of Health. 

</span></div><div><span>If I am a Head of a Ministry and there would be a problem with my Vote Item, I certainly would 

want to be in Parliament.  Also, to listen to the debates and to determine what is right and wrong.  

</span><span>I would like to acknowledge these two individuals for being here and I would like to encourage 

</span><span>other Heads of Ministries to  be present  when the next  Appropriation is tabled so that they  can 

witness how their Vote Items are debated on.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, I support this Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Now, I see the Honourable Toa Isamaela; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  ISAMAELA:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  Kia  Orana  to  you  this  afternoon.    As  saluted  by  previous 

Members, I also offer my salutations for everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am looking at this Vote Item for Te Marae Ora.  I am asking the Minister Responsible 

if this appropriation is enough for your Ministry.  Do not be afraid to speak the truth because the 

Prime Minister is sitting next to you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  reason  for  this  is  because  Te  Marae  Ora  or  the  Ministry  of  Health  is  our  life 

benefactor.  Before I speak on this Vote Item, I have something to say about the health services on 

my island of Aitutaki.  I want to bring good news before I go there. 

</span></div><div><span>Early this morning, my son called me and I asked him what the purpose of his call.  He replied that 

the electricity supply on the island is dead or had shut down.  I asked him why he called me and 

then he said that he is at work, mixing cement.  I told him to kneel and pray for the electricity to 

work again.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is an important need for Te Marae Ora.  This is where I will begin my submission 

</span><span>and that is regarding the “standby” generator for electricity at the Aitutaki hospital.  I am concerned 

</span><span>of this issue because if there was a serious emergency case in the hospital like a surgery, what will 

happen if the power supply for the island shuts down? 

</span></div><div><span>The other issue about this standby generator is no one knows if this is still working.  This is an 

area that our Government must look at so the services for our people is at its best.  If there is a 

need for new generators to be purchased, buy it because this concerns the life of our people.  Just 

</span><span>like what our Chaplain had preached at the beginning of our Sitting today, that </span><span>“none may die or 

</span><span>pass away.”</span></div><div><span>I leave that matter in the hands of the Government.  I come now to the matter of the hospital of Te 

Marae Ora on Aitutaki.  There are some places or rooms in the hospital that needs to be renovated.  

I would like to comment on the staff of Te Marae Ora in Aitutaki.  I challenge the Secretary and 

the Minister of Health on this matter if they have asked whether there are enough staff or whether 

they need more. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  views  as  spoken  by  previous  speakers  about  staff  shortage 

especially for night shifts, even for Ambulance drivers.  I wanted to bring your attention to this 

</span></div><div><span>374 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>issue because my home, on numerous occasions, we had transport people who are very ill to the 

hospital  from  my  village.    People  do  not  have  any  vehicles  and  the  hospital  does  not  have  an 

ambulance driver.  This field is an area that requires attention.  I would highly recommend for the 

Minister to consider this and for the Administration staff to employ for an ambulance driver for 

night shifts.  This could be the reason for the request to increase the Budget.  I know because there 

is no ambulance driver, the nurses on Aitutaki are driving the ambulance to pick up people that are 

ill from the villages.  This is a serious issue that I know for Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>My other request to the Minister of this Vote Item is for the nursing school to be restored again on 

the island.  During COVID, were young people were recruited to help in the hospital.  Today, they 

are still helping the hospital staff.  These young people need to be trained properly in the health 

care services.  I know that Rarotonga is training nurses.  The problem for the Outer Islands if they 

were to come here for training is accommodation.  I would suggest for our young individuals to 

start their training on each islands and for their final year of training, to be done here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to speak on the maternity service.  When our mothers give birth, I noticed that the 

Government  spends  a  lot  of  money  for  this  field.    This  is  definitely  an  area  that  needs  to  be 

improved because only serious cases are to be referred to Rarotonga.  When you are asked where 

you were </span><span>born, your answer will be, “In Aitutaki.”  If you are from Atiu, you would say that you 

</span><span>were  born  in  Atiu.    This  is  what  I  am  seeing  Mr  Speaker.    Many  of  our  children  are  born  in 

Rarotonga and yet, they are from Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>There are many issues that we need to look at and one of the areas that I want to mention is the 

matter on our patient referral cases.  In regards to referral, as I know that our medical services are 

available here on Rarotonga.  For the Pa Enua, you would need many cases in order to be referred 

to Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Our elderly may need special health care attention and I am worried about them because they will 

have to be referred to Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>I  recall  that  couple  of  months  ago,  we  had  a  problem  in  Aitutaki,  but  not  from  within  my 

</span><span>constituency but from within my colleague’s constituency, but I do not think they were aware of 

</span><span>it.  I was responsible in assisting this father and a family member to be flown here in Rarotonga.  

Whilst in Rarotonga, Te Marae Ora was aware that the family paid for the fare in which they were 

reimbursed afterwards and that is my appreciation to Te Marae Ora.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Honourable Member, I will interrupt you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  That is not a problem Mr Speaker, I knew my time was up but I was waiting 

for you to interrupt.  At this moment, I give my support to this Vote Item.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  can  see  the  Honourable  Member  Agnes 

Armstrong; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone in the House today 

and those listening on the radio and watching by livestream.  Kia Orana to the Secretary of Health.  

I do not have much to say on the budget for this Vote Item but I just wanted to say a few words on 

this item. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I want to convey my thanks to all the nurse practitioners and doctors for working in the 

Health  profession.    I  would  like  to  thank  their  services  for  our  people  and  through  times  with 

limited resources, it may seem like a thankless job but we do appreciate your commitment.  I would 

like to thank Te Marae Ora and CIIC for finishing the concreting on our driveway to the Mangaia 

Hospital, so when our stretcher patients arrive at the hospital, it is a smooth ride into the hospital.  

We would have liked a new hospital of course but we are very grateful for what we have been 

</span><span>given and that is the isolation unit and the minor upgrade to the doctor’s house.  We would really 

</span><span>like to see a doctor live in it and I know it is a wish that most of the Pa Enua would love to have.  

</span></div><div><span>I know we have labour issues in that area so I am sure we would be strongly appreciative if the 

fly-in doctor program could be reinstated or relooked at.  In saying that also, the oral health for a 

dentist and each time the doctor comes, to be accompanied by a dentist.  This has proven to me a 

very costly exercise for our people because it is hard to get an appointment at the dentist here and 

they come for a review and they have to go back and it cost them $500 each time they come and 

go back because most people do not want to stay for a month before they get seen.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to briefly touch on the referrals.  We are grateful for the referrals process as it is but I 

just wanted to highlight an issue which was brought to my attention when I was in Auckland two 

weeks ago.  I was visiting a referral patient and that he was having problems in trying to get his 

pension/superannuation and the like.  It was brought to my attention, the Cook Islands Government 

was offered assistance from MSD which is the Ministry of Social Development, in that they would 

</span><span>allocate one of their officers to assist our people in streamlining issues with benefits etc.  I was 

</span><span>very  dismayed  that  we  did  not  take  up  this  offer.    As  I  understand  it,  many  of  our  people  are 

struggling  in  finding  housing,  welfare  benefits  et  cetera.    I  do  understand  we  have  our  own 

personnel in New Zealand that does this but no one seems to be able to get hold of them.  So, I 

think if we can also have this information available to our referrals, it might help greatly.  These 

are  not  criticisms  it  is  just  how  we  can  improve  our  services,  which  comes  to  my  next  two 

comments which happened in the weekend. 

</span></div><div><span>The  first  one  is  the  medication  for  rheumatic  heart  disease  patients  and  my  grandson  has  that.  

</span><span>Every 28 days, these patients need to have their injection.  I do try to get him to go before school 

or before the date he has to have it but sometimes we are a bit late.  In this instance, I rang that

</span></div><div><span>hospital  that  is  up  the  sanatorium  because  it  was  after  3.00  p.m.  and  he  said  he  went  to  the 

Outpatient and the doors were closed, just after 3.00 p.m.  We only found out that they do close 

the doors at 2.00 p.m. on Fridays.  We were told on the next day that we could have come round 

the back but this is not public knowledge so we were left stranded. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Member,  I  will  interrupt  you.    I  can  see  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I just wanted to make a contribution to 

this Vote Item.  First, I would like to say Kia Orana to the Secretary of Health in the Public Gallery.  

Second, I am pleased with the $300,000 increase for personnel.  There are three Ministries where 

I think that they have been underpaid, the staff have been underpaid.  One is Education, one is 

Health  and  the  other  is  Police.    So,  whilst  it  might  be  a  small  increase,  I  am  happy  that  it  is 

happening anyway. 

</span></div><div><span>The  second  is  the  amount  allocated  for  the  mammogram,  in  fact  it  is  called  a  mammography 

machine.  Yes, we the women folk in our country from time to time make use of this machine to 

test us for cancer. 

</span></div><div><span>We all know what our biggest problem is in our country; Health is a huge issue for us, obesity.  I 

think we are the leaders in the world for obesity and sometimes when I travel in my Government 

vehicle on the road and I am driving behind someone who is on a motor cycle, often you do not 

see the motor cycle, you just see the person on the motor cycle.  When we look at it, there is a 

funny  side  to  it  but  there  is  also  a  very  serious  side  to  it  because  obviously,  we  are  grossly 

overweight. 

</span></div><div><span>During each Budget debate, we always refer to these diseases that we have and we are cunning as 

far as food is concerned, we say that it is our culture. 

</span></div><div><span>I do remember just recently, I went to a funeral and during the announcement for the kaikai, the 

</span><span>emcee said, </span><span>“well we are going to be following the health regulations, we will not have any sweet 

drinks, just water.”</span><span>  There is nothing wrong with that at all. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Minister, I want to talk about the Rakahanga hospital.  I am glad that you are sitting next 

door to the Minister of Infrastructure.  Yesterday, I had an email from the Secretary of Education 

to confirm to me that the materials for the school building is down at the wharf waiting for the 

barge.  I am hoping that tomorrow, I will get an email from Mr Williams that my materials for our 

</span><span>hospital will be down at the harbour waiting for the barge.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>While we do not have a doctor, I can understand the reasons why especially during this climate 

and I do appreciate the referrals that are paid for to travel from Rakahanga to Rarotonga to the 

Rarotonga hospital and I am sure that you have many referrals from the Northern Group, not only 

from  Rakahanga  but  from  the  other  Northern  Group  islands  as  well.    While  we  do  not  have  a 

doctor, we have a nurse but the turnover of the nurses is quite regular because not many of the 

personnel want to spend more than a year in the Northern Group and we do need to find a way to 

encourage people that apply for jobs in the Outer Islands, maybe a higher pay so that they can 

remain in the outer islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I heard your neighbour on your left-hand side talk about the Pa Enua tax.  I can assure you Minister 

that her wage is such that her increase, I mean her savings from the Pa Enua tax, is minimal.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you and I see the Honourable Member Teariki Heather;  you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker,  Honourable  Members  and  also  our  people.    Mr 

Speaker, may I have three minutes to speak to our people in Puaikura.  Mr Speaker, I believe it is 

only  right  that  I  give  a  very  big  thank  you  to  all  the  hard-  working  people  of  Puaikura  who 

supported the function for the opening of the CICC Church. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  people  have  witnessed  this  great  occasion  when  we  renovated  our  Church  and  finally  to 

rededicate our Church which has been witnessed by many people.  The donations that has been 

given to support the project and all the food that was provided for the occasion was overwhelming. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I thank the Prime Minister and Honourable Members who attended the occasion and 

the Leader of the Opposition Honourable Tina Browne and thank you also to the people who came 

from overseas and the different Ekalesia who attended.  I was very happy that evening.  May God 

bless us all and I give words of encouragement to the Titikaveka Ekalesia and the Avarua Ekalesia 

</span><span>and may God help them in their work and also for us looking forward to the 200 years celebration. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now come back to the Appropriation for the Ministry of Health.  On behalf of our Party, we 

would like to give our support to the allocation for Health.  We know the situation we are in today 

on behalf of the Government and those involved in putting together this Budget, I would like to 

thank you all for your contribution.  So, on behalf of us, we truly believe that we do not need to 

complain or go against what has been allocated and distribute. 

</span></div><div><span>We would like to make some suggestions and recommendations and maybe we can help in some 

</span><span>way.  The problem for ambulance has been aired.  On many occasions, there is only one driver for 

the  ambulance.    Mr  Speaker,  it  is  a  matter  of  life  and  death  because  we  have  experienced  it.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  we  would  like  to  ask  the  Ministry  of  Health  to  look  into  this  area  and  make  an 

improvement to this service. 

</span></div><div><span>Here is another suggestion, the Aroanui Committee are supporting the Puaikura Fire Service and 

also the Police.  The Police do not use the facility anymore so today, I am telling the Minister of 

Health that there is a vacant area in our building that your ambulance service can utilize so they 

can be very close to our community and also Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>So, in regards to the Outpatient in Tupapa, we need to look at how we can plan properly with the 

services that is provided at the Outpatient and the hospital.  In mentioning this, these two offices 

that have been used by the Police and Fire Service is free and the Police is not using their office 

anymore. 

</span></div><div><span>We had already thought about it during Papa William and Papa Manoa’s time for an ambulance to 

</span><span>use this space and the intention is for quick transporting of our people to the hospital.  

</span></div><div><span>Also, if the Ministry of Health can look into this as well, on messages that are being broadcasted 

on  television  and  newspapers  so  that  our  people  are  being  informed  properly;  it  was  very 

productive  during  COVID,  our  people  were  well  informed.    But  today,  as  mentioned  by  the 

Member of Parliament for Mangaia, is another problem that I can see here on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>It was also stated earlier about the two nurses at the Pokoinu Clinic in relation to health care for 

children.  An individual today had reached 60 years of being ill.  However, he is still alive.  My 

issue is the home that he lives in.  We tried to help renovate his home, the problem lies with his 

health complication.  The request here is for the Ministry of Health and Internal Affairs to work 

together because there are special cases that requires both your attention. 

</span></div><div><span>I am aware there are health issues within our community, maybe some of our Members are not 

aware of these issues but there are some here on Rarotonga and even in the Pa Enua where these 

</span><span>services are not available and they are struggling and finding life hard.  The added increase in the 

</span><span>cost of living is making the family life harder for these homes and family.  Another problem for 

some  homes  is  transportation,  especially  when  these  homes  have  sick  people  with  health 

appointments in clinics and hospital.  How are they going to be transported for their appointments 

when they do not have a motor vehicle? 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my last thought on this Vote Item is our people in the Northern Group.  Only during 

the  Maeva  Nui  Celebration  is  the  only  opportunity  they  can  come  to  Rarotonga  and  make 

</span><span>appointments to meet with doctors, dentist and other health services.  I remember a couple of years 

</span><span>ago, I was responsible for taking a Dentist to Rakahanga, Pukapuka, Manihiki and Tongareva. 

</span></div><div><span>379 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Rakahanga is okay with dental services because they have a retired dentist who cares for them.  

Manihiki  is  all  right  because  the  people  care  for  their  teeth  well  and  did  not  need  that  many 

treatments.  Pukapuka to my surprise has no dental issues maybe because they chew coconuts a 

lot and this kept their teeth healthy.  But Tongareva had 72 cases and there was a big man, Turoa, 

which required five teeth to be extracted. 

</span></div><div><span>My time is up Mr Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Tereapii Maki-Kavana; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity to speak in this 

Honourable House.  I now would like to convey my greetings to the people of my constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to you all my people of Arutanga, Reureu and Nikaupara; to the elderlies, the young 

and the children.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my strong support to this Vote Item for Te Marae Ora.  I know that this 

appropriation is not enough but this is the best we can do for now. 

</span></div><div><span>First, I would like to thank the Minister, the Secretary, and all the doctors and nurses in the Ministry 

of Health for their good work.  I also thank all the health workers on my island of Aitutaki; thank 

you for  your sacrifice in serving our people.  I also thank the Te Marae Ora for sending many 

Specialist Doctors to Aitutaki to serve our people.   

</span></div><div><span>The Eye-Specialist Doctor, the Bone-Specialist Doctor, the Specialist Dental Doctor, the Specialist 

Doctor to check for high blood pressure and many related blood issues.  Today, we have the Heart 

Specialist Doctors on Aitutaki checking on our people.  I also thank the Te Marae Ora for the good 

health services that they are doing for the people of Aitutaki.   

</span></div><div><span>Also, I would like to acknowledge the good services that Te Marae Ora provides on my island; the 

ambulance drivers are driving around the island taking health services to the homes of our elderlies 

and infirmed, thank you for these services.  Thank you to Marae Ora for all the good work hence 

our hospital is free of patients because of your good work; you ensured that our people remains 

healthy, especially with these Specialists on the island. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a request to the Ministry regarding midwife nurses.  As mentioned earlier by the Member 

</span><span>for Amuri/Ureia about pregnant women being referred to Rarotonga to give birth; we would prefer 

</span><span>our women to give birth to our children on our own island.  The doctor on the island may not be 

capable to perform this but this is our request to the Ministry of Health.  Another problem that I 

</span></div><div><span>380 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>would  like  to  highlight  for  these  referral  mothers,  they  do  not  have  any  allowances  whilst  in 

Rarotonga on referral, which makes it difficult for them.  This is an important area that we need to 

focus on and perhaps the Ministry of Health can provide a Specialist to deliver babies in Aitutaki; 

this will save referral costs for these mothers in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>This is my thoughts on the Vote Item for Te Marae Ora.  To thank the Ministry for their services 

to us in Aitutaki and to give my small request to the Ministry.  I give my support on this Vote Item 

for the Health.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you and Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker, Clerk, the staff of 

this House, and to all of us Members.  A special Kia Orana to our people listening in and to the 

Secretary of the Ministry of Health and our two colleagues from the Ministry of Internal Affairs 

in the Public Gallery, and to the Secretary for the Ministry of Internal Affairs; Kia Orana to you 

all.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to give my appreciation on behalf of the Ministry of Health for the allocation 

appropriated  by  Government  and  to  applaud  the  Members  for  supporting  this  Vote  Item  and 

indicating that this is not enough.  As we all know Mr Speaker that health is an important aspect 

</span><span>of our livelihood and corresponds to the Vision Statement of Health which is “</span><span>All people living in 

the Cook Islands living healthier lives and achieving their aspirations</span><span>.” </span></div><div><span>Before I comment on the questions, comments and appreciations raised beforehand Mr Speaker, I 

would like to thank the Secretary of Health because since he held this position, the Annual Reports 

</span><span>from Health has been ‘Unqualified’ Reports.  Like what the Member from Matavera has previously 

</span><span>stated that we thought, a Qualified Report is a good Report but it is the other way around where 

an Unqualified Report is the better Report.  So, this a good indication to us because it shows to us 

</span><span>that the people that are running and managing the Ministry of Health are in good hand under the 

</span><span>guidance  of  the  Secretary  along  with  the  workers.    Therefore,  Kia  Orana  to  the  Secretary,  the 

Directors, Managers, doctors, nurses and all staff of Health both on Rarotonga and out in the Pa 

Enua.  Under the Ministry of Health, five divisions are responsible in carrying out the duties in 

this Ministry.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  thankful  Honourable  Members  for  the  views  that  you  have  expressed  in  support  and  to 

improve the outputs of Health.  We are aware that some of your views are already being looked 

</span><span>into  especially  regarding  our  ambulance  drivers  working  12-hour  shifts.    Yes,  this  took  place 

</span><span>during the COVID pandemic time and this is a request from the drivers so they can work for 3 

days followed by a 4 days off roster.  They favoured this roster because they get to have more time 

</span></div><div><span>381 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>at home with the family and to do other things.  Despite this, the views given are much appreciated 

and these are welcomed to improve the Ministry of Health.  

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank all the Puna Clinic workers and volunteers on Rarotonga who worked 

tirelessly during the time of COVID and to Government who financed significant ventures during 

that time.  So we all know that during the COVID period, we found out our weaknesses and also 

our strengths as a result.  That is why we were able to locate the Puna Clinics permanently within 

our communities.  We were also able to improve the conditions out in the Pa Enua in spite the 

shortage  of  doctors;  we  took  advantage  of  the  technology  by  using  Zoom  where  the  doctor  in 

Rarotonga  can  speak  face  to  face  to  the  Pa  Enua  medics.    But  there  are  also  areas  requiring 

improvement and that is the internet connectivity service.  There are many other improvements 

during that time and we can see today that our Puna Clinics are still open to the public.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am concerned on the comments made that there are some people not being paid.  It 

has been confirmed that these are casual workers and they were being paid during that time.  So to 

wrap up all the views, and on the notices released to our people, including brochures showing the 

opening hours of our hospitals perhaps some of us did not see it or the awareness is not getting 

out, so this is an area we have to improve on. 

</span></div><div><span>So, to our people, for the Outpatient at Tupapa, the clinic opens from 8.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. on 

Mondays to Thursdays and on Saturdays to Sundays.  But on Fridays from 8.30 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. 

because  of  our  staff  training  at  Nikao.    Outside  of  these  hours,  we  have  the  hospital  up  the 

sanatorium but we encourage our people to make use of the Puna Clinics and the Tupapa Clinic 

for people with minor ailments.  Therefore, the main hospital is reserved mainly for emergency 

and serious medical cases. 

</span></div><div><span>On the views of the ambulance services and the comments from the Member from Murienua, yes, 

we will look into improving those areas.  

</span></div><div><span>On the issue in Aitutaki  as mentioned by the Member for Amuri/Ureia, I am not aware of this 

</span><span>generator because the Aitutaki hospital generator is in good condition and is working. Maybe this 

is an island issue where their generator is not well looked after and from what I understand the 

maintenance is the islands own responsibility.  

</span></div><div><span>I take it that the Secretary of Health who is present in the House today will take note of your views 

which are beneficial for the improvement of the Ministry of Health.  

</span></div><div><span>I thank all the mothers and people who are travelling to Rarotonga to give birth to their children 

</span><span>because we know there are not enough Plunket nurses in the outer islands.  We send our nurses to 

</span></div><div><span>382

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Fiji to train in this field but today, I am happy to inform you that today, we have been given the 

rights to hold this kind of training in our own country. 

</span></div><div><span>A program is being formulated to train our nurses and also the nurses from the outer islands to 

undertake the special maternity training.  We believe that more mothers will have babies because 

the Government and I as Minister of Health will ask the Ministry of Internal Affairs to increase 

the baby bonus. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Honourable  Member  for  Rakahanga,  yes  we  are  preparing  for  the  roofing  iron  for  the 

hospital to be sent to Rakahanga.  We have an agreement with the Minister of CIIC and the Marae 

Ora for us to work together to improve the buildings for the Health Department. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  seen  the  Puna  Tiaki  Wellness  Unit  for  mental  health  patients  have  been  completed.  

Renovations  have  been  done  on  the  Pharmacy  and  also  some  new  buildings  have  also  been 

completed.  I want to say that the motto for Te Marae Ora is to </span><span>protect, treat and nurture the lives 

of our people</span><span>.  We know there are many type of diseases affecting our people.  We need to raise 

the remuneration for staff of the Ministry so they will be happy to do their work and for them to 

stay in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I thank the Minister of Finance, all his staff for this increase for staff here on Rarotonga and next 

year, there will be another increase and staff in the outer islands will be included.  I also want to 

thank them for allowing the Xray machine to be purchased and also for the Mammogram machine. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there are many good stories that I want our people to hear especially caring for our 

bodies.  Te Marae Ora is encouraging our people and especially our children to protect themselves 

and to educate them on good health.   

</span></div><div><span>Today, there is a program for screening children from pre-school to the last level.  Mr Speaker, I 

ask our people to help the work that is being carried out by the Ministry of Health because the 

</span><span>Ministry cannot do this all on its own.  But people can help by listening to the suggestions to look 

</span><span>after your own health, your family and school children because the cause of these illness is from 

what we eat. This is just an encouragement to us all to look after our families and to lessen the 

burden of the staff of the Ministry.  The main thing is that we should protect ourselves from the 

many diseases. 

</span></div><div><span>We are now looking forward to receive the 10 Year Plan for the Ministry of Health for our country, 

our new plan and also the Public Health Bill that will be before this House and this will change 

</span><span>some important areas in our country.
