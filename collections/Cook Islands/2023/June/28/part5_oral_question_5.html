<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I will have to interrupt you.  I hear that you are speaking 

on how to apply the work for this Vote Item and I am happy about that.  I would like to ask you to 

speak on it when we come to the Principles and Merits for this Vote Item for Infrastructure Cook 

Islands, for we are still on Question Time.
