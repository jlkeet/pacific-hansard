<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff and Kia Orana 

to all Members of this House and all our people listening to our debate this afternoon. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker because the Prime Minister added comments to the query posed by the 

other side of the Floor and because the media, in the front page of the newspaper this morning, 

there was more information added, I think there was sufficient information made available to the 

queries from across the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>May I also add a few comments to the query as well.  Mr Speaker, to the question on the $400,000 

budget proposed allocation to the National Environment Service regarding the coastal management 

feasibility assessment for Rarotonga and Aitutaki, may I Mr Speaker, express the need to identify 

the risks and concerns relating to exposure to coastal hazards and how well our current coastal 

protection is working.   From there Mr Speaker, we will develop guidelines that will  help NES 

</span><span>evaluate costal management proposals for future environment impact assessments or EIA.  

</span></div>
<div><span>This  will  include  minimal  standards  for  different  types  of  coastal  protection  works  like  design 

considerations, construction standards, construction materials and best practice procedures.  It also 

includes guidance for EIAs. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, this feasibility assessment will give a clear strategic direction to the investments we 

do in the future.  Mr Speaker, it is important to note that a feasibility assessment involves numerous 

</span><span>interconnected complex components and processes.  So, Mr Speaker, this is an area that needs 

</span><span>leadership given the threats of climate change and on-going developments into the future; that will 

continue to put pressure on our natural environment and coastlines.  Mr Speaker, the project is

<div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>underpin  by  consultations  and  discussions  with  many  property  owners  and  permit  applicants, 

permit applicants Mr Speaker who has raised sincere concerns of their loss of property. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr Speaker, the feasibility assessment will give us the key elements we need to guide future 

developments for the protection of our coastal zones and properties and livelihoods.  So, that is a 

brief  overview  of  that  appropriation  or  that  proposed  appropriation,  added  to  the  views  and 

comments of the Prime Minister, which he shared yesterday as well. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To the second </span><span>part of the Honourable Membersâ€™</span><span> question, which is, whether there was funding 

available to actually implement this work in this Budget, and I am talking about implementing the 

actual  construction  work.    I  have  been  informed  that  at  this  point  in  time,  there  is  no  funding 

available for implementation.  But I have also been informed that upon the result of this assessment 

and  the  report  made  available  with  its  attached  recommendations.    Then  any  list  along  with  a 

number of various agencies will begin to reach out to foreign agencies for grant funding and of 

course, the Government as well, to see where we could support this space.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I hope that this information suffices the query of the Honourable Member.
