</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 76: 

</span></div><div><span>Financial  Statement  for  the  Financial  Services  Development

</span></div><div><span>Financial  Statement  for  the  Financial  Services  Development

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 229 (6), Papers No. 73 through to 77 are hereby classified 

for referral to the Public Accounts Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Deputy Clerk.  Before we go on to Question Time, I would like to 

acknowledge the presence of the Secretary of Health who is in the Public Gallery.  Welcome to 

Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, we have two outstanding questions from yesterday, which we have to address.  So, I 

call upon the Honourable Albert Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff and Kia Orana 

to all Members of this House and all our people listening to our debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker because the Prime Minister added comments to the query posed by the 

other side of the Floor and because the media, in the front page of the newspaper this morning, 

there was more information added, I think there was sufficient information made available to the 

queries from across the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>May I also add a few comments to the query as well.  Mr Speaker, to the question on the $400,000 

budget proposed allocation to the National Environment Service regarding the coastal management 

feasibility assessment for Rarotonga and Aitutaki, may I Mr Speaker, express the need to identify 

the risks and concerns relating to exposure to coastal hazards and how well our current coastal 

protection is working.   From there Mr Speaker, we will develop guidelines that will  help NES 

</span><span>evaluate costal management proposals for future environment impact assessments or EIA.  

</span></div><div><span>This  will  include  minimal  standards  for  different  types  of  coastal  protection  works  like  design 

considerations, construction standards, construction materials and best practice procedures.  It also 

includes guidance for EIAs. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this feasibility assessment will give a clear strategic direction to the investments we 

do in the future.  Mr Speaker, it is important to note that a feasibility assessment involves numerous 

</span><span>interconnected complex components and processes.  So, Mr Speaker, this is an area that needs 

</span><span>leadership given the threats of climate change and on-going developments into the future; that will 

continue to put pressure on our natural environment and coastlines.  Mr Speaker, the project is

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>underpin  by  consultations  and  discussions  with  many  property  owners  and  permit  applicants, 

permit applicants Mr Speaker who has raised sincere concerns of their loss of property. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker, the feasibility assessment will give us the key elements we need to guide future 

developments for the protection of our coastal zones and properties and livelihoods.  So, that is a 

brief  overview  of  that  appropriation  or  that  proposed  appropriation,  added  to  the  views  and 

comments of the Prime Minister, which he shared yesterday as well. 

</span></div><div><span>To the second </span><span>part of the Honourable Members’</span><span> question, which is, whether there was funding 

available to actually implement this work in this Budget, and I am talking about implementing the 

actual  construction  work.    I  have  been  informed  that  at  this  point  in  time,  there  is  no  funding 

available for implementation.  But I have also been informed that upon the result of this assessment 

and  the  report  made  available  with  its  attached  recommendations.    Then  any  list  along  with  a 

number of various agencies will begin to reach out to foreign agencies for grant funding and of 

course, the Government as well, to see where we could support this space.   

</span></div><div><span>So, I hope that this information suffices the query of the Honourable Member.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, can you please?  The second outstanding question from 

yesterday has to be answered by the Honourable Prime Minister.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Leader of the United Party; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in the Name of the Lord and 

to all our people listening and watching our Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I thank the Honourable Minister of ICI for his honest answer to the question that has been asked.  

May I just explain Mr Speaker that I do not intend to tell a story, this is however a true question 

that I would like to ask the Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>It is reported in our newspaper this morning on the Report of an appropriation of $400,000 on this 

Vote Item.  I believe that we undertook many research in finding ways of how we can improve 

and protect our coastal lines and today, we are still doing the same thing rather than solving this 

problem.  There are many issues that I would like to raise in regards to this Vote Item and there 

are many issues that we need to address in this area of protecting our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>The first issue I see, the ICI engineers who are supposed to do this kind of work.  The point I want 

</span><span>to raise is, </span><span>“it is who you know.”</span><span>  We are all aware of the disaster that happened to the southern 

</span><span>part of Rarotonga who was struck with high seas and the washing away of seashore properties and 

some of the homes around this area they do not have anything to protect their homes.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I believe this can be classified as a second of the many issues that our people are facing because 

they do not have the money to pay these engineers to help them protect their properties.  I also 

believe that this is the responsibility of our Government to assist our people in these areas of need. 

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, timing.  It seems we have to wait for this feasibility study to be made available before any 

work  can  go  ahead.    Mr  Speaker,  I  can  say  this  that  there  are  no  plans  made  to  this  area  for 

protection.  We see around the Avarua area the use of big rocks or boulders to protect our seashore; 

in my estimate, that is the only sensible or very cost effective means for protecting our coastlines. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I will have to interrupt you.  I hear that you are speaking 

on how to apply the work for this Vote Item and I am happy about that.  I would like to ask you to 

speak on it when we come to the Principles and Merits for this Vote Item for Infrastructure Cook 

Islands, for we are still on Question Time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Speaker.  The question to the Honourable Minister, when 

will these people have their foreshores developed because they are doing it themselves?  Have the 

Government any assistance or when they have the means, are they going to help our people? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    When  the  time  is  up,  I  will  call  on  you  Honourable  Member  to  share  those 

thoughts to assist Government on those issues.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I believe that once this House approves this 

Vote Item, then we will begin with this feasibility study.  To give an answer as to when this work 

will start is not too certain now but I do believe until we get the results of the feasibility report and 

recommendations, then we will be looking for fundings for these projects.  It will be then, we will 

be able to confirm when the work will commence.  But I would like to assure us in the House today 

Mr Speaker, I will be on this issue weekly and just like our road program, I will be consistently 

pushing, pushing and pushing.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have 

</span><span>the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I rise up early today since the Cook Islands News reporter 

is not in the House because whenever I read our newspaper, I can see the popularity of the Member 

of Parliament from Matavera because of his comments in the newspaper.  Mr Speaker, I believe 

that the questions he is asking Government are very meaningful.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I will interrupt you.  I think it is better for you to wait for 

</span><span>the Reporter to arrive before you ask your question.  Anyways, you may continue.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister for ICI.  I am 

sure we have talked about this topic some time ago.  So, the question is if the Minister for ICI can 

explain to us on the standard of the dump on Rarotonga and if there are any plans of purchasing 

an incinerator.  We had talked about this beforehand and I am wondering if there are any updates 

from  the  Minister  for  ICI?    If  the  Minister  gives  an  affirmative  reply,  then  the  Supplementary 

Question is then how long will it take for the incinerator to arrive?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister for ICI; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I am thinking, we have not reached the debate 

time for Infrastructure Cook Islands yet, but with your approval Mr Speaker, I will respond to the 

question because this question connects to the budget item for ICI. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> I think we can leave that until we get to that Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  I am happy to answer the question Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Okay, you may answer but then, you will no longer speak on the Vote Item 

later.</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  The question from across the House I guess 

would be a follow up to the previous question that was asked from that end of the House some 

Sittings back.  I guess the question is justified and relevant.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, ICI put out an Expressions of Interest tender on 11 June 2022, an EOI that closed on 

29 July 2022.  Mr Speaker, the Expressions of Interest that was put out was for the procurement 

</span><span>of an incinerator for Waste Management.  There were 23 businesses that submitted their EOI’s on 

</span><span>the Government Procurement portal.  Eleven companies completed the application, two locally 

</span><span>based companies, one UK based company, one US company, two Australian based companies, 

</span><span>one Canadian based company, one New Zealand based company, one France based company and 

Germany based company as well.  

</span></div><div><span>Of  the  11  submissions,  one  was  qualified  and  10  submissions  assessed  according  to  three 

categories and the three categories Mr Speaker are, one company Information and Technology, 

two Residual and Management Markets and three Technology Overview.  

</span></div><div><span>The EOI Report was completed and submitted to MFEM in March 2022 and ICI has recommended 

</span><span>a Closed Tender with the top three rating companies.  As for funding this Program Mr Speaker, 

the New Zealand Government had expressed strong interest in funding the incinerator through the

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>ITF with the Infrastructure Fund.  So, currently as we speak Mr Speaker where this issue is that 

the  ICI  is  currently  working  with  MFEM  on  completing  the  project  activity  management 

documentation required for the funding and for procurement.  ICI is hoping and intending to go to 

procurement in the second half of this year.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  This is why I said to you Mr Speaker, luckily the Cook 

Islands News is not here.  If they had been here, I will be in the newspaper tomorrow because the 

question asked and the answer from the Minister is quite a significant answer because our people 

will then know that we are exploring for solutions.   

</span></div><div><span>I  have a Supplementary  Question for the Minister for  ICI on the same topic.  The question is, 

whether what  you have assured especially on finance, can be provided to PAC to be reviewed.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I can see the Honourable Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Member.  I will seek 

clarification of what I am required to do within that particular space.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to everyone.  I have a short 

question to the Minister of Seabed Mineral.  This morning, the Prime Minister and I together with 

Minister Mokoroa went to the presentation by the Seabed Mineral at Crown Beach Hotel.  I felt 

</span><span>sorry for the presentation by the Seabed because I believe they have taken a long time to prepare 

</span><span>their  presentation.    But  because  not  many  people  attended,  the  presentation  started  late  which 

means that they had to speed up their presentation. 

</span></div><div><span>I found the presentation very educational and helpful because the Licensees explained what work 

is being done on their research boats. 

</span></div><div><span>My  question  Prime  Minister,  I  am  not  sure  if  the  people  on  the  other  side  was  invited  to  this 

</span><span>presentation because I believe that it is at this venue, if you have a question then you can ask your 

</span><span>question.  We know there are some people who speak against this project and to me, I believe this 

is the time to ask questions.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  The invitation this morning was a presentation to 

the three Pillars  of our society.   First, the Religious  sector, all Members  of Parliament and the 

Religious Advisory Council.  So, the next step then is to take the same presentation out to more 

widely  public  consultation  for  the  rest  of  the  people  including  the  Jews  and  the  Gentiles;  just 

following on from the Scripture for today. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.
