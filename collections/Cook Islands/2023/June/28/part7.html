<div><span>HEAD OF STATE: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $251,889 for Head of State stands part of the Schedule 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I want to make three comments with 

</span><span>regard  to  this  Vote  Item.    The  first  is  probably  this  is  the  lowest  appropriation  for  any  of  the 

</span><span>Ministries.  My second comment is, I am confused as to why they are unable to file a Report.  It 

might be their account has not been audited.  There is not much money that has been allocated. 

</span></div><div><span>My third comment is and I have said it previously, now that we have got visits from the Governor-

General  of  New  Zealand,  the  Governor-General  of  Australia,  we  must  surely  be  as 

</span><span>Parliamentarians feel embarrass about the residence of our King’s Repre</span><span>sentative.  My request is 

for Government to have a look at this seriously.  He is not able to host his guests at his official 

</span><span>residence because there is none. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my comments, thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you to the Leader of the Opposition and I see the Honourable Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand in support of the thoughts shared by the 

Leader of the Democratic Party.  The third comments she made regarding the official residence of 

His Excellency </span><span>the King’s Representative. </span></div><div><span>From 2013, Papa Tom and his wife took over this important role for the country.  I was still in 

Cabinet those days when he was complaining about the poor state the official residence is in right 

up to this day.  

</span></div><div><span>I stand to support an allocation maybe in the next appropriation to upgrade the residence so the 

KR can host the Governor General of New Zealand and Australia and other dignitaries when on 

official visits.  So, Mr Speaker, this topic has been around for over 10 years and we are still talking 

about it.  

</span></div><div><span>Those are my thoughts.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I can see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I am not sure where the Leader of the Opposition 

is getting her information from but I have the latest financial audited Report of the Head of State 

for the year 2021-2022.  We still have to receive the Report for the year 2022-2023.  As far as the 

residence of the Head of State Mr Speaker, I have to thank His Excellency Sir Tom for being so 

understanding about the situation of the residence in Titikaveka.  Many of us will be aware Mr 

Speaker that it took many years to resolve the land ownership dispute on that particular site before 

the Government could commit to not just a renovation but, a rebuilt of the Head of State residence.  

Once we have now finally secured the tenure on that particular piece of land and we had a nice 

</span><span>pool of money in our stabilisation fund to get the work started, the pandemic of course came and 

</span><span>stole all of our money.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, there are plans to rebuild a proper residence for the Head of State as there 

have been suggestions for the building of an official residence for our Prime Minister.  But these 

things  have  to  be  prioritised  Mr  Speaker  in  light  of  other  buildings  and  constructions  that  the 

Government is committed to, to helping our people.  

</span></div><div><span>Plans such as the construction of things like a cyclone shelter for Rakahanga as oppose to a new 

</span><span>building for the Head of State as oppose to upgrading schools on various islands and so forth.  All 

I can say Mr Speaker is that those plans are in the pipeline.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $251,889 for the Head of State stands part of the Schedule?
