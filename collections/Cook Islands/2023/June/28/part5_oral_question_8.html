<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I believe that once this House approves this 

Vote Item, then we will begin with this feasibility study.  To give an answer as to when this work 

will start is not too certain now but I do believe until we get the results of the feasibility report and 

recommendations, then we will be looking for fundings for these projects.  It will be then, we will 

be able to confirm when the work will commence.  But I would like to assure us in the House today 

Mr Speaker, I will be on this issue weekly and just like our road program, I will be consistently 

pushing, pushing and pushing.  Thank you.
