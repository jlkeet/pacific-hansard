<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 

</span></div><div><span>I have one announcement to make.  I would like to offer the Clerkâ€™s apology for his absence in the 

</span><span>House  this  afternoon.    The  Clerk  is  appearing  as  a  witness  in  Court  so  he  is  unable  to  attend 

Parliament.  The Clerk will join us when his service is no longer required by the Court.  In the 

interim, the Deputy Clerk will assume all responsibilities performed by the Clerk in Parliament.  

Thank you so much for your understanding Honourable Members.
