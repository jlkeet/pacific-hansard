<h3>Oral Question 24</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to everyone.  I have a short 

question to the Minister of Seabed Mineral.  This morning, the Prime Minister and I together with 

Minister Mokoroa went to the presentation by the Seabed Mineral at Crown Beach Hotel.  I felt 

</span><span>sorry for the presentation by the Seabed because I believe they have taken a long time to prepare 

</span><span>their  presentation.    But  because  not  many  people  attended,  the  presentation  started  late  which 

means that they had to speed up their presentation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I found the presentation very educational and helpful because the Licensees explained what work 

is being done on their research boats. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My  question  Prime  Minister,  I  am  not  sure  if  the  people  on  the  other  side  was  invited  to  this 

</span><span>presentation because I believe that it is at this venue, if you have a question then you can ask your 

</span><span>question.  We know there are some people who speak against this project and to me, I believe this 

is the time to ask questions.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  The invitation this morning was a presentation to 

the three Pillars  of our society.   First, the Religious  sector, all Members  of Parliament and the 

Religious Advisory Council.  So, the next step then is to take the same presentation out to more 

widely  public  consultation  for  the  rest  of  the  people  including  the  Jews  and  the  Gentiles;  just 

following on from the Scripture for today. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.
