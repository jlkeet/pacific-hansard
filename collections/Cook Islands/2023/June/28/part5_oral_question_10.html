<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I rise up early today since the Cook Islands News reporter 

is not in the House because whenever I read our newspaper, I can see the popularity of the Member 

of Parliament from Matavera because of his comments in the newspaper.  Mr Speaker, I believe 

that the questions he is asking Government are very meaningful.
