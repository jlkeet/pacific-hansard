<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  This is why I said to you Mr Speaker, luckily the Cook 

Islands News is not here.  If they had been here, I will be in the newspaper tomorrow because the 

question asked and the answer from the Minister is quite a significant answer because our people 

will then know that we are exploring for solutions.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I  have a Supplementary  Question for the Minister for  ICI on the same topic.  The question is, 

whether what  you have assured especially on finance, can be provided to PAC to be reviewed.  

Thank you.
