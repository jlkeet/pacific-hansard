<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in the Name of the Lord and 

to all our people listening and watching our Parliament. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Honourable Minister of ICI for his honest answer to the question that has been asked.  

May I just explain Mr Speaker that I do not intend to tell a story, this is however a true question 

that I would like to ask the Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is reported in our newspaper this morning on the Report of an appropriation of $400,000 on this 

Vote Item.  I believe that we undertook many research in finding ways of how we can improve 

and protect our coastal lines and today, we are still doing the same thing rather than solving this 

problem.  There are many issues that I would like to raise in regards to this Vote Item and there 

are many issues that we need to address in this area of protecting our nation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The first issue I see, the ICI engineers who are supposed to do this kind of work.  The point I want 

</span><span>to raise is, </span><span>“it is who you know.”</span><span>  We are all aware of the disaster that happened to the southern 

</span><span>part of Rarotonga who was struck with high seas and the washing away of seashore properties and 

some of the homes around this area they do not have anything to protect their homes.

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I believe this can be classified as a second of the many issues that our people are facing because 

they do not have the money to pay these engineers to help them protect their properties.  I also 

believe that this is the responsibility of our Government to assist our people in these areas of need. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, timing.  It seems we have to wait for this feasibility study to be made available before any 

work  can  go  ahead.    Mr  Speaker,  I  can  say  this  that  there  are  no  plans  made  to  this  area  for 

protection.  We see around the Avarua area the use of big rocks or boulders to protect our seashore; 

in my estimate, that is the only sensible or very cost effective means for protecting our coastlines.
