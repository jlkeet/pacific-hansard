<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Appropriation Bill 2023 - Consideration in Detail, Day 6 

</span></div><div><span>We are still on the Vote Item for Foreign Affairs, which we will be concluding soon.  I call the 

Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you again Mr Speaker and thank you to the previous speakers on this 

particular  Vote  Item  and  I  take  note  of  the  concerns  that  were  raised  by  previous  speakers  in 

particular with regard to our foreign workers and also with the new Regulations that are now being 

applied. 

</span></div><div><span>The Members of the Select Committee of the Foreign Affairs Bill that circulated a number of years 

back now, I am sure they will be able to confirm, but the sentiment of our people at the time with 

regard especially foreign workers was that we needed to ensure we had good strong Regulations 

in place to control the amount of workers and the type of people coming into our country.   

</span></div><div><span>From what we recall of the feedback from the Select Committee Members, there seem to be a fear 

from  some of our people, it may  not  be a rational  fear that our country  might  be overrun with 

</span><span>foreigners. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Act and therefore our subsequent Regulations in this regard seem to take this into account but 

also we had to take into account the needs of our labour market and the need for importing labour 

into our country. 

</span></div><div><span>There  was  a  comment  that  our  Permit  Fees  are  nothing  more  than  a  money-making  machine 

because the fees had been increased.  This in fact is false and if we look at it, the work permit fees 

</span><span>have been restructured so that you pay a $960 work permit which is a permit for three years.  So, 

</span><span>on a yearly basis, this is $320 whereas the previous work permit was $500 per annum.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I know when this was explained to many of our employers, particularly the large employers who 

bring in many foreign workers, they were very happy with this change in the fee structure which 

meant, they paid less. 

</span></div><div><span>The Regulations also add a level of flexibility into those who are bringing in foreign labour and 

this flexibility, Mr Speaker, large employers register themselves as an employer and the process 

for bringing in labour is greatly reduced. 

</span></div><div><span>But there is of course still the need for those checks that need to be supplied for medical checks, 

for police record checks and numerous others that every foreign worker coming into our country 

need to supply and this of course is to protect our employers in bringing their people and also to 

protect aspects of our society. 

</span></div><div><span>The question was raised about the application of bonds.  The Regulation clearly states that the 

Principal Immigration Officer, at their discretion, may apply a bond of up to $10,000.  This again 

is put in place as a protective measure only to be applied when one assesses the risk of certain 

individuals who may be coming into the country.  These risks, Mr Speaker, may be associated with 

the health risk of a person bringing in certain health issues.  It could be a character risk with a 

certain foreigner, maybe with gang affiliations that may be wanting to come into our country or 

employment  risks  associated  with  creating  disruption  within  our  country.    That  is  why  it  is  a 

discretionary  application  Mr  Speaker,  which  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Principal  Immigration 

Officer to assess whether a bond should apply but whatever it is, that bond may not exceed $10 

thousand. 

</span></div><div><span>A  number  of  our  foreign  workers  are  currently  under  the  old  Regulations  whereas  the  new 

Regulations  now  apply  so  there  is  a  process  where  the  Immigration  Office  will  work  with  the 

employers to try and transition the conditions on their employers that they can be under the new 

Regulations. 

</span></div><div><span>Nearly all of the previous bonds that were imposed by the  Immigration Department  have been 

</span><span>refunded back particularly during the period of the COVID restrictions when we were looking at 

ways to support our employers.  Those that had bonds held by the Immigration Ministry have had 

their bonds returned and to date, no bonds have been imposed on any workers. 

</span></div><div><span>So, why do we have this regulation that allows bonds in the first place?  Mr Speaker, the reason is 

so that people are aware and if it is  applied, it is clearly stated in  the regulations.  Ministry of 

Foreign Affairs and Immigration does have the ability to impose a bond if required, which brings 

</span><span>me to  the issue of sponsorship because a  foreigner can have a local  sponsor to  guarantee their 

</span><span>ability to be able to live within their means here in the country without adding burden to our tax 

payers.  Not all persons will require sponsorship Mr Speaker, if foreigners can demonstrate that

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 28 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>they have enough money to cover cost of living, their expenses, then sponsorship should not need 

to apply. 

</span></div><div><span>But certainly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials are happy to work with any employer to 

help  transition  or  migrate  their  current  work  force,  their  foreign  labour  force  under  the  new 

conditions of the new regulations. 

</span></div><div><span>Is there a room for review of these regulations?  Of course, yes, there is room.  But when some of 

the suggested reforms  come to  making it free  for permits to  be issued,  well that is  a cause for 

consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to foreign workers using the Cook Islands as a gateway to ship or move to New Zealand, 

I know this has been an issue with a number of employers who have gone through the trouble of 

recruiting, doing the due diligence and in bringing foreign workers to work in their businesses and 

after just a few months or maybe six months, they resign and move to New Zealand.  There is 

nothing the Government  can do to  stop  people leaving.  We are not  in  the business  of owning 

people, they have the free right to be able to end a contract and most of the contracts that we have, 

either the employer can end a contract under certain conditions or the employee can terminate their 

contract. 

</span></div><div><span>I know this is an issue not just for us here in the Cook Islands but also a big issue in other pacific 

island countries, those that are involved with the Australian and New Zealand seasonal worker 

scheme.  But we are a country that lives by the law of the land and therefore people must be free 

to travel, and to leave if they wish. 

</span></div><div><span>The reality is there is significant labour movement around our region and labour mobility around 

our region is encouraged under regional agreements that many of our countries have signed up to 

such as the PACER Plus Agreement.  So, the question is really, how do we incentivise foreign 

workers to choose to work here rather than choose to pack up and go to New Zealand or Australia? 

</span></div><div><span>That is a difficult one to answer because Mr Speaker, for many decades, our own people have 

chosen to move to Australia and New Zealand in search of employment opportunity.  The figures 

are indicating that our migrant workers, numbers are increasing and there are migrant workers who 

are now reapplying to come back to work in the Cook Islands. 

With those words Mr Speaker, I think the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration deserve to 

be commended; this is a small organisation by comparison to many others in the region.  The small 

team at the Foreign Affairs side of things, I know work is very, very hard in this week with the 

</span><span>arrival of the Secretary General of the Forum and his delegation.  They are working around the 

</span><span>clock to ensure that their engagements with them are maximized.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I know that our Immigrations staff also are working around the clock with the new regulations to 

assist our employers.  We will certainly take into account the concerns raised by the private sector 

in terms of those matters that they thought would need to be reviewed under the current regulations. 

</span></div><div><span>With those words Mr Speaker, I commend this Appropriation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

and Immigration. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,579,134 for Foreign Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>May I ask the Honourable Members when I say, those in favour, can you say, aye!  Due to Standing 

Orders, I am going to bypass the Head of State Vote Item and head straight to Health. 

</span></div><div><span>Sorry, Honourable Members, the next Vote Item is the Head of State.
