<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister for ICI.  I am 

sure we have talked about this topic some time ago.  So, the question is if the Minister for ICI can 

explain to us on the standard of the dump on Rarotonga and if there are any plans of purchasing 

an incinerator.  We had talked about this beforehand and I am wondering if there are any updates 

from  the  Minister  for  ICI?    If  the  Minister  gives  an  affirmative  reply,  then  the  Supplementary 

Question is then how long will it take for the incinerator to arrive?  Thank you.
