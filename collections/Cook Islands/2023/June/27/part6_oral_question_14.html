<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in the House.  To 

those watching the livestream online and to those listening on the air Kia Orana.  To the Secretary 

General of the Pacific Forum and your assistant in our midst, Kia Orana.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I rise and however notice that the time is nearly up.  So, I will use these 16 seconds to say thank 

you to the Secretary of Education because her time spent in the House yesterday was worthwhile 

because she gave a reply to my question on the materials for Rakahanga.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I am happy and wanted to say to the Minister to look at an increment for her for the good work she 

is doing.  Thank you.  

</span></div>
