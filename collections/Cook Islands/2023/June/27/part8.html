</span></div><div><span>That will be for 30 minutes.  I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $463,700 for Financial Services Development Authority stands part of the 

</span><span>Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, for the last two or three years, I have been watching 

this Vote Item.  Parliament will recall some debate about this Vote Item about three years ago.  

There was some question of whether we should continue to appropriate for this Vote Item.  And 

of course, we all know the reason why is because even at one time we were reliant on the revenue 

</span><span>stream coming from our financial sector.  And of course, that somewhat shrunk very quickly so 

</span><span>that the question back then.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The question was whether we should continue to fund this Vote Item.  We will recall that there 

was a presentation by the personnel in the Development Authority at the time and the message to 

us was that they were embarking on a new marketing strategy with the hope that in due course 

some </span><span>revenue will come out of it.  We haven’t in the last couple years, we really haven’t seen the 

</span><span>fruits of the work of this authority. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Minister  Responsible  it  does  not  help  when  this  Authority  does  not  file  any  Reports  in 

Parliament, so we do not know what they are doing.  However, I think there is hope that there may 

be some revenue coming as a result of keeping the Authority going.  I see that the Minister and 

Cabinet probably have the same faith because they have agreed to increase the budget by $40,000. 

</span></div><div><span>This support is given for the continuation of the marketing strategy of this Authority.  But I urge 

the Minister to encourage the Authority to file its Report and to file its statements of accounting 

and hopefully the accounts are unqualified.  As the PAC committee has reminded this, it is this 

Parliament that approves the Budget and the Ministries responsibility is to ensure that it reports to 

this Parliament as to how that money has been spent. 

</span></div><div><span>Of  course,  if  we  do  not  get  a  Report  from  this  Authority  by  the  next  financial  year  it  will  be 

extremely difficult to support this allocation going forward.  Those are my comments Mr Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    I  see  the  Honourable 

Minister Mac Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  MOKOROA:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition who has spoken strongly and in support of this sector. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our Financial Services can play a crucial role in our economy, providing valuable 

financial services to international clients and generating revenues for our country.  Our industry is 

considered well regulated in compliant with international rules and expectations which is of credit 

</span><span>to our Government and those who take part in the industry by putting in place a comprehensive 

</span><span>regulatory framework that adheres to global standards and best practice.   

</span></div><div><span>This will not only ensure that our Offshore Financial Services providers are subject to strict anti-

money laundering Regulations but it also helps prevent reputational risk to our country. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Financial  Service  industry  is  a  key  employer  for  professionals  in  the  Cook  Islands  and 

provides our next generation a range of career options on island. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  since  2020,  employee  numbers  have  increased  14  percent  despite  the  impact  of 

COVID.    When  I  say  professionals  in  this  sector,  I  am  referring  to  lawyers,  accountants,

</span></div><div><span>administrators in the offshore financial services industry.  During COVID, the industry remained 

stable and proved itself to be safe bet during times of global pandemics while also having a low 

carbon footprint.  Our focus in the past year was to increase our marketing industry to increase 

employment and contributions to our economy and those fruits are starting to bare.   

</span></div><div><span>We have also changed guard in our office and we are excited about having a new team for 2023/24 

with a heavy focus on marketing so our industry can grow globally, increase employment locally 

and continue to contribute positively to our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as mentioned I will be asking the officials to submit their Audit report to PAC.  While 

our Budget is limited this year, we are expecting more for less.  I thank you all for your support 

for this vote item. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I put the Question and the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $463,700 for Financial Services Development Authority stands part of the 

Schedule?
