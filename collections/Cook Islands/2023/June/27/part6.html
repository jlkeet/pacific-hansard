</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I pose my question, I seek leave for the 

Honourable Teariki Heather, Member for Murienua, who is currently overseas for yesterday and 

today. 

</span></div><div><span>As I did not have time to speak yesterday on the Environment Vote Item and this morning, I direct 

my question to the Minister for NES, National Environment Services.  This question is in regards 

to our foreshore issues from the beaches of Muri and right to Puaikura.  There is an allocation of 

$400,000 funding for researching into this environmental issue in our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>The question to  you Minister is, is there an allocation of funds by the Government to help our 

landowners in  these beach areas  from business  owners that are running their businesses on the 

beaches?  Thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Minister Albert Nicholas; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and all your parliamentary 

staff and to every Honourable Members in this House and our people listening in this afternoon, 

Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, to give a short answer to the question posed by the Member of Akaoa, I believe the 

appropriation in the budget for NES is for looking at ways to solve this environment problem.  But 

as to the question whether the allocation is for the construction of barriers to protect the seashore 

from washing away, I am not sure of this but if I can be given time to find out the answer and come 

back tomorrow to give you a clear reply to your question.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister and now I see the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Just to maybe clarify the Honourable Members’ 

</span><span>question regarding this allocation and what can the Government do to help. 

</span></div><div><span>The $400,000 is allocated for a feasibility study to allow us to determine what is the best way that 

we can address this issue of coastal erosion that is taking place more and more.  And because we 

know  Mr  Speaker  that  the  protection  of  our  foreshore  is  something  that  has  to  be  done  very 

carefully to ensure that we protect the environment.  And while $400,000 might seems like a lot 

this  is  the  amount  of  money  required  just  to  conduct  the  study  as  to  how  we  can  protect  our 

foreshore.  

</span></div><div><span>339 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>And it is through this study, Mr Speaker that we will determine whether is it a concrete wall that’s 

</span><span>the best thing, is it a rock wall, is it sand bags, is it more natural barriers that is required to help 

protect the foreshore.   

</span></div><div><span>One thing for sure, one of the significant causes of this coastal erosion, not just here on Rarotonga 

but also all of our islands and all around the Pacific, is the impacts of climate change.  The one 

thing we know about the impacts of climate change is the incremental, it happens every year, and 

if the world does not do anything to reduce carbon emissions, this will continue to cause a big 

challenge for all countries, not just here in the Pacific but everywhere in the world. 

</span></div><div><span>But whatever the solution is, Mr Speaker I know that it will cost in the millions and millions of 

dollars to help protect our foreshore.  That is why it is important our voice is heard when we go to 

International forums to make sure that countries who are causing the carbon emissions also take 

responsibility for providing funding to support countries like us who are feeling the impacts of 

these carbon emissions.  While the establishment of the Green Climate Fund with the commitment 

of a hundred billion dollars a year to be made available to countries like us has yet to be realized 

so  we  must  do  what  we  can  for  ourselves  in  the  meantime  to  help  these  households  and  these 

businesses that are struggling. 

</span></div><div><span>But this was really brought home to me yesterday at a function that was held at the Edgewater 

Resort which I have not been to for a while when I saw the foreshore has a big concrete wall now 

along the foreshore.  Before they had this concrete wall, they had a rock wall that was there and 

before they had the rock wall, it was like a rocky beach going down to the sand. 

</span></div><div><span>So, it shows over time the impacts of what climate change has caused some places.  When they 

see their beach being eroded, they had to put the rocks up that has been eroded, and they now had 

to put the concrete walls.  What is the next step? 

</span></div><div><span>I think for us here, we have to do what we can and work together to make sure that we can at least 

</span><span>slow down the impacts of erosion that is occurring on all of our islands.  We need to put our heads 

</span><span>together and come up with what is the best short-term solution while we look at addressing the 

long-term cause of this climate change.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Prime  Minister  and  I  now  see  the  Leader  of  One  Cook  Islands, 

Toanui Isamaela; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, greetings to you this afternoon and all staff of this House.  To 

</span><span>the  Government  side,  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  all  Members  of 

</span><span>Government,  greetings  in  the  Name  of  our  Lord.    To  the  Opposition  side  and  your  Leader, 

greetings to you all.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I was going to pose my question to the Prime Minister but I can see that the Prime 

Minister answered the question from the Honourable Member Robert Heather.  However, I can 

see the Minister Mokoroa sitting by himself so I will pose the question to him. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister explained that people collecting the New Zealand pension and are 

earning below $60,000 would not be affected by the Act we had passed last week.  Mr Speaker, I 

am happy with this because our people in the Outer Islands will not be affected under this law. 

</span></div><div><span>My question, Mr Speaker because I am the Leader of One Cook Islands with one spirit, one love, 

one  heart,  under  our  Constitution  Article  64  (1)  (b),  it  sets  out  our  individual  rights  and  the 

protection of the law.  I am then asking where the rights of our people are on Rarotonga for the 

people who are collecting the New Zealand pension.  This is what I am asking the Minister on this 

subject if the different tax system for the Pa Enua is different for Rarotonga.  Thak you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I now see the Leader of the Nation. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Speaker.  I will go back to our Bible text that was referred to us 

this morning.  It says, </span><span>“in the eyes of God we are all the same, Jews and Gentiles.”</span><span>  When I look 

at this Appropriation, it is the same for Government and for the Gentiles, all of us will benefit 

under this Appropriation.  Under our law, all is equal. 

</span></div><div><span>This new law change will only affect the Outer Islands and will not apply to Rarotonga.  We know 

what life is like on the Pa Enua and when you purchase goods in the shops, the cost is so much 

higher  there  than  here  on  Rarotonga.    A  carton  of  chicken  in  the  Pa  Enua  costs  more  than  in 

Rarotonga.  The carton of green bottles costs higher in the Pa Enua.  The ice cream, bread and 

other things.  This is the purpose of this law change to alleviate the burden that is placed on our 

people in the Pa Enua.   

</span></div><div><span>So, it is not like the Outer Islands are ahead of us here in Rarotonga, no.  We are leveling the 

</span><span>playing field as much as we can to ease the burden on those who live in the Pa Enua.  I hope that 

clarifies the position Mr Speaker and Honourable Member; thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Toanui, is that a 

Supplementary Question? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>I have a Supplementary Question but I wish to rise and give thanks to the 

</span><span>Prime Minister for answering my question.  The reason why I wanted to pose the question to the 

</span><span>Minister Mokoroa is that he is the Minister for Justice.  I indicated to him my question but he 

responded back saying he does not know.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you to the Prime Minister for reiterating what the Chaplain had said this afternoon, about 

</span><span>God’s eyes on us.  So, I am asking where the eyes are for Government for our people here on 

</span><span>Rarotonga.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Prime Minister.  Can you please 

explain on the formation of Boards and the Boards under CIIC?  I am asking this question to him 

because  he  was  the  previous  Minister  for  CIIC  before  the  Minister  Albert  Nicholas.    Prime 

Minister, we know that the Board for Power Supply on Araura is under the control of CIIC. 

</span></div><div><span>We also heard from the Member of Amure/Ureia last week on the finance controlled by the Power 

Supply Board is under the CIIC.  So, that is the question, if you can give some clarification on it 

and I believe some Board chairs on Rarotonga are listening in so they know the reasons of the 

Board coming together.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much to the Member of Matavera.  

There are two questions in there.  The first one is asking about how Board members appointed 

onto the Boards?  And the second one is in relation to the Mana Uira o Araura Board (Aitutaki 

Power Board).  In terms of the Board appointments, the Government and Investment Corporations 

a number of  years  ago amended the legislation to allow people to put  their names forward for 

consideration as Board members on all of our SOE Boards.  This has allowed the Board of the 

Investment Corporation to have a wider pool of good qualified people to serve as Board members 

on our SOE Boards.  And I have to say that the performance and calibre of our Boards now across 

</span><span>all of our SOE’s are much higher than they have been in previous years.</span></div><div><span>For  the  Mana  Uira  o  Araura  Board  in  Aitutaki,  this  was  established  a  number  of  years  ago.  

</span><span>Previously, the power in Aitutaki was run as pretty much as most of the outer islands are run and 

</span><span>administered by the Island Administration.  But we could see that Aitutaki’s power use and the 

</span><span>economy  was  changing  and  growing  with  increased  use  of  power  and  much  more  commercial 

application  of  power  than  it  was  seen  in  the  rest  of  the  outer  islands.    But  it  was  not  till  the 

application of the solar project to Aitutaki to the value of significant billions of dollars of assets 

that we have invested in providing power for Aitutaki that it was decided the best way to be able 

to  accommodate  and  manage  this  increased  asset  value  was  to  create  a  Board  for  the  Aitutaki 

power supply.  That is why this Board was established and made up of members of the community 

</span><span>from Aitutaki because not only were they now responsible for significant millions of dollars of 

</span><span>assets but also in Stage 2.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The Growth of Aituaki’s Solar Program was  going to  be significantly  more millions of dollars 

</span><span>added to the asset value of the power company in Aitutaki.  This one entity has more assets and 

potentially  more  revenue  base  than  the  Island  Administration  itself.    So,  it  was  felt  that  the 

establishment of an SOE similar to how the Te Aponga in Rarotonga would be the best way to 

manage this asset and ensure revenue collection is done in a way that is more commercial rather 

than on an island community basis for a company that is so big.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all of us in the House.  To 

those watching the livestream online and to those listening on the air Kia Orana.  To the Secretary 

General of the Pacific Forum and your assistant in our midst, Kia Orana.  

</span></div><div><span>I rise and however notice that the time is nearly up.  So, I will use these 16 seconds to say thank 

you to the Secretary of Education because her time spent in the House yesterday was worthwhile 

because she gave a reply to my question on the materials for Rakahanga.  

</span></div><div><span>I am happy and wanted to say to the Minister to look at an increment for her for the good work she 

is doing.  Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  We have come to the end of 

our Oral Question.  I would like to thank you all Honourable Members.
