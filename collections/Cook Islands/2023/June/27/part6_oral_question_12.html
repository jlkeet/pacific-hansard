<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much to the Member of Matavera.  

There are two questions in there.  The first one is asking about how Board members appointed 

onto the Boards?  And the second one is in relation to the Mana Uira o Araura Board (Aitutaki 

Power Board).  In terms of the Board appointments, the Government and Investment Corporations 

a number of  years  ago amended the legislation to allow people to put  their names forward for 

consideration as Board members on all of our SOE Boards.  This has allowed the Board of the 

Investment Corporation to have a wider pool of good qualified people to serve as Board members 

on our SOE Boards.  And I have to say that the performance and calibre of our Boards now across 

</span><span>all of our SOE’s are much higher than they have been in previous years.</span></div>
<div><span>For  the  Mana  Uira  o  Araura  Board  in  Aitutaki,  this  was  established  a  number  of  years  ago.  

</span><span>Previously, the power in Aitutaki was run as pretty much as most of the outer islands are run and 

</span><span>administered by the Island Administration.  But we could see that Aitutaki’s power use and the 

</span><span>economy  was  changing  and  growing  with  increased  use  of  power  and  much  more  commercial 

application  of  power  than  it  was  seen  in  the  rest  of  the  outer  islands.    But  it  was  not  till  the 

application of the solar project to Aitutaki to the value of significant billions of dollars of assets 

that we have invested in providing power for Aitutaki that it was decided the best way to be able 

to  accommodate  and  manage  this  increased  asset  value  was  to  create  a  Board  for  the  Aitutaki 

power supply.  That is why this Board was established and made up of members of the community 

</span><span>from Aitutaki because not only were they now responsible for significant millions of dollars of 

</span><span>assets but also in Stage 2.

</span></div>
<div><span>The Growth of Aituaki’s Solar Program was  going to  be significantly  more millions of dollars 

</span><span>added to the asset value of the power company in Aitutaki.  This one entity has more assets and 

potentially  more  revenue  base  than  the  Island  Administration  itself.    So,  it  was  felt  that  the 

establishment of an SOE similar to how the Te Aponga in Rarotonga would be the best way to 

manage this asset and ensure revenue collection is done in a way that is more commercial rather 

than on an island community basis for a company that is so big.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
