<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Speaker.  I will go back to our Bible text that was referred to us 

this morning.  It says, </span><span>“in the eyes of God we are all the same, Jews and Gentiles.”</span><span>  When I look 

at this Appropriation, it is the same for Government and for the Gentiles, all of us will benefit 

under this Appropriation.  Under our law, all is equal. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This new law change will only affect the Outer Islands and will not apply to Rarotonga.  We know 

what life is like on the Pa Enua and when you purchase goods in the shops, the cost is so much 

higher  there  than  here  on  Rarotonga.    A  carton  of  chicken  in  the  Pa  Enua  costs  more  than  in 

Rarotonga.  The carton of green bottles costs higher in the Pa Enua.  The ice cream, bread and 

other things.  This is the purpose of this law change to alleviate the burden that is placed on our 

people in the Pa Enua.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, it is not like the Outer Islands are ahead of us here in Rarotonga, no.  We are leveling the 

</span><span>playing field as much as we can to ease the burden on those who live in the Pa Enua.  I hope that 

clarifies the position Mr Speaker and Honourable Member; thank you. 

</span></div>
