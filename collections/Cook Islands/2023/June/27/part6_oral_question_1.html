<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I pose my question, I seek leave for the 

Honourable Teariki Heather, Member for Murienua, who is currently overseas for yesterday and 

today. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As I did not have time to speak yesterday on the Environment Vote Item and this morning, I direct 

my question to the Minister for NES, National Environment Services.  This question is in regards 

to our foreshore issues from the beaches of Muri and right to Puaikura.  There is an allocation of 

$400,000 funding for researching into this environmental issue in our nation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question to  you Minister is, is there an allocation of funds by the Government to help our 

landowners in  these beach areas  from business  owners that are running their businesses on the 

beaches?  Thank you.   

</span></div>
