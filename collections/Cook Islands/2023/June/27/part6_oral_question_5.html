<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Just to maybe clarify the Honourable Members’ 

</span><span>question regarding this allocation and what can the Government do to help. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The $400,000 is allocated for a feasibility study to allow us to determine what is the best way that 

we can address this issue of coastal erosion that is taking place more and more.  And because we 

know  Mr  Speaker  that  the  protection  of  our  foreshore  is  something  that  has  to  be  done  very 

carefully to ensure that we protect the environment.  And while $400,000 might seems like a lot 

this  is  the  amount  of  money  required  just  to  conduct  the  study  as  to  how  we  can  protect  our 

foreshore.

</span></div>
<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>And it is through this study, Mr Speaker that we will determine whether is it a concrete wall that’s 

</span><span>the best thing, is it a rock wall, is it sand bags, is it more natural barriers that is required to help 

protect the foreshore.   

</span></div>
<div><span>One thing for sure, one of the significant causes of this coastal erosion, not just here on Rarotonga 

but also all of our islands and all around the Pacific, is the impacts of climate change.  The one 

thing we know about the impacts of climate change is the incremental, it happens every year, and 

if the world does not do anything to reduce carbon emissions, this will continue to cause a big 

challenge for all countries, not just here in the Pacific but everywhere in the world. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But whatever the solution is, Mr Speaker I know that it will cost in the millions and millions of 

dollars to help protect our foreshore.  That is why it is important our voice is heard when we go to 

International forums to make sure that countries who are causing the carbon emissions also take 

responsibility for providing funding to support countries like us who are feeling the impacts of 

these carbon emissions.  While the establishment of the Green Climate Fund with the commitment 

of a hundred billion dollars a year to be made available to countries like us has yet to be realized 

so  we  must  do  what  we  can  for  ourselves  in  the  meantime  to  help  these  households  and  these 

businesses that are struggling. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But this was really brought home to me yesterday at a function that was held at the Edgewater 

Resort which I have not been to for a while when I saw the foreshore has a big concrete wall now 

along the foreshore.  Before they had this concrete wall, they had a rock wall that was there and 

before they had the rock wall, it was like a rocky beach going down to the sand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, it shows over time the impacts of what climate change has caused some places.  When they 

see their beach being eroded, they had to put the rocks up that has been eroded, and they now had 

to put the concrete walls.  What is the next step? 

</span></div>
<div><span>I think for us here, we have to do what we can and work together to make sure that we can at least 

</span><span>slow down the impacts of erosion that is occurring on all of our islands.  We need to put our heads 

</span><span>together and come up with what is the best short-term solution while we look at addressing the 

long-term cause of this climate change.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Prime  Minister  and  I  now  see  the  Leader  of  One  Cook  Islands, 

Toanui Isamaela; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, greetings to you this afternoon and all staff of this House.  To 

</span><span>the  Government  side,  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  all  Members  of 

</span><span>Government,  greetings  in  the  Name  of  our  Lord.    To  the  Opposition  side  and  your  Leader, 

greetings to you all.

<div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I was going to pose my question to the Prime Minister but I can see that the Prime 

Minister answered the question from the Honourable Member Robert Heather.  However, I can 

see the Minister Mokoroa sitting by himself so I will pose the question to him. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister explained that people collecting the New Zealand pension and are 

earning below $60,000 would not be affected by the Act we had passed last week.  Mr Speaker, I 

am happy with this because our people in the Outer Islands will not be affected under this law. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question, Mr Speaker because I am the Leader of One Cook Islands with one spirit, one love, 

one  heart,  under  our  Constitution  Article  64  (1)  (b),  it  sets  out  our  individual  rights  and  the 

protection of the law.  I am then asking where the rights of our people are on Rarotonga for the 

people who are collecting the New Zealand pension.  This is what I am asking the Minister on this 

subject if the different tax system for the Pa Enua is different for Rarotonga.  Thak you.
