<div><span>FOREIGN AFFAIRS: 

</span></div><div><span>One hour.  I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,579,134 for Foreign Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa: you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for the opportunity that you have given me to speak on 

</span><span>the Vote Item for Foreign Affairs and Immigration.  Mr Speaker, I have no problem with their 

</span><span>allocation  and  I  support  their  appropriation  and  also  the  increase  that  have  been  given  for 

personnel.  I can see that the sum of $367,000 have been given and this is a large amount of money. 

Our  people  should  also  understand  that  an  amount  of  money  have  been  appropriated  for  the 

important  meetings  that  will  be  held  in  our  country  and  an  amount  of  $150,000  have  been 

appropriated. 

</span></div><div><span>I  wish  to  comment  on  Output  2  and  Output  3  because  under  these  outputs  it  connects  us  to 

</span><span>organizations  outside  of  our  country,  the  regional  organizations  and  also  international 

</span><span>organizations.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>One important program under the guidance of this Ministry is our support for PACER PLUS.  This 

program  supports  us  and  many  regions  in  the  Pacific.    So  I  congratulate  the  Secretary  of  this 

Ministry because she represents our country and also the Leader of our Nation who represent our 

country in these large Conferences. 

</span></div><div><span>I congratulate Tepaeru Herman who is from Matavera.  It is true what they say about Takitumu 

that the head of the fish is Matavera and the head provides for the stomach and the tail.  I also 

congratulate  the  Minister  who  is  the  Leader  of  the  Nation  because  they  are  showing  how  we 

connect to what goes on in bigger countries and our relationship to them.  What I also want to tell 

Members is our relationship to SPREP and the Pacific Community and others and also Mr Speaker, 

our connection to international organizations. 

</span></div><div><span>We have a connection on agriculture and also the functions of the Environment Service.  Under 

the organization called BASIL, this connects to the environment and the Stockholm Convention, 

the  environment  service  comes  under  that  umbrella.    Under  the  Rotterdam  Convention,  this 

connects to agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>These are large organizations and they are based in Geneva in Switzerland.  So, I want to support 

these two programs  because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is  promoting our position in these 

organizations.  That is why I support the increase in remuneration for staff to help them train and 

when they attend these meetings, they know what to say. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to say a few words regarding Immigration.  I give my support for the staff of Immigration.  

I remember in 2022, we discussed the Immigration Bill and this Bill was eventually passed and 

became the Immigration Act.  At this time, we are hearing over the air and also in the newspaper 

on the Regulation under this Immigration Act. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe this will affect both our small time and big time businesses in respect of 

taking out loans to hire foreign workers to work for them.  To end, I give my support to the Vote 

</span><span>Item extending out to the Secretary and all employees in the Foreign Affairs and Immigration.  

</span><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Robert Heather; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana again to all of us in the House.  Just a 

short contribution on the Vote Item for Te Marae Ora especially on the Puna Clinics in the districts; 

</span><span>I beg your pardon, I am too hasty and rushed to the Marae Ora Vote Item.  Sorry, Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Your apology is accepted.  I see the Honourable Member Tukaka Ama; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. AMA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker and Members of this Honourable House, Kia Orana.  To begin my 

presentation this afternoon, I am reminded of our Devotion this morning, I am not sure if all of us 

took notice where the Chaplain stated, </span><span>“say it how it is.” </span></div><div><span>If I may Mr Speaker just have a few moments to say a few words to my constituency of Ngatangiia.  

I am happy to say that some of you may have noticed that the road markings in the Aroko area has 

begun as of yesterday.  Therefore, I am asking for the support of our constituency and the people 

of Ngatangiia, especially the people in the Aroko area to support our road marking program.  

</span></div><div><span>I stand here to fully support the Appropriation for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration.  

More  importantly,  to  support  the  request  of  $360,339  for  Critical  Personnel  in  the  budget  for 

Foreign Affairs.  Sorry Mr Speaker, I meant to say Personnel and Resourcing capacity, I hope and 

pray that this extra funding asked for  will also  be to  the benefit of  Immigration officers in  the 

Ministry of Foreign Affair and Immigration.  

</span></div><div><span>I am sure that we all know that Immigration is a big issue now in our country and with the foreign 

workforce, we have in the country many of these Immigration Officers put in a lot of hard work 

and hard hours.  There is not many of them dealing with over two to three thousand work permits 

and issues every day.  I pray and hope and I know that some of these increases in personnel will 

go towards the Immigration staff.  I am also aware that currently there is a shortage of staff in 

Foreign  Affairs  in  the  Diplomacy  division.    When  I  say  the  Diplomacy  area,  it  is  the  Pacific 

Regional  Affairs  Division,  the  International  Affairs  and  Trade,  Treaties  and  Multilaterals  and 

Oceans Division.  These are important and key roles that our leaders and Ministers require when 

travelling on work duties and International meetings.  

</span></div><div><span>As an example, our Prime Minister who is now the Chairman of the Forum, travelled to Korea and 

</span><span>on these travels,  you take Officials with  you.  As the Chairman of the Forum, he would be the 

</span><span>highest-ranking  leader  at  this  Forum  in  Korea.    As  an  example,  the  countries  that  attend  these 

meetings  come  with  up  to  10  plus  Officials  in  attendance.    Our  leader  from  our  small  country 

usually turn up with one or two Officials.  I think it is important for us listeners and people out 

there listening may think that this is a nice cosy job when you travel, when in reality, it is not what 

you think.  

</span></div><div><span>The Foreign Affairs staff is required to ensure that they give the right advice, right information, 

</span><span>and the right decisions for our leaders and Ministers to make the appropriate decisions on behalf 

</span><span>of our country.  As I mentioned, it is not as easy as you think when travelling.  You try travelling 

on a 16-hour flight and the next morning  you have four hours sleep and you have a high-level

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>meeting.  Even more pressured is when you are meeting with some of the most influential leaders 

in  the world.   I can understand where and why it  is  important  that the increase in  personnel  is 

required because they are desperately in need of workers in this area.  

</span></div><div><span>On that note Mr Speaker, I support this Appropriation as well as the increase for the personnel in 

the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Toanui 

Isamaela; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR.  T.  ISAMAELA:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  again  to  you  Mr  Speaker  this  afternoon.    Before  I  give  my 

support to this Vote Item, I want to say a few words.  I want to thank those involved in preparing 

our Appropriations for us and that the increases are suitable.  An area I am looking at is the foreign 

workers  where  we  are  hiring  them  to  come  into  the  country  to  work  and  they  are  indeed  hard 

workers.  These workers have a high standard of work level written in their Job Applications and 

ones we cannot compete against.  

</span></div><div><span>But when they arrive Mr Speaker, especially when they come to Aitutaki and work on the area 

they were hired to do the work, they do not know anything about that work.  I am talking about 

jobs such as bending and cutting roofing iron, they do not even know what they are doing.  But 

</span><span>when their CV’s were received beforehand, this is the very job they are experienced in doing.  So, 

</span><span>our local workers end up teaching these people on how to do these jobs.  However, when you tell 

them to do some gardening or weeding, they are very good at it to the point the grasses are pulled 

out in a short time.  Mr Speaker, in this area of work, these workers are tidy and clean in doing 

that sort of work.  

</span></div><div><span>My  concern  here  Mr  Speaker  is  about  our  own  people  bringing  these  foreign  workers  into  the 

country especially to Aitutaki.  How did they managed to have their paperwork processed by the 

Government  and  the  costs  involved  in  bringing  these  foreigners  into  our  country?    There  are 

</span><span>different stages in order to be approved for foreign workers to enter our country, this include police 

</span><span>checks, health checks et cetera.  It is compulsory for these steps to be ticked before the foreign 

workers arrive. 

</span></div><div><span>These are my issues Mr Speaker, especially when they are required to work for the people and the 

island.  My concern is the local people that brings these people in from overseas.  Are they being 

cared for?  Are they being fed properly?  Are they well looked after?  In Aitutaki, I have seen many 

foreign workers mistreated.  I do not know if there is an Agent here in Rarotonga for these foreign 

</span><span>workers. 

</span></div><div><span>354 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We had a problem in Aitutaki a couple of years ago with a foreign worker.  These people came to 

see me regarding their contracts that are almost expired.  The employers would mistreat them and 

then  these  foreign  workers  would  leave  Aitutaki  to  come  to  Rarotonga  without  notifying  their 

employers.  When their contracts is expired, the employers could not find them in the homes they 

put them in; they disappear.  But they are coming over to Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>They leave Aitutaki and did not contact their employers.  They would come to Rarotonga, they 

would  approach  this  Ministry  and  would  give  them  false  testimonies  of  them  being  mistreated 

which will make the employers look bad.  My concern Mr Speaker are the staff members for this 

Ministry.    These  employees  would  share  their  lies  to  these  staff  members  regarding  the 

mistreatment received while working for their employers in Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>This  became  stressful  for  the  employers  who  had  spent  a  lot  of  money  bringing  these  foreign 

workers into the country.  I am also aware that these people are using our country to bypass the 

system,  to  get  into  New  Zealand  with  no  problems.    This  is  what  I  want  to  share  with  the 

Government today, to be careful about the stories that these foreign workers are telling them and 

to monitor the processes carefully. 

</span></div><div><span>The staff of this Ministry should be trained properly when reviewing the applications for these 

foreign workers before processing anything.  We must look after our locals and not apply anything 

wrong against them.  We need to check their applications properly before allowing them to run off 

to New Zealand on a visa which they did not deserve or at the expense of our people.  The Ministry 

of Immigration must not be fooled by anyone and they must not use our Government as a gateway 

to New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>The  locals  are  missing  on  this;  foreign  workers  are  gaining.    It  could  be  that  someone  here  in 

Rarotonga are helping them so that they can get out of the country so easily.  I suggest for the 

Minister to review this properly so our local people do not lose anything. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I can see that my time is up.  I just want to say that I support this Vote Item.  Thank 

</span><span>you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I think you people in Aitutaki have to wake 

up and sort your problems out.  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  This is an important Ministry to the 

development of our nation, that is Foreign Affairs.  I am aware of the importance of this Ministry 

</span><span>with  our  relationship  with  other  countries.    This  is  especially  with  the  Foreign  Affairs.    The 

</span><span>Immigration looks after the visitors or foreigners that come to visit, work or live in our country 

and care for our people especially the locals who are contracting foreign workers to be fair.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I have no problem with the increase in the appropriation for this Vote Item.  Both the $367,000 for 

personnel and also $150,000 for the expenses in the hosting of the Pacific Forum.  I believe that 

these two areas are very important to assist the Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>I however want to share my views on the issues that is being mentioned because I also mentioned 

it yesterday in the House.  This is an issue that needs to be carefully look at and for the reason that 

we  have  accepted  that  we  should  support  our  tourist  industry,  for  this  is  the  industry  that  will 

quickly recover our financial income or bring money into the country. 

</span></div><div><span>At the time of the  Immigration Bill,  I was one of the committee  members for the consultation 

especially with the Pa Enua.  I was happy during this time of consultation for this Bill because 

there were many submissions to the committee.  There was strong submission on the Permanent 

Residence matter.  The many opinions in the submissions were incorporated in the Immigration 

Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>The spirit of the Immigration Bill is to protect our country and people, to protect our own people 

who are bringing in foreign workers, to be fair with the employees that we are bringing from out 

of  the  country  and  for  Government  to  be  careful  in  giving  outsiders  the  Permanent  Residence 

status, one of the strongest submissions. 

</span></div><div><span>We  are  all  aware  of  when  the  Immigration  Bill  was  brought  into  Parliament.    There  was  a 

requirement  for  an  Amendment  to  the  Constitution;  there  was  a  delay  to  the  adoption  of  the 

Immigration  Bill.    I  believe  the  Members  on  this  Parliament  Committee  believed  that  this 

Immigration Bill will safeguard our people.  When I was given a copy of the regulations which 

was adopted by Cabinet and the King</span><span>’</span><span>s Representative this year 2023, I was not happy. 

</span></div><div><span>I was really sad and there are two reasons why.  The first reason there was no consultation held 

even with the Committee Members or the people connected to the industry on the fees.  To me, I 

</span><span>did not believe that the result of the Act is this Regulation. 

</span></div><div><span>When you look at the Schedule the new fees are listed there and if I compare that to the Schedule 

of the 2008 Regulations, the way I see it is this seems like a money- making exercise.  The sad 

part is the people that we are making money from are the very people that we rely on to grow our 

GDP. 

</span></div><div><span>I myself bring in foreign workers but my foreign workers cannot be compared to the workers for 

</span><span>the Rarotongan or the Edgewater as they bring in up to 30 workers.  I only have two workers and 

</span><span>I am not in the tourist industry.  My workers collect rubbish.  If you put an advertisement in the 

</span></div><div><span>356 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>newspaper for a rubbish collector, no one will apply to work.  If you put an advertisement in the 

paper for a lady to iron clothes, no one will apply. 

</span></div><div><span>I agree with the Member for Amuri, these people from overseas when they send their CV, you 

would think they are accountants or highly qualified people.  The difference here is even though 

they have a degree, they will accept an ironing job or pick up rubbish.  Their intention is to earn 

money for their family in the Philippines. 

</span></div><div><span>So, if you compare this to the hotels who bring in over 10 workers, when we look at these fees, it 

is killing them.  So, when I read the Cook Islands News, I can understand their frustration. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to share something that I did not believe that it has come to this. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, I will have to interrupt you as your time is up.  Thank you 

Prime Minister for the correction. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>This regulation is No 54.  It says if you want to bring a foreigner 

into the country, you have to pay a bond.  This bond is in the absolute discretion of the Principal 

Immigration Officer but must not exceed $10,000. 

</span></div><div><span>I did not see this when we were discussing the Immigration Act.  Something like this would have 

been very hard to approve.  So, please Minister that is why I asked yesterday if there is an appetite 

from Government to consult with the industry to look at these fees and Regulations whether in the 

climate that we are in today, I think it should be erased.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  There are lots of matters to be addressed in this 

</span><span>Vote Item but I can see that I will not have sufficient time to address them properly.  I will request, 

</span><span>Mr Speaker that tomorrow I will finish our debate on this appropriation for the Ministry of Foreign 

Affairs.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  In that case, we have come to the end 

of our business  for  today.  Parliament will now adjourn until  tomorrow, Wednesday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> June 

2023 at 1.00 p.m.  May I ask an Honourable Member to say a Closing Prayer for us please?
