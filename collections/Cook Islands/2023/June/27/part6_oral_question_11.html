<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Prime Minister.  Can you please 

explain on the formation of Boards and the Boards under CIIC?  I am asking this question to him 

because  he  was  the  previous  Minister  for  CIIC  before  the  Minister  Albert  Nicholas.    Prime 

Minister, we know that the Board for Power Supply on Araura is under the control of CIIC. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We also heard from the Member of Amure/Ureia last week on the finance controlled by the Power 

Supply Board is under the CIIC.  So, that is the question, if you can give some clarification on it 

and I believe some Board chairs on Rarotonga are listening in so they know the reasons of the 

Board coming together.  Thank you.
