</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Appropriation Bill 2023 </span><span>–</span><span> Consideration in Detail, Day 5. 

</span></div><div><span>We are now on the Vote Item for Finance and Economic Management. That will be for one and a 

</span><span>half hours. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $31,819,348 for Finance and Economic Management stands part of the 

Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I speak on the Vote Item for Finance, I would 

like to reiterate the welcoming of our Secretary General, our sister Lisa Williams and our Director

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>of  National  Security  Maara  Tetava  into  the  House,  Kia  Orana.    May  God  bless  you  all  in  our 

consultation and believe it will be beneficial for our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I  come  back  to  the  Vote  Item  for  those  responsible  in  holding  the  finance  for  the  country  Mr 

Speaker.  Firstly, I give my support to this Vote Item.  On top of that Mr Speaker, I support the 

$40,000 increment for the personnel in the Statistics division because I believe it has been a long 

while for the personnel in this division to receive and increase in wages.  When we look at their 

appropriation for 2019-2020, 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 period, there are no indications to show 

an increase.  But we all know as to why this happened to us because it was a time when the country 

was in COVID.  I thought there would be an increase in the budget for 2022/23.  But today, we 

can see that increase in this new budget for 2023/24 given to them. 

</span></div><div><span>Even though we were made aware in this House that the budget we have for this period is a “lean” 

</span><span>budget.  Also, with regards to other increases for this Ministry, there are a lot of increases like $40 

thousand, $60 thousand, $47 thousand and much more.  Mr Speaker, my problem of the allocation 

for this Ministry is the tax department because the PAC committee had received a Report regarding 

the problems the tax department are currently experiencing. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when you look at the PAC Committee’s Report, especially our Recommendations, 

</span><span>the Tax Department would need to be restructured.  I believe the Minister Responsible for this 

Ministry understands their current problems.  Tax payment is not the only problem in this country; 

there is also the problem we had discussed earlier about Air New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  a  problem  with  this  appropriation  Mr  Speaker.    I  know  that  some  of  our  Members  of 

Parliament have not completed their tax returns because I have received an email as to how much 

tax I have to pay.  It is not much Mr Speaker and that is what they wrote in the email; the amount 

is $36,000.  They came back apologising saying that their figures were wrong. 

</span></div><div><span>They  claimed  that  I  was  working  for  the  Government  in  2016  and  2017,  but  I  was  planting 

</span><span>arrowroots in that period.  That is my problem with the allocation for this Ministry and I ask that 

</span><span>the Minister of Finance consider the recommendation made by PAC. 

</span></div><div><span>I do not have any problem with the other departments within this Ministry with their allocations 

and salaries for public servants.  Can the Minister for Finance look into this problem?  I support 

the  allocation  appropriated  for  the  scholarships  for  our  young  individuals  to  study  abroad,  the 

amount of $50,000. 

</span></div><div><span>There is  also an appropriation for Environment  as deliberated before.  I would like to alert the 

</span><span>Minister  of  Finance  the  allocation  for  National  Heritage.    I  know  that  this  used  to  under  the

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Ministry  of  National  Environment;  this  department  will  be  moved  to  MFEM.    I  do  not  have  a 

problem with this.  This is a problem when I was the Head for NES. 

</span></div><div><span>Before my speaking time is up, I wanted to offer my support to this Vote Item and the transfer of 

National Heritage to MFEM. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Honourable Members, I will now interrupt 

the business of the House.  In order for this House to receive the Secretary General of the Pacific 

Islands Forum, Mr Henry Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 1.53 p.m.</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please be seated.  Kia Orana to everyone.  We are still speaking to the Vote 

Item  for  Finance  and  Economic  Management.    The  Floor  is  open  and  I  see  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Greeting  Mr  Speaker  and  greetings  again  to  everyone  this 

afternoon.    I  rise  to  give  my  thoughts  on  this  Vote  Item  as  this  Vote  Item  has  the  most  funds 

appropriated and so it should because it has immense responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  when we look  at the changes or the shifting of  funds from one Vote  Item or from one 

Ministry to another, this Ministry has the most movement either a small increase and then shifting 

from one Vote Item to another. 

</span></div><div><span>When  we  look  at  the  functions  of  this  Ministry,  not  only  to  keep  the  books  but  also  to  be 

</span><span>Government’s main financial adviser.  When we look at the relevant Reports that is filed into this 

</span><span>House and when we look at this last financial year, this Ministry has not filed any Report and nor 

</span><span>is there an audit in progress. 

</span></div><div><span>Minister, this is not a good thing because this is the Ministry that should be demonstrating good 

financial systems to all Ministries.  Secondly, we know that at the beginning of this year, some 

Reports were filed by PERCA and this was forwarded to PAC.  PAC has filed three Reports, these 

were tabled into Parliament, Paper 34, 35 and 36. 

</span></div><div><span>The Member for Matavera mentioned a part of that complaint and I want to mention the remainder 

</span><span>of that complaint.  The three Reports that was referred to PAC, the first one is the work that was 

</span><span>carried out  on the Cyclone Centre in  Penrhyn.  The second one is  when MFEM dealt with  the 

</span></div><div><span>345 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>revenue or tax of a particular company.  The third one also concerns tax and complaints from some 

tax payers. 

</span></div><div><span>I mention these because the recommendations in the Report from PAC, these recommendations 

are quite important.  The strongest recommendation was to look into the status of the Collector in 

his next performance review because the PAC agree that the response from the Collector to the 

complaint from the tax payer is not right. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  Minister  I  think  it  is  right  that  the  Financial  Secretary  be  made  aware  of  this.    The  other 

complaint is regarding the procedures of that Section of MFEM to do with tax also.  PAC agrees 

with the recommendation that was put forward by PERCA that the work performed by the Tax 

Division regarding the complaints from this company was not right. 

</span></div><div><span>So the recommendations Mr Minister is that the Ministry of Finance look into the performance of 

this Division and make them better so that they can deal with the complaints of tax payers because 

some of the complaints are just easy and can be answered easily.  But in these cases it has taken 

seven months, or six months for a response. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding  the  problem  of  the  Penrhyn  Cyclone  Centre,  the  recommendation  was  for  ICI  and 

MFEM work together, to improve the procurement process.  The criteria for the tender process 

should be looked at by the people on the panel that decides who the contract should be awarded 

to. 

</span></div><div><span>I myself believe that these recommendations are to improve our systems going forward and these 

recommendations deal with the people who is along the chain who decides, ok this is my part and 

move on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, I will interrupt you as your time is up. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Can I carry on with my other 10 minutes? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>You are always begging, yes. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>So, to me, Minister in Charge, these are matters that should be 

look into for the future and it is not accepta</span><span>ble that the MFEM should have a ‘qualified’ report.  It 

</span><span>is not a good look if they are the chief financial advisers to  government and yet their financial 

</span><span>statements are ‘qualified’.  They should be the role model of every other Ministry, after all they 

</span><span>are the keepers of our purse.

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>What I do not see in this Budget, Minister is some ways of reducing costs.  We talk about Ministries 

that have no changes to their Budgets and we talk about the Ministries that have slight increases 

to deal with the minimum wage and we also see some Ministries who have given increases which 

in my mind are justifiable. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  last  few  days  last  week,  we  were  talking  about  cost  savings  and  I  think  an  example 

mentioned  in  Parliament  was  our  lunches  to  be  reduced.    I  mentioned  that  not  because  I  am 

supporting that suggestion, I am simply mentioning it because it was mentioned last week.  When 

I look around this Parliament House, we all deserve to have good lunches.  It is not easy to be 

concentrating on debates for four hours.  We should also give some thoughts to the people who 

are receiving payments, to the mamas who are trying to make a living and when I look at the food 

that is provided and what we pay for it, I wonder whether the caterers are making any money at 

all.  

</span></div><div><span>However,  the  cost  saving  exercise  that  I  wanted  to  put  to  the  Minister  is  that  of  Government 

vehicles.  Unfortunately, I was not able to get a straight answer from any central agency as to how 

many Government vehicles we have in total.  We need to have a look at my suggestion Mr Minister 

because there could be cost saving in the provision of Government vehicles to the Ministries.  

</span></div><div><span>These days, when you become a HOM, you get a $75,000 or $60,000 Toyota Hilux.  My question 

is you only need to get from home to your office and then back home.  So, I wonder why do you 

need  a  four-wheel  drive  Hilux  worth  $75,000.    I  see  no  problems  with  Ministers  having  their 

vehicles and the  Leader of the Opposition  having her second hand vehicle.  The  Leader of the 

Opposition is still waiting for her vehicle; she is still using the former Deputy Prime Ministers 

vehicle.  Of course, there is a tendency amongst us human nature, if you did not pay for it, you do 

not look after it.  

</span></div><div><span>So, you see these vehicles running on the road are having accidents and there is just not the care 

given to the vehicles because it is not coming out of your pocket.  So, these are the sort of things, 

</span><span>I have other suggestions as far as cost saving is concerned, it should be relevant during this term 

</span><span>because I am not asking for an increase in the budget but rather a decrease in the spending.  I am 

aware that Government may be purchasing some vehicles for the Pacific Forum and so it should 

and I would be watching as to which Ministries are going to be awarded those vehicles when in 

fact, Government needs to get its money spent reimbursed.  Those are my comments Minister in 

respect of this Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the Opposition the Honourable Tina Browne.  I see the 

</span><span>Prime Minister; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I take note of the comments made by the Member 

for Matavera and also the Leader of the Opposition.  I am aware of the PERC Reports that have 

been  submitted  regarding  complaints  made  against  in  particular  the  Revenue  Management 

Division on a number of individual cases of complaints against that way, that the RMD office has 

assessed  the  tax  of  certain  companies  and  individuals.    I  too  share  the  concerns  raised  by  the 

Members and I will be requesting with my officials to consider the recommendations that has been 

proposed by the PERC Report and the PAC.  

</span></div><div><span>I am also aware of the unqualified Audit Report on the Ministry of Finance and I am aware that 

this arose out of a situation of a point of interpretation of the law.  This was a point of difference 

between  the  Audit  office  and  the  RMD  office  in  regards  to  </span><span>the  confidentiality  of  client’s  tax 

</span><span>records.    I  am  certainly  not  happy  myself  that  this  is  an  issue  that  is  causing  concern  and  has 

resulted in a qualified Audit Report because I believe there are certain ways that we can manage 

issues of confidentiality o</span><span>f individual’s tax records.  Also, allow Audit to have full disclosure so 

</span><span>that they are able to provide an accurate Audit Report.  

</span></div><div><span>I would have thought the use of non-disclosure agreements between these two agencies would help 

to  resolve  these  matters  of  protecting  secrecy  or  confidentiality  and  allowing  full  disclosure  to 

enable the complete Audit Report to be done, so, another matter that I will be stepping in these 

two agencies.  But I do acknowledge that this Ministry has a great responsibility on Government 

</span><span>Agencies as the Manager of the people’s money really but also responsible for providing good 

</span><span>sound financial economic advice to the Government of the day.  

</span></div><div><span>In response to some maybe cost cutting or savings measures, I noticed the Leader of the Opposition 

did not join us for lunch, maybe that is the reason.  That is why we said you guys should not have 

lunch.  But  cost  cutting  is  always  an exercise that  Ministries are required to  undertake in  their 

operations and while it is easy to pick on things like vehicles, the reality is, vehicles are required 

to run Government operations.   

</span></div><div><span>And of course, for Heads of Ministries, the appropriate vehicle is what should be used and I would 

</span><span>know of only a few Heads of Ministries that would be driving large 4x4 pickups. 

</span></div><div><span>These would be Ministries Mr Speaker that would be required to carry equipment as part of their 

job but most Ministries and most Heads of Ministries would be quite sufficient with a small car.  

And I know that when a request goes out for a new vehicle from a Government department, the 

request is very carefully scrutinised by the small committee that has been established that approves 

capital expenditures for vehicles. 

</span></div><div><span>You have to be able to justify to the committee as to why you need a 4x4 double cab.  So, I am at 

this stage happy with the way our vehicle fleet is being managed.  And I am happy to report that

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 27 June 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fourth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>we will be bringing in a fleet of electric vehicles for the Forum.  This is our demonstration Mr 

Speaker that our country is serious about renewable energy, we are serious about reducing carbon 

emissions, so when we have these pacific leaders here, they will be transported around in electric 

vehicles. 

</span></div><div><span>The bulk of these vehicles will be sold out to the public Mr Speaker in order to recover some costs.  

</span><span>We will be keeping however a small number to be added on to the Government’s fleets.  The aim 

</span><span>being Mr Speaker, we should look to convert our entire fleet of cars into electric cars.  The good 

news is that the Leader of the Opposition will be getting an electric vehicle.  It will be the current 

second hand one that I am driving now because I fully support her sentiment of looking at ways to 

save  money.    In  this  way,  we  can  save  money  by  giving  her  the  second-hand  electric  vehicle.  

Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $31,819,348 for Finance and Economic Management stands part of the 

Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
