<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>I have a Supplementary Question but I wish to rise and give thanks to the 

</span><span>Prime Minister for answering my question.  The reason why I wanted to pose the question to the 

</span><span>Minister Mokoroa is that he is the Minister for Justice.  I indicated to him my question but he 

responded back saying he does not know.
