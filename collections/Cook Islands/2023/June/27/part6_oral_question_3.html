<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and all your parliamentary 

staff and to every Honourable Members in this House and our people listening in this afternoon, 

Kia Orana. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, to give a short answer to the question posed by the Member of Akaoa, I believe the 

appropriation in the budget for NES is for looking at ways to solve this environment problem.  But 

as to the question whether the allocation is for the construction of barriers to protect the seashore 

from washing away, I am not sure of this but if I can be given time to find out the answer and come 

back tomorrow to give you a clear reply to your question.  Thank you.
