<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to correct the statement against me that I am using the 

machinery to generate money.  The people who wanted to use this machine, I have advised them 

that there is no fee to it.  However, they will have to purchase for diesel.  The work that is needed 

to be done at Prison has been done, therefore, I am waiting to see if there is any more work, so the 

machine can be taken back there to be used.  Thank you.
