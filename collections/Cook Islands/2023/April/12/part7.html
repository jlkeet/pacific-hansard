<div><span>ORAL QUESTION 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor for Question Time. 

</span></div><div><span>I will take the Honourable Minister first.  Honourable Albert Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I rise today to answer some queries 

from our Sitting yesterday, as I have information to share for those queries.  And I wish to respond 

to  the  Honourable  Member  for  Murienua  for  the  question  he  raised  on  the  progression  of  the 

</span><span>roadwork in Puaikura, especially given his experience as former Minister for Infrastructure and 

</span><span>firsthand knowledge of th</span><span>e constraints faced by the Ministry in fulfilling everybody’s needs when 

</span><span>it comes to road upgrade.  

</span></div><div><span>I am what pleased that the roads that we have now have significantly improved since the Cook 

Islands party has been in Government and rest assured Mr Speaker, we plan to continue improving 

those roads not only in Rarotonga, but also in the Outer Islands as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, ICI started working on Raemaru Heights and Arerenga roads.  Unfortunately, due to some 

</span><span>landowner issues concerning these roads, we have had to stall these projects till those issues have

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>been sorted.  And if I may inform not only this House but the general public, our people listening, 

the work had started until some landowners had made an issue of the boundaries of these roads. 

</span></div><div><span>And may I remind the Honourable Members across the Floor, once again, that these roads were 

the Raemaru Heights road, which is the road of the former Member of Parliament for Ruaau and 

also the Arerenga road as well.  Land issues are still pending. 

</span></div><div><span>Some Members may seem to imply that we are not paying much attention to Puaikura.  Well, we 

wish that we could fix all the roads at once; unfortunately, this is not a reality.  Also, we cannot be 

seen to be in favour of one area of our infrastructure and not the other because after all, we are the 

Government of the whole Cook Islands and not part of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact, the work we started in Puaikura is the start of a comprehensive, yet, realistic programme 

to maintain the Ara Metua, as well as a numerous link roads especially here in Rarotonga.  And 

so, in order for me to inform the Honourable Member and this Honourable House, I will give an 

</span><span>overview of ICI’s confirmed roading program moving forward.</span></div><div><span>Next month, from Puaikura back road, we will swift to the Vaimaanga Ara Metua in Titikaveka.  

This road will start work in the month of April to June.  Following that work Mr Speaker, we will 

swift to Turangi Valley road.  Following that road Mr Speaker, we will come to the Phillip Vakatini 

Road in Takuvaine.  Also, Mr Speaker, from the Phillip Vakatini Road, I believe we will go to the 

Stephen Matapo Road.  We do not have a name for this road but we call it the Stephen Matapo 

Road. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Speaker! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker!  As indicated by the Honourable Minister, he is 

</span><span>supposed to be answering the question.  This is Question Time.  We should be asking questions, 

</span><span>not telling stories about work history!  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Can the Honourable Minister please round up 

your answer to the question? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I am getting the view that this information is 

becoming too painful for the Honourable Member.  So, I will rest. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member, Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question goes to the Honourable Prime Minister.  I 

read  the  newspaper  article  for  Monday  13</span><span>th</span><span>March  2023  and  this  article  stated,  “Police  and 

Customs need to work together.”  Before I ask my question to our Prime Minister, I can see our 

</span><span>Solicitor General in the House and this question may apply to him. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have been asking these two Government Departments of what the conflict is?  They 

told me that they have their own Legislation which they use to monitor visitors to our country.  

Police  also  have  their  own  as  well  especially  with  the  importation  of  Marijuana  for  the  use  of 

medicinal purposes.  Therefore,  the question that  I want to  ask the  Leader of</span><span>our Country is a 

simple  question.  So,  my  first  question  is  whether  Customs  and  Police  acting  on  the  advice  of 

Crown  Law  has  met  to  discuss  and  settle  the  issues  between  those  two  departments  on  the 

importation of medicinal marijuana into the country?   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you very much to the Member from Matavera for the fitting question.  

The question is rightly directed to me because I am the Minister Responsible for both Customs 

and Police.  I like both these departments to be like children to me and I am their father.  The 

problem then is that both of them does not come to the parent to seek advice on how they will 

settle this new problem.  

</span></div><div><span>This problem at the International Airport came to my attention through a newspaper article.  We 

had met with these two departments in regards to the importation of medicinal cannabis.  Firstly, 

we have not amended our laws to allow for medicinal cannabis to be imported into the country.  

We have not changed the law yet.  I would say this problem is a matter for each department to 

</span><span>know  their  roles.    It  is  like  a  rugby  team,  you  have  one  group  of  </span><span>forwards</span><span>  and  one  group  of 

</span><span>backline</span><span>.  Each one has a job to do but at the end of the day, they are all in the same team.  So I 

am happy to say I have met with both Agencies and also the Solicitor General on this matter to 

make sure each department is clear on what the law is, currently and what their roles are as two 

Agencies of the Government. 

</span></div><div><span>I think it is a matter of us seeing more people coming through, bringing their prescribed medicinal 

cannabis into the country.  This is a result of our Referendum that we held, Mr Speaker, where an 

</span><span>overwhelming  majority  of  people  supported  changes  to  our  legislation  to  allow  for  medicinal 

</span><span>cannabis to be used.  In fact, I believe that 62 percent of the respondents supported this and this is 

more people than supported, or voted for the Government.  But we are in the process of reviewing

</span></div><div><span>the legislation to make these amendments, to see how we can apply the use of medicinal cannabis 

in our country.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Leader of the United Party, 

Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER: </span><span> Thank  you Mr Speaker.  I have a question to the Minister of Corrective 

Services, Honourable George Angene, Member for Tupapa and Maraerenga.  This question was 

posed in the last Session of Parliament by the Member of Matavera to the Minister, regarding him 

starting  a  business  with  a  particular  machinery.    So,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  a  simple 

question.  Did he bought the machinery or was it from the appropriation of Corrective Services? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  George 

Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you also to the Member from Murienua for 

the question.  I think the question you have asked is a bit diluted because you knew when you were 

in  Government  who owns the machinery.  This  machine belongs to  the  Ministry of Corrective 

Services and was used for their planting scheme, which is under my leadership.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:    </span><span>Supplementary  Question  Mr  Speaker.    As  indicated  by  the  Honourable 

Minister,  it  was  purchased  by  the  Ministry  of  Corrective  Services.    I  have  never  seen  the 

machinery, in particular, an excavator of five tonne bobcat acquired by the Cook Islands Motor 

Centre at the Corrective Services premises.  Concerning the purchase of this machinery, I have 

never seen it being used in the compound of the Ministry of Corrective Services. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order Honourable Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>    The Honourable Member  for Murienua is  getting  out  of hands with  his 

speech.  He is trying to find some faults so that he can blame me with this machinery; I want to 

correct him.  Concerning this machinery, I have asked the Prime Minister for it and to be used at 

the Prison and to help our people as well.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue Honourable Member.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Minister.  The answer 

was absolute.  It was the Ministry of Corrective Services, which means, Government purchased 

the  machine.    It  was  indicated  in  the  last  Session  by  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Matavera, 

Vaitoti Tupa, when he asked a question about the use of this machinery for side-business purposes 

by the Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>I can vouch Mr Speaker in this Honourable House that this machine has been around the entire 

island, being used.  I can show some photos as proof of this particular machinery being used on 

some properties and that is my concern Mr Speaker, the fact how this machinery was bought by 

Government funds used by the Ministry of Corrective Services, which the Minister took advantage 

of.  That is the end of my question Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  George 

Angene. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to correct the statement against me that I am using the 

machinery to generate money.  The people who wanted to use this machine, I have advised them 

that there is no fee to it.  However, they will have to purchase for diesel.  The work that is needed 

to be done at Prison has been done, therefore, I am waiting to see if there is any more work, so the 

machine can be taken back there to be used.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you for your answer Honourable Minister.  Mr Speaker, his response 

is quite diluted too.  I have a question for the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>It has come to the attention of this country through the Cook Islands Newspaper about the term 

Sabbatical Leave.  Honourable Prime Minister, my question is, have this been resolved?  Has the 

Head for IRD taken this leave with pay for six months?  Because my concern is, under our law of 

</span><span>the  country,  for  any  holiday  period,  two  weeks  is  ample.    But  this  one,  for  six  months  Prime 

</span><span>Minister; and with the Salary that he collects!   

</span></div><div><span>I was reading some of the comments made by the Head of MFEM regarding one of the reasons for 

this Leave is because of the hard work that this gentleman has done during COVID-19.  

</span></div><div><span>There were many volunteers who did not get paid, who gave hours of support as commented by 

our Prime Minister, which is rightly so.  

</span></div><div><span>So, Honourable Prime Minister, has this been resolved?  Is this the actual truth of this matter?  

Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you Honourable Member for the question.  

I think this is a new thing in our country to hear about Sabbatical.  I know in New Zealand and in 

some industries like legal firms, lawyers may take extended amount of time, six months to take, 

what they call is a Sabbatical.  I think the more accurate term to use would be a Leave of Absence.  

</span></div><div><span>However, this is a matter between the Head of the Ministry and the staff and it is something as the 

Honourable Member pointed out a number of our people who were involved in the COVID-19 

years, many of them were over worked and burnt out. 

</span></div><div><span>So obviously the Head of the Ministry has seen that he supports the request from his Head of RMD 

for a six months Leave of Absence.  Furthermore, I am advised by the Head of Ministry that this 

Leave of Absence is without pay.   

</span></div><div><span>But as we know, Mr Speaker, good qualified employees in our country are hard to come by so if 

it means that we have to be innovative in how we try and retain our staff by providing them things 

like a Leave of Absence or a Sabbatical to re-charge their batteries, then I think it is a good idea 

that we look at that.   

</span></div><div><span>But as pointed out by the Member, I think the concerns when people read about this was that he is 

going on a six months paid holiday.  From what I understand Mr Speaker, it is six months Leave 

of Absence from the job in which he will then, I understand, will be returning back to  the job.  

Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member 

Teariki Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I appreciate the answer to the question Prime Minister.  Mr 

Prime Minister, my last question is that last week, $52,000 were raised for Tauturu Aotearoa.  My 

simple question is, is Government going to be part and parcel of the contributions that our people 

have raised for Tauturu Aotearoa?  Thank you Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you for the question.  I think it is a wonderful effort by the people of 

</span><span>the Cook Islands to be able to raise over $50,000 towards the Cyclone Relief in New Zealand.  The 

Government is mindful that with taxpayer funds, we do have a lot of requests and amongst them 

</span></div><div><span>75 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>this year, we heard the question about whether the Government was putting money towards the 

</span><span>200 Years’ Church celebrations.</span></div><div><span>As the Minister of Finance, it is important that we are prudent with how we expend our money and 

I think the efforts done by the fund raising committee for the Tauturu Aotearoa has demonstrated 

</span><span>the people’s support for that.</span></div><div><span>What I have indicated to my team at the Ministry of Finance is that I am more likely to support 

these initiatives that go to countries that are in far more need than New Zealand, and we are mindful 

that only a few weeks ago, the country of Vanuatu was hit by three cyclones and an earthquake in 

a  very  short  space  of  time.    Our  small  community  of  Vanuatu  that  live  in  the  Cook  Islands 

fundraised along with our Red Cross and our Cook Islands community and managed to raise close 

to $10,000 through food sales and the radiothon that was held.  This is a worthy cause that I feel 

our Government  and our tax payers should be putting some money to  support a fellow Pacific 

Islanders that is in a much more needy position than our friends and families in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>So, to that end, Mr Speaker, the Government will be looking to allocate a contribution of $10,000 

towards the Vanuatu Hurricane Relief as part of our contribution for the Cook Islands.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Members.  We have come to the end of our Question Time.
