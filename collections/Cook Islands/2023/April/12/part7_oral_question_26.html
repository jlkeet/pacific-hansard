<h3>Oral Question 26</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you for the question.  I think it is a wonderful effort by the people of 

</span><span>the Cook Islands to be able to raise over $50,000 towards the Cyclone Relief in New Zealand.  The 

Government is mindful that with taxpayer funds, we do have a lot of requests and amongst them

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>this year, we heard the question about whether the Government was putting money towards the 

</span><span>200 Years’ Church celebrations.</span></div>
<div><span>As the Minister of Finance, it is important that we are prudent with how we expend our money and 

I think the efforts done by the fund raising committee for the Tauturu Aotearoa has demonstrated 

</span><span>the people’s support for that.</span></div>
<div><span>What I have indicated to my team at the Ministry of Finance is that I am more likely to support 

these initiatives that go to countries that are in far more need than New Zealand, and we are mindful 

that only a few weeks ago, the country of Vanuatu was hit by three cyclones and an earthquake in 

a  very  short  space  of  time.    Our  small  community  of  Vanuatu  that  live  in  the  Cook  Islands 

fundraised along with our Red Cross and our Cook Islands community and managed to raise close 

to $10,000 through food sales and the radiothon that was held.  This is a worthy cause that I feel 

our Government  and our tax payers should be putting some money to  support a fellow Pacific 

Islanders that is in a much more needy position than our friends and families in New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, to that end, Mr Speaker, the Government will be looking to allocate a contribution of $10,000 

towards the Vanuatu Hurricane Relief as part of our contribution for the Cook Islands.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker.
