<h3>Oral Question 16</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Minister.  The answer 

was absolute.  It was the Ministry of Corrective Services, which means, Government purchased 

the  machine.    It  was  indicated  in  the  last  Session  by  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Matavera, 

Vaitoti Tupa, when he asked a question about the use of this machinery for side-business purposes 

by the Minister.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I can vouch Mr Speaker in this Honourable House that this machine has been around the entire 

island, being used.  I can show some photos as proof of this particular machinery being used on 

some properties and that is my concern Mr Speaker, the fact how this machinery was bought by 

Government funds used by the Ministry of Corrective Services, which the Minister took advantage 

of.  That is the end of my question Mr Speaker.
