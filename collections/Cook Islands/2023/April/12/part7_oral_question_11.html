<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER: </span><span> Thank  you Mr Speaker.  I have a question to the Minister of Corrective 

Services, Honourable George Angene, Member for Tupapa and Maraerenga.  This question was 

posed in the last Session of Parliament by the Member of Matavera to the Minister, regarding him 

starting  a  business  with  a  particular  machinery.    So,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  a  simple 

question.  Did he bought the machinery or was it from the appropriation of Corrective Services?
