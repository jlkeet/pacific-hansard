<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:    </span><span>Supplementary  Question  Mr  Speaker.    As  indicated  by  the  Honourable 

Minister,  it  was  purchased  by  the  Ministry  of  Corrective  Services.    I  have  never  seen  the 

machinery, in particular, an excavator of five tonne bobcat acquired by the Cook Islands Motor 

Centre at the Corrective Services premises.  Concerning the purchase of this machinery, I have 

never seen it being used in the compound of the Ministry of Corrective Services.

<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker! 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order Honourable Minister? 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>    The Honourable Member  for Murienua is  getting  out  of hands with  his 

speech.  He is trying to find some faults so that he can blame me with this machinery; I want to 

correct him.  Concerning this machinery, I have asked the Prime Minister for it and to be used at 

the Prison and to help our people as well.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue Honourable Member.
