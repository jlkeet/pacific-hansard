<div><span>SECOND READING OF BILLS 

</span></div><div><span>We will deal with the Bills in order of appearance.  There is a slight change to the appearance on 

</span><span>the Order Paper.  Our first Bill for the Second Reading is the Departure Tax Amendment Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Prime Minister for the Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Departure Tax Amendment Bill 2023 be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana</span></div><div><span>76 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I now open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak on the principles and 

merits of the Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  This is a very straight forward Bill that tidies up 

some administrative matters relating to the departure tax.   

</span></div><div><span>Our Members will recall when we first came in to Government in 2011, one of the first things we 

did was to incorporate the departure tax into the ticket of paying passengers.   

</span></div><div><span>Some of us remember the days when we had the departure tax booth at the airport and when you 

went to leave, you had to go there and pay $40 to get your departure tax receipt before you could 

get on the plane and previous Governments, Mr Speaker, could not find a way to get the airlines, 

to compel the airlines to incorporate the departure tax into their ticket like its done everywhere 

else in the world. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact, I recall very distinctly those years ago, the Senior Management of Air New Zealand were 

saying that if we put it in the price of the ticket, we are going to see our tourism industry decline.  

Well, it was those sentiments Mr Speaker that made us pass specific legislation to the Departure 

Tax Act to compel the airlines to include the departure tax in their tickets.  And of course, as they 

say, our tourism industry has gone from strength to strength. 

</span></div><div><span>What this Bill does Mr Speaker is that it requires the payers of the departure tax, which is the 

airlines, it requires the airlines to file monthly departure tax returns.  So currently, the airlines pay 

the departure tax that they collect off the passengers.  However, there is no requirement for them 

to file a tax return. 

</span></div><div><span>This is similar to income tax returns that individuals are required to file, Mr Speaker.  We all pay 

</span><span>our taxes but at the end of the  year, we are also  required to file an income tax return.  So, the 

requirement to file these returns will enable the RMD to reconcile the payments received to ensure 

that the departure tax collected is being currently accounted for by the Government. 

</span></div><div><span>The Bill also allows the Collector, the RMD, to determine the method in which the return and the 

payments are to be submitted.  What this means is, it will allow a requirement for them to be able 

to submit electronically  their payments and their returns which fits in with the way that we do 

</span><span>business today, moving away from the filing of paper and making manual payments to the bank.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So this Amendment, Mr Speaker, to the Departure Tax Act, really is an administrative updating to 

allow the returns to be filed but also to allow electronic payments and electronic filing of returns.  

Thank you and I commend this Bill before the House, Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Leader of the Opposition,

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to the people of Titikaveka that are listening to our broadcast.  There was something I 

wanted to say in my speech yesterday which I missed out, but want to share with you today.  If 

only I was given three hours to speak, perhaps, I would have said everything I wanted to say to 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>If I may share with you now that this coming Saturday, at 6.00 p.m., will be our wrap-up for the 

people of Titikaveka as a result of what we went through with the recent Election.  That is at 6.00 

p.m. on Saturday evening at our Puna; at William </span><span>and Mama Moe’s residence in Titikaveka.</span></div><div><span>I hear on this side that they are inviting themselves to this event.  I have no problem with that, so 

</span><span>long they come to support our gathering.  Our Mama’s have also indicated to me that they will not 

</span><span>prepare a small feast, but a big one to cater for all. 

</span></div><div><span>So, on Friday evening, we will begin the preparations for the food for the Saturday event at my 

place before we go to the meeting place.  To those who wishes to bring their alcohol with them, 

feel free to bring them with you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, referring back to the B</span><span>ill before the House, presented by the Minister of ICI…</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, please; I see the Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I was just having a look at the Standing Orders.  I 

think some leeway has been given here but I think we need to concentrate on the debate and sorry 

</span><span>to the Member of Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Honourable Member, can 

you revert back to the debates on the Bill.
