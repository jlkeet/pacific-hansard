<h3>Oral Question 22</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you Honourable Member for the question.  

I think this is a new thing in our country to hear about Sabbatical.  I know in New Zealand and in 

some industries like legal firms, lawyers may take extended amount of time, six months to take, 

what they call is a Sabbatical.  I think the more accurate term to use would be a Leave of Absence.  

</span></div>
<div><span>However, this is a matter between the Head of the Ministry and the staff and it is something as the 

Honourable Member pointed out a number of our people who were involved in the COVID-19 

years, many of them were over worked and burnt out. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So obviously the Head of the Ministry has seen that he supports the request from his Head of RMD 

for a six months Leave of Absence.  Furthermore, I am advised by the Head of Ministry that this 

Leave of Absence is without pay.   

</span></div>
<div><span>But as we know, Mr Speaker, good qualified employees in our country are hard to come by so if 

it means that we have to be innovative in how we try and retain our staff by providing them things 

like a Leave of Absence or a Sabbatical to re-charge their batteries, then I think it is a good idea 

that we look at that.   

</span></div>
<div><span>But as pointed out by the Member, I think the concerns when people read about this was that he is 

going on a six months paid holiday.  From what I understand Mr Speaker, it is six months Leave 

of Absence from the job in which he will then, I understand, will be returning back to  the job.  

Thank you Mr Speaker.
