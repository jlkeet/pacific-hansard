<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you for your answer Honourable Minister.  Mr Speaker, his response 

is quite diluted too.  I have a question for the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It has come to the attention of this country through the Cook Islands Newspaper about the term 

Sabbatical Leave.  Honourable Prime Minister, my question is, have this been resolved?  Has the 

Head for IRD taken this leave with pay for six months?  Because my concern is, under our law of 

</span><span>the  country,  for  any  holiday  period,  two  weeks  is  ample.    But  this  one,  for  six  months  Prime 

</span><span>Minister; and with the Salary that he collects!   

</span></div>
<div><span>I was reading some of the comments made by the Head of MFEM regarding one of the reasons for 

this Leave is because of the hard work that this gentleman has done during COVID-19.  

</span></div>
<div><span>There were many volunteers who did not get paid, who gave hours of support as commented by 

our Prime Minister, which is rightly so.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So, Honourable Prime Minister, has this been resolved?  Is this the actual truth of this matter?  

Thank you.
