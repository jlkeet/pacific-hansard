<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question goes to the Honourable Prime Minister.  I 

read  the  newspaper  article  for  Monday  13</span><span>th</span><span>March  2023  and  this  article  stated,  “Police  and 

Customs need to work together.”  Before I ask my question to our Prime Minister, I can see our 

</span><span>Solicitor General in the House and this question may apply to him. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I have been asking these two Government Departments of what the conflict is?  They 

told me that they have their own Legislation which they use to monitor visitors to our country.  

Police  also  have  their  own  as  well  especially  with  the  importation  of  Marijuana  for  the  use  of 

medicinal purposes.  Therefore,  the question that  I want to  ask the  Leader of</span><span>our Country is a 

simple  question.  So,  my  first  question  is  whether  Customs  and  Police  acting  on  the  advice  of 

Crown  Law  has  met  to  discuss  and  settle  the  issues  between  those  two  departments  on  the 

importation of medicinal marijuana into the country?
