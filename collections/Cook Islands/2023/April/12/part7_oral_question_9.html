<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you very much to the Member from Matavera for the fitting question.  

The question is rightly directed to me because I am the Minister Responsible for both Customs 

and Police.  I like both these departments to be like children to me and I am their father.  The 

problem then is that both of them does not come to the parent to seek advice on how they will 

settle this new problem.  

</span></div>
<div><span>This problem at the International Airport came to my attention through a newspaper article.  We 

had met with these two departments in regards to the importation of medicinal cannabis.  Firstly, 

we have not amended our laws to allow for medicinal cannabis to be imported into the country.  

We have not changed the law yet.  I would say this problem is a matter for each department to 

</span><span>know  their  roles.    It  is  like  a  rugby  team,  you  have  one  group  of  </span><span>forwards</span><span>  and  one  group  of 

</span><span>backline</span><span>.  Each one has a job to do but at the end of the day, they are all in the same team.  So I 

am happy to say I have met with both Agencies and also the Solicitor General on this matter to 

make sure each department is clear on what the law is, currently and what their roles are as two 

Agencies of the Government. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I think it is a matter of us seeing more people coming through, bringing their prescribed medicinal 

cannabis into the country.  This is a result of our Referendum that we held, Mr Speaker, where an 

</span><span>overwhelming  majority  of  people  supported  changes  to  our  legislation  to  allow  for  medicinal 

</span><span>cannabis to be used.  In fact, I believe that 62 percent of the respondents supported this and this is 

more people than supported, or voted for the Government.  But we are in the process of reviewing
