<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Clerk.  Honourable Members, that completes the First, Second and 

Third Reading of the Departure Tax Amendment Bill 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now move to the second Bill; Value Added Tax Amendment Bill 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Prime Minister Mark Brown, to move for the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Value Added Tax Amendment Bill 2023  

be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Our Honourable Members will recall that this Bill 

was actually ready to be tabled before Parliament adjourned due to the last Election.   

</span></div><div><span>Some of us may recall before COVID-19, the Ministry of Finance had undertaken a review of our 

</span><span>taxation, our country was on the verge of graduation, our income levels had risen considerably, so 

it was timely we reviewed our tax policy to see whether there is a need for adjustment.  However, 

COVID-19 came into the country or came to the world in 2020 and that tax review was put aside 

and other measures were needed to change some of our tax to allow us to go through this period 

of reduced income and COVID-19 pressures that were on the country.  One of the measures that 

we will recall in 2020 was an increase in the tax free threshold and also some of our Members will 

recall, there was a relaxation on the requirements to pay provisional tax. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the things we looked at Mr Speaker, was how do we reduce the burden on business in terms 

of the administration of VAT.  So, currently, every month, there are approximately one thousand 

</span></div><div><span>82 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>VAT returns that are filed each month.  Two thirds of these returns out of the two thousand are 

from the businesses with an annual turnover that is less than $300,000 a year.  

</span></div><div><span>So, what this Amendment Bill provides is, it allows those businesses with a turnover of $300,000 

or less to be able to file quarterly returns instead of filing monthly returns.  So, this has the potential 

Mr Speaker to reduce by 42 percent the number of VAT returns that are filed each month.   

</span></div><div><span>To put it another way, it has the potential to reduce by up to 5,000 the number of VAT returns filed 

each  year.  What this means for this smaller business Mr Speaker is that instead of doing their 

returns  each  month,  they  can  do  it  every  quarter.    So  this  reduces  the  time  that  businesses  are 

consumed in doing their VAT administration instead of 12 times a year, it is only four times a year.  

But it also reduces the amount of times spent by IRD in processing these VAT returns.  This is a 

huge amount of proce</span><span>ssing that takes up the bulk of the RMD’s time on the VAT returns.  </span></div><div><span>Now this measure Mr Speaker is a voluntary measure, so if businesses want to file monthly, they 

can still file monthly until such time as they want to file quarterly, then they can file each quarter.  

However, those businesses that do earn more than $300,000 a year, which is about one third of the 

registered VAT companies, they will still be required to file monthly returns.  If  your business 

does grow and exceeds the $300,000 turnover, then you will be required to file monthly returns.   

</span></div><div><span>It is hoped Mr Speaker by this amendment to the VAT Act in one small way, can help reduce the 

business burden and the administrative burden on both the businesses and also on the RMD.  

</span></div><div><span>I commend this Bill to the House Mr Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  Before we take a break, I would like to 

invite the Solicitor General and his Staff to share lunch with us. 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is now suspended until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended 14.30 p.m.  

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.17 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please be seated. 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is now open for debate and if none of the Members want to speak, I will put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the explanation given by the Prime Minister who 

is In-Charge of this Bill, clearly explains the benefits to the Private Sector and to the Tax Office.  

It  gives the option to Businesses who do not return more than $300,000, an option to file their 

returns quarterly.  But if they choose to continue with their monthly returns, that is fine as well.  

But I think that it really also helps our Tax Office who, if the person files quarterly returns, will 

only  deal  with  four  returns  instead  of  12.    This  is  a  Bill  that  the  Democratic  Party  Opposition 

supports. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Teariki 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to support this Bill which has been brought 

in by the Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>My  remarks  on  the  principles  and  merits  of  this  Bill,  if  the  Prime  Minister  can  consent  to  my 

comments about helping our people, especially those in small businesses.  As clarified by the Prime 

Minister, I am unsure about how it was done in the past, but the purpose of this Bill is to impose 

taxes on our people who are currently selling their products on the side of the road.  I do not think 

that these small businesses have reached the $300,000 threshold per annum.  If we can recall in 

the past, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management did propose imposing taxes to those 

small  businesses  who  are  trying  to  generate  some  income  on  the  side  of  the  road.    Therefore 

Honourable Prime Minister, I am not sure if this is still in place, especially with the high inflation 

of products inside the supermarkets, we can actually see a lot of our people generating income on 

the side of the road.   

</span></div><div><span>We can see the struggle that our people are being faced with, especially at the end of COVID.  Our 

people were struggling in their homes for days, weeks, right through to the end of the year. 

</span></div><div><span>We can also see with some of the vendors on the side of the road who are selling bags of chestnuts 

</span><span>at $15, but the size of the bag had gone smaller.  I do not know if there is a correct measure in 

</span><span>place for weighing these bags to see if they meet the correct standards in selling them.  Also, we 

can see that these chestnuts are being imported from Mitiaro and Atiu, maybe there are freight tax 

fees are being included in the importation of these bags of chestnuts to Rarotonga, maybe they are 

a bit higher than their usual costs. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I wanted to thank and encourage our people for utilizing these fruits that God has 

blessed us with because when the right season comes for these fruits, we know that we can use 

</span><span>them for generating income.  We all know the work involved when it comes to chestnuts, it is not 

</span><span>an easy task in preparing them.  Furthermore, the people selling these chestnuts, the chestnut trees

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>are not theirs.  Even with our ta</span><span>ro, people are stealing them from someone else’s plantation, selling 

</span><span>them on the side of the road, along with other produces.   

</span></div><div><span>This evidently tells us Members of Parliament the need to look into this and to see how encouraged 

our people in times like this, not because they were broke, but because they had the strength and 

the encouragement to seek ways in generating some income to help their families with their needs. 

</span></div><div><span>Some vendors that sells coconuts on the side of the road, they always have coconuts every day.  

Mr Speaker, I would like to thank our people for what they do and would encourage them to keep 

going.  We can see the </span><span>eis</span><span> being flown in from the Outer Islands, which basically shows the talents 

that our people have. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Honourable Prime Minister, if this proposal is still in place, I ask if this can be put on 

the side until such time, when our people are back on their feet.  Otherwise, I support this Bill.  

Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I think, it is happening in Takitumu. 

</span></div><div><span>I can see the Honourable Toanui Isamaela; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>Thank you</span><span>Mr Speaker.  First of all, I would like to thank the Honourable 

Prime Minister for the Bill being presented to this Honourable House.  This Bill also applies to the 

Outer Islands as well.  Therefore, I give my full support towards this Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I can see the Honourable Teokotai Herman; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, please, if I may use this time for my Maiden Speech before I 

share my support for the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Member delivers a Chant from Aitutaki 

</span></div><div><span>This chant unifies us all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  congratulations  to  your  re-election  and  your  reappointment  as  Speaker  of  this 

Honourable House.  Also, to my friend, Honourable Member from Pukapuka, for your re-election 

as the Deputy Speaker of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Your Excellency, the King’s Representative Sir Tom Marsters and Lady Marsters, I wish you all

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I thank the people in the gallery and all those who are listening to this telecast, kia orana to all of 

you.  In every day, I hope to make you proud through working smart for our tomorrow.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand before you all at this very moment truly honoured and very humble to acknowledge two 

special people from my family who have served our country for years.  Their portraits hang on the 

wall of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mama Maea, Papa Arapati Enere is from the Ngati Kamire of Aitutaki.  Few in history get to shape 

the destiny of a Nation and Papa Arapati certainly was one of them.  Mr Speaker, from that bunch 

of bananas, Tango is one of the branches.  We all know of the work he has done, especially with 

all of us seated in this Honourable House; the Government side and the Opposition side.  This is 

how we, the people of the Cook Islands, realized that we can lead ourselves and it was our people 

who voted for our Government without disruptions; and my Uncle Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>These two Pillars have done great contributions and had attained great achievements for our small 

Nation.  Both served with distinction as Honourable Ministers and Prime Ministers and Leaders 

of our country.  I give glory to God for leading these two during their time.  They did some great 

work during their time. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, this is my time.  This is Tango Herman’s time and this is where my political journey starts.  

</span><span>There is a bit of delay with this journey Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I have served the people of 

Araura Enua as Mayor for 15 years.  Yes, 15 years and I have achieved a lot of good things; I 

cannot remember any bad ones. 

</span></div><div><span>Henry Kissinger once said, do not be too ambitious, do the most important thing you can think of 

and your career will take care of itself.  One of my achievement was to initiate and establish Sunday 

flights into Aitutaki.  Mr Speaker, that was a bumpy ride, the hurdles were very high and I nearly 

got hung for it.  Today, this service is positively contributing to the economy of Aitutaki, enjoyed 

</span><span>by the people of Aitutaki and by the people of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>It also contributes as a major transport link for our tourism industry.  Mr Speaker, it takes special 

people  with  vision  and  courage  to  achieve  that  goal.    I  bring  this  House  values  of  my  own 

consistent with the founding princip</span><span>les of our country’s vision statement.  These values stem from 

</span><span>the teaching and moulding of my grandfather John and my grandmother Nancy Herman.  They 

were hard and smart working people and at times rule with iron fists. 

</span></div><div><span>They made sure I understand and practice good work ethics and I did with my own flavour.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have not come here to make a career, I have come here to contribute and try and 

make better to what we have already.  There are so many things we want to achieve in our terms, 

in our time in Parliament especially my time.  Please bear with me for what I have to say. 

</span></div><div><span>I know the Speech from the Throne mentioned that we committed ourselves to $130 million in 

debt to facilitate the needs of our people during the COVID pandemic.  I understand, Mr Speaker, 

that Government has a good plan in place to repay that debt. 

</span></div><div><span>For the past 10 years or more, we enjoyed no cyclones during our cyclone seasons.  Mr Speaker, 

the forecast is that El Nina is now starting to move towards the east from the west.  Mr Speaker, if 

this is so, couples with growing effects of global warming we will surely be expecting stronger 

cyclones with more devastating effects. 

</span></div><div><span>We have seen the Fiji isles and those in the west of Fiji bearing the brunt.  Being accountable 

means we need to urgently recoup our reserves depleted during COVID-19.  This to me overrides 

any non-essential and expensive projects that are now being considered if there are any.  We can 

always revisit these projects in the future but for now, recouping our national reserves need to be 

taken seriously. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we cannot depend onto New Zealand to bail us out during our own disasters.  As we 

know today that New Zealand is getting battered up badly, its infrastructure, its roads, bridges and 

airport and it is costing New Zealand millions and millions of dollars.  I am all about trying to find 

ways to recoup our reserves.  

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday Mr Speaker, I heard some of the speakers asking for funding to support the celebration 

of the 200 years of Christianity, arriving on our shores, especially in Nga-Pu-Toru, Rarotonga and 

Mangaia.    My  Constituency  Vaipae  have  just  completed  the  celebration  of  the  arrival  of  the 

Gospel.  I had been told by our Chairman that the donated money received exceeds the expenditure 

of the event.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when we look at our finance and we had just came out of COVID-19, surely the teats 

of our cow is dry and there is no milk.  Rightly, we should not keep milking the cow for more milk 

or else the cow is going to kick us.  I pledge my support for every initiative that will grow prosperity 

in our country and most importantly, protecting the safety and welfare of each paramount. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before I conclude my speech, I would like to honour and pay tribute to my late friend 

Tini Ford from Tongareva, to his wife and family.  I have heard of his passing but I did not want 

</span><span>to delete it as there was no messages or phone calls.  It is only three weeks ago when I had the 

</span><span>courage to ask my son and I was shocked with disbelief.  To the family, may God comfort you all.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>That concludes my speech Mr Speaker and I stand to support the Bill that is in front of us.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  As there are no more speakers to this particular 

Bill,  let  me  thank  the  Honourable  Members  who  stood  to  support  these  amendments  and  also 

acknowledge the comments by the Member for Murienua regarding what other supports we can 

provide particularly to our low income earners.  

</span></div><div><span>Let mind remind you that this Bill is the amendment to the VAT.  There is a different law in regards 

to income tax.  Income tax does not differentiate your age and your status in the community, but 

on how much you are earning.  So, if you are earning $15,000 per annum, you will not be taxed.  

If you are collecting over $15,000 per annum, then you will be taxed.  We do see our people selling 

produce on the side of the road and trying to find ways to make ends meet.  Like what the Member 

has said, there are vendors selling chestnuts and the size of the chestnut packs is getting smaller 

but the price is not going down. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is one law I have mentioned before COVID-19 arrived and that is on tax review.  

Our economic status as a nation has improved and at the time we needed to review our tax laws, 

ease the tax threshold on our people and we needed to look at ways to make changes to advance 

the  livelihood  of  our  people.    At  the  time,  it  was  suggested  you  have  to  get  to  a  pay  increase 

threshold, then you start paying tax. 

</span></div><div><span>There will be an Income Tax Bill coming before the House in the next few days especially on our 

workers on the Outer Islands.  This is one of the first steps we are looking at to help our people.  I 

will leave it here until such time the Bill is tabled in the House, then I will explain the merits and 

principles of the Bill.  

</span></div><div><span>At this time, I would like to thank all Members for giving your support to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I will now put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to?
