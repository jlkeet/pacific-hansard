<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you also to the Member from Murienua for 

the question.  I think the question you have asked is a bit diluted because you knew when you were 

in  Government  who owns the machinery.  This  machine belongs to  the  Ministry of Corrective 

Services and was used for their planting scheme, which is under my leadership.  Thank you.
