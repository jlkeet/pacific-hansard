<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I rise today to answer some queries 

from our Sitting yesterday, as I have information to share for those queries.  And I wish to respond 

to  the  Honourable  Member  for  Murienua  for  the  question  he  raised  on  the  progression  of  the 

</span><span>roadwork in Puaikura, especially given his experience as former Minister for Infrastructure and 

</span><span>firsthand knowledge of th</span><span>e constraints faced by the Ministry in fulfilling everybody’s needs when 

</span><span>it comes to road upgrade.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I am what pleased that the roads that we have now have significantly improved since the Cook 

Islands party has been in Government and rest assured Mr Speaker, we plan to continue improving 

those roads not only in Rarotonga, but also in the Outer Islands as well. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, ICI started working on Raemaru Heights and Arerenga roads.  Unfortunately, due to some 

</span><span>landowner issues concerning these roads, we have had to stall these projects till those issues have

<div><span>Wednesday, 12 April 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>been sorted.  And if I may inform not only this House but the general public, our people listening, 

the work had started until some landowners had made an issue of the boundaries of these roads. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And may I remind the Honourable Members across the Floor, once again, that these roads were 

the Raemaru Heights road, which is the road of the former Member of Parliament for Ruaau and 

also the Arerenga road as well.  Land issues are still pending. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Some Members may seem to imply that we are not paying much attention to Puaikura.  Well, we 

wish that we could fix all the roads at once; unfortunately, this is not a reality.  Also, we cannot be 

seen to be in favour of one area of our infrastructure and not the other because after all, we are the 

Government of the whole Cook Islands and not part of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In fact, the work we started in Puaikura is the start of a comprehensive, yet, realistic programme 

to maintain the Ara Metua, as well as a numerous link roads especially here in Rarotonga.  And 

so, in order for me to inform the Honourable Member and this Honourable House, I will give an 

</span><span>overview of ICI’s confirmed roading program moving forward.</span></div>
<div><span>Next month, from Puaikura back road, we will swift to the Vaimaanga Ara Metua in Titikaveka.  

This road will start work in the month of April to June.  Following that work Mr Speaker, we will 

swift to Turangi Valley road.  Following that road Mr Speaker, we will come to the Phillip Vakatini 

Road in Takuvaine.  Also, Mr Speaker, from the Phillip Vakatini Road, I believe we will go to the 

Stephen Matapo Road.  We do not have a name for this road but we call it the Stephen Matapo 

Road.
