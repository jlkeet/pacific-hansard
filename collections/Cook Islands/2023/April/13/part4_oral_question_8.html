<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Irrelevance!  Mr Speaker, I entered Politics in 2010.  In 2011, a meeting 

was held  and the Minister at the time was  Teariki  Heather.  The Members of Parliament  were 

invited,  not  Ministers,  Members  of  Parliament.    At  that  time,  the  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Mokoroa was the Head of Ministry for ICI.  We the Members of Parliament at the time was invited 

to this meeting. 

</span></div>
<div><span>During that time one of the current Ministers of the Crown, Mac Mokoroa was the Secretary of 

ICI at the time.  I requested for a machine to be purchased for all Honourable Members.
