<h3>Oral Question 38</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This question is to the Minister of Finance.  The Cook Islands 

Medium Term Debt Management Strategy 2022-26 stated that the total value of the public debt to 

the end of June 2022 was estimated to be $228.3 million and I believe of this debt $114 million 

was related to COVID.  The speech from the throne referred to a debt of $130 million.  Can the 

Minister explain the difference of $16 million is my first question? 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, that, I do not ask a Supplementary Question and maybe because I am expecting you want time 

to answer that question, let me ask my second and third question.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Is there a plan to put a ceiling on spending on COVID and what is our actual total value of public 

debt today?   

</span></div>
<div><span>The  fifth  question  is,  what  plans  are  in  place  to  repay  this  debt  given  the  slow-down  of  the 

economy?  I thought you might need time for all those questions.   

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I  can see the Honourable 

Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker and thank you very much Honourable 

Leader of the Opposition.  These are the types of questions needed, they are so solid.

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, let me answer the first question and that is to the different figures that you alluded to on 

the debt.  I can assume that there are debt figures at different period of time and there may have 

been debt settled during those periods.  But I can say that by the end of this Financial Year, by end 

of June, we estimate our debt levels to be at $216 million.   

</span></div>
<div><span>As to COVID debt, we do not expect to take out any more debts in regards to the COVID pandemic, 

in my own opinion, that issue has now been put to an end, we are now in the process of recovery 

from COVID.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Certainly, our debt levels have increased as a result of COVID.  In fact, we have to change our 

rules  in  regards  to  debts  and  the  Government  have  set  a  net  debt  to  GDP  ratio  of  55  percent.  

Currently, our net debt to GDP sits at 43 percent.  It was just brought to my attention in the last 

day or so that the impact of COVID on our economy over that period from 2020 to last year, and 

the  contraction  of  our  economy,  we  have  been  using  the  estimate  of  around  25  percent  of  our 

economy in contracted.   

</span></div>
<div><span>However, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, has just finished their assessment of our debt 

situation and our economic situation, and their result, ready at hand, indicate that our contraction 

to our economy was actually 41 percent.  Far greater than we expected it to be, but I look at this in 

a positive of light because, according to them, we are the only country in the world with that high 

as level of economic contraction.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Any other country in the world that had an economic contradiction of 41 percent would have seen 

a total collapse of their economy.  However, in the period leading up to COVID and under the very 

good  skillful  management  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Government  have  managed  to 

accumulate $60 million in cash reserves, plus $57 million in an economic stabilization fund.  If we 

did not have that, our debt position would be much greater than it is today. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As it is even with a net debt ratio of 43 percent which we are expecting to the end of this financial 

year, we are still in a very modest debt position especially compared to other countries in the region 

that have far higher debt profiles than our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As has been pointed out to me on a number of occasions, it is not the amount of debt that we need 

to be overly concerned with, it is the repayment amount of the debt that is the concern.  The ability 

to be able to service your debt moving forward is the most critical factor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To answer the question on the plan, most definitely this Government does have a plan and it is a 

continuation of the plan that we outlined at the last Budget but with much better forecasts.  And 

over the next three years I expect to see our debt levels decrease as debt servicing takes care of 

debt but also as the economy increases.

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Government has been on a number of missions now talking to our creditors such as the Asian 

Development Bank who is our biggest banker to the country to restructure our debt servicing so 

that we can reduce the amounts each year that go towards debt servicing and extend that out over 

a longer period of time.  And in fact our estimates are that at our current net debt to GDP of 43 

percent we expect over the next three to four years that level to drop down to 25 percent. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This debt level that we have, Mr Speaker, allows us not just to manage current debt that we have 

but it also allows us to put in place contingency for any other natural disaster that may hit our 

country in the next year or so.  With El Nino expected in the next year coming through, the chances 

of cyclone increase.  Therefore, having a contingent line of credit with the Asian Development 

Bank ready at hand in the event we need it, we can draw it down and still remain below our debt 

to GDP ceiling. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So in  summarizing these five questions that was asked of me, Mr Speaker our debt  position is 

modest, our debt restructuring that we are pursuing will address concerns with the debt servicing, 

especially in the next coming years and if we keep the faith our plan will work.  Thank you Mr 

Speaker.
