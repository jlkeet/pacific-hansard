<h3>Oral Question 30</h3>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I thank God for your reappointment to your position.  

Greetings to all of you in the Name of our Lord.  Because of the delightful statements coming from 

the Government side, like what the Prime Minister was saying, the Government is for the people, 

I therefore stand to redirect our focus towards Mangaia.   

</span></div>
<div><span>This question is and being mindful of what our Chaplain has shared to us this afternoon, that we 

must align ourselves with the Words of God.  So, I believe, exactly like what you have said that 

you are the Government of the people, is true.   

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is to the Minister of Health.  Seeing that Mangaia has been going on for nearly a year 

without a Dentist, what is our opportunity of getting one?  I just need a short simple answer, not a 

diluted one. 

</span></div>
