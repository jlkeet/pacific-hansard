<div><span>SECOND READING OF BILLS 

</span></div><div><span>Our first Bill for the Second Reading is the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>I  call  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  Honourable  Mark  Brown  to  move  for  the  Second 

Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2023 be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  thank  you  Honourable  Tingika 

Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I begin, I was remiss to seek your indulgence 

Mr Speaker as I have two Members on our side of the House who have sort leave, the Member for

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Ngatangiia  who  is  to  attend  a  funeral  that  is  taking  place  right  now  and  also  the  Member  for 

RAPPA who is at an urgent medical appointment which he assures me that he will survive and 

will be back for the remainder of the afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Leave is granted. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  If I may now speak to the Bill that is before the 

House, the Income Tax Amendment for the Pa Enua.  This Amendment Bill Mr Speaker, Members 

will be aware, is part of the Government pledge during the last campaign to make workers on the 

Outer Islands receive income at a tax free threshold of $60,000. 

</span></div><div><span>It  was  an  ambitious  pledge  Mr  Speaker  that  we  made.    It  was  a  pledge  made  out  of  what 

Government has been through the two years of COVID that ravaged our country to find ways how 

we can help all of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>It was a pledge we made Mr Speaker and this Government keeps its promises.  It is clear to all, I 

think everybody, not just Members of the Outer Islands but it is very clear to everybody that there 

is an uneven playing field when it comes to Rarotonga and the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>This Bill goes some way towards levelling that playing field Mr Speaker.  We think that things 

here on Rarotonga cost a lot of money but when you go to the Outer Islands, everything costs more 

than what it is here. 

</span></div><div><span>Fuel  cost  more,  imported  food  cost  more,  materials  cost  more  and  the  time  lost  in  terms  of 

convenience to be able to go down the road and pick up something at the shop cost more.  If you 

need a part for a machine, over here you can go down the road and pick it up or you can order it 

and it will be on the plane the next day.  In the Outer Islands, you can wait days or weeks or months 

for the same thing. 

</span></div><div><span>So, the Government came up with a plan to see how we can start the ball rolling; to do the first 

step.  The first step was, let us lift the tax free threshold from $15,000 for everybody and up to 

$60,000 for those in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The immediate impact of this Bill Mr Speaker will be that over 1,500 workers in the Outer Islands 

will be better off.  1,500 workers Mr Speaker, depending how much they earn, will start to get a 

little bit more money in their pocket because the tax will not be deducted from their pay. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Ministry of Finance estimates that this will inject $1.2 million into our Outer Islands.  This 

means, those people working in the Outer Islands, teachers, nurses, police and all Public Servants, 

they will automatically get a pay rise.  

</span></div><div><span>105 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>But also, those Outer Islands, where there is an active Private Sector, they will also see the benefits.   

</span></div><div><span>The beauty with the amendment Mr Speaker, the first benefit is as I have mentioned, the people 

will get more money in their pocket. The second benefit from the Government side and from the 

budget  side  is  that  there  is  no  need  for  an  appropriation  to  increase  any  payments.    Unlike 

increasing  the  Minimum  Wage  which  this  Government  expects  will  take  place  in  the  coming 

Budget, but that is more good news for later. Unlike an increase in the Minimum Wage, there is 

no need to look for an appropriation to add cost into our appropriation. All it is, is an adjustment 

in the revenue estimates that Government expects to earn to its taxation.  

</span></div><div><span>One of the reasons behind this particular amendment Mr Speaker is, we are looking at economic 

growth.  When this Bill becomes law, I expect that it will attract the number of our firstly Public 

Servants to want to live in the Outer Islands and work in the Outer Islands.  The recruitment of 

teachers which is always difficult will be an added incentive for those looking in the Outer Islands 

when this Bill becomes law. 

</span></div><div><span>Already, I have some Public Servants working in different Agencies asking when this is going to 

take place because they want to move to their home islands to work there. But it also helps our 

grassroots people, those who sell food, those who has stalls, those who grow and those who fish.  

They do not need to be worried in back in their mind that they might be making too much money 

and they have to declare their income and they have to find out how much tax they have to pay.  

They no longer have that concern.  I expect, this will attract more people Mr Speaker into some of 

the start-up work and opportunities that exist in our Outer Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>Of course there will be some rules around how this particular amendment is applied because we 

know our people are travellers.  They live in the Outer Islands, but they travel to Rarotonga and 

sometimes travel to New Zealand.  How do we determine who qualifies under this particular law?  

It is the same rule that we use to determine who qualifies as a resident and who qualifies as a non-

resident if you live overseas.  To qualify for this particular law in the Outer Islands, you must have 

your home in the Outer Islands.  But you must also be resident for at least 182 days to qualify as 

an Outer Island resident. Like the rules we have for resident and non-resident Cook Islanders, there 

are rules also  that will cater for absences from  your home island due to health or education or 

business and work related.   

</span></div><div><span>The  one  thing  I  would  like  to  point  out  here  Mr  Speaker  is  that  in  our  discussions  with  our 

Government team, we are very clear that this particular law be tax exemption.  The tax threshold 

will not apply to Members of Parliament. So, Members of Parliament  will still need to pay the 

usual tax regardless of their residence status. Of course, if I look at our Members of Parliament, I 

</span></div><div><span>106 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>can say that the majority of our Outer Island Members are all here on the Government side.  There 

are only two on the Opposition side and I am sure they will support that ruling as well.  

</span></div><div><span>Economic growth, Mr Speaker is the key to ensuring that we overcome inflation that we talked 

about yesterday.  Economic growth is the key to ensuring that we are able to provide a level of 

health care that our people deserve and economic growth Mr Speaker is to ensuring that we have 

a social welfare network that allows our elderly to live in dignity.  That is why these small steps, 

these amendments to the Income Tax Bill is one small step to helping and providing our stepping 

stone for those who are more disadvantaged in the Outer Islands to get a little handout.  

</span></div><div><span>There are major areas that we are also looking at for economic growth in the diversification of our 

economy  Mr  Speaker.    If  I  listen  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  it  sounds  like  we  are  going 

nowhere and after I congratulated her on retaining her leadership of the Democratic Party, we look 

forward to good working relationship going forward but she is throwing rotten oranges to this side.  

Sounds like the same old story about looking to export products to New Zealand, do not rely on 

tourism and hold back on the seabed minerals program. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister I have to interrupt you.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members I think it is time for a break.  We will continue when we return from our 

break.  Parliament is suspended until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.29 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please be seated.</span><span>I call the House to Order.  During the recess, the Honourable 

Prime Minister was speaking and I would like to invite the Prime Minister to take the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before our lunch break, I felt my blood pressure 

rising in responding to the comments by the Leader of the Opposition with her Reply to the Speech 

from the Throne.  Consequently, the result in taking in that raw-fish, my blood pressure started to 

drop.   

</span></div><div><span>When I was referring to this Bill Mr Speaker before us, this is one of the first of our steps in looking 

at  ways to  rebuild our economy.  One third of our population  Mr Speaker resides in  the Outer 

Islands.  We need to look at ways at how we can include our Outer Islands into part of our growing 

our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>107 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The Government will do its part by making sure that more money stays on the island and we hope 

to  stimulate  more  economic  activity  in  our  Outer  Islands,  but  this  goes  hand  in  hand  with  the 

development of key infrastructure in our Outer Islands, such as the sealing of airport in Manihiki, 

which is now underway.   

</span></div><div><span>So instead of a Bandit aircraft that can take maybe six or seven passengers and very little freight 

sealing a runway, now you will be able to land a Saab aircraft which can take up to 36 passengers 

with 20 kilos each. 

</span></div><div><span>These numbers may seem small but they will have a huge impact on our Pa Enua.  And the question 

has been asked, why are we spending millions of dollars sealing a runway for a community that 

only has a few hundred people?  The simple answer, Mr Speaker that is the cost that a community 

must  bear  if  you  want  to  be  inclusive  of  your  whole  population.    If  we  do  not  invest  in  the 

infrastructure that will enable economic activity, then the people will leave and go to where the 

money is. 

</span></div><div><span>So  it  is  ambitious,  but  it  is  the  Government’s  plan  to  improve  </span><span>the  infrastructure,  the  transport 

infrastructure on all of our islands because this Government believes that once that is in place, we 

will start to see real economic contribution from our Pa Enua, we will start to see people who have 

never been to the islands of Manihiki or Tongareva or to Pukapuka or even to our Southern Group.  

We will start to see them want to go there if the infrastructure enables appropriate pricing for travel 

to these islands. 

</span></div><div><span>It will enable those communities to be able to participate in the economy on Rarotonga by sending 

their products, whether it is sea food and fish or agricultural products or crafts to the markets here 

in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Economists will tell you that, that does not make economic sense.  But we have always been a 

country that has bucked the economic trends, we have always been a country that have come up 

with solutions that many formally trained people would think is impossible, but it works for us.  

The one thing that is under-estimated in all of these formulas that are being used by finance people 

and by economists is the resilience and strength of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>The 96/97 economic crisis bankrupted our country and estimated that it will take 10 to 15 years 

for our country to recover.  It took us less than five years to bounce back.  The global financial 

crisis of 2008/09 affected much of the world but barely an impact on our own tourism industry. 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition says that we must look to change our tourism industry, we cannot 

be doing the same things.  Certainly, I agree with that and more so I see that our industry is acting 

on that.  We hear the talk, there must be more or better yields, not more numbers and again, we 

</span></div><div><span>108 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>are seeing that very much more better yields than we have previous to COVID occurring now.  

That  is  because  our  Private  Sector  is  being  innovative  and  our  Government  is  enabling  that 

innovation. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of our agriculture, we cannot simply fall back to the ways of the past as was mentioned 

by the Leader of the Opposition and look to exports.  The biggest beneficiary of any agricultural 

exports is the airline where the cost of freight far exceeds the return to the grower which is why 

this Government has been always supportive of agriculture that supports local industry.  This is 

where the money is, here. 

</span></div><div><span>As our tourism industry has grown, the demand for fresh products has also grown and this is where 

we see our Pa Enua being able to be part of this economic growth and recovery that we are wanting 

to do. 

</span></div><div><span>I read the comments of the ANZ Economist a few weeks ago about the need to diversify within 

the tourism industry.  Our people in the industry, the tourism industry, Mr Speaker are some of the 

best operators that we have in the region if not in the world. 

</span></div><div><span>They are always looking for a way in how to improve their yield and how to improve their business.  

Recently, on the back of COVID, we have seen a change in how some of our high end travellers 

chooses to take their holiday.  We have seen a number of private jets come into the country with 

these very wealthy people wanting to fly in on their own plane.  We need to adapt the Government 

side to meet the demands of the Private Sector such as private jets landing directly into the island 

of  Aitutaki.    We  need  to  smooth  the  way  of  Government  process  to  enable  these  new  type  of 

activities to take place. 

</span></div><div><span>I now move on to the concerns raised by the Leader of the Opposition about our seabed minerals 

and its role in our economic growth.  I have always stated and this Government has always stated 

that  the  Cook  Islands  will  cautiously  develop  our  seabed  minerals  sector  in  line  with  the 

precautionary  approach.    This  Government  has  always  placed  the  protection  of  our  marine 

environment, our Marae Moana at the forefront.   This has been protected and safeguarded in our 

Seabed Minerals law and policies. 

</span></div><div><span>I have also repeatedly stated that we have not made any decisions yet on whether we will allow 

harvesting of our minerals to go ahead or not.  Those future decisions will be based on the robust 

scientific evidence and with the best interest of our Cook Islanders and our Cook Islands people at 

heart as opposed to relying on arbitrary time frames or moratoriums that are being set by overseas 

interests.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe  if  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  have  been  paying  attention  to  what  the  Government  is 

actually doing, she would have realized that our approach has always been the precautionary one. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  a voyage that we have been on for many decades now with  our forefathers such as Sir 

Albert Henry, Sir Terepai Maoate, who was responsible for the first Seabed Minerals legislation 

and also our current KR, Sir Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>They knew then what I know now, that this voyage requires courage and it requires vision.  Let us 

also not forget the six or seven expeditions done by the SPC during the 70s and the 80s in our 

waters. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  over  the  last  decades,  Mr  Speaker,  we  have  been  putting  in  place  our  laws,  our  processes.  

Setting  up  our  institutions  so  that  we  can  responsively  and  sustainably  develop  our  Seabed 

Minerals  sector.    The  Government  will  continue  to  hold  our  license  holders  to  account  to  our 

monitoring compliance and enforcement regime. 

</span></div><div><span>This includes through having independent experts verify the research findings and also making the 

environmental research publicly available.  So, although the comments coming from the other side 

may be driven by fear and concern, we do not let fear guide our policy. 

</span></div><div><span>I  remain  confident  Mr  Speaker  that  our  Minerals  program  will  play  a  significant  part  in  our 

economic  growth  as a nation.  All the more reason why our Pa Enua  who are stationed in  our 

waters as sentential or guardians to our vast ocean all the more important that they play a key role 

in our economic growth. 

</span></div><div><span>This is an excellent Bill Mr Speaker, if I may say so myself.  Again, an example of how our country 

does things different from any country, how our country is not afraid to take steps that nobody else 

has done before. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, I encourage all Members of this House to strongly support this Bill and I 

urge our members particularly from the Pa Enua to also voice their support for this Bill.  Kia Orana 

and Kia Manuia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Toa Isamaela; 

you have the Floor.

Honourable Members, let us form some groups tomorrow to help this group from the island of 

Mitiaro.  There is an Ambrose tomorrow and this will be at the Golf Club.  This is the intention of 

our people of Aitutaki, for Aitutaki to show their support for Nga-Pu-Toru for the arrival of the 

Gospel to their islands.  We are Christians and we need to assist.

</span></div><div><span>A  special  acknowledgement  to  my  friend  Teina  Bishop  for  his  strong  support  and  faith  in  me 

during our campaign and for giving me advice in the things I should do.  I was hoping that the both 

of us would be here, unfortunately that did not happen.  Therefore, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me remind this House that Teina Bishop has always been the Leader for One Cook Islands 

Party and last month, that position was passed down to me and today, he became my Assistant.  

Thank you to you and to my Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I want to thank my wife for everything she did, for her support during the Election period.  

I have never seen any women such as my wife for the continuous support even though she was 

tired.  I know that she is not listening, she is busy with food preparation.  I want to let you know 

that I love you.

Speaker, my children did not attain any qualifications, but the skills they have in fishing, planting, 

I am forever grateful; especially when it comes to the Round the Island Dancing.  The knowledge 

obtained from my parents have been passed on to them.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>plans by the Government, especially with projects for the Outer Islands, in particular with Aitutaki.  

I have seen some failures of these projects, for example, the dredging of the wharf in Aitutaki.  We 

are currently experiencing problems with this project and has been on since the beginning.  Work 

for this project delays because it gets extended all the time.  It is nowhere near completion.  I am 

not saying anything bad about the Government, I am just stating facts as per my observation.  All 

I am saying is that if only this project was subcontracted to a Private Sector, this project would 

have been completed by now.  But that is the problem today, you tell them to do something, they 

do something else.  It has gone worse. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Honourable Minister, if you get a chance to go to Aitutaki, I ask that you invite the 

three of us to be with you so that we may inspect the work being carried out.  This is my request 

to the Minister of ICI if the opportunity arises.  Do not rely on your Associate Ministers because 

you two will only talk to each other as you are in Government.  But do include the three of us so 

we can update you on what is actually happening. 

</span></div><div><span>Putting that aside, I now want to focus on our Solar.  This is still incomplete. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, in the past few months, our power has been playing up, causing blackouts.  

The households are affected and I for one has lost one of my refrigerators.  Friends have also lost 

refrigerators and computers as a result of the power cuts.  I went to see the person in charge of the 

power facility and asked him what was wrong, he said that his job is only to switch the power ON 

and OFF.  I said to him that his answer was inappropriate.    

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  I seek for an extension of speaking time for the Honourable Member Toa

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Teariki Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  ISAMAELA:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Member  for  Murienua  for  the 

extension of my speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I understand that you are just finishing off? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMELA:  </span><span>He told me to go and talk to the Chairman of the Power Board.  So, if the 

Minister Responsible for this area is listening, when you come to Aitutaki, if the three of us can 

accompany you.  

</span></div><div><span>I will leave that there and will come back to the three of us in the House, from the island of Aitutaki.  

I believe that we should work together to attain some advantages for Aitutaki.  I know that political

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>interferences will occur and people will say things like particular Members from particular Party.  

The togetherness spirit is what I want for the three of us so that we may be able to help our people.   

</span></div><div><span>Referring back to the Speech from the Throne, it also mention that </span><span>“He will pray for the Members 

of this House so that they would work together for the betterment of our people.”</span><span>  I was full of joy 

hearing this.  That was the foundation that Papa Arapati established for this country.  This is a 

Christian nation and we call ourselves Christians.  But concept of it is totally different.  When we 

look  at  the  projects,  millions  of  dollars  are  expended  on  them.    But  when  it  comes  to  the 

Bicentennial Celebration, you do not get much. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this event has come and gone.  I am now looking forward towards the four islands 

that will be celebrating the arrival of Christianity onto their shores in July.  Vaipae has just finished 

their celebration and it was a blessed Event.  

</span></div><div><span>What I am looking at is if Government has a surplus of funds, then by all means give them out to 

Christian  events  because  when  disasters  strikes,  we  all  turn  to  the  Almighty  to  seek  for  His 

guidance, including a Prayer Service at the Auditorium. 

</span></div><div><span>Some of you may say that I get outraged when I speak, no, this is how I communicate.   

</span></div><div><span>I am running out of time and Mr Speaker, I have a few comments to make on Seabed Minerals.  

Last February, our Prime Minister came to Aitutaki to consult with our people and our schools.  

Everything  went  smoothly.    We  could  not  do  anything  because  it  has  already  been  signed  off.  

However, I am hoping to have this displayed in Public.  When they were extracting these seabed 

minerals, I mean you cannot find them here in Rarotonga.  These elements can only be found in 

Aitutaki and in some areas towards the Northern Group; and is administered by Rarotonga.  My 

request is for some Aitutaki Members to be involved and be included on the Committee panel that 

oversee these projects.  Otherwise, relocate this Office to Aitutaki; but to exclude members from 

their industry, and include people from outside of their industry. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have other issues to raise, but I am running out of time.  We can see the prices of 

goods rising.  Our Committees have proposed some programmes for agricultural purposes and this 

has been on for quite some time.  I believe, and my fellow Colleagues will probably agree with me 

as well, that teaching our people in planting crops, feeding animals and fishing would be essential 

for us, especially with the challenges that we currently face.  This is what I mean about finding 

ways that will help our people.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, WWII in 1942, Soldiers from America came over to Aitutaki to protect our island.  

Conversely, there was no war.  War started on the island.  Aitutaki women were impregnated by 

their bullets and when they went back to their country, nine months later, and these bullets started

</span></div><div><span>exploding.  From that time until last year.  Back in those days, 82 babies were born in Aitutaki.  

As  a  result,  a  notification  was  sent  to  their  Embassy,  inviting  them  over  in  hope  to  settle  an 

agreement between Aitutaki and America.  Honourable Prime Minister, you may recall one of their 

Commando Officer who have been here for the agreement.  This agreement has been settled and 

you may notice some of our half-cast people of Aitutaki, some fathers came back to meet their 

children. 

</span></div><div><span>This is a Constitution in our individual islands, our rights to be able to go overseas to fundraise 

and to bring those funds back so we do not have to reply on the Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my time is up and I will conclude my speech.   

</span></div><div><span>His Excellency stated in his Speech that </span><span>“our Government is for the people.  It exists primarily to 

</span><span>provide  an  improved  standard  of  living  and  wellbeing  for  all  of  us  who  call  the  Cook  Islands 

</span><span>home.”</span></div><div><span>Therefore  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  asking  the  Government  if  they  can  consider  us  in  some  of  their 

planning so we can discuss some of the projects for the Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.  In regard to the Bill before  the 

House, as I have run out of time, I give my full support for this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you very much.  I hope our next Member to speak will not be like yours.  

I see the Honourable Tereapii; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for granting me this time to speak.  To all 

Honourable Members of this House, Kia Orana this afternoon.  To you Speaker and your staff, 

thank you for the good work that you do and may God Bless you for the work that you are doing 

for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister  Mark  Brown,  all  Cabinet  Members  and  all  Members  of 

Parliament, Kia Orana to all of us. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Opposition side, Honourable Leader of the Opposition and all your Members, Kia Orana to 

you all and may our relationship continue since the beginning from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August 2022.  It has been 

so long last time we met, from the time of the General Election until now.  My regards to our 

Members of Parliament from the past and our new Members.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, may I please take this opportunity to address my Constituency in Aitutaki.  From one 

side of my Constituency to the other side, Kia Orana to you all.  To my ARE-NIKAU Constituency,

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to you all; you are all probably waiting for me to speak.  To our Cook Islands Party 

supporters, my Committee Members, Kia Orana and thank you for voting for me, for entrusting 

me to be your Member again.  I give thanks to God for this opportunity.   

</span></div><div><span>The woman that I married for 38 years, my wife; thank you very much for being my right handed 

person.  Thank you for your support during our Campaign.  Thank you to our children and our 

families. 

</span></div><div><span>To our Traditional Chiefs on the island, Tamatoa and Teurukura, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To the six different Religious Denominations in my Constituency; thank you for your Prayers, I 

will never forget you. 

</span></div><div><span>To my awesome Sports group, my young farmers, my women’s group and all our children in my 

</span><span>Constituency, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, thank  you to  the Prime Minister for giving me the privilege to  officially open the 200 

</span><span>Years’ Gospel Bicentennial Celebration for Vaipae.  Also to our Cabinet Ministers, for giving me 

</span><span>the privilege to represent all Members and to speak on your behalf.  I believe wholeheartedly, that 

should be the spirit of Government that when special occasion like this takes place in the Outer 

Islands  the  Member  of  the  Island  should  stand  as  Governments  representative  and  save  the 

travelling cost to Government. 

</span></div><div><span>As you hear me speak to you the people of the Cook Islands that this is the spirit of togetherness 

and  this  the  heart  of  this  Government  as  it  pledges  to  help  and  support  to  give  the  benefit  to 

everyone in our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like now, Mr Speaker to speak on the principle and merits of this Bill that is before the 

House.  And as  indicated  by my  colleague the  Member for Amuri-Ureia,  I too  give my strong 

support to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank Government for this initiative in regards to the Tax Amendment Bill which 

will benefit all our people in the Outer Islands even the people of my Constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>Aitutaki is the second most developed island in our country.  As we all know that statistics show 

that Aitutaki is the second largest economic island behind Rarotonga in our country.  I believe that 

it is only right that Aitutaki gets the benefit first. 

</span></div><div><span>Of course, the Word of God says, “there is a time and season for everything.”  There is a time for 

</span><span>good things and there are times for bad things.  Irrespective of the hardship time that we have come

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>through; I am delighted to see this Bill and what has been proposed by this Government in this 

House that will benefit all of our people in the Cook Islands and especially the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I am also grateful to our Government for remembering the people of the Outer Islands that in the 

spirit of this Amendment Bill is also to give recognition and help to our people in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>As already been stated that the threshold of $15,000 or $20,000 that has been explained by the 

Prime Minister before the House that we the Members of Parliament are not eligible but the rest 

of our people in the country for they qualify for this.  No matter, this is good because the benefit 

goes to everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>Despite all of the things and intricacies and the difficulties that we have come through in the Outer 

Islands, I am grateful to the Government and thankful for this particular Bill, which will help and 

support our people in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Prime  Minister  and  his  Seabed  Mining  team  met  in  Aitutaki  with  the  Island  Council  and 

Traditional Leaders.  The people of Aitutaki showed their support, indicating for an immediate 

start in harvesting our ocean.  Let us not wait until three or five years.  We should start now. 

</span></div><div><span>Why  should  we  be  afraid?    Our  people  supports  this  and  would  want  to  reap  the  benefits.    I 

overheard the Member for Amuri/Ureia saying that we, Members of Aitutaki should work together 

for the benefit  of  our people.  That  is  our purpose my friend, to  have three of us Members sit 

together  for  the  benefit  of  our  Aitutaki  people.    But  the  Mayor  and  the  Local  Government  on 

Aitutaki would need to stay out of our way and not interfere with our businesses.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have come to the end of what I intend to say in this Honourable House.  I strongly 

support the Bill before the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Firstly,  my  apologies  to  the  Prime 

Minister I forgot to respond to your congratulatory remarks for my reappointment as Leader of the 

Opposition the other day.  I know that your congratulations: is very sincere. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, I would like to thank all our new Members for their Maiden Speeches.  I did not want 

to speak earlier on regarding the Maiden Speech, I waited until all the new Members have spoken 

and then I want to express my views to you all.  I would like to say thank you to you all and tell 

you all that level of your Maiden Speeches were very high.  But not as high as when we delivered 

ours at our time.

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>But  one  the  importance  things  is  that  it  is  shown  in  our Standing  Orders  in  the  past  there  was 

prohibition about reading from a prepared speech.  So, when Members deliver their speech, it is 

impromptu.    We  can  see  that  you  have  put  a  lot  of  thoughts  in  your  speeches  and  therefore, 

congratulations to you all for excellent speeches. 

</span></div><div><span>I have to be quick because I have only limited time on the address in respect of the Income Tax. 

</span></div><div><span>I think the most telling comment by the Prime Minister in the lead up to the last election was his 

response to the question on how this tax bill will impact tax take and he replied.  And I quote, </span><span>“it 

won’t make much difference.”</span></div><div><span>Of course, having made the promise the Government now has to deliver.  In my mind I doubt very 

much whether they have been much thought given at the time for the complexities that this will 

create in the tax system. 

</span></div><div><span>The Explanatory Note explains that the Bill is to provide targeted economic stimulus and financial 

support to people living in the Outer Islands by increasing the standards supplementary deduction 

for  those  individuals.    We  are  also  told  that  the  Bill  is  an  attempt  by  Government  to  arrest 

depopulation. Today, I want to share with the House the Oppositions views or concerns about the 

Bill. First, it seems to me that the Bill creates two classes of people, those that pay tax and those 

</span><span>that don’t. Second and perhaps the most striking thing about the Bill is that it is going to lead to 

</span><span>the same problems like we had with the Electoral Act. Too many inconsistent terms.  

</span></div><div><span>I wish to apologize to the Solicitor General. I wanted to thank the Solicitor General for making 

himself available this morning to come along to the office to assist us with the Crimes Bill and 

also with the Income Tax Bill. I provided the Solicitor General with a written paper with some of 

the concerns that we had with the inconsistency of some of the terms used in the Bill. He took 

those  away  and  we  agreed  to  meet  at  12.40  p.m.  today  so  he  could  perhaps  explain  to  me  the 

reasons why those terms were used. It remains however a concern for me and I will tell you why 

and for those of us that have been in the Electoral Court we are familiar with term of residence 

here, leaving for medical, leaving for health etc. Although in 2003 or 2004 when the Electoral Act 

was passed I think the Parliamentarians at the time believed that that was the answer to all our 

problems in the Electoral Act. And since then we have come to learn, no it does not solve any of 

the problems. Many court decisions in relation to Electoral Petitions have recommended that that 

Act be relooked at.  

</span></div><div><span>So, the inconsistent terms that I am referring to if you have your Bill which I trust you are looking 

at. The section that deals with Eligibility to qualify for the exemption is in section 44 and when 

you have a look at those sections at 44 (1) (a) it refers to a person who is resident in Rarotonga, 

</span></div><div><span>118 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>that is the term used. And then in 44(1) (b) the term is not a resident in Rarotonga but permanently 

leaves or permanently arrives and so on and so on throughout 44 (1) and 44A. It talks about the 

allowances given for people going for education or being employed or going away for health. We 

know  in  the  Electoral  Act  you  can  be  away  from  a  Constituency  if  you  have  been  absent  for 

medical reasons and we know that the court initially interpreted that to mean if you have a referral. 

Later on, the court interpreted that to mean no, you do not have to have a referral if you are yourself 

feeling sick and you think you need treatment, you can be away.  I think, in the recent Titikaveka 

case, that definition was also broaden to mean that it may not necessarily be a health but more so 

a spiritual treatment, you people can correct me, that you are seeking and that is excusable under 

the Act.  

</span></div><div><span>My point here is that this is going to be a field day for lawyers.  The interpretation of these is going 

to be a problem and will end up in court.  In the discussion we had with the Ministry of MFEM 

yesterday we asked whether this would be problematic administration wise.  They were clearly not 

willing to give us a straight answer because they were fearful of their boss but the impression I got 

and I do not think you need to be a scientist to work it out that it will be problematic.   

</span></div><div><span>For example, when you are in the Outer Islands and when you are not, when you are in Rarotonga 

and when you are not, there is two vehicles that can travel, one is the barge or Tapi Taio and the 

other is Air Rarotonga.  I say, it is a nightmare as far as administration because if I was a person 

that was applying for this exemption and I say, well I have spent a 183 days in Rakahanga, how 

much time will the Ministry for Finance take to establish or to find out whether indeed I was in 

Rakahanga for 183 days?  Putting aside of course with Air Rarotonga, sometimes we have some 

phantom travellers which we are all familiar during times of Election, they are not listed on the 

passenger list but they travel from A to B.  So, whilst the Solicitor General and I spent about five 

or  ten  minutes  before  Parliament  started  this  afternoon,  my  concerns,  Mr  Solicitor  General 

remains. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I turn to the major problem and I wanted to respond to the points that the Prime Minister 

made justifying this Bill.  There are some points we agreed on and there are some we do not agree 

on.  Maybe this is a good time for me to comment.  

</span></div><div><span>I think the Prime Minister was critical of my response to the Speech from the Throne.  May be I 

can  summarize  it  this  way  Mr  Prime  Minister.    There  is  another  famous  saying,  </span><span>“an</span><span>  excellent 

</span><span>opposition might make a satisfactory Government.”</span><span>  So, you need a very strong Opposition to be 

able to ship shape the way we move forward and when we talk about making comments, please 

note that in this Parliament, we are making comments. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> I see the Honourable Agnes Armstrong.</span></div><div><span>119

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  A.  ARMSTRONG:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  seek  an  extension  to  the  Leader  of  the 

</span><span>Opposition’s reply to the Bill?</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>I  have  always  thought  that  in  this  House  when  we  make 

comments, it is for the betterment of our country and if my friends on the opposite side of the 

</span><span>House take it as a political speech, well you are entitled to interpret that way but it isn’t.  </span></div><div><span>And with regard to seabed, am I fearful, no.  Fear is not a word in my dictionary in my Maori and 

English dictionary, fear there is no such word as fear.  Concern, yes definitely.  For the country, 

yes definitely. 

</span></div><div><span>So when we go to the cost in the Outer Islands I agree, we all agree in this House that the cost of 

food and goods in the Outer Islands are high.  But how we address the problem I think is where 

</span><span>we differ.  And the Bill that we are debating today is Government’s suggestion as to how to arrest 

</span><span>part of that problem. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I also have had a closer look at the analysis on the exemption.  The Prime Minister alluded 

to the fact that 1500 tax payers in the Pa Enua will benefit.  Not so, not so.  Approximately 570 of 

</span><span>that 1500 is going to benefit.  That’s about a third of the total.</span></div><div><span>Now if you divide 570 by the number of constituencies 24, 14 islands I think it’s fairer for me to 

</span><span>talk about constituencies because some of the constituencies are islands.  So if we divide that by 

Constituency only 24 people per Constituency is going to benefit. 

</span></div><div><span>I now look at my small island Rakahanga.  The people that will be benefiting is me, that’s if I 

qualify  and  that’s  if  I  go  to  Rakahanga  and  live  there  for  183  days,  the  Executive  Officer,  the 

</span><span>Financial Officer, maybe the Marine Officer, the teacher and the nurse, five.  So someone needs 

to explain to me, how is that going to be a stimulus to the economy in Rakahanga? 

</span></div><div><span>The people that are the most vulnerable and need to have more money in their pockets are the ones 

that are on Minimum Wage.  Now the graph says that if you are on $10,000 and below, there is no 

tax and if you are on $15,000, these are the calculations from the MFEM Office.  If you are on 

$15,000 you actually get $1.31 per week more and if you are on $20,000 you have $17.65 per 

week more and there is more and more as you go up the scale.  So the people that are really needing 

the money is not going to get the money.   

</span></div><div><span>For us Members of Parliament and I will comment on that before we finish, those Members of 

Parliament in the Outer Islands who qualify, you would be saving and taking away about more

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>than $10,000 per annum.  So it would be quite justified for my electorate to say to me, well you 

are going to go to Parliament and vote for a Bill to fill your own pocket. 

</span></div><div><span>I  heard  the  Prime  Minister  say  that  this  Bill  will  not  apply  to  Parliamentarians.    I  stand  to  be 

corrected and I did not ask, I was not aware of that and I did not ask the Solicitor General.  I do 

not  read the Act  to  say that,  there is  no Parliamentarian reference to  Parliamentarians as being 

exempt. 

</span></div><div><span>I agree with the Prime Minister that a wage increase will require an amendment and appropriation.  

I have serious doubts as to whether this Bill is going to attract or re-populate our population on the 

Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  there  are  other  in  our  view,  the  Opposition  view,  there  are  other  avenues  where  we  can 

stimulate the economy in the Outer Islands.  There may be not one or two or three answers, there 

may  be  a  multitude  of  answers  but  shipping  subsidy  is  one,  extra  benefit  for  the  vulnerable  is 

another, special allowance for unemployed is another, et cetera, et cetera.   

</span></div><div><span>All I know, Honourable Members is this is not one of them.  Thank you and I will not support this 

Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Honourable Members, we 

have come to the end of our business for today.  Thank you for your efforts today and we will 

come back tomorrow to complete our businesses.  To our new Members, we will be starting at 

10.00 a.m. tomorrow.   

</span></div><div><span>May I remind all Honourable Members that tomorrow is Kia Orana Day and if you can come in 

your nice pareu shirts with your ei.   

</span></div><div><span>Please do not come in your party shirts, try and wear different colours to bring a colourful taste to 

this House.  I will be expecting a good deliberation tomorrow, hopefully we will finish all our 

businesses tomorrow.

please?
