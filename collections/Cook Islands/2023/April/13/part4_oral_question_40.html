<h3>Oral Question 40</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Minister for ICI.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I was very happy to read todays paper, the Minister outlined the work that will be done on our 

roads.  I was also happy to note that Matavera has been included in these plans.  Mr Speaker, my 

question is more a request.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The current plan will be carried out from Matavera and then to Titikaveka next month, back to 

Matavera  the  following  month.    My  question  to  the  Minister  is  in  regards  to  the  backroad  of 

Matavera.  This will include Tupapa, from the Manihiki Hostel all the way to Ngatangiia and then 

to the main road and then straight to Titikaveka; can the backroad be considered?   

</span></div>
<div><span>The article that  was printed in  the local  newspaper was making  referrals  to  a month-by-month 

work program especially the allocation of the works on our roads, including Matavera. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, my question therefore is this.  If possible Honourable Minister that the repairs of the back road 

of Matavera, if that could take place from the Manihiki hostel in Tupapa and all the way back to 

the other end of Matavera.

<div><span>And to Ngatangiia and back on the main road and all the way to Titikaveka.  And as you have 

spoken and revealed the allocation on the basis of month-by-month work on the roads.  If this can 

be included from Tupapa to the other side of Matavera and further on to Titikaveka.
