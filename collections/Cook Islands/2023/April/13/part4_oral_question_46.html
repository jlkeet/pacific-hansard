<h3>Oral Question 46</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  I have only 15 seconds left and thank you Mr Speaker.  On this question, 

where are your lights?  My answer is I do not know because I never took them and I do not know 

where they are stored. 

</span></div>
<div><span>If you had asked for some lights, I would have asked you to wait for us to sort something out. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.
