<h3>Oral Question 32</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Kia Orana to us all and to you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana also to the 

Honourable Member for asking me this question.  However, I am quite astonished with her because 

we always sit together whenever we go for our lunch break.  But then again, she wants the entire 

world to hear her question.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, there is a plan.  Not only for Mangaia but also for the other islands as well 

and not only for dental practitioners, but also general practitioner.  We are all aware that a number 

of our people are leaving the country and some from important posts in Government, particularly 

from the Ministry of Health.  Yes, we are trying and looking for ways to extend the assistance to 

our people in the Outer Islands.  Included in this plan is the island of Atiu.
