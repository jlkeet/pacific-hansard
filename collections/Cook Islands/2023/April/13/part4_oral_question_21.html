<h3>Oral Question 21</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana everyone.  Mr Speaker and your staff, Honourable 

Prime Minister and your side, our side, Kia Orana.  Our guests in the Public Gallery, the Solicitor 

General and your Assistance, our Media, Kia Orana.  Staff of this Parliamentary House who is not 

in this Chamber, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I have a question to the Minister of Infrastructure.  In the Speech from the Throne, the Government 

were praising themselves with the capital investments and projects here in Rarotonga and the Outer 

Islands.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Rakahanga was mentioned as one of the islands on these investment development projects. I was 

surprised, so I contacted the EO in case the project involving the construction of the Rakahanga 

Cyclone Centre was done in my absence.  He replied nothing major has been done but much needed 

repairs to the school roofing and to the water tanks are required.  The question is?  Am I wrong or 

</span><span>is there another project or infrastructure because I am asking this question on the grounds that the 

</span><span>Rakahanga Council Members are holding meetings in the rundown administration office and I feel 

sorry for them.  There are no toilet and kitchen facilities.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So please Minister, the only reason why I am asking you this question is because it was mentioned 

in the Speech from the Throne.
