<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  The question Mr Speaker is to our Prime Minister.  If this is the case, then 

a log book should be provided to the Government to show where and when the machine was used.  

And if that can be made available and be presented to this House or to me personally, then I will 

support the claims of the work that this machinery was purchased for.  It is for the community and 

this is why I have not seen this machinery at our Prison in Arorangi.  Thank you Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  It is not the business of the Members of this House 

or  the  business  even  of  Ministers  to  present  working  log  books  of  operating  machines  before 

Parliament. 

</span></div>
<div><span>If anybody is interested in how much a vehicle is being utilized, the appropriate people to go and 

see is the heads of those ministries and departments.  If the Honourable Member is keen to know 

the log book and operating records of this particular machine.  I would suggest and recommends 

that he meets with the head of the Corrective Services to be able to discuss those management 

matters. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Teariki 

Heather.
