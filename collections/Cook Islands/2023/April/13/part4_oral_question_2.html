<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Member for the question.   

</span></div>
<div><span>You are asking me how much this machine cost.  My response Honourable Member is, I do not 

know how much it cost because I am not a Finance Officer.  Although I cannot count money in 

digital sense, however, I can count numbers of people who voted for me during Election.  I would 

know exactly the total numbers of voters who voted for me. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In response to your question, I am not sure how much the machinery cost.  Thank you.
