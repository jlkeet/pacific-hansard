<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank  you Mr Speaker.   I am looking at Standing Order 240 (1) (j),  </span><span>“a 

</span><span>question  must  not  be  asked  seeking  information  readily  available  in  official  publications  or 

</span><span>ordinary works of reference.”</span></div>
<div><span>The question put by the Member for Murienua; he knew the answer because he answered his own 

question.  He knew how much the machinery costs.  I will wait for the rest of his comments.  As 

we are the Ministers, therefore, we are the Fathers of these Ministries.  His question is whether the 

Ministry of Corrective Services been audited with the work, he did.

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question was asked on the machine that was bought under the Corrective Services.  When the 

request came through the Budget Appropriation Mr Speaker, it was a very straightforward request 

for machinery to help the prisoners in their work outside in the community. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We know the work that they have been doing in the past Mr Speaker is hard labour.  So the Minister 

for Corrective and rightly so recommended and suggested to our Budget request for a machine that 

would be suitable to help our Corrective Services, also be useful in the wider community and as 

we can see this machine has been very helpful in helping our communities digging holes or graves 

amongst other works in our community. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Particularly for our low-income earners who cannot afford to hire expensive machinery for small 

jobs around their homes.  So, for the cost of the price of fuel to run the machine, Mr Speaker that 

is all the community is required to cover in the operation of this machine. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.
