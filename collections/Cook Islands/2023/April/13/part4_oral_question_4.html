<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister for your response.  The reason why Mr 

Speaker  is  because  the  Minister  confirmed  yesterday  that  the  Ministry  of  Corrective  Services 

funded this machinery.  The total amount expended for this machinery is $130,000.  It is important 

for the Minister to know this instead of Votes numbers.  From 2019 up until today, Mr Speaker, I 

cannot und</span><span>erstand why a Minister will purchase a machine using taxpayers’ money and use it for 

</span><span>his own purposes and not for the people of this country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I was happy with the Prime Minister yesterday when he shared about the two children of his that 

works  for  the  Min</span><span>istry.    He  was  correct  when  he  said,  “Father  of  the  Nation,  Father  of  the 

Government.”  My question to you Honourable Prime Minister, these are your two children, and 

</span><span>if they did something wrong under your Ministerial leadership, what would you do with regarding 

the  funds  that  were  misused  by  the  Government?    The  machine  stayed  with  him  throughout 

General Election, which he used for his own purposes.
