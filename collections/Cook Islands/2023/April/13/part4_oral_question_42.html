<h3>Oral Question 42</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you to the Member from Matavera.  I thought you were going to 

stand and ask for Matavera roadwork to be done outside of the programme. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But to answer the Honourable Members’ question, plainly Mr Speaker because of the constraints 

</span><span>of  the  annual  budget  Mr  Speaker,  which  is  $800,000  annually.    On  this  request  of  yours 

Honourable Member, this means this budget allocation will be spent on your roads alone. 

</span></div>
<div><span>That means the Honourable Sonny Williams and Honourable Vaine Mokoroa will have to wait for 

another year or onwards for their Constituency road upgrade to be attended to.  Hence, the reason 

why the allocation of the work that has been spread out from one location to another, to spread 

</span><span>everyone’s’ share.</span></div>
<div><span>The question  you raised  Honourable Member is a good question.   If only the allocation of our 

budget annually is over $5 million, then I believe the request that you have made for the completion 

of the work on our roads will be certified under that program. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Consequently, because of the allocation of the budget that has been given for this program, we 

therefore  had  to  allocate  certain  work  and  budget  to  benefit  and  shared  to  every  one  of  our 

community. 

</span></div>
<div><span>That is the answer and the reason of the allocation and I hope that I have answered your question.  

So, the answer being, no. 

</span></div>
