<h3>Oral Question 36</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you all and thank you to the 

Honourable Member for the question.  Bear with me, I will come back to you with a reply, I just 

need to know who this family is that requires this special care.  There is assistance available from 

within Internal Affairs for the elderly, children and those that requires special assistance as you 

have explained.  Perhaps when we have a break, we can have a discussion on this issue.  Thank 

you.
