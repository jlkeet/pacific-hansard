</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have come to Question Time and Question Time will be for one hour.  

I  now open the  Floor for Question Time.   I see  the Honourable Teariki  Heather;  you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you and Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker; Clerk and staff of Parliament 

and Members of Parliament on both sides, Kia Orana to you all this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a question to the Minister for the Ministry of Corrective Services.  He responded to my 

question yesterday with a diluted response, but I would like to ask him another question regarding 

the same machinery. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is, can the Honourable Minister share with us in this Honourable House to how much 

</span><span>it cost to purchase for this BobCat Excavator machine? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  George 

Angene; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Member for the question.   

</span></div><div><span>You are asking me how much this machine cost.  My response Honourable Member is, I do not 

know how much it cost because I am not a Finance Officer.  Although I cannot count money in 

digital sense, however, I can count numbers of people who voted for me during Election.  I would 

know exactly the total numbers of voters who voted for me. 

</span></div><div><span>In response to your question, I am not sure how much the machinery cost.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you very much Honourable Minister and I see the Honourable Member 

Teariki Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister for your response.  The reason why Mr 

Speaker  is  because  the  Minister  confirmed  yesterday  that  the  Ministry  of  Corrective  Services 

funded this machinery.  The total amount expended for this machinery is $130,000.  It is important 

for the Minister to know this instead of Votes numbers.  From 2019 up until today, Mr Speaker, I 

cannot und</span><span>erstand why a Minister will purchase a machine using taxpayers’ money and use it for 

</span><span>his own purposes and not for the people of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>I was happy with the Prime Minister yesterday when he shared about the two children of his that 

works  for  the  Min</span><span>istry.    He  was  correct  when  he  said,  “Father  of  the  Nation,  Father  of  the 

Government.”  My question to you Honourable Prime Minister, these are your two children, and 

</span><span>if they did something wrong under your Ministerial leadership, what would you do with regarding 

the  funds  that  were  misused  by  the  Government?    The  machine  stayed  with  him  throughout 

General Election, which he used for his own purposes.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank  you Mr Speaker.   I am looking at Standing Order 240 (1) (j),  </span><span>“a 

</span><span>question  must  not  be  asked  seeking  information  readily  available  in  official  publications  or 

</span><span>ordinary works of reference.”</span></div><div><span>The question put by the Member for Murienua; he knew the answer because he answered his own 

question.  He knew how much the machinery costs.  I will wait for the rest of his comments.  As 

we are the Ministers, therefore, we are the Fathers of these Ministries.  His question is whether the 

Ministry of Corrective Services been audited with the work, he did.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The question was asked on the machine that was bought under the Corrective Services.  When the 

request came through the Budget Appropriation Mr Speaker, it was a very straightforward request 

for machinery to help the prisoners in their work outside in the community. 

</span></div><div><span>We know the work that they have been doing in the past Mr Speaker is hard labour.  So the Minister 

for Corrective and rightly so recommended and suggested to our Budget request for a machine that 

would be suitable to help our Corrective Services, also be useful in the wider community and as 

we can see this machine has been very helpful in helping our communities digging holes or graves 

amongst other works in our community. 

</span></div><div><span>Particularly for our low-income earners who cannot afford to hire expensive machinery for small 

jobs around their homes.  So, for the cost of the price of fuel to run the machine, Mr Speaker that 

is all the community is required to cover in the operation of this machine. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you Honourable Prime Minister.   I see again  the Honourable Teariki 

Heather on the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Prime Minister for your reply.  The reason for my question to 

the Prime Minister is because of the appropriation in the budget, the allocation is for the people of 

this country, in this particular ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Prime  Minister  is  opening  a  new  initiative  for  all  Honourable  Members  and  individual 

Constituencies, under this new initiative, we can request for ourselves an excavator to help our 

people. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, what is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Irrelevance!  Mr Speaker, I entered Politics in 2010.  In 2011, a meeting 

was held  and the Minister at the time was  Teariki  Heather.  The Members of Parliament  were 

invited,  not  Ministers,  Members  of  Parliament.    At  that  time,  the  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Mokoroa was the Head of Ministry for ICI.  We the Members of Parliament at the time was invited 

to this meeting. 

</span></div><div><span>During that time one of the current Ministers of the Crown, Mac Mokoroa was the Secretary of 

ICI at the time.  I requested for a machine to be purchased for all Honourable Members.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, can you please sit down? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Irrelevancy Mr Speaker!  I was talking to the Prime Minister.  I was asking 

him  a  question  and  I  was  sharing  my  views  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  not  to  the  Minister  of 

Corrective Services. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Member,  are  you  asking  another  question  or  a  Supplementary 

Question? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Yes, yes, I am asking a question, straight after explanation.  My question is 

to the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please, ask your question! 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  The question Mr Speaker is to our Prime Minister.  If this is the case, then 

a log book should be provided to the Government to show where and when the machine was used.  

And if that can be made available and be presented to this House or to me personally, then I will 

support the claims of the work that this machinery was purchased for.  It is for the community and 

this is why I have not seen this machinery at our Prison in Arorangi.  Thank you Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  It is not the business of the Members of this House 

or  the  business  even  of  Ministers  to  present  working  log  books  of  operating  machines  before 

Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>If anybody is interested in how much a vehicle is being utilized, the appropriate people to go and 

see is the heads of those ministries and departments.  If the Honourable Member is keen to know 

the log book and operating records of this particular machine.  I would suggest and recommends 

that he meets with the head of the Corrective Services to be able to discuss those management 

matters. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Teariki 

Heather.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Prime Minister for your reply.  The reason I asked because the 

funds spent on these machines is from the budget of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see now the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Minister for the Ministry of Justice.  

I believe that he is able to answer my question for this is mentioned in our local newspaper. 

</span></div><div><span>It was quoted in the Newspaper article on 18</span><span>th</span><span>March 2023 that Judge Toogood “slams Cri</span><span>minal 

</span><span>Justice System.”</span></div><div><span>He said that he is a bit worried about the criminal justice system.  Mr Speaker, when we read this 

article, the lengthy period it took for the conviction of this person, I would say Mr Speaker that it 

took a one year period for this case to be considered. 

</span></div><div><span>When I contacted the Ministry of Justice, I asked them who was at fault.  They explained it to them 

that there are many.  I was not sure whether the Minister Responsible was at fault or not. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Minister,  the  question  is,  has  this  case  been  resolved?    The  frustration  that  Judge 

Toogood experienced, has it been resolved?  This case took so long and I wanted to ask if this has 

been resolved, to prevent Judges from issuing their verdicts.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  MOKOROA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    First  of  all,  Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable 

Members in this House.  I would like to thank the Honourable Member for Matavera for raising 

this question on a newspaper article written on 18 March 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>As articulated by the Member, the delay of this case with this person being convicted.  His question 

is,  if  this  case  has  been  resolved  by  Judge  Toogood.    The  answer  is,  yes  and  this  case  been 

dismissed.  I do not  think the problem  lies with the Ministry of Justice,  I think it lies with  the 

Police, as they were the ones who lodged this case to Court. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would recommend for the Member of Matavera to direct his question to the Minister 

of Police. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister Mokoroa.  I see the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana everyone.  Mr Speaker and your staff, Honourable 

Prime Minister and your side, our side, Kia Orana.  Our guests in the Public Gallery, the Solicitor 

General and your Assistance, our Media, Kia Orana.  Staff of this Parliamentary House who is not 

in this Chamber, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a question to the Minister of Infrastructure.  In the Speech from the Throne, the Government 

were praising themselves with the capital investments and projects here in Rarotonga and the Outer 

Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>Rakahanga was mentioned as one of the islands on these investment development projects. I was 

surprised, so I contacted the EO in case the project involving the construction of the Rakahanga 

Cyclone Centre was done in my absence.  He replied nothing major has been done but much needed 

repairs to the school roofing and to the water tanks are required.  The question is?  Am I wrong or 

</span><span>is there another project or infrastructure because I am asking this question on the grounds that the 

</span><span>Rakahanga Council Members are holding meetings in the rundown administration office and I feel 

sorry for them.  There are no toilet and kitchen facilities.   

</span></div><div><span>So please Minister, the only reason why I am asking you this question is because it was mentioned 

in the Speech from the Throne. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the Opposition.  I can see the Minister for Infrastructure; 

you have the Floor 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    This  question  is  a  bit  diluted.    Firstly,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, I cannot speak about the King’s Representatives Speech, that has absolutely nothing to 

do with me.  Whatever references that…?</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Point of order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This is a Speech from the Prime Minister, from Government, 

</span><span>delivered by the King’s Representative.  That is why I asked because it is Governments position. </span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the Opposition.  Can I ask the Minister to respond? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My understanding is that it is a Speech from the 

</span><span>Throne.  However, to answer the Honourable Member, my Auntie from Rakahanga, just to be fair, 

</span><span>if  she  could  just  give  me  a  bit  of  time  so  I  can  gather  the  information  required  to  answer  her 

question.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister; that is more appropriate.  Now, I can see the 

Member for Tamarua, Tetangi Matapo; you have Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I thank God for your reappointment to your position.  

Greetings to all of you in the Name of our Lord.  Because of the delightful statements coming from 

the Government side, like what the Prime Minister was saying, the Government is for the people, 

I therefore stand to redirect our focus towards Mangaia.   

</span></div><div><span>This question is and being mindful of what our Chaplain has shared to us this afternoon, that we 

must align ourselves with the Words of God.  So, I believe, exactly like what you have said that 

you are the Government of the people, is true.   

</span></div><div><span>My question is to the Minister of Health.  Seeing that Mangaia has been going on for nearly a year 

without a Dentist, what is our opportunity of getting one?  I just need a short simple answer, not a 

diluted one. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister of Health; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Kia Orana to us all and to you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana also to the 

Honourable Member for asking me this question.  However, I am quite astonished with her because 

we always sit together whenever we go for our lunch break.  But then again, she wants the entire 

world to hear her question.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Member, there is a plan.  Not only for Mangaia but also for the other islands as well 

and not only for dental practitioners, but also general practitioner.  We are all aware that a number 

of our people are leaving the country and some from important posts in Government, particularly 

from the Ministry of Health.  Yes, we are trying and looking for ways to extend the assistance to 

our people in the Outer Islands.  Included in this plan is the island of Atiu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I can see the Honourable Robert Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Members and staff of this House.  

My question is to the Minister Responsible for Internal Affairs.   

</span></div><div><span>Before I ask my question, just a brief background on my thoughts.  There is this elderly couple 

being a teacher and a builder with three children all suffering from autism.  The problem here is 

they are collecting about $50 each per month or $200 a month.  These two parents are no longer

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>working  because  they  needed  someone  to  look  after  the  children.    According  to  the  vision  of 

Internal Affairs being, </span><span>“No one is to be left behind.”</span></div><div><span>My question then Minister is, does Government has any other means to assist this couple seeing 

this is a special needs case?  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  Robert  Heather.    I  can  see  the  Honourable 

Minister for Internal Affairs; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you all and thank you to the 

Honourable Member for the question.  Bear with me, I will come back to you with a reply, I just 

need to know who this family is that requires this special care.  There is assistance available from 

within Internal Affairs for the elderly, children and those that requires special assistance as you 

have explained.  Perhaps when we have a break, we can have a discussion on this issue.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I can see the Leader of the Opposition; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  This question is to the Minister of Finance.  The Cook Islands 

Medium Term Debt Management Strategy 2022-26 stated that the total value of the public debt to 

the end of June 2022 was estimated to be $228.3 million and I believe of this debt $114 million 

was related to COVID.  The speech from the throne referred to a debt of $130 million.  Can the 

Minister explain the difference of $16 million is my first question? 

</span></div><div><span>So, that, I do not ask a Supplementary Question and maybe because I am expecting you want time 

to answer that question, let me ask my second and third question.   

</span></div><div><span>Is there a plan to put a ceiling on spending on COVID and what is our actual total value of public 

debt today?   

</span></div><div><span>The  fifth  question  is,  what  plans  are  in  place  to  repay  this  debt  given  the  slow-down  of  the 

economy?  I thought you might need time for all those questions.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I  can see the Honourable 

Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker and thank you very much Honourable 

Leader of the Opposition.  These are the types of questions needed, they are so solid. 

</span></div><div><span>100 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, let me answer the first question and that is to the different figures that you alluded to on 

the debt.  I can assume that there are debt figures at different period of time and there may have 

been debt settled during those periods.  But I can say that by the end of this Financial Year, by end 

of June, we estimate our debt levels to be at $216 million.   

</span></div><div><span>As to COVID debt, we do not expect to take out any more debts in regards to the COVID pandemic, 

in my own opinion, that issue has now been put to an end, we are now in the process of recovery 

from COVID.  

</span></div><div><span>Certainly, our debt levels have increased as a result of COVID.  In fact, we have to change our 

rules  in  regards  to  debts  and  the  Government  have  set  a  net  debt  to  GDP  ratio  of  55  percent.  

Currently, our net debt to GDP sits at 43 percent.  It was just brought to my attention in the last 

day or so that the impact of COVID on our economy over that period from 2020 to last year, and 

the  contraction  of  our  economy,  we  have  been  using  the  estimate  of  around  25  percent  of  our 

economy in contracted.   

</span></div><div><span>However, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, has just finished their assessment of our debt 

situation and our economic situation, and their result, ready at hand, indicate that our contraction 

to our economy was actually 41 percent.  Far greater than we expected it to be, but I look at this in 

a positive of light because, according to them, we are the only country in the world with that high 

as level of economic contraction.   

</span></div><div><span>Any other country in the world that had an economic contradiction of 41 percent would have seen 

a total collapse of their economy.  However, in the period leading up to COVID and under the very 

good  skillful  management  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Government  have  managed  to 

accumulate $60 million in cash reserves, plus $57 million in an economic stabilization fund.  If we 

did not have that, our debt position would be much greater than it is today. 

</span></div><div><span>As it is even with a net debt ratio of 43 percent which we are expecting to the end of this financial 

year, we are still in a very modest debt position especially compared to other countries in the region 

that have far higher debt profiles than our country. 

</span></div><div><span>As has been pointed out to me on a number of occasions, it is not the amount of debt that we need 

to be overly concerned with, it is the repayment amount of the debt that is the concern.  The ability 

to be able to service your debt moving forward is the most critical factor. 

</span></div><div><span>To answer the question on the plan, most definitely this Government does have a plan and it is a 

continuation of the plan that we outlined at the last Budget but with much better forecasts.  And 

over the next three years I expect to see our debt levels decrease as debt servicing takes care of 

debt but also as the economy increases. 

</span></div><div><span>101 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 13 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The Government has been on a number of missions now talking to our creditors such as the Asian 

Development Bank who is our biggest banker to the country to restructure our debt servicing so 

that we can reduce the amounts each year that go towards debt servicing and extend that out over 

a longer period of time.  And in fact our estimates are that at our current net debt to GDP of 43 

percent we expect over the next three to four years that level to drop down to 25 percent. 

</span></div><div><span>This debt level that we have, Mr Speaker, allows us not just to manage current debt that we have 

but it also allows us to put in place contingency for any other natural disaster that may hit our 

country in the next year or so.  With El Nino expected in the next year coming through, the chances 

of cyclone increase.  Therefore, having a contingent line of credit with the Asian Development 

Bank ready at hand in the event we need it, we can draw it down and still remain below our debt 

to GDP ceiling. 

</span></div><div><span>So in  summarizing these five questions that was asked of me, Mr Speaker our debt  position is 

modest, our debt restructuring that we are pursuing will address concerns with the debt servicing, 

especially in the next coming years and if we keep the faith our plan will work.  Thank you Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister and I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Minister for ICI.   

</span></div><div><span>I was very happy to read todays paper, the Minister outlined the work that will be done on our 

roads.  I was also happy to note that Matavera has been included in these plans.  Mr Speaker, my 

question is more a request.   

</span></div><div><span>The current plan will be carried out from Matavera and then to Titikaveka next month, back to 

Matavera  the  following  month.    My  question  to  the  Minister  is  in  regards  to  the  backroad  of 

Matavera.  This will include Tupapa, from the Manihiki Hostel all the way to Ngatangiia and then 

to the main road and then straight to Titikaveka; can the backroad be considered?   

</span></div><div><span>The article that  was printed in  the local  newspaper was making  referrals  to  a month-by-month 

work program especially the allocation of the works on our roads, including Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>So, my question therefore is this.  If possible Honourable Minister that the repairs of the back road 

of Matavera, if that could take place from the Manihiki hostel in Tupapa and all the way back to

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>And to Ngatangiia and back on the main road and all the way to Titikaveka.  And as you have 

spoken and revealed the allocation on the basis of month-by-month work on the roads.  If this can 

be included from Tupapa to the other side of Matavera and further on to Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister,  Albert 

Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you to the Member from Matavera.  I thought you were going to 

stand and ask for Matavera roadwork to be done outside of the programme. 

</span></div><div><span>But to answer the Honourable Members’ question, plainly Mr Speaker because of the constraints 

</span><span>of  the  annual  budget  Mr  Speaker,  which  is  $800,000  annually.    On  this  request  of  yours 

Honourable Member, this means this budget allocation will be spent on your roads alone. 

</span></div><div><span>That means the Honourable Sonny Williams and Honourable Vaine Mokoroa will have to wait for 

another year or onwards for their Constituency road upgrade to be attended to.  Hence, the reason 

why the allocation of the work that has been spread out from one location to another, to spread 

</span><span>everyone’s’ share.</span></div><div><span>The question  you raised  Honourable Member is a good question.   If only the allocation of our 

budget annually is over $5 million, then I believe the request that you have made for the completion 

of the work on our roads will be certified under that program. 

</span></div><div><span>Consequently, because of the allocation of the budget that has been given for this program, we 

therefore  had  to  allocate  certain  work  and  budget  to  benefit  and  shared  to  every  one  of  our 

community. 

</span></div><div><span>That is the answer and the reason of the allocation and I hope that I have answered your question.  

So, the answer being, no. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister and I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Spe</span><span>aker and thank you for the Minister’s reply to my question.  

</span><span>My last question is to the Minister of Culture. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is, where are my lights?  I believe I was one of the first Members of Parliament to 

request for these lights.  I requested the Minister of Culture if these lights can be put up at the 

Takitumu School compound as well as the Matavera Clinical area.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  George 

Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  I have only 15 seconds left and thank you Mr Speaker.  On this question, 

where are your lights?  My answer is I do not know because I never took them and I do not know 

where they are stored. 

</span></div><div><span>If you had asked for some lights, I would have asked you to wait for us to sort something out. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister and thank you Honourable Members for your 

questions and answers. 

</span></div><div><span>We have come to the end of Question Time.
