<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>HON.  V.  MOKOROA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    First  of  all,  Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable 

Members in this House.  I would like to thank the Honourable Member for Matavera for raising 

this question on a newspaper article written on 18 March 2023. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As articulated by the Member, the delay of this case with this person being convicted.  His question 

is,  if  this  case  has  been  resolved  by  Judge  Toogood.    The  answer  is,  yes  and  this  case  been 

dismissed.  I do not  think the problem  lies with the Ministry of Justice,  I think it lies with  the 

Police, as they were the ones who lodged this case to Court. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, I would recommend for the Member of Matavera to direct his question to the Minister 

of Police. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister Mokoroa.  I see the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition; you have the Floor.
