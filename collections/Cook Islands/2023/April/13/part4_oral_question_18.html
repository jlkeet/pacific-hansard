<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Minister for the Ministry of Justice.  

I believe that he is able to answer my question for this is mentioned in our local newspaper. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It was quoted in the Newspaper article on 18</span><span>th</span><span>March 2023 that Judge Toogood “slams Cri</span><span>minal 

</span><span>Justice System.”</span></div>
<div><span>He said that he is a bit worried about the criminal justice system.  Mr Speaker, when we read this 

article, the lengthy period it took for the conviction of this person, I would say Mr Speaker that it 

took a one year period for this case to be considered. 

</span></div>
<div><span>When I contacted the Ministry of Justice, I asked them who was at fault.  They explained it to them 

that there are many.  I was not sure whether the Minister Responsible was at fault or not. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Minister,  the  question  is,  has  this  case  been  resolved?    The  frustration  that  Judge 

Toogood experienced, has it been resolved?  This case took so long and I wanted to ask if this has 

been resolved, to prevent Judges from issuing their verdicts.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
