<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  will  be  directed  to  the  Minister 

</span><span>Responsible for ICI.  

</span></div>
<div><span>On  Friday  24</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  I  heard  the  Minister  on  the  radio  confirming  that  the  Tender  for  the 

development of the Manihiki airport has been awarded to ICI.  I was taken by surprise because 

this is a Ministry of Government tendering for a Private Sector driven project.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I am surprised at this so the question Minister is, is this true? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert 

</span><span>Nicholas; you have the Floor.
