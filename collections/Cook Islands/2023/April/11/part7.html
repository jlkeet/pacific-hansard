</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Before we adjourned our last meeting, I assured the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina 

Browne that when we return, I will give her the first speaking opportunity.  You may have the 

Floor Honourable Tina Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to all of us in this House 

today.  Yes, it is true before we adjourned our last meeting, I stood up to signal to the Speaker that 

we on the Opposition side wish to reply to the Speech from the Throne and the reason for this is 

when I look at our meeting, it looked as though no one will speak in reply to the Speech from the 

Throne. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we are ready to give our reply to the Speech but for this reason, being that I am aware 

there are new Members in this House who should be giving their maiden speeches before I make 

mine.  So, Mr Speaker, I will give the opportunity but if we in this Parliament do not wish to accept 

the Maiden Speech of new Members of Parliament, I am happy to do my reply.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I think that some of the new 

Honourable Members indicated that they will not do their Reply to the Speech from the Throne 

now but  at  a later stage.  However,  I can see the Honourable Member for Mauke, Honourable 

Stephen Matapo; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. MATAPO:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  To the Speaker of the House, Honourable Tai Tura, 

</span><span>Clerk and your dedicated team, greetings.  To our King’s Representative, Sir Tom Marsters and 

</span><span>your good wife, greetings.  To the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, Honourable Mark Brown, 

Deputy Prime Minister Honourable Robert Tapaitau and Cabinet Ministers, greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Leader of the Opposition, Mrs Tina Browne, greetings.  To all Members of Parliament on 

both sides of the House, new and long serving, greetings to you all in the Name of our Lord and 

Saviour Jesus Christ.   

</span></div><div><span>To all of you listening in to today’s Parliament Sitting, greetings also.</span></div><div><span>The speech I am about to deliver in this House, they call it the Maiden Speech.  It is the first speech 

given by a new Member of Parliament to speak after being sworn in as a Member of this House.  I 

believe that the Maiden Speech, and like many others before me, is the opportunity given to us to 

say thank you.  Therefore, thank you to everybody for your support. 

</span></div><div><span>The Word of God says in Colossians Chapter 3:17</span><span>, “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all 

</span><span>in the Name of the Lord Jesus; giving thanks to God </span><span>and the Father by Him.”</span><span>  In other words, put 

</span><span>God first, Amen.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I would firstly like to give thanks, praise and honour to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, for this 

is  His work.  He knows what  is  best  for us.   Put Him  first  and all things are possible.  As the 

Scripture says, </span><span>“Whatsoever ye do in Word or Deed, do it in the Name of our Lord and Saviour 

Jesus Christ.”</span></div><div><span>To the three Pillars who govern us today on the island of Mauke, our Religion, our Tradition and 

our Government.  To the Religious Advisory Council, Traditional Leaders, Island Council and our 

Private Business Sectors, greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to acknowledge my hard working Committee.  My Chairman Joanne Stephens, Campaign 

Manager Teahui Tauu and all the Committee Members, so many to mention; thank you and God 

bless you all.  I know we will continue to work together with and for the people.  As we have said 

all along, </span><span>“Akatokamanāva, kia okota’i tatou i teia taumano ‘au.”</span></div><div><span>To the children of Mauke, the young and the elderly, those in need of help and care, those overseas, 

the Villages of Kimiangatau, Areora/Makatea and Ngatiarua, blessings to you all in Jesus Name. 

</span></div><div><span>To Pastors Tevai Matapo, Po Kauri, Michael Akava, Pareta Ezekiela, Father Alvin, Bishop Tutai 

Pere, Nono and your Prayer Warriors and your families, thank you all for your Prayers, for your 

Word of God and words of encouragement. 

</span></div><div><span>To Auntie Carmen, the musicians, the cooks, the Mamas who made the </span><span>eis</span><span>, the Papas who helped 

where needed, the helping hands and et cetera, thank you all for your help. 

</span></div><div><span>To  Bubs  Numanga  and  your  team  at  Air  Rarotonga,  to  Taio  Shipping,  Cook  Islands  General 

Transport, thank you all for your services. 

</span></div><div><span>To the many, many more people out there who have helped me and my family get us here today, 

whom I have not mentioned, this is for you.  Thank you so much for your help and support and 

</span><span>may God continue to bless you. 

</span></div><div><span>To  Dad  Papa  Tiki  Matapo,  Papa  Jake  and  Mama  Kate  Numanga,  Mama  Upokoina  and  Papa 

Tuakana Taurarii, our families the Matapo, Tikitau and Jake Numanga, here and overseas.  Family, 

friends, Aunty Nan, Aunty Marama, Adrian Teotahi, Junior Areai, my brother Rob and our hard-

working team at Tina and Co., thank you all for your love and support. 

</span></div><div><span>To those of you who put your trust in me and voted on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August 2022, it is with a humble heart 

</span><span>that I say, thank you and God bless.  It was a lot of work and it was challenging and I did not do it 

</span><span>on my own and yet, I had you to help me get us here.  We as individuals can only do so much, but

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>together  in  numbers,  we  can  do  much  and  much  more.    So  please,  help  me,  to  help  you,  help 

Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  take  this  time  to  acknowledge  some  organizations,  communities  who  have 

contributed to the person I am today.  To my former school Titikaveka College, my sports club 

Titikaveka Rugby League and Rugby Union, the village of Titikaveka from Tikioki to Vaimaanga, 

thank you all for everything. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Cook  Islands  Police,  18  years  of  service,  it  is  still  an  honour  to  have  been  part  of  this 

dedicated hard-working team who </span><span>continues to serve our people “together for a safer community.”  

</span><span>A special acknowledgement to a mentor and a dear friend, Detective Inspector Areumu Ingaua.  

</span><span>To the team at Cook Islands Customs, thank you for the 10 years’ service.  It is still an honour </span><span>to 

</span><span>have been a part of this dedicated team serving our people and ensuring the “Protection of our 

Borders.”  A special acknowledgment to a mentor and a dear friend, Chief of Customs, Ngapoko 

</span><span>Ngatamaine.  To both the Cook Islands Police and Cook Islands Customs, thank you all for your 

services and do keep up the good work, God Bless. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Prime Minister, Honourable Mark Brown, today I stand in this House humbled and honored 

to represent Mauke.  Mauke is so grateful to be a Member in Government and we look forward to 

sitting around the table to contribute and support where and when needed for the people of the 

Cook Islands.  Prime Minister, thank you and God Bless. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge three women who have departed and whom I hold dearly in my heart; 

my dearest mum, the late Miimetua Tikitau Matapo, my late Aunty Tereau Simmons and my other 

late Aunty Matakeu Kokaua.  I wished you were still here and I miss yo</span><span>u all.  Thank youyou’re 

</span><span>your strength, support and love.  God Bless. 

</span></div><div><span>Last but not least, to my dear wife, Rosina Uraiatiu Numanga Matapo, known to many as Tina.  I 

cannot thank you enough for your support.  You have always been there by my side, every single 

</span><span>step of the way.  Your strength, commitment and love is overwhelming.  It is true that </span><span>“behind 

</span><span>every good man is a strong woman.</span><span>”  Thank you and may the Good Lord bless us both as He has 

</span><span>so many times.  My prayers and love for you and our children.  God Bless and I love you. 

</span></div><div><span>It has been 200 years when the Lord God Almighty walked onto our shores.  Nga-Pu-Toru has 

been blessed.  This is truly a historical event that we should all be proud of.  I wish the committees 

and organizers and everyone helping out for the upcoming celebration the best.  Also, to the Airport 

Authority  Board,  Chairman  Taoro  Strickland  and  your  Board  Members,  thank  you  for  your 

</span><span>contribution  of  $10,000  towards  this  occasion.    God  Bless  your  team  and  best  wishes  to  the 

</span><span>Airports’ 50</span><span>th</span><span> Birthday.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>To the people of Nga-Pu-Toru, Atiu, Mitiaro and Mauke, Happy 200 Years in Jesus Christ our 

Lord and Saviour. 

</span></div><div><span>To everyone listening in and to every Member in this House, Prime Minister and your Cabinet and 

the Government of today, I leave you with these Words from 1 Peter 4:11, </span><span>“If anyone speaks, they 

</span><span>should do so as one who speaks the very Words of God.  If anyone serves, they should do so with 

the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ.  To Him 

be t</span><span>he glory and the power, forever and ever.  Amen.”</span></div><div><span>God bless and thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Sonny Williams 

of Titikaveka; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members of 

this  House  and  to  all  my  supporters  in  the  Public  Gallery.    Kia  Orana  to  our  people  who  are 

listening in and watching us here in Rarotonga, overseas and other parts of the world.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am very humbled and honored to be standing before you all, speaking for the first 

time  as  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Titikaveka.    I  have  many  words  of  thanks  and 

acknowledgement to give at the end of my speech, however, for now, thanks to be to God for this 

sacred blessing.  I will just like to touch on a few very important points about the Reply to the 

Speech from the Throne. 

</span></div><div><span>First of all, I would like to give my full endorsement to the Speech from the Throne and would 

touch on a few key points.  The Speech mentions the formation of Government and the Governance 

System of today.  

</span></div><div><span>First, the Head of State.  Congratulation to Sir Tom Marsters for your reappointment on 27</span><span>th</span><span> July 

</span><span>2022 as the QR then and the King’s Representative today, being the </span><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Head of State of the Cook 

</span><span>Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>Second, the Government of the Cook Islands.  Congratulations to Honourable Mark Brown for 

your appointment as Prime Minister on 12</span><span>th</span><span> August 2022, and the 12</span><span>th</span><span> Head of Government since 

1965.  

</span></div><div><span>Third, Head of Judiciary.  Congratulations to the Honourable Chief Justice Patrick Keane, CNZM 

</span><span>for your appointment as Chief Justice for the Cook Islands in October/November 2022.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Next, the Head of Legislature.  Congratulations to you Honourable Tai Tura for your election and 

appointment as Speaker of Parliament on 21</span><span>st</span><span> March 2023, and as the 12</span><span>th</span><span> Speaker and 8</span><span>th</span><span> person 

to hold the post. 

</span></div><div><span>Congratulations to Tangata Vainerere on your reappointment as Clerk of this Honourable House 

and thank you for acknowledging me as a former staff member of this House and now, standing 

before you as a Member of Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>Congratulations to all the Members of Parliament for our collective elections as Members for this 

Honourable House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the point here is with all these appointments to these important Arms of Government, 

I do believe we have a strong Governance System in place today.  We should have confidence in 

our Governance of the Cook Islands today.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to touch on a quick summary of the whole Speech.  First of all, the Speech referred 

back to the Visions of our forbearers like the Opening of the International Airport in 1974.  It also 

acknowledges the progress over the years through former Governments, work done recently by 

the current Government and the challenges we faced and came through.  This gives a clear vision 

for the future, that is, positive and full of hope, while also acknowledging potential challenges like 

climate change, global events like pandemics and economic impacts.  To quote from the speech 

</span><span>“today,  we  believe  that  like  what  we  did  with  tourism,  we  could  do  the same  with  our  seabed 

minerals programme.”</span></div><div><span>The next point I would like to comment on is COVID-19.  Our performance as a country was one 

of  the  best.    Maybe  we  could  even  be  bold  to  say  that  we  were  the  best  performing  country.  

Overall, it was a job well done by all those in Government and the Private Sector.  First, Cabinet 

setting  policies,  Parliament  passing  the  required  laws  and  necessary  appropriate  budgets, 

Government  Agencies  coordinating  and  delivering  the  services  and  support,  Private  Sectors 

</span><span>providing supplies and services, NGOs providing much needed volunteer manpower and the many 

</span><span>Punas providing support at grassroots.  

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  thank  and  commend  our  TMO  Clinics  and  staff  as  well  as  our  Puna  and 

volunteers in Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, may I interrupt you.  Before I suspend our Sitting, I would 

like to acknowledge the members of public in the Public Gallery for your presence in Parliament 

</span><span>today.  

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is suspended until 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>53

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.28 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.14 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Parliament is now in Session.  Before we adjourned for our lunch break, the 

Honourable Member Sonny Williams was speaking and I now give him the honour to continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before we took a break, I was commenting on the 

good work carried out by our country in all sectors, the Government, Private Sector, NGO and so 

forth.  In particular, the very good work that is carried out by our TMO Clinic and Staff as well as 

our Puna and Volunteers in Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the former Member of Parliament, Selina Napa for hosting all of 

us to a thank you dinner. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would now like to touch on Agriculture.  To </span><span>quote from the Speech, “In the 1950’s 

and  60’s,  we  were  the  fruit  bowl  of  the  Pacific  and  earned  millions  of  dollars  in  agricultural 

</span><span>exports.  Men, women and children banded together in the planting, harvesting and shipping of 

produce from our fertile soi</span><span>ls to markets abroad.”</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I say that today, our market for fresh produce is no longer overseas, it has moved here 

in the form of the thousands of visitors arriving to consume our fruit that has matured and ripened 

on trees, much sweater and tastier.    To name one, the nu, coconuts, is a thriving local industry we 

find with sellers along our roads, in the markets, into the hotels, even direct door to door sales. 

</span></div><div><span>I do believe Titikaveka has a significant part to play in this potential for Rarotonga.  One, it has 

traditionally been a major food production area for Rarotonga.  Two, it has good source of water 

with two main water intakes.  Three, it still has large tracts of land no longer under agricultural 

</span><span>development.  It just needs a backroad to link Kauare to Avaavaroa to open up these lands for 

</span><span>agricultural and food production. 

</span></div><div><span>Titikaveka  today  has  two  modern  successful  examples.    One,  Wigmores,  the  biggest  and  most 

</span><span>successful food production enterprise in the Cook Islands.  Two, Teava Iro’s com</span><span>post production 

company,  encouraging  organic  farming.    I  say  this  is  the  way  for  the  future  with  skyrocketing 

fertilizer costs globally. 

</span></div><div><span>We now see global difficulties in accessing supply of everything including food.  We seriously 

</span><span>need to return to high levels of food production and be able to feed ourselves, as the world supply 

</span></div><div><span>54 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>chain continues to be costly and disrupted.  Again, I say, Titikaveka has a major part to play in our 

future food production. 

</span></div><div><span>The next point I would like to touch on is Infrastructure.  Having being part of the infrastructure 

sector in the last few years, I now have a better understanding and appreciation for the importance 

of this sector in our country.  And to </span><span>quote from the Speech, “We have built roads, constructed 

</span><span>new faciliti</span><span>es and developed key projects on Rarotonga and the Pa Enua.”  To list just a few of 

</span><span>these, our roads, Rarotonga main road, Atiu and now Mauke roads.  Titikaveka is fully anticipating 

the day the roadworks and hot mix comes around the southern side of the island. 

</span></div><div><span>We have bridges, the Avatiu and the Takuvaine main road bridges, general maintenance of bridges 

with another contract to be let soon.  In terms of drainages, networks and system, we have the big 

projects in Muri so no more flooding and we also have Nikao, Tereora College as well. 

</span></div><div><span>We have cyclone shelters in the Outer Islands and upgrades of government houses and facilities 

on  Rarotonga  and  in  the  Outer  Islands,  including  schools.    Therefore,  on  behalf  of  PTA,  the 

Principal and staff, students and parents of Titikaveka College, we would like to thank you for the 

</span><span>School’s upgrade.</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  it  is  only  fair  that  I  acknowledge  and  commend  our  Infrastructure  Sector,  both 

Government and Private Sector, heavy machinery and supply operators for the vital part they have 

played in the past and is still working today.  We hope that they would continue into the future for 

our national development. 

</span></div><div><span>In Government Agencies, we have ICI and CIIC as the main Agencies.  In the Private Sector, we 

have TRIAD Limited, roading specialist in this field and hot mix is now going from Super Brown 

Tupapa heading towards Avarua Township. 

</span></div><div><span>We have Landholdings Limited, responsible for building harbours, bridges, drainage, structures 

</span><span>and everything else.  We have T&amp;M Heather, the biggest supplier of cement, bricks, rocks, sand, 

</span><span>machinery and everything else.  They have a very long history of construction and supply in the 

Cook Islands.  We also have new operators in this Sector.  Firstly, we have CCL, a Cook Islands 

Company  new  into  the  market  from  Australia,  with  very  high  standards  of  work  for  drainage, 

bridges, cyclone centres, et cetera. 

</span></div><div><span>We  also  have  Gio  Contractors,  young  and  upcoming  company;  they  are  into  housing  and  they 

actually  built  the  Marsters  House  in  town,  bridge  maintenance,  culverts  and  they  are  from 

</span><span>Titikaveka.

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We  also  have  AVA  Contractors,  young  Teava  Iro  and  his  partner  starting  out.    They  have  old 

machinery and they are looking to expand and purchase a new machinery.  They are into drainage, 

land clearing and landscaping.  They have a bright future and requires our support.  They are also 

from Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the late Mike Rennie.  What a builder!  A concrete expert 

and an innovator, creator et cetera.  New Zealand contractors hired him to be in charge of their 

concrete structures for Te Mato Vai Project, the biggest in the Cook Islands history.  I find him 

very respectful in very intensive contractor meetings with ICI engineers.  He was a humble man.  

He is also a resident and a gun darts player from Titikaveka, he was a good top player.  Rest now 

you good servant. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Speech mentioned Climate Change and Global Environment changes and sea level 

rise.  I am happy that this is emphasized in the Speech.  As we  all know of the recent damage 

</span><span>caused to the east coast and south coast line on Rarotonga by last year’s sea surge and storm water 

</span><span>damage.  Whole stretches of the Titikaveka coastal road were affected and closed to the people in 

these places. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker.  I stand to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That an extension of speaking time be given to the Honourable Member Sonny Williams 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  Looking through the Standing Orders, it will 

only allow for a 15 minutes extension. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Member, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Continuing with the sea level rise.  When these 

</span><span>roads were blocked, emergency services could not get into these areas and the valleys up into the 

hills in Turoa of Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>There has been a project launched quite recently, in hope to apply for funds from the Green Climate 

Fund to install for foreshore protection in this area and this is a project that we all need to support.  

One of the last points covered in the Speech is the constitutional amendment on election.  I am 

very happy that this part has been mentioned because this is very relevant to Titikaveka following 

</span><span>the recent 2022 Elections, and I fully support this proposed amendment.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I also would like for this Parliament to further consider strengthening the Electoral Act.  There are 

so many things I want to say but I will just summarize them.  We, in this House, need to work 

together to protect our voters and encourage them to vote for their representatives for this House.  

Let us not punish voters for casting their votes. 

</span></div><div><span>In Australia, they have barbeques and drinks around Polling booths and it can be quite fun.  Over 

here, we are too busy spying, looking for faults, blaming, condemning and hauling each other into 

court.  There must be a better way to make things more enjoyable rather than having to experience 

the unnecessary experiences with our last Election. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, Law and Order is another area that Titikaveka would like to have it strengthened.  It 

may not be in the Speech, but it is one of the challenges that we face in Titikaveka.  We ask that 

Community Policing in Titikaveka be revived.  Not only for our locals, but for Tourism.  We will 

be hosting some international forums in the near future. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are the main points that I would like to comment on Mr Speaker.  Now, I would like to give 

some acknowledgements. 

</span></div><div><span>First of all, I would like to thank the people of Titikaveka for allowing me into your homes; thank 

you for your hospitality and for not chasing me away. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank my friends and families here on Rarotonga, the Outer Islands, New Zealand 

and  Australia  and  everywhere  for  your  support  and  well-wishes.    Please  accept  my  sincere 

appreciation to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To my strong Campaign Committee, our Patron Papa Tiki Matapo, Chairman Adrian Tehotahi,

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, I would like to say thank you to my beautiful wife, Georgina Keenan Williams and our 

daughter, Ohiva, son Aporo and our housekeeper, Lucia.  This is my family from my home.  They 

are the secret of my journey. 

</span></div><div><span>To  my  people  of  Titikaveka,  it  is  time  that  we  come  together  and  work  to  help  complete  the 

</span><span>renovation work on our Church as we will be hosting the 200 Year’s Bicentennial Celebration here 

</span><span>in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in conclusion, a couple of quotes from the Speech which I believe is very appropriate 

for us: 

</span></div><div><span>“And at all times, let us remember that government does not exist for its own sake.  Nor does it 

exist to create dependencies.  Instead, it exists to help our people across all fronts.”</span></div><div><span>Second quote, it says:  

</span></div><div><span>“At the end of the day, our Government is for the people.  It exists primarily to provide an improved 

standard of living and wellbeing, for all of us who call the Cook Islands, home.”</span></div><div><span>With that Mr Speaker, I say God protect the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Tina Browne you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Greetings to us all this evening.  Just a short time for me to speak 

to  my  Constituency  of  Rakahanga.    To  the  three  Pillars  on  our  island,  the  three  religious 

Denominations, the government, Mayor, EO and Public Servants, our traditional leaders, all the 

elderly  right  through  to  our  children,  all  the  organisations  on  the  island,  I  greet  you  all  in  this 

</span><span>moment. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, the speech on the Throne went on for some length as to what has happened 

to our country economically and our financial position today.  However, it did nothing to deliver 

</span><span>on what solid plans there are to rebuild the nation’s economy other than again focusing on tourism</span><span>.   

</span></div><div><span>During the pandemic, the harsh lesson learnt there was all our eggs has been placed in one basket.  

The tourism basket and much was said about not repeating this mistake.  Tourism Cook Islands 

</span><span>has issued statements of a new focus and the approach and the term regenerative tourism has been 

</span><span>darted repeatedly but essentially what we are seeing is a return to the same pattern of focusing on 

growing tourism numbers.  We are too numbers focused and frankly, we cannot sustain 180,000

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>tourists  per  annum.    We  need  to  work  on  yield,  the  concept  of  yield  refers  to  the  expenditure 

injections of tourist, sales revenues or the profitability of catering to different visitor markets.  

</span></div><div><span>I  sought  the  advice  of  local  tourism  expert  Robert  Skews  on  this  subject  as  he  has  long  been 

advocating yield as oppose to focusing on unchecked growth of visitor numbers.  Our country now 

has the opportunity not to go to 180,000 tourists and crash our infrastructure again, but specifically, 

target  the  high  end  traveller.    This  does  not  mean  attracting  just  wealthy  travellers,  but  those 

travellers who respect nature, the environment and want to contribute in some way to the Cook 

Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>As Mr Skews advises, experiential travel is a key word and regenerative tourism is a good path to 

follow but must be in action and not mere rhetoric.  So far, we have seen little of the former action 

and much of the latter rhetoric.  A recent comment from the Chamber of Commerce that we can 

grow our annual tourism to mind boggling levels does nothing to reassure the Opposition of the 

desirability  of  this.    But  rather  makes  us  concern  given  the  massive  strain  it  will  place  on  our 

environment, infrastructure and local people.  

</span></div><div><span>Diversification was a word much mentioned by the government during the pandemic.  Our absolute 

need to diversify and not place our entire reliance to generate most of our national revenue from 

tourism.  But after a flurry of activity during the outset of our lockdown to get people planting 

crops, issuing seeds and seedlings to help the public to do this, the Ministry of Agriculture appears 

to have gone into hibernation and this concerns the Opposition greatly.  That program of assistance 

to the public, that encouragement to return to or begin planting crops to put food on our tables 

should be ongoing.  It should be happening right now as part of our national food security strategy.  

A solid food security strategy should be in place right now in preparation for when the fuel prices 

increase as this will impact on the cost of all imported food and goods.  

</span></div><div><span>Food is already costly in the Cook Islands and the price of imported food will increase markedly 

when fuel prices go up.  We have to be prepared for this event and a common-sense approach will 

</span><span>be to encourage our public to commence planting and raising livestock for their own consumption.  </span></div><div><span>We also challenge the Ministry of Agriculture to disclose what steps have been taken if any to 

work  with  its  New  Zealand  counterpart  to  introduce  the  agriculture  export/import  protocols 

necessary to see our Cook Islands produce making its way into the New Zealand market. 

</span></div><div><span>For instance, Mitiaro and Mauke are great year round producers of quality limes.  Prices in New 

Zealand for limes recently reached well over $40 a kilo yet our Outer Islands cannot export limes 

</span><span>to New Zealand because the required protocols are not in place.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>There does not seem to be any urgency to address this and giving our Outer Islands and Rarotonga 

wider export opportunities and the obvious financial benefit that follows on.  So, we ask of the 

government what steps are being taken to have in place protection from global price increases with 

respect to the inevitable increase in the cost of fuel. 

</span></div><div><span>We urge the government to formulate a solid strategy to have in place the protection our small 

Nation absolutely needs from global fuel increase. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, I now turn my attention to the Crimes, Sexual Offences Amendment Bill 

2023 which will shortly come before this House for debate.  I believe there is no justification for 

the fact that it has taken seven years for this to happen.  I am however, relieved that the offending 

section in the Crimes Act, Sections 152 to 155 are finally to be repealed. 

</span></div><div><span>As I stated at a recent International Human Rights Conference on one hand, we boast about being 

a Christian Nation and on the other, we have Parliamentarians who seem to want to criminalize 

and punish a sector of our society for engaging in consenting adult sexual activity.  I believe that 

we truly need to become contemporary, rationale and mature in our thinking and approach to life 

and discard any insidious laws. 

</span></div><div><span>We  cannot  on  one  hand  call  ourselves  God  fearing  Christians  with  a  Constitution  that  clearly 

defines our human rights and yet condemn our sons and daughters for being the people they were 

born to be. 

</span></div><div><span>In recent years we have seen the unprecedented advocacy by Government for the mining of our 

seabed.  The Opposition believes caution over exploiting this last untouched bastion of our Nation 

has been too enthusiastically cast to one side.  It is caution that is being shown by other Pacific 

Nations and many International Organizations who have called on a ten year moratorium on any 

seabed mining to obtain scientific evidence. 

</span></div><div><span>The Democratic Party Opposition has maintained the position of adopting a very cautious approach 

</span><span>to any commercial seabed mining given that there are too many unknowns about the seabed and 

the long term impact of mining it.   

</span></div><div><span>We have always supported a very cautious and responsible exploration of our seabed to  gather 

data  that  will  help  the  government  of  the  day  make  an  informed  decision.  We  want  the  signs, 

preferably independent of mining interest to conduct the studies.  That position has not changed. 

</span></div><div><span>However, it is very concerning that the very entities who wish to mind our seabed are the ones 

</span><span>conducting exploratory  missions.   Input  from  local  marine expert and Goldman Environmental

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>award  winner  Jacqueline  Evans  was  obtained  on  this  subject  to  help  the  Opposition  be  better 

informed on the challenges our Nation currently faces with respect to deep sea mining. 

</span></div><div><span>These are some of the questions that we would like to ask.  How does the government guarantee 

that  the  seabed  mining  industry  will  benefit  Cook  Islanders  first  and  foremost?    Has  the 

government  performed  a  cost  benefit  analysis  demonstrating  follows  of  revenues  through  the 

economy, estimated amounts of revenues to the Cook Islands and not the industry as a whole and 

weighing this against potential social, cultural and environmental impacts of the industry? 

</span></div><div><span>What  evidence  can  the  government  provide  for  their  conclusion  that  the  industry,  and  I  quote, 

</span><span>“develop and flourish for the benefit of our people” and not for the benefit of just a few?</span></div><div><span>Further, will the government provide evidence of the amount of mini</span><span>ng companies’ investment 

</span><span>spilling over to our domestic economy? 

</span></div><div><span>What  if  it  is  just  the  government  made  to  encourage  oceanographic  institutions  to  conduct 

independent research on our deep sea? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Members  and  Honourable  Member,  I  will  give  the  Floor  to  the 

ladies first. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I rise to ask: 

</span></div><div><span>For an extension of speaking time for the Leader of the Opposition, 

for another 15 minutes 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Tingika 

Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tingika Elikana</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, you may continue for 15 minutes, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  We will be the second country on the planet to embark on this 

industry in our region. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we do not have to look far in our own region to be reminded that Papua 

</span><span>New  Guinea  lost  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  after  backing  what  is  now  described  as  a  ghastly 

</span><span>industrial experiment.  They sold rather one deep sea mining project initiated by the now defunct 

company called Nautilus, was a total failure.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Nautilus, wanted to extract metals from the PNG seabed.  The PNG government which is by no 

means a wealthy government borrowed a reported NZD$168 million to pay a stake in the ill-fated 

project.  The PNG government now laments that this huge sum was money simply dump in the 

ocean. 

</span></div><div><span>I hear that I am hitting a few nerves on the opposite side of the House.  I am happy to hit those 

nerves. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, the PNG government is amongst other nations leading the call for the teenier moratorium.  

Not for anything else, but to allow for independence scientific research.  The primary purpose of 

the  Marae  Moana  Act  2017  is  to  protect  and  conserve  the  ecological  biodiversity  and  heritage 

values of the Cook Islands marine environment.   

</span></div><div><span>To achieve that purpose, it established the Marae Moana and the Marae Moana Council and it was 

to provide a system of Marine special planning including zoning plans and management measures 

for marine base activities.  One of the functions of the council is to approve the National Marae 

Moana  Special  Plan.    And  of  course,  the  Marae  Moana  is  the  overarching  Act  is  supposed  to 

monitor our Marae Moana. 

</span></div><div><span>I think the public deserves to know that in fact the Council last met in 2019.  This is despite the 

fact that the Marae Moana Act requires the Council to meet at least once a year. 

</span></div><div><span>We ask whether the Marae Moana technical advisory group had been working on any regulations 

to  develop  the  Marines  Special  Plan.    It  is  deeply  concerning  to  the  Opposition  that  while 

government is saying that we need to protect our environment, the very reality is that the body 

which is charged with nourishing our source of life, ensuring that our ocean is respected, cared for 

and used wisely, today and for generations to come is in a coma. 

</span></div><div><span>It is in a catatonic state and this should completely unacceptable to us.  Our people are the greatest 

</span><span>asset of our nation.  The government has been silenced on what policies are in place for the sound 

sustainable  economic  development  of  our  nation.    But  it  has  also  been  silenced  on  how  the 

continued depopulation of our nation has been addressed. 

</span></div><div><span>How are we enticing our people to remain at home or to return and be productive members of our 

society?    We  already  know  that  there  is  a  shortage  of  qualified  public  servants  in  government 

which explains why we need to import expatriate expertise.  I am aware that a qualified graduate 

</span><span>accountant working for central government would be earning a salary of around $36,000.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>It is no wonder that these skill workers only remain to gain experience and then leave our shores 

for better opportunities.  The government has been very self-congratulatory on its handling of our 

affairs during the COVID pandemic.  There has been a deliberate failure to mention the important 

role  played  by  the  Democratic  Party  Opposition  in  ensuring  and  supporting  the  passing  of  our 

COVID legislation. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact, Hansard will show that it was the Opposition that called for the closure of our borders right 

at  the  outset  to  prevent  the  entry  of  COVID  and  help  keep  our  people  safe.    The  government 

differed from doing this and we must thank former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden 

for decisive action and heeding the call we made. It was Ms Adern who stopped all flights into our 

International airport, although the government as expected tried to take credit of this.  

</span></div><div><span>I wanted Mr Speaker to cover the Income Tax Amendment Bill but I think I am going to run out 

of time so I will jump and go straight to my final paragraph.  There will be another opportunity 

where I could address that issue.  

</span></div><div><span>The Opposition submits that the change of the Constitution, sorry, it was mentioned that in the 

Crowns speech that the Crown intends to change the Constitution to allow for Parliament to sit 

irrespective  of  outstanding  Electoral  Petitions.    The  Opposition  went  public  and  indicated  our 

support  for  such  an  amendment.    However,  it  is  Oppositions  position  that  the  change  of  the 

Constitution should also include a required numbers of days for us Parliament to sit. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition and thank you Honourable 

Members.  

</span></div><div><span>As there are no further speakers?  I will put the Question.
