<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Minister of Finance, Honourable 

Prime Minister, for your collaboration to my question.  There may not be any financial assistance, 

however, there were other assistance available that were offered externally.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Supplementary  Question  to  the  Minister  Responsible  for  the  House  of  Ariki.    As  we  will  be 

</span><span>celebrating the 200 Yearâ€™s Bicentennial this year, my question is, what are you going to do because 

</span><span>the  Minister  for  Finance  have  explained  that  there  are  no  funds  to  help  with  these  events?  

However, Public Servants will be released to assist the celebration programme.  Therefore, my 

question is, what are you going to do for this Bicentennial celebration?
