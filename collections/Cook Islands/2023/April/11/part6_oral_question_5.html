<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and on this question, I am surprised because I hear 

that these islands have raised a lot of money in their fundraising for this anniversary event.  It is 

not for them to ask government for funds, it is for government to ask them for money. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, there is an allocation in the Ministry of Culture’s budget for big culture events like 

</span><span>this annually.  Major events like the Constitution or like the Cook Islands Games, that is what this 

portion of funds is put aside for. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The budget of the government in 2021 is for the celebration of the arrival of the Gospel to our 

</span><span>country, Cook Islands.  That was the national contribution to that national event of that year.  Each 

</span><span>islands  celebration,  then  follows  after  the  national  celebration,  that  is  each  island  own 

commemoration of the event.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The government’s financial contribution of that year, it was in the form of chairs, tents and artefacts 

</span><span>to assist the Aitutaki, Gospel Anniversary.  This year, we know the events is like a day after each 

one especially in Nga-Pu-Toru and immediately after that, on Rarotonga.  So, it would be difficult 

</span><span>to send those sorts same equipment’s to each of those islands, it would be very diffic</span><span>ult.

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>But from what I have heard, the preparations are progressing well and each island has fundraised 

significant amount of money to be able to host their people when they come on to their island for 

</span><span>each of those days’ events.</span></div>
<div><span> Also, the role of the government would be able to release government workers on each of these 

islands to be able to participate in order to be able to help festivities that will take place on each of 

these islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>A special programme is also being made so that our schools and our school children on each of 

these  islands  will  also  be  able  to  participate  as  a  learning  experience  in  their  school  year 

programme.  So, it will be like a day off holiday as a learning experience. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is through these little planning and programming that </span><span>government’s hopes to assist our people 

</span><span>and the celebration on each of the islands will be a memorable one.
