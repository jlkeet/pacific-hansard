<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question goes to the Minister of Finance, our Prime 

Minister.  I believe my question is a simple question to you Honourable Minister of Finance.   

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is whether there is any allocation in our Budget for the Outer Islands to help with 

</span><span>their 200 Years’ Bicentennial Celebration?  First of all, the islands of Atiu, Mitiaro, Mauke and 

Rarotonga.  Next  year is Mangaia’s  </span><span>turn to  celebrate their Bicentennial.    But  the reason why  I 

wanted to ask this question is because I know that Aitutaki were allocated with some funds when 

they celebrated their Gospel anniversary back in 2021.
