<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have come to Question Time and our Question Time is for 30 minutes.  

But before I open the Floor to Members, I have two important reminders for Members: 

</span></div><div><span>1.</span><span>Any Member who wishes to pose an Oral Question to any Minister or Member, must ensure 

that such question meets the standards for questions as stipulated in Standing Order 240; 

2.</span><span>Any Minister or Member to which a question is posed which I have deemed admissible, 

</span></div><div><span>must answer the question in accordance with Standing Order 244 (1), (2) and (3). 

</span></div><div><span>To begin our Question Time for today, the Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne, 

put a question to our Prime Minister during Question Time on Thursday 22</span><span>nd</span><span> March.  The question 

was, </span><span>“how much was lost in paying the lawyer involved in the case between the Tax Department 

and Air New Zealand?”</span></div><div><span>I recall the Prime Minister requesting for time to get an accurate figure before responding in this 

Sitting.  Therefore, Honourable Prime Minister, if you have the answer ready, you may have the 

Floor.  In addition, if not, it is up to you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Kia Orana and</span><span>thank you Mr Speaker.  On the outset, let me congratulate 

the Leader of the Opposition for retaining her position as the Leader of the Democratic Party at 

your recent conference.  I am sure the rest of the House would like to offer their congratulations 

to you on debt. 

</span></div><div><span>The question you raised, Mr Speaker, how much money was lost to the lawyers?  I can assure you 

</span><span>that there is no money lost when it comes to lawyers, the lawyers would have gotten that money, 

and it did not get lost.   

</span></div><div><span>The RMD’s legal cost for this court case Mr Speaker came to $93,500.  In addition to that Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, the legal fees for the other side, the Air New Zealand team, came to $406,000.  In the 

matter of costs, the court awarded Air New Zealand $275,000 of their cost which represents 70 

percent of their total cost.  Not being removed Mr Speaker, I am not sure whether these are modest 

</span><span>cost or whether they are excessive cost.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>However,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  being  a  lawyer  herself,  probably  would  be  in  a  better 

position to advise whether these are more of less than what lawyers would charge.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question goes to the Minister of Finance, our Prime 

Minister.  I believe my question is a simple question to you Honourable Minister of Finance.   

</span></div><div><span>My question is whether there is any allocation in our Budget for the Outer Islands to help with 

</span><span>their 200 Years’ Bicentennial Celebration?  First of all, the islands of Atiu, Mitiaro, Mauke and 

Rarotonga.  Next  year is Mangaia’s  </span><span>turn to  celebrate their Bicentennial.    But  the reason why  I 

wanted to ask this question is because I know that Aitutaki were allocated with some funds when 

they celebrated their Gospel anniversary back in 2021. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member; I see the Honourable Prime Minister and you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and on this question, I am surprised because I hear 

that these islands have raised a lot of money in their fundraising for this anniversary event.  It is 

not for them to ask government for funds, it is for government to ask them for money. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there is an allocation in the Ministry of Culture’s budget for big culture events like 

</span><span>this annually.  Major events like the Constitution or like the Cook Islands Games, that is what this 

portion of funds is put aside for. 

</span></div><div><span>The budget of the government in 2021 is for the celebration of the arrival of the Gospel to our 

</span><span>country, Cook Islands.  That was the national contribution to that national event of that year.  Each 

</span><span>islands  celebration,  then  follows  after  the  national  celebration,  that  is  each  island  own 

commemoration of the event.  

</span></div><div><span>The government’s financial contribution of that year, it was in the form of chairs, tents and artefacts 

</span><span>to assist the Aitutaki, Gospel Anniversary.  This year, we know the events is like a day after each 

one especially in Nga-Pu-Toru and immediately after that, on Rarotonga.  So, it would be difficult 

</span><span>to send those sorts same equipment’s to each of those islands, it would be very diffic</span><span>ult.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>But from what I have heard, the preparations are progressing well and each island has fundraised 

significant amount of money to be able to host their people when they come on to their island for 

</span><span>each of those days’ events.</span></div><div><span> Also, the role of the government would be able to release government workers on each of these 

islands to be able to participate in order to be able to help festivities that will take place on each of 

these islands. 

</span></div><div><span>A special programme is also being made so that our schools and our school children on each of 

these  islands  will  also  be  able  to  participate  as  a  learning  experience  in  their  school  year 

programme.  So, it will be like a day off holiday as a learning experience. 

</span></div><div><span>It is through these little planning and programming that </span><span>government’s hopes to assist our people 

</span><span>and the celebration on each of the islands will be a memorable one. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Minister of Finance, Honourable 

Prime Minister, for your collaboration to my question.  There may not be any financial assistance, 

however, there were other assistance available that were offered externally.   

</span></div><div><span>Supplementary  Question  to  the  Minister  Responsible  for  the  House  of  Ariki.    As  we  will  be 

</span><span>celebrating the 200 Year’s Bicentennial this year, my question is, what are you going to do because 

</span><span>the  Minister  for  Finance  have  explained  that  there  are  no  funds  to  help  with  these  events?  

However, Public Servants will be released to assist the celebration programme.  Therefore, my 

question is, what are you going to do for this Bicentennial celebration? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and to you Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker for allowing me to respond to the question.  Thank 

you Honourable Member of Matavera for your question.  What am I going to do as Minister of the 

House of Ariki for the Gospel Bicentennial Celebration? 

</span></div><div><span>The first thing I am going to do on that day is, the Opening Ceremony for the Event and I will be 

welcoming the Chiefs and the Child of the Chiefs here in Rarotonga.  I have received an invitation 

from Tinomana Ariki and her Office.  I will also be taking a group of invitees to this major Event.  

</span><span>As per the question raised on what I will be doing, the answer that I gave you is what I will be 

</span><span>doing on that day.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I believe that Rarotonga will not be the only island that 

you will support Honourable Minister of the House of Ariki, but also the islands of Nga-Pu-Toru 

and Mangaia for their Gospel Bicentennial Celebration next year.   

</span></div><div><span>My third question is to the Prime Minister.  Mr Speaker, this question relates to the processes of 

OECD.  As we can see, we are currently experiencing high inflations here in the Cook Islands.  

Because I have seen a rep</span><span>ort from the Prime Ministers’ Department in regards to our debts. We 

</span><span>are still paying these debts and I believe this is a fitting question to be directed to the Prime Minister 

because we are a member of the OECD and to that end, we have obligations.  So, the question to 

the Leader of the Nation is what are we going to do? Are we going to withdraw as a member from 

the OECD or does the Government have any thoughts of how are we going to reduce our debts? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I would like to remind the House that on 1</span><span>st</span><span> January 

2020, we graduated under the OECD as a High Income Country.  It is not us that wanted to be on 

this level but it is the OECD that did so.  It is them that sets the developed state of our country.  

Under their observation, they will analyse the GDP per capita.  If they find we are above a certain 

threshold of GDP, we would be graduated from a Developing Nation status to a Developed Nation 

status.  Developed Nations status means that we cannot have access to money from any Aid or 

Grant funds from any organisations or foreign nations.  The only funding we can have access to is 

by way of loans.  

</span></div><div><span>Unfortunately,  on  1</span><span>st</span><span>  January  2020,  we  graduated  to  a  Developed  Nation  especially  under  the 

tourism sector.  But came the month of March 2020, there was the outbreak of COVID-19.  We 

</span><span>have to close our border and we saw the loss of income brought by tourism into the country. 

</span></div><div><span>Although  our  situation  has  declined  in  the  past  years  but  our  status  is  still  high  in  the  OECD 

Developed Nation state.  This status will not change for us because they can see the rise of tourism 

again as well as other businesses.   

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker, we have to look for ways to repay these loans that was not generated through 

tourism.  We can see we have started our project on the Seabed Minerals amd you can see that 

</span><span>there are two research vessels berthed at the wharf that had already started doing their work. We 

</span><span>have  to  look  to  the  near  future  to  reap  the  benefits.  But  for  the  time  being,  we  are  relying  on 

tourism.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I am now happy because it has been confirmed that three direct flights per week will be flying in 

from Australia to the Cook Islands.  A direct flight from Hawaii will also commence.  Last week, 

it was announced that there will be an increase of flights from Tahiti from one flight a week to 

three flights per week.  So, our tourism industry is advancing. 

</span></div><div><span>Now on the question of inflation.  The only way to beat inflation is to make money.  As a country, 

that is what we need to do.  Most of the inflation, if not all of the inflation is beyond our control.  

Even though the war in the Ukraine is on the other side of the world, we see the impact on the 

price of fuel and gas.  Even though the impacts of climate change occur in other countries, we see 

that in the increase in the price of food.   

</span></div><div><span>Someone asked me why did the price of chicken went up so much.  Here is the answer.  These 

chickens  are  fed  with  wheat  and  there  is  a  shortage  of  wheat  and  one  of  the  wheat  producing 

countries in the world is Ukraine and the shipment of wheat in the Ukraine were suspended, taken 

over by Russia.  So, the price of feed went up and the price of chicken went up. We are mindful 

of these increase pressures on our people which is why I am very glad next month in May when 

we table our Budget  before this House, this Budget  will have measures that will address  those 

inflations especially to the most vulnerable in our community.  

</span></div><div><span>We do need to support our elderly, those collecting the Pension, the children and the households 

on low incomes.  I encourage the Members to take into account what we will table for our National 

Budget in May and urge the Members to support it strongly when it comes to the House for debate 

in the month of June.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  will  be  directed  to  the  Minister 

</span><span>Responsible for ICI.  

</span></div><div><span>On  Friday  24</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  I  heard  the  Minister  on  the  radio  confirming  that  the  Tender  for  the 

development of the Manihiki airport has been awarded to ICI.  I was taken by surprise because 

this is a Ministry of Government tendering for a Private Sector driven project.  

</span></div><div><span>I am surprised at this so the question Minister is, is this true? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert 

</span><span>Nicholas; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS</span><span>:  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you for the question from the Member 

for Murienua.  

</span></div><div><span>Just to shorten my reply Mr Speaker, the answer is no.  I did not made any comments to that effect 

because when this project in Manihiki was tendered out to the public, there was only one company 

that  responded  to  the  tender  and  that  is  the  TRIAD  Company.    To  date,  ICI  and  the  TRIAD 

company is negotiating with the costing for the development of the airport because we all know in 

this short period of time there has been a change of prices for everything. 

</span></div><div><span>To  recap  my  reply  to  the  Member,  I  cannot  recall  making  those  comments  but  I  can  recall 

commenting  the  ICI  working  closely  with  the  sole  tender  of  the  contract  which  is  the  TRIAD 

Company to finalise a final costing for the development of the airport in Manihiki.  This week on 

Thursday, we will meet again with the TRIAD Company and hopefully we will have a final costing 

with TRIAD and an announcement will follow once that confirmation is made.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. HEATHER</span><span>:  Thank you for the reply Honourable Minister.  Secondly, on the tarsealing 

of the road in Ruaau.  So far, we can see 200 metres has been sealed.  So, the question is, what is 

the timeline?  If it can be completed this year and to the point when will it reach to Murienua, this 

is the tar sealing of the backroad? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Minister, you may 

continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you to the Member from Murienua.  It is my belief, but I may be 

wrong, the area of the road that has been agreed to, because this area of road in Inave/Ruaau was 

taken during the time of the former HOM who has retired.  We have a new CEO at ICI and maybe 

</span><span>tomorrow, I will get the proper information and I will bring it to this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  Thank you Honourable Members, we have 

come to the end of Question Time.
