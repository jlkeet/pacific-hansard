<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I believe that Rarotonga will not be the only island that 

you will support Honourable Minister of the House of Ariki, but also the islands of Nga-Pu-Toru 

and Mangaia for their Gospel Bicentennial Celebration next year.   

</span></div>
<div><span>My third question is to the Prime Minister.  Mr Speaker, this question relates to the processes of 

OECD.  As we can see, we are currently experiencing high inflations here in the Cook Islands.  

Because I have seen a rep</span><span>ort from the Prime Ministersâ€™ Department in regards to our debts. We 

</span><span>are still paying these debts and I believe this is a fitting question to be directed to the Prime Minister 

because we are a member of the OECD and to that end, we have obligations.  So, the question to 

the Leader of the Nation is what are we going to do? Are we going to withdraw as a member from 

the OECD or does the Government have any thoughts of how are we going to reduce our debts? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I would like to remind the House that on 1</span><span>st</span><span> January 

2020, we graduated under the OECD as a High Income Country.  It is not us that wanted to be on 

this level but it is the OECD that did so.  It is them that sets the developed state of our country.  

Under their observation, they will analyse the GDP per capita.  If they find we are above a certain 

threshold of GDP, we would be graduated from a Developing Nation status to a Developed Nation 

status.  Developed Nations status means that we cannot have access to money from any Aid or 

Grant funds from any organisations or foreign nations.  The only funding we can have access to is 

by way of loans.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  on  1</span><span>st</span><span>  January  2020,  we  graduated  to  a  Developed  Nation  especially  under  the 

tourism sector.  But came the month of March 2020, there was the outbreak of COVID-19.  We 

</span><span>have to close our border and we saw the loss of income brought by tourism into the country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Although  our  situation  has  declined  in  the  past  years  but  our  status  is  still  high  in  the  OECD 

Developed Nation state.  This status will not change for us because they can see the rise of tourism 

again as well as other businesses.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr Speaker, we have to look for ways to repay these loans that was not generated through 

tourism.  We can see we have started our project on the Seabed Minerals amd you can see that 

</span><span>there are two research vessels berthed at the wharf that had already started doing their work. We 

</span><span>have  to  look  to  the  near  future  to  reap  the  benefits.  But  for  the  time  being,  we  are  relying  on 

tourism.

</span></div>
<div><span>Tuesday, 11 April 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I am now happy because it has been confirmed that three direct flights per week will be flying in 

from Australia to the Cook Islands.  A direct flight from Hawaii will also commence.  Last week, 

it was announced that there will be an increase of flights from Tahiti from one flight a week to 

three flights per week.  So, our tourism industry is advancing. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now on the question of inflation.  The only way to beat inflation is to make money.  As a country, 

that is what we need to do.  Most of the inflation, if not all of the inflation is beyond our control.  

Even though the war in the Ukraine is on the other side of the world, we see the impact on the 

price of fuel and gas.  Even though the impacts of climate change occur in other countries, we see 

that in the increase in the price of food.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Someone asked me why did the price of chicken went up so much.  Here is the answer.  These 

chickens  are  fed  with  wheat  and  there  is  a  shortage  of  wheat  and  one  of  the  wheat  producing 

countries in the world is Ukraine and the shipment of wheat in the Ukraine were suspended, taken 

over by Russia.  So, the price of feed went up and the price of chicken went up. We are mindful 

of these increase pressures on our people which is why I am very glad next month in May when 

we table our Budget  before this House, this Budget  will have measures that will address  those 

inflations especially to the most vulnerable in our community.  

</span></div>
<div><span>We do need to support our elderly, those collecting the Pension, the children and the households 

on low incomes.  I encourage the Members to take into account what we will table for our National 

Budget in May and urge the Members to support it strongly when it comes to the House for debate 

in the month of June.  Thank you.
