<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 

</span></div><div><span>I have one announcement to make.  I would like to remind Honourable Members that on Monday, 

21</span><span>st</span><span>  June  2021;  I  notified  the  House  that  the  wearing  of  neckties  on  Mondays,  Tuesdays, 

Wednesdays and Thursdays are optional.  This ruling does not extend to the wearing of jackets, 

unless we decide otherwise.  It also does not allow the wearing of jeans in the House.  Thank you 

Honourable Members.
