<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Kia Orana and</span><span>thank you Mr Speaker.  On the outset, let me congratulate 

the Leader of the Opposition for retaining her position as the Leader of the Democratic Party at 

your recent conference.  I am sure the rest of the House would like to offer their congratulations 

to you on debt. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question you raised, Mr Speaker, how much money was lost to the lawyers?  I can assure you 

</span><span>that there is no money lost when it comes to lawyers, the lawyers would have gotten that money, 

and it did not get lost.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The RMDâ€™s legal cost for this court case Mr Speaker came to $93,500.  In addition to that Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, the legal fees for the other side, the Air New Zealand team, came to $406,000.  In the 

matter of costs, the court awarded Air New Zealand $275,000 of their cost which represents 70 

percent of their total cost.  Not being removed Mr Speaker, I am not sure whether these are modest 

</span><span>cost or whether they are excessive cost.

</span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  being  a  lawyer  herself,  probably  would  be  in  a  better 

position to advise whether these are more of less than what lawyers would charge.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.
