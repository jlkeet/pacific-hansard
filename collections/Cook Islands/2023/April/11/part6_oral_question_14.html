<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS</span><span>:  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you for the question from the Member 

for Murienua.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Just to shorten my reply Mr Speaker, the answer is no.  I did not made any comments to that effect 

because when this project in Manihiki was tendered out to the public, there was only one company 

that  responded  to  the  tender  and  that  is  the  TRIAD  Company.    To  date,  ICI  and  the  TRIAD 

company is negotiating with the costing for the development of the airport because we all know in 

this short period of time there has been a change of prices for everything. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To  recap  my  reply  to  the  Member,  I  cannot  recall  making  those  comments  but  I  can  recall 

commenting  the  ICI  working  closely  with  the  sole  tender  of  the  contract  which  is  the  TRIAD 

Company to finalise a final costing for the development of the airport in Manihiki.  This week on 

Thursday, we will meet again with the TRIAD Company and hopefully we will have a final costing 

with TRIAD and an announcement will follow once that confirmation is made.  Thank you.
