<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you to the Member from Murienua.  It is my belief, but I may be 

wrong, the area of the road that has been agreed to, because this area of road in Inave/Ruaau was 

taken during the time of the former HOM who has retired.  We have a new CEO at ICI and maybe 

</span><span>tomorrow, I will get the proper information and I will bring it to this House. 

</span></div>
