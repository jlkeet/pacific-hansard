<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and good morning to you.  To the Clerk and your 

staff, all Members of Parliament who have been elected to serve our people, greetings to you all 

this morning. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  answer  a  question  that  the  Honourable  Member  of  Rakahanga  posed 

yesterday,  my  dear  Aunty  Tina.    If  I  may  just  clarify  the  question  at  Question  Time  and  the

<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div>
<div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>question, </span><span>I quote, “In the Speech from the Throne, Government were praising themselves with the 

capital investments and projects here in Rarotonga and the Outer Islands” and “Rakahanga was 

mentioned” and the follow up question was, am I wrong or is there another pr</span><span>oject infrastructure? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Yes Mr Speaker, to answer her question, technically yes.  However, I must go back to the Speech 

from the Throne.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Now, the portion that she mentioned yesterday was a part of a bigger part of the Speech.  And I 

quote the Speech from </span><span>the Crown, “we have funded a number of initiatives aimed at a growing 

</span><span>economy reducing barriers and the competition growing labour force making government more 

</span><span>efficient in the Pa Enua.”</span></div>
<div><span>So,  to  answer  her  question  Mr  Speaker,  yes!    In  the  speech  from  the  throne,  the  question  was 

making reference to part of the speech that was referring to the funding that has been approved, 

specifically, for Rakahanga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, these projects, Mr Speaker, are in the process, the funding has been approved.  But because 

the  team  is  still  in  Manihiki,  we  currently  have  some  funding  set  aside  to  do  some  work  in 

Rakahanga this year, our team are currently completing Phase 1 of the Manihiki Tukao Cyclone 

Centre refurbishment.   

</span></div>
<div><span>When this is finished early May, which is in a next few weeks, the team will move to Rakahanga, 

specifically  Mr  Speaker,  to  redo  the  spouting  on  both  the  Hospital  and  the  School.    Also,  the 

roofing is being procured for the Hospital and we would expect for this on the island in the next 

few months.  The reroofing will be undertaken hopefully by July.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Also Mr Speaker, Rakahanga is one of the last remaining island requiring a Cyclone Centre, along 

with Nassau may I add.  So, we have undertaken planning for the Rakahanga Cyclone Centre, the 

funding component for this particular project is still in progress.  Also, that has been approved on 

the ICI front.  There is a plan to repair for the Community water tanks for the Rakahanga CICC 

Hall, as well as the square tank next to the Church.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, to answer the Honou</span><span>rable Member’s question, yes!  I hope the Honourable Member would 

</span><span>acknowledge and accept the information.   

</span></div>
