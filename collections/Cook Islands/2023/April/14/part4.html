<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Interrupted debate on the Second Reading of the Income Tax Amendment Bill 2023.  

</span></div><div><span>I open the Floor for Honourable Members to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill.  I see 

the Honourable Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  At this moment, I have two humble 

requests to ask.  First, I wish to convey my respect to a very close friend of mine that has recently 

passed away this year.  I believe this is my only chance to do this.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may do so. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the second request is, whilst I am paying my respect to my 

friend, for my Speaking Time not to be deducted as a result of my speech about my friend.  Excuse 

me Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>The late Tini Ford.  At first, we did not know each other.  However, when God united us for the 

first time, we became friends until he passed away.  Therefore, on behalf of myself, my family and 

the T&amp;M company, our  deepest  condolences to  the family of Tini Ford.   Whenever he arrives 

Rarotonga, he always comes over to visit us in Arorangi before he heads back to Penrhyn.  From 

that time we met, our friendship continued until his sudden demise.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there are not many people in our country like this gentleman.  Our friendship is very 

intimate with no political intrusions.  As a result, he welcomed me with open arms when I went to 

Penrhyn.  His home became my home.  Not only that, he looked after my wife and I when we went

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>to visit Penrhyn for its attractiveness.  It is quite sad.  We never had the chance to see each other 

again before he passed away. 

</span></div><div><span>The last time we met, was when he went to New Zealand for his medical check-up.  He said to me, 

</span><span>“when I come back Teariki, we will meet again.”  But</span><span> because we never saw each other and for 

him to come and see me, I met up with his two sons, Mark and Mose at the Airport in December.  

Mr Speaker, when I met up with these boys of his, I have not had the chance to meet this friend of 

mine.  And at that very moment, I cried.  I cried because that was the first time I saw his boys 

again.  They even told me that their father is unwell and that he has gone back to Penrhyn.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, to his entire family, may God bless you all.  This is the true meaning of a true friendship, 

which is equal to a true marriage relationship.  Regardless of the up and down in relationships, it 

was quite similar to this friendship of ours.  This friend of mine was a true Democratic supporter 

and when I was in Government, nothing political came in our way. 

</span></div><div><span>Friendship is for life and political career is only for a period of time.  Thank you Mr Speaker for 

allowing me to share my thoughts on my friend. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I would like to share my comments on the Income Tax Bill.  I, along with my colleagues, 

would like to  object  on this Bill  that the Government had presented to  this House.   I will also 

explain why.  I enjoyed listening to what the Prime Minister was saying, do not get me wrong 

Honourable Prime Minister, but the way you explained the Bill, I enjoyed it.   

</span></div><div><span>As  per  the  comments  made  earlier  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  likewise,  I  oppose  the 

principles and merits within this Bill.  Mr Speaker, the reason why I oppose is because I cannot 

see the objectives and the benefits that this Bill will bring for our people in the Outer Islands.  Our 

recent General Election was a last minute proposal made by the Honourable Prime Minister Mark 

Brown.  Just before the Election, before the 1</span><span>st</span><span> when the Honourable Prime Minister Mark Brown 

made the announcement.  

</span></div><div><span>To me Mr Speaker, the Government are purposely doing what they are doing because they have 

the numbers to pass this Bill with no problems.  Similarly, it is quite the same with the tar-sealing 

of the Manihiki Airport.  It is their intentions to do what their Party wants to do.  Mr Speaker, the 

reason for this will not benefit the people in regards to this Bill that we are debating today. 

</span></div><div><span>It has been shown in the Schedule of how tax will be taken out on the amount that you will receive.  

The Prime Minister mentioned yesterday that the Members of Parliament are not included in this 

</span><span>Bill.  I cannot see that Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>129 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>In this Bill, there is an amount of $60,000 that will be beneficial to the Outer Islands, but mainly 

for  those  in  Aitutaki;  exactly  what  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Party  was  saying  yesterday, 

$60,000 exempted from Tax, meaning $10,000 better off in that year.  What about those who earn 

less?  I believe most of our people in the Outer Islands earn maybe $20,000 at least.  Therefore, 

we, the United Party and the Democratic Party do not support this Bill.  I believe that this should 

be applied to a time like the period after COVID-19.  The Prime Minister has quoted in the media 

</span><span>that “it is time that we diversify our Nation after</span><span>what we have come through in the disaster” and 

</span><span>I was on the understanding Mr Speaker that he was referring to the subsidy.  He quoted on the 

</span><span>subsidy, “to all the Outer Islands and mostly the Northern Group islands.”</span></div><div><span>Therefore  Mr  Speaker,  I  do  not  support  this  Bill  because  the  benefit  that  it  entails  is  quite 

insufficient for the Outer Islands.  I really appreciate the thoughts that is shared by the Honourable 

</span><span>Minister Albert Nicholas and again quoted by him and recently in this Parliament, “We should not 

</span><span>divide what we do in the Cook Islands separating the Outer Islands and of course, Rarotonga in 

</span><span>the work we do.”</span></div><div><span>I will not be surprise at our support for Government in pushing this Bill through.  I just wanted to 

say what he mentioned the other day. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe that this Bill will not encourage our people to go return to the Outer Islands.  

I suggest for a subsidy on cargos that that are shipped to the Outer Islands and for the Airlines; not 

for political promises in travelling to the Northern Group islands 

</span></div><div><span>I urge Government to reconsider their decisions and to allocate some funds for our people in the 

Outer Islands by increasing their wages and salaries and most importantly, subsidizing the airline 

and the shipping. 

</span></div><div><span>Our people in the Northern Group islands can confirm if this airfare is correct, $3,400 or $3,600 

for a return airfare to the Northern Group islands.  This is what I mean Mr Speaker, the sealing of 

</span><span>the airport in Manihiki has nothing to do with it because you have to have an influx of 100 people 

</span><span>per week.  Without this count, this will be hopeless.  Simple answer Mr Speaker, the cost of airfares 

to the North needs to be reduced. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I may be exaggerating on the figures and I could be wrong, but my estimation clearly 

tells me that to seal an Airport of 11,000-15,000 metres on the width and length, it will cost over 

$20 million. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Toa Isamaela. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I stand to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>130 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>For an extension of speaking time  

to the Honourable Member of Murienua 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member, you may continue speaking. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for Amuri/Ureia for 

your support. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in this time of our country, I think the priority is our people.  I remember the former 

Member of Parliament for Atiu, the late Nandi Glassie, he always state, in the New Zealand Maori 

</span><span>language,  “What  is  the  most  important  thing  in  the  world?    It  is  people!”    During  my  time  in 

</span><span>Government,  when  we  were  reviewing  the  landing  fees  for  the  Outer  Island  airports,  in  our 

discussion with Mr Ewan Smith, he proposed for the airport runways to be tar-sealed.  The first 

priority for tar-sealing the airport runways was for Penrhyn.  The reason for this is because Penrhyn 

has a natural harbour where any sized boat vessels can enter.  This is one of the airstrips that was 

built by the Americans during the Wars.  Hercules was able to land even the SAAB aircrafts can 

land on the airstrip of Penrhyn.   

</span></div><div><span>The risk in Manihiki is their harbour.  This is the difference between the two islands Mr Speaker, 

one is ready to be tar-sealed and no major work is required and cost as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, we oppose this Bill because of these reasons.  For example, our recent 

Parliament  Ceremonial  Opening,  we  have  seen  what  you  have  done  Mr  Speaker  and  what  the 

Government has done.  I do not have enough time to explain everything and I am not here to blame 

anybody Mr Speaker, but I would like to make reference to what our Chaplain have said from that 

day till today.   

</span></div><div><span>We may ask questions whether this is a coincidence Mr Speaker.  I think it is a Holy intervention.  

</span><span>If we recall at the Ceremonial Opening Mr Speaker, as we got out of our vehicles, I was shocked 

</span><span>to see Prison Wardens as Guard of Honors for Members of Parliament.  I asked myself Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>are we prisoners to be guarded by Prison Wardens to the King’s Chamber?  Never in the history 

</span><span>of the Cook Islands has this ever happened in all the Ceremonial Openings that I have known of.  

Yes Mr Speaker, I was shocked and surprised as to who came up with this program. 

</span></div><div><span>Not only that Mr Speaker, entering the King’s Chamber and of course with the Message that our 

</span><span>Chaplain delivered this morning.  Our School children and the Uniform Organization has always 

</span><span>been Guards of Honors, showing respect to Members of Parliament of this country.  The Message 

</span><span>of the day fit well for such occasion to be called house of thieves!  It requires better planning and

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>programming and the Scripture expresses us not to be in a house of thieves.  Sorry Mr Speaker and 

ladies and gentlemen of this Honourable House.   

</span></div><div><span>I have to take my seat now for my time is up.  Thank you very much.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Teokotai 

Herman; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HERMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    To  the  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and 

Members of this House, Leader of the Opposition and your team, Papa Teariki and your team, Kia 

Orana.  Mr Speaker and your staff who is doing a wonderful job, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we have heard the Leader of the Opposition and of course, this morning Papa Teariki 

Heather with the objection to the Bill on the Floor.  The principle objective of the Bill, Mr Speaker 

is nothing more than to allow our people in the Outer Islands to earn more up to $60,000 per annum 

tax-free.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, having this Bill passed in this House will bring new opportunities to the people on 

the Outer Islands no matter which island they are on.  Let us not only focus on what we earn today 

but other avenues and doors opening that will prosper the Outer Islands.  Mr Speaker, this will 

give  the  people  earning  $20,000,  $30,000  or  $40,000  to  seek  other  employment  to  take  their 

earnings up to $60,000 per year tax-free.   

</span></div><div><span>It is true as an earlier comment made was that Aitutaki would benefit.  For us in Aitutaki, we are 

heavily dependent on the tourism industry especially on the skilled people serving in this industry.  

For example Mr Speaker, staff working at the Pacific Resort after their shift or day-off can seek 

secondary employment say for example at the Tamanu Resort.  

</span></div><div><span>We need to focus more on the merits of this Bill.  This will no doubt establish growth incentives 

</span><span>in the Outer Islands.  I understand, Mr Speaker, it was said that one third of the population of the 

</span><span>Cook Islands live in the Outer Islands.  However, I believe that more than 50 percent of us Maori 

living on Rarotonga are from the Outer Islands.  Therefore, those of you from the Outer Islands 

living here on Rarotonga, do not get mad at this Bill but show your support to it because your 

relatives and families on the Outer Islands will reap the benefits of this Bill.  Mr Speaker, this will 

incentivize the Outer  Islanders living on Rarotonga and abroad to immigrate back to the Outer 

Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, earlier on this morning, the development on the airport in Manihiki was mentioned.  

</span><span>I understand that the Government’s long term plan is not only to develop Manihiki, but Penrhyn 

</span><span>and Pukapuka as well.  When the development on the airports on these three islands are completed, 

</span></div><div><span>132 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>we will know that it will bring in the tourism industry onto these islands.  The level of the tourism 

industry on these islands will be of a higher standard compared to Aitutaki; it would probably be 

more like standards of Tahiti and Bora Bora.   

</span></div><div><span>This will open doors to our people living in Rarotonga and abroad that are from the Outer Islands 

to return to their islands and work.  As mentioned earlier, there are many incentives applicable to 

these islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is one of the many reasons, but first, let us deal with this Bill; get it done with 

and it is over.  There are always new incentives in the future.  Mr Speaker, I strongly support this 

Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Honorable  Members  I  will  interrupt  our 

business for today as it is time for our break.  However, you may continue when we return from 

our break.  

</span></div><div><span>I will suspend our Sitting until 12.15 p.m. today. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.26 a.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 12.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Please  be  seated.    This  Parliament  has  now  resumed.    Now  I  give  this 

opportunity to the Honourable Minister Rose Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and greetings to  you, to  your wife and 

family and congratulations on your re-appointment as Speaker of this Honourable House. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to the Clerk of Parliament, Deputy Clerk and staff of this House and especially to our 

</span><span>two interpreters.  I know that your interpretation role in interpreting what the Honourable Members 

</span><span>are saying is not easy. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to the King’s Representative, your wife and family.  To the Honourable Prime Minister, 

</span><span>your wife and family, Deputy Prime Minister and your wife and your family and all Honourable 

Ministers.  Honourable Members on both sides and your Leaders, Kia Orana in the Name of our 

Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to our former Members of Parliament who we served with together in the past, may 

God bless you all.   

</span></div><div><span>To our children and families with disabilities, Kia Orana to you all.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, may I be permitted to address my people of Atiu.  I have been waiting patiently for 

this moment and I think it is fitting that I should greet my people of Atiu. 

</span></div><div><span>The three pillars that we always greet, the three Chiefs and Traditional Leaders, Kia Orana in the 

Name of our Lord.  To the different denominations, Church Pastors, Kia Orana to you all in the 

Name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Island Government, Mayor, Council Members, Executive Officer and Public Servants, Kia 

Orana to you all in the Name of our Lord.  To our elderly, our youth and our children, Kia Orana 

to you all.  From the both of us, your Members of Parliament, we greet you all.  

</span></div><div><span>To our people here on this island, those around from the Cook Islands and those abroad, I greet 

you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I present my comments on the Bill, the Bible states, “oh give thanks to the Lord, His love 

and mercy will last forever.”  This Ver</span><span>se is what the people of Atiu have chosen to show their 

support  for  this  Bill.    Especially  with  our  supporters,  Committee  Members,  Chairman  and 

everyone else who were involved in supporting us with the last Election, thank you and I greet you 

all.  Sorry, I will not name each one of you, but the support you have shown towards us in voting 

for us to be your Members of Parliament for Atiu, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have so much to say to all our supporters because, it was not an easy trip for us, it 

was quite rough.  In regard to this experience of ours, we ended up in Court.  Both I and our other 

Member of Parliament for Atiu supports this Bill.  Even though the Opposition opposes to this 

Bill, saying that this Bill has no benefit for the Outer Islands, we and our supporters supports this 

Bill.  The High Court even gave their decision saying that this will be useful for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I did not understand with what the Leader of the Opposition have said because I thought that when 

</span><span>this Bill was presented to Court, it would have made it easier to be presented here in the House 

</span><span>with no objection.  

</span></div><div><span>This Bill is well known to Atiu and Mitiaro.  This Bill went around with no problems.  Thankfully, 

this mini Member assisted with this Bill until it was presented to Parliament and our people of Atiu 

are very thankful for his actions because we will see its benefits to the people.  When Atiu was 

taken to Court, the case seemed worthwhile because our people could see the benefits especially 

for those who are 60 years old and are still working as Public Servants, they will be one of the 

</span><span>groups who will harvest the goodness out of this Bill.  Even though a few people will be part of 

</span><span>this, they too have families and we have a saying that although it comes in a small basket, however, 

when it reaches the end, the entire community will reap.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, we give our full support for this Bill.  This Bill will also encourage our Atiu people 

living abroad to return back to Atiu.  I know that the Government is planning some changes and I 

know that the Minimum Wage will be raised by 50 cents.  These are changes that will benefit our 

people living in the Outer Islands.  We are the ones who knows what the Outer Islands are like and 

that is why we support this Bill and the positive comments that will come after which will help 

our people in the Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we look forward in celebrating the 200 Years Gospel Bicentennial and I acknowledge 

our Committee Members in charge of planning and preparing for this major event.  I believe that 

this will bring joy for all of us being united with our loved ones.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I think I have said enough in regarding this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I take my seat, I would like to thank my husband for his continuous support, who is also 

the father of the Member of Parliament for Tengatangi/Areora.  To our children and our parents 

on the island of Atiu, thank you and my regards to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>There is a chant from Atiu, “one eye opens, one eye shuts,” which I believe that this chant applies 

</span><span>to us all Honourable Members who were chosen by our Constituencies. 

</span></div><div><span>I know that some of us do not sleep because our people continues to knock on our doors for help.  

This is the reason why I chose this chant. 

</span></div><div><span>God bless. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Sonny 

Williams; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and thank  you for giving me this opportunity to 

</span><span>speak before this House in regards to this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that greetings to our people is already extended by previous speakers.  

</span></div><div><span>At this time, I extend my appreciation to all our teachers and all the children in our schools for 

their cultural performances that was seen at the National Auditorium last night and the previous 

night.  I want to commend their efforts which they put in to their preparation and performance at 

</span><span>this cultural festival.  The only contribution I saw about the Minister is the monetary donation that 

</span><span>he made on the night.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I think the most donation you gave was when our Titikaveka College was on stage. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise because of the plea from the Member from Aitutaki for this House to show their 

support for this Bill.  I stand to support some of the Members here in Rarotonga for the benefit of 

the Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have two main points to make.  First one, this is not a new idea; the idea of creating 

separate  systems  to  a  certain  sector  of  our  society.    In  looking  at  their  special  situation  and 

conditions.  We do this through our welfare payments in providing special assistance for all the 

categories from the old aged to the young. 

</span></div><div><span>And  I  consider  the  Outer  Islands  to  have  special  conditions  like  this.    The  distance  of 

transportation, the separation from Rarotonga and the high cost that comes with it for the goods 

and products in the Outer Islands.  So, to come up with a special category I think it is fitting for 

we already have done it before. 

</span></div><div><span>I  went  with  my  son  for  the  200  years  Anniversary  to  Aitutaki,  he  wanted  to  have  some  sweet 

drinks.  I gave him some money to go and buy the drink and come back.  He came back with only 

one bottle of drink.  I asked him for the other bottle of drink, he said this is the only thing that he 

can buy from the amount of money I gave him.   

</span></div><div><span>What I ask him, all our money gone?  He said yes, no more money.  I told him that we will be in 

Aitutaki for two weeks.  And this one bottle of sweet drink we will have to sip it slowly so we can 

last  the  two  weeks.    This  is  the  worth  of  our  dollars  in  Aitutaki  and  I  experience  it  myself  in 

Aitutaki.  But fortunately, the drinking coconuts in Aitutaki is very sweet especially from Amuri 

but the sweet watermelon is from the ARE-NIKAU area. 

</span></div><div><span>So, somebody from Rarotonga going for a short visit have a straight impact on the difference of 

cost to the Outer Islands.  And when I consider, that it is even worst and higher in the other Outer 

</span><span>Islands in the Northern Group.  I feel that nobody in Rarotonga has the right to deny any assistance 

</span><span>like this to our people in the Outer Islands.  I certainly feel I do not have that right to deny them. 

</span></div><div><span>And to the idea of maybe it is a bit bias to the Outer Islands and why is this assistance only bias 

for the benefit of the Outer Islands.  I say that it is bias because the weight of the cost of living is 

heavily bias to the Outer Islands.  So, rightly a method of helping should be bias along the same 

lines.   

</span></div><div><span>We in Rarotonga should be grateful of the assistance that we are getting from the Government here 

</span><span>on Rarotonga.  Like the many things that has been announced in this House in the speech from the 

</span></div><div><span>136 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>throne.  And we read in the newspaper recently that the Vaimaanga Road in Titikaveka is going to 

be tar-sealed from April to June.  Praise the Lord! 

</span></div><div><span>So,  Titikaveka,  come  tomorrow  to  our  wrap-up  at  6.00  p.m.  and  celebrate  the  benefits  that 

Titikaveka are getting.  With that, I think you know that I fully support this Bill before this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Are the other Members invited?  Sorry, I call 

the Honourable Tingika Elikana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I echo the salutations and greetings 

conveyed by other Members of this Honourable House to yourself and everybody else that have 

been mentioned.  And I will reserve time to express my gratitude to my people of Pukapuka and 

Nassau in due course.  And the reason for that Mr Speaker should be obvious that we want to get 

through this Bill and order of businesses as soon as possible. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my support to the Amendment Bill before this House.  As stated by 

Members on the government side particularly those from the Outer Islands there is a lot of benefits 

that will accrue to the Outer Islands notwithstanding the views of our friends on the opposite side. 

</span></div><div><span>I am now sorry for our friends who are Members from the Outer Islands on the other side, they are 

still sitting there, and they have not walked across the Floor yet.  As I anticipate, when they return 

home, I am sure they will find a safer place for them to hide because their people on their own 

islands will attack them. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker it does not take Einstein to work out that us in the Outer Islands to bear the brunt of 

any decisions particularly regarding the cost of living.  Whilst those who live here on Rarotonga 

only have to deal with one freight which is the international freight from outside our country into 

</span><span>Rarotonga.  We also have to bear the cost of a national freight where goods from Rarotonga are 

</span><span>transported to the Outer Islands where our people in Rarotonga enjoy air freight from Auckland, 

New Zealand or other international destinations just here to Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>Our people in the Outer Islands has also to bear the costs of domestic flights from Rarotonga to 

the Outer Islands.  And so, there are cost involved in those means of travelling to the Outer Islands.  

Unfortunately, the best our friends from the other side of the aisles can come up with is to increase 

the Minimum Wage.  That Mr Speaker will mean looking for other sources or funds to add to our 

</span><span>current budget.  

</span></div><div><span>137 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Under the Bill before the House, the Government of the day under the leadership of the Prime 

Minister, have come up with a way where we do not go and seek for extra funds where we move 

funds, where it is supposed to come to the public accounts in terms of tax and move it back to the 

Outer Islands into the pockets of our employees in the Outer Islands.  

</span></div><div><span>That, Mr Speaker, in my mind, is a very creative and intelligent way of assisting our people in the 

Outer Islands Because Mr Speaker, if we take under the proposed Bill for anybody in the Outer 

Islands who is earning about $30,000, instead of paying $2,618 to the, he retains all that in his 

pocket.  

</span></div><div><span>For anyone about $50,000 in allowance, instead of paying the sum of $8,018 to the RMD tax, he 

gets to retain that in his pocket and use it on his own island.  So, when the Opposition, particularly 

when  the  Leader  of  the  United  Party  said  that  there  is  no  benefit  to  the  Outer  Islands,  I  think 

everybody in the Outer Islands will say the $8,000 retained in their pocket is much better than 

Government going out of their way to find extra funds to fund a wage adjustment. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, it is obvious that this Bill will assist our people in the Outer Islands, mainly 

dealing with cost of goods.  And if I may just address some of the matters raised in this Bill, in 

particular, the matters raised by my friend the Leader of the Opposition  where she commented 

about how this Bill will create two groups of people, taxpayers and non-taxpayers.   

</span></div><div><span>I do not know whether my friend is mistaken with the actual intent of the Bill because under our 

current laws, there are always two groups of people, the taxpayers and non-taxpayers.   

</span></div><div><span>What is the different with this Bill?  It is the quantum when tax is attached to your income.  For 

those of us in the Outer Islands, you do not get to pay any income tax unless you are earning over 

$60,000  per  annum.    So  those  earning  under  $60,000  per  annum,  can  be  referred  to  as  non-

taxpayers.   

</span></div><div><span>For those in Rarotonga, the case has always been I think if it is $15,000 and you do not pay income 

</span><span>tax.  So, as you can see Mr Speaker, there has always been two groups of people, the taxpayers 

and the non-taxpayers. 

</span></div><div><span>Interestingly Mr Speaker, my friend the Leader of the Opposition raised some issues regarding 

some legal matters that she perceived will cause problems in which she made references to our 

Electoral Act provisions in terms of residency.  I have been advised that the wordings in the Bill 

mirrors the current positions in our Income Tax.  The only twerking is to make sure that it captures 

</span><span>the policy regulating to the Outer Islands.  And if I may say, references to the Electoral residential 

</span><span>requirements is like comparing apples and oranges.  

</span></div><div><span>138 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So Mr Speaker, I also come to address an issue where my friend the Leader of the United Party 

referred in highlighting the plight of our people in the Outer Islands, particularly the people of 

Manihiki and the Manihiki airport project, inferring that it is money not well spent.  I noted in his 

speech, he spoke with the owners of Air Rarotonga.  I am sure he would have been advised the 

reason why the fares are high if I can put it correctly.  It is because Air Rarotonga includes fees 

for  any  potential  damages  to  the  planes.    When  it  lands  on  these  unsealed  airports,  dusts  and 

pebbles are blown away by the propeller which can cause damages to the plane.  This is the reason 

why airfares are so high.   

</span></div><div><span>I did have a chat with the owners of Air Rarotonga and their pilots and I have been assured that 

once the airports are sealed, there will be a review of their airfare structure.  I have been assured 

and I am sure other people who spoke with Air Rarotonga has been assured in that respect which 

will be much cheaper than what the current fare is. 

</span></div><div><span>My only problem Mr Speaker is, my airport falls behind Manihiki and Penrhyn.  But I know that 

once they are finished, Pukapuka airport will be sealed and I can assure you that once those airports 

are completed, airfares will come down and a number of our people who are professionals here on 

Rarotonga will definitely want to return to their own islands. 

</span></div><div><span>As  the  Prime  Minister  has  already  alluded  because  this  is  also  part  of  a  parcel  of  incentives 

provided to make sure that our people remain on our islands.  I know the Surgeon at Rarotonga 

Hospital will want to go back to Nassau and the Oral Surgeon will want to go to Pukapuka as well; 

hence the reason I strongly support this Bill before the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Stephen Matapo; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR S. MATAPO:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  To the Speaker of the House and your team, greetings.  

To the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and your Cabinet, greetings.  To the Leader of the 

</span><span>Opposition Tina Browne and your team, greetings.  To all Members in this House today, good 

</span><span>afternoon and greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Speaker, if I may say a few words to some people that I would like to acknowledge before 

I touch on the Bill.  Firstly, I would like to convey to the Mayor of Mauke, Papa Vaine Aberahama, 

also to our Financial Secretary, Tekura Samuel Tura who at the moment is at home and not well, 

my Prayers go out to you and the family and hope that you have a speedy recovery and will return 

back to work.   

</span></div><div><span>I have been told that on Wednesday, the village of Areora/Makatea had their working bee for the 

community and I have also been told that there was good community support.  So I would like to 

</span></div><div><span>139 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>thank Areora/Makatea, the community and the people for a job well done.  I hope for the next 

clean up, we have no Parliament Sitting.  I look forward to being part of that team. 

</span></div><div><span>As those of you who had the opportunity to watch the television last night, Reverend Mike Akava 

was on television.  I want to support his appreciation again to the Airport Authority, its Board 

Members for the $10,000 contribution.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, to the Minister of Education, this is music to our ears to be given the opportunity for our 

children to be part of a very important function in their lives and that is for the performances that 

they had in the last two nights.  So I look forward to the school from Mauke preparing for this 

event and on top of that, to the new Principal of Mauke, Tapita Aiturau; welcome home and I look 

forward to working with you for the students.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand in support of this Income Tax Amendment Bill 2023.  If I can take us back to 

May 2022, this was the month I returned back to Mauke to commence my campaign.  During my 

campaign, I spoke to one community member and this person asked me one question, are you here 

to  stay  or  are  you  just  passing  through?    At  that  moment,  I  did  not  know  how  to  answer  that 

question but it is one of those questions where you sleep with one eye open and one eye closed. 

</span></div><div><span>Because of that question and with the support of my family, come May this month, I would have 

stayed there for one year.  I returned to Mauke as a foreigner, someone from outside their bubble 

but I have had one year to be part of that bubble.  In that one year, I have learnt to live like them, 

I have learnt to eat what they eat and I have also learnt to think the way that they think.  In all 

honesty, it has been tough but I am so grateful to be there. 

</span></div><div><span>If there was one thing that I have learnt from this one year being there, it would be to appreciate 

the little things.   

</span></div><div><span>I believe that this Bill is a blessing for the Outer Islands because it is a blessing for the people of 

</span><span>Mauke.  This will enable the people to have some extra savings to help and to contribute to their 

</span><span>way of living but also to improve their way of living.  So, to this House, to the Prime Minister and 

everyone else, on behalf of the people of Mauke, we support this Income Tax Amendment Bill 

2023.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Matapo.    I  can  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert 

Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  As I am a Member of Parliament for Palmerston 

</span><span>Island, I thought it would be prudent that I get up and say a few words before we pass this Bill and 

I will keep that brief, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>140 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to speak to the spirit and the intent of the Bill.  In my humble view, Mr 

Speaker, the spirit of the Bill basically is to ensure that all those in the Outer Islands are earning a 

wage to the threshold of $60,000, can retain all its income.  That is a 100 percent retention of your 

income,  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  bring  a  Bill  to  this  House  that  will  apply  to  us  here  on 

Rarotonga Mr Speaker but totally understand Mr Speaker because of certain hardships with our 

families in the Outer Islands, hence the reason for this Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>I see this to be a very honorable Mr Speaker.  A Bill to assist our families and our friends in the 

O</span><span>uter  Islands.    This  is  similar  to  the  Outer  Islands’  Shipping  Subsidy,  Mr  Speaker.    Again  a 

</span><span>programme designed to help assist our people in the Outer Islands, a programme that I believe 

brought to the fore by this Government, your Government, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the question that I am asking is, are we going to have technical issues concerning this 

Bill  moving  forward?    Possibly,  are  we  going  to  be  able  to  fix  these  issues  moving  forward?  

Absolutely Mr Speaker!  Absolutely!  That is the reason of this House Mr Speaker.  That is the 

purpose of each Members of Parliament in this House.  Hence, why amendments are part of the 

process of this House. 

</span></div><div><span>This document Mr Speaker is a living document, it will evolve with time, it will change and it will 

change with the Government, it will change if a new Government comes in and it will evolve. 

</span></div><div><span>And amendments will be made to suit.  In closing Mr Speaker, the bottom line is this Government, 

your Government, my Government saw a need in the Outer Islands.  So, pre-election, Mr Speaker, 

this  government  made  a  pledge,  this  government  made  a  promise,  this  Government  made  a 

commitment that it if returned to Office, would raise the income tax free threshold from $14,000 

to $60,000 for those living and working in the Outer Islands and the document and the Bill before 

the House, Mr Speaker is a process of fulfilling that promise.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  today,  we  intend  to  fulfill  and  honour  that  commitment  and  we  will  fulfill  that 

</span><span>promise.  Mr Speaker, my gut filling tells me that this is precisely what the other side of the Floor 

is afraid of. 

</span></div><div><span>They are afraid that this Government is going to fulfill its promise it had made to its people during 

the Election period.  Nothing pierces more fearful in the hearts of those across the Floor than a 

promise kept. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TAPAITAU:</span><span>“</span><span>It is people, it is people, it is people</span><span>.”</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to everyone in the Name of our Lord.  Mr Speaker, Kia Orana.  Bless the Lord for your 

reappointment as Speaker.  To your staff, Clerk and Deputy, Kia Orana.  Kia Orana Honourable 

Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers.  Leader of the Opposition, Leader of the United Party and 

One Cook Islands and all Honourable Members.  To our guests in the Public Gallery, the Solicitor 

General, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, may I take this opportunity to acknowledge my people of Tongareva.   

</span></div><div><span>To the three pillars of Tongareva, Church, the Government and traditional leaders.  To our Church 

Ministers, Public Servants, Mayor, Deputy Mayor and Council Members, people of Tongareva, 

people of Te Pitaka. 

</span></div><div><span>Oh  my  Tongareva  people,  we  have  more  good  news  for  you.    In  deliberating  on  with  this 

Amendment Bill, I cannot see anything except the benefit you will get.  I am sure that most of us 

are currently earning more than $15,000 per annum.  Unlike what some Members on the other side 

are saying, only one or two earns above this amount.  I believe that a lot of our Tongareva people 

are earning above this $15,000 threshold.   

</span></div><div><span>Any of us in the Outer Islands who will earn below $60,000 will not be paying for any taxes.  You 

can  actually  afford  to  buy  another  bag  of  rice.    This  is  what  I  have  always  said  for  you  in 

Tongareva.  If it is small or big, I will bring it to you Tongareva.  But I can see today, I know that 

the  majority  inside  this  House  are  from  the  Outer  Islands.    And  then,  I  hear  that  they  are  not 

supporting this?  How sad!   

</span></div><div><span>If only we live in the Outer Islands, you will know the burden and how hard it is.  Do not tell me 

</span><span>that we are the same, we are not the same.  Honestly, we are not the same.  Right now, if you want 

something, you would walk across to the Oasis store.  When you are in the Outer Islands, there are 

no shops like over here where you can just walk across to it.  Do we have no sympathy for our 

</span><span>people?  “It is people, it is people, it is people!”  That is what one of the United Members w</span><span>ere 

saying earlier, a quote he had said.  Of course he would know because he lives in the Outer Islands.  

There is a lot to say on this today.  I thank the Prime Minister, the Government for this very good 

initiative.  When you think about it, some people took this to Court!  Are you going to take your 

</span><span>own people to court?  This Amendment Bill is for our people!  Yes, for our people to come, it is 

</span><span>true.  Some of us are saying that this Amendment Bill will only benefit one person.  But when we 

</span></div><div><span>142 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>look ahead because some of us are talking about the conditions of our airports.  I feel sorry for you 

Manihiki.  Some people are saying that this is all political work.  How sad!   

</span></div><div><span>Look at  Aitutaki  that is  the example that we should be looking at.    If we do this on Manihiki, 

Penrhyn, Pukapuka, Atiu, Mangaia and the Outer Islands that is where the benefits are of this Bill; 

Aitutaki as an example.  This Bill is significant when these visions come to realization.  

</span></div><div><span>A speaker earlier on stated for the airport to be subsidi</span><span>zed by the passenger’s fares. Even if we 

</span><span>subsidize the passengers today, this subsidy will give us nothing in return because although this 

subsidy  is  paid,  only  seven  passengers  are  available  to  make  a  flight.  When  we  redevelop  the 

airports,  a  larger  plane  will  then  be  able  to  accommodate  over  20  passengers  and  it  will  be 

consistent.  If this Amendment Bill is fulfilled, our people will return because the airfares will be 

reduced.  Our people will return to work in the Outer Islands because most of us are working here 

on  Rarotonga  because  there  are  no  jobs  in  the  Outer  Islands.    But  with  the  initiatives  of  the 

Amendment Bill to the Income Tax Act infrastructure projects that Government has in plan will 

bring our people home. 

</span></div><div><span>It is important that we look at the important projects the Government are setting up because all of 

us in here are saying that it is for the benefit of our people.  This is what we are striving for and it 

is not worthwhile for us to argue against each other.  When I look at us all, we are grown-ups.  I 

can hear today that the Leader of the Opposition has many thoughts, however, those are the same 

thoughts she mentioned yesterday.  She was commenting that they did it, no!  We did it!  She 

further stated about an English word being diversification, going back to tourism.  I do not think 

the people of Aitutaki will accept her views.   

</span></div><div><span>I also  heard the Honourable Member Toa for Amuri/Ureia commenting  that the nodules are in 

Aitutaki.    Certainly  and  that  benefit  will  also  shift  towards  Penrhyn  so  I  do  not  think  the 

Government  got  all  its  eggs  in  one  basket,  hence  why  we  are  treading  very  cautiously  with 

exploration.  We in Government are certain of the objectives we are doing.  To all of us in the 

</span><span>House, including myself, have to carefully look at the decisions we make because of the saying, 

</span><span>for the people, the people, the people,” it is our people.  I am a Member of Parliament for Penrhyn 

</span><span>and I will not conclude until I bring big benefits to you Penrhyn.  May God bless us all.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    I  will  put  the  Question.  

However, due to the process of Parliament I am aware that the Honourable Member Tai Herman 

has 11 minutes left to speak since we suspended.  Do you wish to proceed or not?  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  No.
