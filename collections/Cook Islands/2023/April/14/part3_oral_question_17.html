<h3>Oral Question 17</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you very much for the very good question, raised by our Member for 

</span><span>Akaoa.   

</span></div>
<div><span>In fact, our Caucus had a discussion just a few weeks ago regarding improving the presence of our 

Police in our communities, particularly here on Rarotonga.  I can  advise, and in my discussion 

with  the  new  Police  Commissioner,  he  is  also  very  supportive  of  the  establishment  of  our 

Community Policing program. So, we will be working very closely with our community group to 

re-establish our Community Police within our districts as soon as possible.  This is also a request 

that is coming through from our communities as well.  That is, they want a presence of Police in 

</span><span>the community to help deter any petty crimes in particular but also to project a presence of safety 

</span><span>within the community.  So, I look forward to the establishment of the Community Police increasing 

a presence hopefully along the policy of not paying any rent to the Community Hall.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker.
