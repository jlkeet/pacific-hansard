<div><span>IN THE HOLY NAME OF GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, THE EVERLOVING, AND THE 

EVERLASTING 

</span></div><div><span>We, the people of the Cook Islands, recognising the heritage of Christian principles, Cook Islands 

custom, and the rule of law, remember to keep holy the Sabbath Day, being that day of the week 

</span><span>which, according to a person’s belief and conscious, is the Sabbath of the Lord.” </span></div><div><span>And what are those principles we ask?  If we refer to the Second Greatest Commandment after the 

admonition to worship only God, it is to love your neighbour as yourself.  When we look at the 

whole of the Bible rather than selective verses, we are taught that we should be kind and respect 

old people, be humble, have a generosity of spirit and help people who are less able than we are, 

forgive rather than take revenge, have honesty and integrity, promote peace and goodwill among 

people and I think these principles reflect very strongly the actual identity and way of life of our 

Cook Islands people.  

</span></div><div><span>When we looked at it this way, these Christian principles run against decriminalization of these 

Acts and I want to give two quotes that were given by two Heads.  The Pope, in fact, the Arch 

Bishop issued an apology in 2016 for hurt caused by the Anglican Communion for its historical 

</span><span>hostility to homosexual people.  The Pope in 2013 had this to say, “if a person is gay and seeks 

</span><span>God and has g</span><span>oodwill, whom am I to judge?”  So, Parliamentarians, Honourable Members, our 

</span><span>Constitution dictates to us under the law and also our Christian principles that we talked of.  

</span></div><div><span>The second reason why we should support this Bill is, we have obligations to comply with the 

International Conventions that we have signed up to.  The Convention on the Elimination on all 

form of Discrimination against Women and Child, it says that the party is ratifying the Convention 

declare  intent  to  enshrine  gender  equality  into  their  domestic  legislation  and  repeal  all 

discriminatory provisions in any of their laws.  We signed this Convention in 1985, 33 years ago 

</span><span>and today, we are debating something in that I think we have no option but to comply with the 

</span><span>Convention that we are a Party to.  

</span></div><div><span>So, I normally take so much time, but on this occasion, before I sit down, I just wanted to add to 

the talk about </span><span>sin</span><span> and </span><span>crime</span><span>.  Like the Minister Mokoroa, I did google a definition of </span><span>sin</span><span> and a 

definition of </span><span>crime</span><span> and I agree with the way he had addressed that particular issue in his address.  

Let me also comment on the comments made by the Honourable Member for Pukapuka/Nassau.  

Yes,  I  was  not  blaming  you  for  the  delay  in  the  Bill.    I  do  understand  the  process  and  the 

</span><span>consultation that went on with the public.  It is unfortunate that quite a bit of confusion about what 

</span><span>the Bill was intended to achieve but like I said, that is in the past, we are here today and we move 

forward.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>And finally, to the comment from the Leader of the United Party, I wish to say that I and three 

from our side have a clear conscience in supporting the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Tina Browne.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  stand  to  advise  this  House  that  all  15  of  our 

Government Members are in support of this Crimes (Sexual Offences) Amendment Bill 2023.  In 

saying this, Mr Speaker, I acknowledge the individual views that the Members of our team has on 

parts of this Bill relating to de-criminalizing of sexual activity between members of the same sex. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  team  has  debated  this  matter  thoroughly  in  our  Caucus  and  while  each  of  us  respect  each 

Member's  respective  views  on  this  subject,  we  are  also  mindful  of  our  role  as  law  makers  in 

Parliament.    That,  as  law  makers,  we  cannot  pass  laws  that  knowingly  discriminate  against 

members of our community.   

</span></div><div><span>Our  team  has  agreed  that  while  we  acknowledge  the  beliefs  of  our  individual  members,  the 

Government team has chosen to vote as a block to support this Bill.  The reason being Mr Speaker, 

is that there is much in this Bill that gives greater protection to victims of sexual crime.  In fact, 

the bulk of this Bill Mr Speaker, is about improving the protections against sexual crimes.   

</span></div><div><span>This Bill has broaden its protections and definitions of sexual crimes.  This Amendment brings 

into the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century laws that were passed more than 50 years ago.  It removes legal language that 

is  no  longer  appropriate  in  this  day  and  age.    It  replaces  the  old  stereo-type  of  crimes  being 

committed by men on girls to recognize them now as crimes by adults whether they be men or 

women against children, whether they be boys or girls. 

</span></div><div><span>It now puts in place protection for boys that were not recognized in the old Act.  Further, it removes 

</span><span>marriage as a defense against rape.  Domestic violence and domestic sexual abuse against women 

</span><span>or men for that matter can no longer be accepted just because you are married.  And speaking of 

rape, this Bill defines more accurately sexual violation in its broadest sense as a crime of which 

rape is just one part.   

</span></div><div><span>This  Bill  also  allows  for  our  Courts  to  prosecute  anyone  charged  with  sexual  crimes  against 

children regardless if that offence took place here or overseas.  And finally, this Bill removes or 

decriminalizes sexual acts between consenting adults whether they are men or women. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this change in law comes from the idea that it is not the Government’s role to interfere 

</span><span>in the private lives of individuals when activity is consensual and has not caused harm to anyone.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The  purpose  of  criminal  offences  is  not  to  dictate  the  morality  of  people’s  life  choices,  but  to 

</span><span>protect people from criminal harm.    

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned by our Minister of Justice, this Bill has been greatly debated by our people.  I know 

that our people have their views on this Bill.  Our older generation have conservative views, our 

younger generation have more liberal views.  Every country in the world at some stage has had to 

deal with this matter of removing discriminatory laws that criminalize people.  Our country is no 

exception to this. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, we heard the Message from our Chaplain and also from some of our want-to-be Reverends 

inside the House.  It is the role of the Churches Mr Speaker, to teach people and to raise awareness 

as to what the Bible says about any human activity and the effects of pursuing those principles.  In 

other words, revealing to people to the original intent and purpose or why and how God created 

human kind.  That is the role of the Church.  The choice to follow or not to follow those principles 

rests entirely with  the individual.  What  is  important  here is  that  the choice be made based on 

informed decisions, spiritually or otherwise. 

</span></div><div><span>This  Bill  is  not  intended  to  change  the  word  of  God  or  the  Bible  or  the  interpretation  of 

homosexuality.  In the eyes of God, it is still defined as a </span><span>sin</span><span>.  The role of the Government is to 

protect our people and to protect our rights.  We are the Government for all of our people, not just 

the Government for some of our people and as a Government, we must protect the rights of all our 

people especially the minority in our community. 

</span></div><div><span>It is not the job of Government to tell people what their sexuality is.  It is not the job of Government 

to absolve sin, it is not the job of Government to tell people how they can or cannot have sex.  The 

Government does not have a place in the bedrooms of the people.  

</span></div><div><span>We  are  a  free  country,  we  have  freedom  of  speech,  we  have  freedom  of  expression,  we  have 

freedom  to  worship,  we  have  freedom  to  observe  our  Sabbath,  whether  it  be  on  Saturday  or  a 

</span><span>Sunday.  We have freedom to start a business, we have freedom to work on a Saturday or a Sunday.  

</span><span>We have freedom to love who we want to, we have freedom to be who we want to be.  We all 

should have the right to live our lives free from discrimination.   

</span></div><div><span>We say we are a people of love and respect.  Today, we are doing our job as law makers.  We will 

remove  a  discriminatory  and  unjust  law  that  goes  against  our  Constitution  and  our  values  as  a 

Nation.  We are doing what is right and what is just.  Simply put Mr Speaker, we are protecting 

our people.  That is what we have done today.  Mr Speaker, with the support and agreement of my 

</span><span>team,  I stand on behalf  of all our Government  Members to  support this Bill  before the House.  

</span><span>Thank you.
