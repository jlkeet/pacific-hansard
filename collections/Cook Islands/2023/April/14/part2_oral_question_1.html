<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER (T. TURA):</span><span>  I call the House to Order.  Kia Orana to all of us this morning.  Kia 

</span><span>Orana to our Chaplain who presented a good Message for us this morning.  The Message that he 

</span><span>had  shared  with  us  this  morning  suits  our  purpose  for  today  and  I  wish  everyone  hope  for  the 

future.

greetings to you all.

<div><span>We will not forget our people living overseas in New Zealand, Australia, Tahiti and other parts of 

the world watching our livestream and listening to this broadcast, greetings to you all.  Greetings 

also to our people here on the island of Rarotonga and the Outer Islands, greetings to you all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We have no further notices, therefore, we will move on to Question Time and this is for 30 minutes.
