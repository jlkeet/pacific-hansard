</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I only wish to make a very short comment.  I think 

the Parliament should be proud of being the only one that has so far filed an Annual Report and I 

hope that this is some incentive for the Ministers to encourage their Ministries to file their Reports 

in a timely manner. 

</span></div><div><span>Of course, in our new Standing Orders, we need to remind ourselves of Standing Order 224 and 

what it says is, that the Public Accounts Committee must do an Annual Review of the Reports that 

are prepared.   

</span></div><div><span>So, congratulations Parliamentary Services for being on time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  As mentioned earlier, I have read this Report and along 

with the recommendations of this Report, I stand to support that as well.   

</span></div><div><span>I think we should also look at Personnel.  I want to request the Minister Responsible to increase 

the amount for Personnel, maybe in the next Budget, to improve the remuneration for staff.  I ask 

that in our next Budget Appropriation, please increase the amount for remuneration for staff who 

work in Parliament Services.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I am sure the Honourable Prime Minister, 

who is the Minister of Finance have taken note of that.  

</span></div><div><span>Paper 16: Cook Islands Investment Corporation Annual Report for the year ended 30</span><span>th</span><span> June 2014.   

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Paper be received 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you and you may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, my comments in respect of this one is also going 

to be very short.   

</span></div><div><span>It not only relates to this Paper but it also relates to Papers 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.  This is a 

clear indication that this Ministry has been in default since 2014 and there really is no point.  I

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>have read the Report, no point in debating it because it is something that has happened nine years 

ago.  Of course I am now hoping that with a new Minister of Investment Corporation that their 

Report for the 2021/22 year will be promptly filed soon and consistent with my remarks earlier on 

Paper 15.  This should encourage all other Ministers, if your Heads of Ministries are not complying 

with your obligations, you have a job to do. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Some of the Members might be wondering why 

we have seven lots of Annual Reports there from the Cook Islands  Investment Corporation.  In 

fact, it is eight Annual Reports dating from 2014 up to 2021.  It is not that these Reports were not 

done Mr Speaker, in  fact,  these Reports were  completed on time, submitted to  the Ministry of 

Finance but also submitted to the Audit Office and I might add that these Audits on these Reports 

came through with unqualified.  Unqualified under the Audit means it passed through with flying 

colors.  

</span></div><div><span>The reason why they sit here is that they are mistakenly thought that once they are submitted to 

the Audit Office that they would then be forwarded here to Parliament.  But that has not been the 

case.   

</span></div><div><span>So, these are really submitting the Reports that have already previously been supported following 

the due process so that Parliament receives its copies from CIIC and not from Audit.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  Let us continue: 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 17: 

</span></div><div><span>Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Annual  Report  for  the  year 

ended 30 June 2015. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 18: 

</span></div><div><span>Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Annual  Report  for  the  year 

ended 30 June 2016.

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, when a Report is read and is unqualified, that means it is passed.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have completed all our businesses for today.  It has been a long day for 

us and I thank you all for your hard work. 

</span></div><div><span>May I ask an Honourable Member to say our Closing Prayer please?
