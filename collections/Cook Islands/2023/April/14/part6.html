</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand and would like to spend some time to talk on this Crimes (Sexual Offences) 

Amendment Bill 2023.   

</span></div><div><span>If we have listened t</span><span>o the Leader of the Opposition’s speech to the Speech of the Throne, she was 

</span><span>very critical of the fact that this Bill took seven years to be tabled in this House.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to assure this Honourable House that this shows to this House and to the 

people of the Cook Islands listening in, that this Government and more so those who have been in 

charge of this Amendment Bill were very, very cautious.  They were very prudent in carrying out 

a systematic, structured and inclusive process in bringing this Bill to this House. 

</span></div><div><span>We are all aware of the widespread consultation with key stakeholders, with the Outer Islands and 

with the wider range of groups and organizations within our Cook Islands.  Consultations was also 

taken to our drafters and advisers from our New Zealand and Australian counterparts and even 

amongst and within our Government Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, let me thank those respective Ministers and Members of Parliament who have been 

involved in driving this Amendment throughout the past seven years. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, as we can see that present in our House today is the current Solicitor General, Mr 

Jason  Lauaki  Annandale  and  Ms  Maraiata  Tavioni  from  the  Crown  Law  Office  and  let  me 

congratulate  you on  your new appointment and thank  you for having the time to  brief Cabinet 

Members and the Opposition on this particular Amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  stand  and  can  honestly  state  that  this  Bill  took  seven  years  because,  part  of  the 

biggest obstacle of this matter is of our strong religious belief.  We are a strong religious country.  

This  particular  religious  belief  is  what  is  affecting  all  of  us,  especially  those  of  our  Members 

representing their constituency from here in Rarotonga and from the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Daily Scripture for today and as our Ch</span><span>aplain Teava Nanai stated that “this Daily Scripture 

</span><span>for today is not a coincidence.”  Leviticus 18:1</span><span>-30, as the Member for Murienua stated is a divine 

intervention. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, briefly speaking, this Chapter 18 sets the standard of right and wrong in sexual matters 

given by God.  Both in  this Chapter and the entire Bible, this provision  was not  given to hurt, 

deprive or restrict life, joy or happiness for humanity.  They were given to ultimately build the best 

life for society and individuals; we can live by them and live better by them. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  these  sexual  matters  such  as  homosexual,  sodomy,  incest,  sexual  violation  and 

adultery is a very sensitive and more or less a taboo subject that is very rarely discussed in public, 

</span></div><div><span>148 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>only the newspaper and George Pitts paper takes advantage of this so that they can make money 

from these sensitive issues. 

</span></div><div><span>Because of our hesitancy and reluctance to talk about this subject matter in the public domain, I 

have taken the liberty to put  before some simple definition that  will  ease our mind  within this 

House. 

</span></div><div><span>For a start, we need to ask ourselves, what is the difference between SIN and CRIME? 

</span></div><div><span>Sin</span><span> and </span><span>Crime:</span><span>A sin is an act or behaviour that is against religion or God’s will, they contravene 

God’s law whether written i</span><span>nto nature, divinely revealed or imposed by the Church.  Crime is an 

action against the law.  Crimes are contraventions of man-made law, many crimes Mr Speaker are 

also sins in and of themselves.  For example, murder and theft is a sin as well as a crime. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, sin is recognised by God and Religion and if you commit sin against God’s law, God 

</span><span>is your Judge and will penalize you. 

</span></div><div><span>Crime is recognised by the state or Government and if you commit any of these crimes, you will 

be judged by Judge Toogood and Patrick Keane.  That is what this House is all about, putting in 

place laws that will protect our people, the land, sea and the sky. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I ask all 24 Members here, Members of Parliament present that you have an obligation 

here in this House, to make those laws, to pass or not pass those laws. 

</span></div><div><span>All  24  of  us  here  are  to  debate  with  consciousness  to  voice  your  views  on  what  your  belief  is 

pertaining to this Bill.  Remember this crime once committed will be reported to the Police and 

actioned by them.  It will be taken to the Court to be prosecuted by the Crown, by the Solicitor 

General, by the Crown Law on behalf of the Government of the day.  Our role as Members of 

Parliament  in  this  House  is  to  represent  our  Constituency  on  matters  of  local,  national  or 

</span><span>international importance. 

</span></div><div><span>So, if you as a Member of this House, want to discuss the spiritual intervention, I suggest  you 

apply  to  Takamoa  Theological  College.    Please  put  on  your  professional  hat  as  a  Member  of 

Parliament representing your Constituency.  This topic of LGBTQ is one of those issues whereby 

many have a lot of interest in/on or about it.  It affects our society, it affects you and me, it affects 

our family structure, and it affects our village, island and country. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Crimes Act was enacted in the Cook Islands in 1969 and was heavily informed 

</span><span>by the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961 who was also heavily influenced by the British Crimes Act, 

</span></div><div><span>149 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>back then.  Our Crimes Act has been amended a number of times, often mirroring developments 

in the criminal law in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>In other words, whatever happens in New Zealand today, will move towards our way by five, 10 

or 15 years later.  But nevertheless, change will be evident for us here in the Cook Islands.  Today, 

we are starting to action the referendum on medicinal plants especially in Marijuana.  Mr Speaker, 

this is already legal in New Zealand.  The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act was passed on 11</span><span>th</span><span>

December 2018. 

</span></div><div><span>This Bill makes amendments to sexual crimes within the Crimes Act,  which are guided by the 

overall policy principles and it provides for greater and equal protection from sexual crimes to all 

individuals under the law; and ensuring that sexual criminal activity is prosecuted equally. 

</span></div><div><span>There are 4 key policy changes created by this Bill: 

</span></div><div><span>1.</span><span>Non-gendered offences </span><span>–</span><span> our existing sexual offences are restricted by the genders of the 

perpetrators and victims.  These amendments are made so that all sexual offences can be 

committed by anyone, toward anyone.  This covers gaps left in our law, where for example, 

there is no offence to cover offending committed by a woman, on a young boy.  Under this 

new  Bill,  all  offending  committed  by  anyone  is  treated  the  same,  and  no  one  is  left 

unprotected. 

</span></div><div><span>2.</span><span>New key definitions and concepts </span><span>–</span><span> the Bill uses four new key terms, which are guided by 

</span></div><div><span>New Zealand law, the first new term is: 

</span></div><div><span>a.</span><span>Sexual  connection  </span><span>–</span><span>this  is  used  to  replace  “sexual  intercourse”,  to  address  a 

</span><span>broader category of sexual activity, and to include individuals of any gender. 

</span></div><div><span>The second new key term is: 

</span></div><div><span>b.</span><span>Sexual violation </span><span>–</span><span> this is used instead of rape, and includes a broader category of 

</span></div><div><span>sexual activity; 

</span></div><div><span>The third new key term is: 

</span></div><div><span>c.</span><span>Dependent family member; 

</span></div><div><span>The last new key term is: 

</span></div><div><span>d.</span><span>Person with significant intellectual impairment.

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>3.</span><span> The third key policy changes Mr Speaker is the decriminalization of consensual sexual 

</span></div><div><span>activity between members of the same sex; 

</span></div><div><span>4.</span><span>And the last key policy changes are the removal of marital defense to sexual crimes. 

</span></div><div><span>There may be potential questions such as, does this mean same sex marriage will be legalized?  

</span></div><div><span>This  is  a  completely  separate  subject  from  allowing  marriage.    This  Bill  is  concerned  with 

prosecuting  activity  that  meets  the  high  threshold  of  criminality,  nothing  to  do  with  same  sex 

marriage.   

</span></div><div><span>The second question is, does the Act allow consensual sexual activity between minors under 16 

years of age?  This Bill acknowledges that the age bracket of 12 to 16 years is an age bracket where 

young people will experiment with sexual activities.  This Bill does not encourage this activity.   

</span></div><div><span>The third potential question is the inclusion of surgically constructed genitalia?  This is to account 

for a person who has undergone reconstruction surgery is either a perpetrator or a victim of a sexual 

crime; it ensures that the same law applies to them.  While reconstructive surgery is not common 

in  the  Cook  Islands,  it  accounts  for  foreign  visitors  that  may  have  had  reconstructive  surgery 

visiting the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the next question is, where to from here once this Bill is passed?  Government action 

on this Bill does not end here.  The Police, the Ministry of Justice, Prison Services, Probation and 

the Justice system that was questioned by the Member of Parliament of Matavera yesterday needs 

to be trained and upskilled on how these provisions can be effectually policed. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition thanked Yours Truly about the wonderful cultural items 

delivered  over  the  last  two  nights  at  the  Auditorium.    On  the  same  token,  let  me  thank  all  the 

Ministry of Education staff, the principals, teachers, parents and most of all to our students from 

</span><span>Early Child Education to Year 13 for putting up a good show last night. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in my closing speech last night, I raised this statement that caught my attention that 

</span><span>was highlighted by one of the school.  The statement is that “this generation will stride for dignity.”  

</span><span>Dignity means, the state or quality of being worthy of honour or respect.  

</span></div><div><span>Today, this is what this House is striding or striving for.  This means we are extending the quality 

of being worthy of honour and respect to our LBTQ family and at the same time, protecting our 

</span><span>children, both boys and girls, should the circumstances arises and they unfortunately fall to such 

</span><span>demise.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>With those words Mr Speaker, I thank this House for the time.  God bless and Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Leader of the United Party; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Greetings Mr Speaker and the staff of this House. Greetings to the Member, 

our elders, and to  our friends in  the Public Gallery.  Greetings also  to  our people in  the Outer 

Islands and on Rarotonga listening to us.  Before I make my comments, I stood up earlier on but I 

was  lost  because  I  wanted  to  talk  on  the  Motion  by  the  Prime  Minister.    But  despite  that  Mr 

Speaker, we had a Program set down for two weeks by the Committee that we had selected for our 

Sittings.  On the spirit of this, my team prepared for the two weeks as scheduled by Parliament.  

However caught us the United Party by surprise. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to you Mr Speaker and a 100 percent support to all the previous greeting that went out 

earlier today.  At this moment Mr Speaker, with your blessings, I would like to say a few greetings.  

Firstly, to those in the Cook Islands United Party for your support during our campaigning right 

up to today; to shorten things, thank you to all of you in putting your faith in our United Party on 

the 1 August 2022.  May God bless you and for all your support up to today and not forgetting the 

Electoral Petitions we came through last year.  

</span></div><div><span>We all know the situation we came through as the Prime Minister has stated about the long awaited 

time for Parliament to finally sit again.  I would like to say in this House, it is </span><span>not the United Party’s 

</span><span>fault to prolong the Sitting of Parliament.  There are procedures and processes for the running of 

Parliament but as citizens of this country, we have a right to do what we have done.  I feel sorry 

for the Leader of the Nation, to quote, on the Speech from the Throne. 

</span></div><div><span>I feel sorry for the Leader of our Nation to again quote part of the Speech from the Throne; we all 

heard the Speech.  But today, I would like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister for promoting 

the United Party; thank you very much.  I believe that is water under the bridge for us all. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now refer to the Amendment Bill before this House.  We have the reading for us today at the 

beginning of our Parliamentary Sitting.  That is why I was asking earlier today whether this is a 

coincidence or is this holy intervention? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister Vaine Mokoroa has a different interpretation.  With that interpretation 

for our people listening in, why was this Bill raised today?  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I convey to all of our previous leaders, to all of our people that have passed on for our 

</span><span>Nation to be called a Christian Nation and to be a God fearing Nation today.  In reference to our 

Reading yesterday, it was talking about the spilling of blood.  And today, we had something else 

</span></div><div><span>152 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>brought into our House, it was a Word that tied in with this Amendment Bill; I guess in a way, it 

is in our Reading today. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, I am grateful to the Almighty, I am grateful that yesterday, our Reading 

was pertaining to the blood, that we are covered in blood and everything that the blood is associated 

with.  Today, we as Representatives in this House now stand under one spirit and one purpose, 

before God. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand on behalf of the United Party family and likewise, us, in this Honourable House to oppose 

this Bill.  One question that we must ask ourselves is, where is our dignity that pertains to the 

Scripture that has led us this far?  As we are currently debating on this Amendment Bill, how will 

that impact us and our people? 

</span></div><div><span>Psalm 103:2, </span><span>“Rejoice and give thanks to the Lord for He is worthy of all good and let everything 

inside of me give thanks and honour to His Name.”</span></div><div><span>The Minister gave us a detailed explanation on what </span><span>sin</span><span> and </span><span>crime</span><span> truly means.  A question for 

the Honourable Minister, since 1969, how many people have been prosecuted under this Act?  And 

now, we are changing it? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister also stated that same sex marriage is not included in this Bill.  The United 

Party knows that once this Bill ascends, another request will be brought forward in the near future.  

May  your Christian conscience be with  you in the decisions you make for our country and for 

tomorrow.  </span><span>“So now faith, hope and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.”</span></div><div><span>Today,  Mr  Speaker  and  our  people  listening  in,  we  are  moving  the  boundaries.    We  are  not 

accepting  the  Message  that  our  Chaplain  had  preached  to  us  this  morning;  something  that  we 

should not be surprised.  The last part of our Daily Reading says, </span><span>“I am your God.”</span><span>  The Minister 

</span><span>has told us what the punishment is for a crime and that is alright.  What will God’s judgment be?  

</span><span>We are following the laws of New Zealand.  Look at what is happening to New Zealand today.  

</span><span>The have agreed to same sex marriage.  Look at all other countries of the world!  Another question 

that I would like to ask everybody today is, do we want the same thing to happen to us?  This is 

why I was querying earlier on whether this is a coincidence or a Holy intervention. 

</span></div><div><span>I agreed to what the Honourable Minister have mentioned in regards to the 24 Members of this 

Parliament  who  will  speak.    In  our  Standing  Orders,  we  Members  of  the  Opposition  hold 

Government accountable, that is in the Standing Orders. 

</span></div><div><span>We all heard our Members support the Income Tax Bill because it will benefit our people.  We 

have been told that the Government would like to have the Crimes (Sexual Offences) Amendment

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  I rise to ask that an extension of 10 minutes be granted to the Honourable Member 

for Murienua.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:   </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member, extension approved. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you again to Mr Speaker and also to the Member of Matavera for 

giving me more opportunity to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speake, I am weary in regards to this Bill that is before the House because I am made aware 

that the Government is going to push through the House for this Amendment Bill to be completed 

today.  We were of the opinion that this Parliament Sitting will extend to next week and we, the 

three  in  our  Party,  have  planned  to  put  to  the  House  our  thoughts  and  submission  on  this 

Amendment Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I thank the  Government  of today for pursuing in this matter that it will proceed but  I was just 

wondering whether you will stand firm on the decisions that you are making and not change your 

mind later. 

</span></div><div><span>Because the Celebration will be on the 25</span><span>th</span><span> July and I am proud to say this to you and remind you 

that our Chief Tinomana of Puaikura was the first to accepting the Gospel to Rarotonga and we 

will be celebrating the Anniversary on the 25</span><span>th</span><span> July.  What they have established and what we have 

done in the year 2006; I recall that all Members of this House supported the recommendation that 

we will not allow for enforcement of marriage between same sexes. 

</span></div><div><span>And that is why I have been mentioning before that we are removing what we had discussed before 

</span><span>and now we are introducing this and I will wait as to what will be the next move.  We stand firm 

as to what God has made a law and to what our forefathers have  set in place for our people as 

prescribed in the Bible.   

</span></div><div><span>That Mr Speaker is what my Party Members stand on this matter for today and for the future.  This 

is my question to this House today, which of us the 24 Members in this Honourable House will 

stand in regards to this Amendment Bill?  But rest assured, what we decide today will remain in 

</span><span>your heart for the future.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I thank God because at the right time, the word of God is speaking to us in the community and in 

this House especially.  We are being guided every day, my company T&amp;M; we have Devotions 

every day, reading our Daily Bread Scripture, every day and six days a week.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I oppose to this Amendment Bill based on the Word of God.  I cannot give up my 

faith for a sinful law telling me otherwise.  You the Government pushing this law through this 

House; maybe it be on your heads not on your shoulders as to what you will be doing today. 

</span></div><div><span>This is the United Party Members unanimous decision on this Amendment Bill and the Democratic 

Party will have make their own decision. 

</span></div><div><span>I have so many thoughts that I want to share with this House but with the time limits that we have, 

I will have to end my speech on this Amendment Bill.  Our islands are preparing for what, the 

celebration of the arrival of the Gospel to our country.   

</span></div><div><span>Please  bear  with  me  Mr  Speaker,  there  is  a  task  given  into  my  hands  by  the  CICC  Church  of 

Puaikura  to  renovate  the  CICC  Church  ready  for  the  anniversary  celebration  on  25</span><span>th</span><span>  July.  

Therefore, I seek from you leave of absence from the House to attend this very important work in 

my village. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa 

and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members this afternoon and 

to all our people in the Public Gallery today. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to speak some points that was raised by the Minister Responsible for the Amendment Bill.  

As  he  has  defined  the  difference  between  </span><span>sin</span><span>  and  </span><span>crime</span><span>.    My  thoughts  go  along  that  of  the 

Honourable Member from Murienua. 

</span></div><div><span>My question here is, what happens when you break the law?  Is that not a sin committed by you?  

This is what I am on about because you, Honourable Minister was trying to clarify the difference 

between </span><span>sin</span><span> and </span><span>crime.</span><span>  And my understanding is that once you break the law, you have sinned.  

So, this is just one of the additions that I want to put to the House as to what you have already told 

the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  Mr  Speaker,  I  thank  God  for  the  vision  He  has  given  to  me  this  morning  through  the 

</span><span>Message  given  by  the  Parliament’  Chaplain.    That  Message  supports  what  I  have  prepared  to 

</span><span>present to the House. 

</span></div><div><span>155 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our Daily Bread Scripture for today fits appropriately with this debate on this Amendment Bill 

before the House.  As shared by the Honourable Member for Murienua, how come it coincides 

with our Daily Bread Reading; which is defined in Leviticus 18:1-30.  This Scripture is telling us 

today to be right and God is warning all of us.  Do not have sexual relationship with any immediate 

member of the family, mother, father, sister, brother and any siblings of the family. 

</span></div><div><span>The Scripture for today also states </span><span>“humans should not have sexual relationships with animals or 

beasts.”</span><span>  It is telling us in Verse 30, </span><span>“therefore shall ye keep mine ordinances that </span><span>ye commit not 

any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you and that ye defile not 

</span><span>yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God.”</span></div><div><span>And in Verse 22 of Chapter 18, it says </span><span>“do not have sexual relationship with a man as one does 

</span><span>with a </span><span>woman because that is an abomination to the Lord.”</span><span>  That is what is specifically stated by 

Verse 22.  Even in Verse 24, which states, </span><span>“do not defile yourselves in any of these sins because 

</span><span>this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you bec</span><span>ame defiled.”</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker, our Reading for this morning really encourages me in what I wanted to speak in 

the House. 

</span></div><div><span>The old Act, the Crimes Act 1969, was drafted by the late Albert Royle Henry inclusive of his 

Cabinet Ministers those days and supported by the people of the Cook Islands.  Albert Henry laid 

the foundation under this Act with a provision in regards to Sex Crime.  I believe this provision 

</span><span>was also linked from the Holy Bible and the word ‘sodomy’ is also from the Holy Bible and in 

</span><span>their belief that all criminal activities fall under the Crimes Act.  But at the same time, when I 

looked  at  the  Crimes  Act  1969,  it  did  not  mention  any  other  interested  groups.  It  also  did  not 

mention about queer people and did not include any groups such as the LGBTQ.  

</span></div><div><span>And yet today, we are looking at amending the laws established by Albert Henry.  I believe we are 

repealing some of the robust provisions in our laws today.  The question is, why?  Are we scared?  

</span><span>I am not sure.  Are we fearful of manmade laws and we are not fearful of laws made by God?  It 

</span><span>is so sad!  It is telling us today about a relationship between a lady and a girl, a man and a boy, 

man and man.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is my concern of what we are considering today.  However, mark my word Mr 

Speaker, I have children and grandchildren in these groups.  They have chosen to be part of this 

group and I have nothing against them for being part of this group because one of my children 

came and asked for my support towards the group.  I did not decline and I gave my support.  For 

</span><span>our children who choose to live this way of life is not my concern, it is their choice because Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, it is not for me to judge, but God is responsible to judge us.  

</span></div><div><span>156

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I am standing to testify in our Christian belief and my strong belief in our Lord Jesus Christ.  This 

did not discourage me but encouraged me to strive forward as I am not fearful of people, but I fear 

God.  It is quoted in the Scripture, John 14:6, </span><span>“I am the way the truth and the life no one gets to 

</span><span>the Father </span><span>except through me Jesus.”</span><span>  So, Honourable Speaker, I fear God especially TODAY! 

</span></div><div><span>Under the definitions of the Crimes Act 1969, as I have mentioned earlier in regards to Sections 

152, 153, 154 and 155, never mentions about any group of people and any relationship between a 

mother and girl, woman and a woman, father and a son or a man and a man and also sodomy.  

There are also the amendments from Section 140 to Section 149 and as mentioned by the Minister 

</span><span>earlier on, brought in new definitions such as ‘sexual</span><span>connection’ to replace ‘sexual intercourse’.  

Also the word ‘rape’ will be replaced by the word ‘sexual violation.’  </span></div><div><span>My concern Mr Speaker is the repealing of Sections 152, 153, 154 and 155 because I do believe 

our forefathers inserted this provisions for a reason and here we are today changing it and also Mr 

Speaker, the definitions are not mentioned.  

</span></div><div><span>I want to refer us to Section 155 that provides for the offence of sodomy.  I then say, if you commit 

sodomy under the old provision of the Act, then you have committed an offence.  However, under 

the new amendment, there is no provision, it is an offence and I am concerned on the repealing of 

these four sections from the principal Act. 

</span></div><div><span>This is my own thought Mr Speaker, and there are members of the public that has approached me 

to convey their thoughts in the House.  If you look at any proposed law changes and you think it 

is not right, then challenge the change.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Member,  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Agnes  Armstrong;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I stand to ask for an extension for the Honourable Vaitoti 

</span><span>Tupa, to carry on speaking for another 10 minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, you may proceed. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you also to the Honourable Member from Ivirua, 

Agnes Armstrong for asking for an extension for me to keep talking. 

</span></div><div><span>The Bible states a Parable, </span><span>“If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it 

</span><span>is sin for them.”</span><span>  My interpretation on this is, if you know the truth and you do not practice it, that 

</span><span>is a sin for you.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The Book of Genesis illustrates the actions of sodomy, one of the biggest sin ever.  I believe that 

sodomy originated from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  We all know this story and we all 

know what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah!  This exemplifies what the people did, which is 

what we are doing right now and what we are trying to repeal out of this Bill, God destroyed the 

two great cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.  This is what I want to bring to this House today.   

</span></div><div><span>I have a suggestion to you, Mr Speaker but I know it is not accordance with the Standing Orders 

but  nevertheless,  I  want  to  put  through  my  suggestion.    Under  Standing  Order  Number  6,  it 

spec</span><span>ifies a Motion.  But I know that you will have to give two days’ notice to the Clerk before the 

</span><span>Motion is considered.  But regardless of this, I will still present my suggestion to everyone today.  

I have a request, how about we give this to our people in the form of a Referendum? 

</span></div><div><span>Hopefully, we will get  some results on what  our people actually think about  this, although the 

Committee had done their Public consultation, I am sure that there are still people out there wanting 

to share their thoughts on this.  So, Mr Speaker this is my request.   

</span></div><div><span>I oppose this Amendment Bill, especially with Sections 152, 153, 154 and 155 under our Crimes 

Act of 1969 and now, we are trying to repeal it 

</span></div><div><span>I, Member of Parliament for Matavera, oppose this Bill, especially with the repealing of these four 

Sections.   

</span></div><div><span>My second request is, if we can restore these four Sections back into this Amendment Bill, even 

though I understand the Standing Orders.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore  Mr  Speaker,  to  conclude  my  speech,  again,  I  stand  to  oppose  this  Amendment  Bill 

because I believe in the Work of God.   

</span></div><div><span>May God help us all Members of Parliament with your thoughts on this Bill.  Please, do no go 

</span><span>against me for my protest against this Amendment Bill! 

</span></div><div><span>God bless us all, thank you and best wishes to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Honourable Members, subject to Standing 

Orders  42,  I  as  Speaker,  suspends  our  meeting  for  15  minutes.    I  will  release  you  to  refresh 

yourselves with more ideas when we reconvene again.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Please  be  seated.    This  meeting  has  now  resumed.    Before  our  Sitting  was 

adjourned, the Honourable Member for Tamarua was upstanding when I interrupted and now, I 

recognise her on the Floor and I will give her this opportunity to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  This is what Pilate asked Jesus, </span><span>“Are you the King 

of the Jews?”</span><span>  His response was, </span><span>“You said so, yourself.”</span></div><div><span>Tangike to everyone in the Name of our Lord.  If I speak old school, please bear with me.  If I 

speak like a Mama Revered, please bear with me.  But if I speak as Tetangi Matapo, Member of 

Parliament for Parliament, that is me. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I speak on the principles and merits of the Bill, I would like to convey my regards to the 

island of Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>Nga Ngauru o Tamarua, Nga Mana i Toru, </span><span>Mr and Mrs Reverend Aravei William and your family, 

our Traditional title holders, and to the rest of Tamarua, Tangike, Tangike, Tangike.  To the people 

of Mangaia, villages of Oneroa and Ivirua, we, Members of Parliament conveys our greetings to 

you all.  God bless us all. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Parliament Chaplain in his Message this morning has given me two important concepts that I 

</span><span>wish to highlight in my speech.  The first thing is, “</span><span>obey</span><span>the Word” of God and “</span><span>share</span><span>the Word” 

</span><span>of God. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you to all the previous speakers for your input on this Amendment Bill.  I also wanted to 

give my regards to those responsible for this Amendment Bill.  To the Select Committee Members 

who are not in the House today, Selina Napa, William Heather, I express my appreciation to all of 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>I will let you determine on what my thoughts are.  This Amendment Bill has been around for so 

</span><span>long.    But  w</span><span>e  would  say  that  things  happen  according  to  God’s  plan.    Maybe  today  was  a 

coincidence.  As highlighted by the Honourable  Minister, which coincides with  the Chaplain’s 

</span><span>Message this morning.  Their remarks were pretty good.  I would like to thank those who gave us 

an insight explanation of this Bill.  The problem for our people are the things that were shared to 

them  for  they  have  heard.    However,  this  is  one  of  the  things  that  I  have  said  when  I  became 

Member of Parliament, to be the voice for my people.   

</span></div><div><span>This is what I want to share.  There is a majority of people that opposes this Bill and there are 

</span><span>those whose voices are not being heard.  I am speaking on behalf of my island.  So, today, I am 

not a judge, and Pilate is the judge, but I want to convey my </span><span>thoughts on these two people.  God’s

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>laws  are  good  and  man  cannot  change  it.    From  the  Book  of  Leviticus  going  into  the  New 

Testament,  there  are  two  laws  Jesus  brought  for  us.    There  are  also  the  laws  the  Minister  has 

expressed to us today.  First, </span><span>“love the Lord with all your hearts.”</span><span>  Secondly, </span><span>“love thy neighbour.”</span></div><div><span>What we are doing today, there are a lot of laws in the Cook Islands.  The Minister has defined to 

us what the laws are and what the penalties are.  Jesus said, </span><span>“I did not come to abolish th</span><span>e laws 

</span><span>but to fulfil it.”</span><span>  My thoughts on this Bill is that we a modernizing the law.  The Holy Bible has 

been in existence for over 2,000 years and the Son of God has been in existence for over 2,000 

years as well.  However, what he has done for us never changes.  

</span></div><div><span>I reflect back on the times when I used to be a School Teacher and see boys who acts like girls in 

the classroom.  There was no protection for these children.  They were abused and ridiculed.  And 

today, this group of people are as a result of the Bill.  So, we are hearing about what we are going 

to do about this situation.  I am a God fearing person and I believe I will not be a judge.  So in 

regards to the Bill today, we may have been blind in the past or is it our attitude as a Christian 

nation?  I believe God created us in  His image.  However, what  you do and  your directions is 

where we are not alike. 

</span></div><div><span>So, if the intention of the Bill is in line with our presence of God and we are not saying Prayers 

and being judgmental  and annoyed at  others,  the intention is  that we are steadfast  before God, 

which is an area that I am looking at.  Therefore, Honourable Members of the House, those are our 

speeches  for  the  day.    You  have  your  own  mind  or  speaking  on  behalf  of  your  Constituency 

extending to our people abroad.  I cannot keep quiet on this Bill Mr Speaker, I wanted to be heard 

and also on behalf of the silent voices out there as well.  I did not stand up for those in the Public 

Gallery and a credit to all of you because of your presence but I stand for my people, for those that 

has been heard and for those that have not been heard.  Maybe there are a few however, I kept my 

pledge that I am your mouth piece in Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>To conclude, I would like to congratulate and greet all the new Members of Parliament that are in 

</span><span>the House.  Your contributions into the House are greatly appreciated.  Thank you for the words 

</span><span>of encouragement and your thoughts of support for our people.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, those are my views and if you are not pleased with my speech being too 

short, regardless of what we are talking about, the ruling has already been made on the decision 

towards the Bill.  God bless us all and Tangike to everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member for Tamarua.  I see the Honourable Member 

</span><span>George Angene; you have the Floor.

listening in from the Northern Group and Southern Group islands; Kia Orana to you all.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  if  I  may  have  some  to  address  my  Constituency  please?    To  my  people  of 

Tupapa/Maraerenga, Kia Orana to you all.  To those who likes me and those who does not, those 

who hates me and those who does not, Kia Orana to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>You  voted  for  me  to  represent  you  as  a  Member  of  Parliament  and  to  be  your  voice  in  this 

Honourable House, I stand here, representing you all.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am carrying 568 people on my shoulders.  Some people within my Constituency do 

not support me and this number is the number that I represent.  They agreed to whatever decision 

I make in this House.  We have had some that are off and some that are right.  However, I speak 

on behalf of those who voted for me. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to our Honourable Prime Minister, Mark Brown and his Deputy, the Honourable Deputy 

Prime Minister Robert Tapaitau.  To our side, the Government side, Kia Orana.  To the Opposition 

side  and  your  Leader  Tina  Browne,  Members  of  the  United  Party,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    The 

Member for the One Cook Islands is  not here;  I held that title in the last couple of years.  The 

meaning of One Cook Islands Party (OCIP) is, the Original Cook Islands Party.   

</span></div><div><span>Let us leave that on the side and focus on the Amendment Bill before us.  The intention of this 

Amendment Bill is to provide the rights for the Act to not prosecute.  However, Mr Speaker, I can 

see a lot of Pastors in this House.  I am not a Pastor, I am a Prophet.  I have read my Bible, John 

5:39 states, </span><span>“You study the Scriptures diligently…”</span></div><div><span>While I was listening to these Members saying their Bible Verses, they only disclosed part of the 

Verses.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, according to what God is saying in this Bible, a lot of things will apply to us and a lot 

</span><span>applies outside of our spaces.  I have spent 29 years on this Book, till today.  I do not go to Church.  

Jesus said, </span><span>“I am the way, the truth and the life,”</span><span> He did not say that, I am the Seven Day Adventist, 

the Protestant, the Catholic, et cetera.   

</span></div><div><span>Colossians 3:17, Jesus was so clear in what He said.  Jesus said, </span><span>“And whatever you do, in word 

</span><span>or deed, do everything in the Name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through 

</span><span>Him.”</span></div><div><span>Romans 3:23, “For</span><span>everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard.”  These Bible 

</span><span>Verses will apply to every single person in this House.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Matthew 7:1, </span><span>“Do not judge…”</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I think I have spoken enough on the Word of God, there are many Verses in the Bible 

that will apply to us all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, do you support it or not? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Yes I do!  I wanted to further deliberate on what we are deliberating right 

now.  The reason why I brought the Word of God is because I heard others talking about.   

</span></div><div><span>James 5:16, </span><span>“Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another… the fervent 

prayer of a righteous person is very powerful.” </span></div><div><span>This is the reason why I stated earlier about my standard.  I do not go to Church and I only one 

</span><span>Church, God’s Holy Bible and that is it.</span></div><div><span>About this Amendment Bill that is on the Floor and to answer your question, I and the people that 

I am representing supports this Amendment Bill 100 percent! 

</span></div><div><span>How do these Members know?  Maybe these victims goes to Church more than the Members that 

have been talking?  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Book of Exodus clearly outlines everything that people shall not kill, shall not 

steal, shall not commit adultery, we have done them all.  So, who will judge us? 

</span></div><div><span>I wanted to talk about </span><span>love.  </span><span>Do not be greedy, do not be jealous, do not slander, do not look for 

wealth for yourself; this is what </span><span>love </span><span>is.   

</span></div><div><span>1 Corinthian 13:4 explains it all.  I cannot say that I am perfect, but I am trying. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Prime Minister, I support the Amendment Bill that you have presented in this House, 

100 percent and the people that I am representing.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister Angene.  I see the Honourable Member Tingika 

</span><span>Elikana; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  ELIKANA:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Again,  Mr  Speaker  I  echo  the  salutations  and 

greetings  offered  by  previous  speaker  regarding  this  afternoon  session  as  I  would  like  to 

concentrate on my talk on the merits and principles of the Bill before this House.   

</span></div><div><span>Before I do so, I would like to acknowledge the presence of our LGBT Committee members and 

also their supporters here, thank you for joining us this afternoon.  

</span></div><div><span>I am probably not a popular person amongst them as the former Chair of the previous Crimes Bill 

which was introduced in the last Parliament and now have now died of natural causes.  There is a 

mis-perception that I am against the Bill.  That is probably because of some of the questions and 

some of the remarks I have made when there was public hearings about the Bill as Chairperson.  

But as any good Chairperson will do is to ensure that all areas of concern in any Bill or in any 

subject matter before a meeting is raised and addressed accordingly. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Amendment to the current Crimes Bill is timely.  It has upgraded the language 

used and it has removed mis-conceptions about certain conducts.  If I may allude this House to 

one of those that is the mis-conceptions that only males can commit most of the sexual offences. 

</span></div><div><span>If  you look  at  the provisions  of the Crimes  Act  1969, it mainly focusses on males  committing 

offences, either the offence of </span><span>rape</span><span> which under the current Crimes Act, women cannot commit.  

If  you  look  at  the  current  Crimes  Bill,  where  a  woman  commits  indecency  on  a  boy,  involves 

concerns as well.  And if you look at the headings of those sections of the Crimes Act, you will 

not  notice  any  heading  where  it  says  woman  on  a  woman;  but  you  will  see  a  male  on  a  male 

offence.    The  Bill  now  before  this  Parliament  removes  those  distinctions.    It  removes  this 

discrimination against males.  It brings before us the Parliament a Bill that is gender neutral. 

</span></div><div><span>And on that note Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Solicitor General and your staff for the 

hard work that you have put into in drafting this Bill and making sure that it is gender neutral.  

Congratulations. 

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  key  matters  this  Bill  brings  before  this  House,  it  removes  what  is  often  referred  as 

marital defense, a defense based on an archaic understanding that women are properties.  Because 

under the current law, if a man rapes a woman who is married to him, he cannot be charged for it.  

But  the  Bill  before  the  House  and  I  commend  again  the  Crown  Law  Office  and  also  the 

Government for removing that defense. 

</span></div><div><span>So, for men who currently think that they can force themselves on their wives, be careful because 

</span><span>the new legal framework coming into force exposes you to be charged.  I also welcome the new 

</span><span>definition  for  </span><span>rape</span><span>  and  </span><span>sexual  connection.</span><span>    I  wish  those  were  in  place  when  I  was  a  Criminal

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Prosecutor because some of the Acts in those days do not apply except for penile penetration.  So, 

I welcome the new Bill presented in this Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I just like to make some comments on the concerns raised by those who are more-less 

</span><span>opposed  to  the  bill  and  the  references  to  our  Ministers’  Message  this  morning,  I  welcome  the 

</span><span>Message from the Minister.  This highlights the position for Christians and for people who believe 

in God and how they should behave.  For people who believe in God and how they should lobby 

those non-believers to turn their lives around, I welcome that on those merits. 

</span></div><div><span>A lot has been said as to the distinction between </span><span>sin</span><span> and </span><span>crime</span><span>.  Most of our legislation and crimes 

are based on the Bible and also the 10 Commandments.  But irrespective of what we do, a </span><span>sin</span><span> is 

still a </span><span>sin.</span><span>  But a </span><span>crime</span><span> can be normalized and there is a lot of good examples.  If we track back 

the historical developments of our legislation, particularly in crimes, we will note  that we have 

made some changes to suit us in this present time.  Whether we change those to suit the present, it 

is still a sin but it is not a crime anymore because we have changed it. 

</span></div><div><span>If you want to look into the Bible, </span><span>fornication</span><span> is a sin, but we all do it.  Do not say that we have 

not!  We look into the Ten Commandments, adultery is an offence before God and a sin.  I will 

leave it at that. 

</span></div><div><span>(House burst into a loud laughter) 

</span></div><div><span>What I am trying to say Mr Speaker, is to highlight the fact and concerns that has been advocated 

by these group of people in our House.  There are certain things in life where you will make your 

own choices and where you will live with the consequences, either before our Creator or before 

Justice Toogood. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I say those points Mr Speaker to highlight certain things in making your own choices and how 

you will fall on your own sword.  Our Constitution highlights freedom of choice, subject to the 

</span><span>existing laws of the country.  I can sleep with anyone I want but not with my dog because bestiality 

</span><span>is an offence. 

</span></div><div><span>So, we are trying to remove these provisions to ensure that people like everybody else is treated 

equally and that they have the option to make those choices regarding their sexuality.  And I think, 

Mr Speaker, just to add another point, I have been in the Police force for over 14 years and I have 

been a Crown Prosecutor for over 10  years and in those  years,  I have not seen anybody being 

brought before the Court or even prosecuted for the offences that has been removed as amended 

</span><span>in this Bill.

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>It does not mean that we the Police and Lawyers do not know that Acts do exist.  It is not our job 

to go to every houses to check whether this is actually happening.  I know that for a fact that people 

assume  when  certain  individuals  like  boys  acts  like  women,  people  will  think  that  they  are 

homosexual.  That is not always true and I know that because I have relatives and nephews who 

are in that position and have girlfriends. 

</span></div><div><span>Just because of the way they act, they get a lot of societal assumptions in committing same sex 

relations.   

</span></div><div><span>I fully support this Bill and I have already outlined my thoughts on it and to the members of the 

LGBT, I am not the person you think I am.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; you have the Floor and you look beautiful. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>Thank  you Mr Speaker.  To all of us especially those in  the 

Public Gallery, welcome to Parliament, especially to Lady Tuaine Marsters who I see in the corner 

of the Public Gallery, Kia Orana.  You need not know where my support is as what I am wearing 

makes a statement. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me start by saying that in the Minister Mokoroa’s address introducing the Bill, he referr</span><span>ed to 

my very critical comments in my Reply to the Speech from the Throne and he is right.  However, 

he will be pleased to know that I have no intention on dwelling in the past.  I am very pleased that 

this Bill is being debated today and the past is the past and we leave it in the past.  I am going to 

be addressing the Bill in three capacities.  First is as a Parliamentarian, second as a Lawyer and 

thirdly, in case of those who do not know, as a grand-daughter of a Pastor that served in the Cook 

Islands Church, in the LMS for years.  I put a little proviso on the third row, I do not profess to be 

anywhere near those who alleges to be Pastors in this House.  

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, as Parliamentarians, I think we have a job to do, we have a duty to do.  I 

</span><span>am not sure that we have any option at all and why I say that is two reasons.  Our Constitution 

provides  for  fundamental  human  rights  and  freedom.    It  prohibits  us  for  discriminating  people 

based on sex, it provides that everyone should be treated equally so sitting around in this Chamber, 

we are obliged to comply with our Constitution.  We should not be having second thoughts about 

supporting the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Now on my Christian side and I am going to venture into this area knowing I am not a Pastor, 

</span><span>however, I did read on a report that the consultant prepared for the previous Select Committee.  He 

</span><span>reminded us of the other part of our Constitution which is the Preamble, which says:
