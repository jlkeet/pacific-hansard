<h3>Oral Question 29</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  In regards to the issue of marijuana weed, you are 

referring to; well I believe the Police have just completed a major drug bust in Aitutaki, which 

resulted in a number of convictions of people on the island of Aitutaki.  I do know the Police have 

their active team working on this issue as well.  Nevertheless, these are matters that are sensitive 

to  the  Police  and  not  matters  that  they  will  share  or  divulge  with  their  Minister.    From  what  I 

believe and understand Mr Speaker is that their work is progressing as it has been in the past with 

their detection services and the drug dogs and so forth.  That is about the extent I know.  Thank 

you.
