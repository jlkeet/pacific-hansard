<h3>Oral Question 21</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I think this question, from memory and I am not 

quite accurate, I would like to come back with an accurate figure but I think it is about $62 at this 

stage.    In  the  Departure  Tax  Act,  there  is  a  provision  each  year  for  an  incremental  increase  in 

departure  tax.    So,  rather  than  after  a  period,  we  increase  the  departure  tax  which  can  cause 

difficulties with the airlines who collect this in their ticketing.  When we passed our Departure Tax 

Act, we put that provision in so that each year, there is a slight increase and it provides assurance 

in planning for the airlines to know what the departure tax amount is that they need to factor into 

their tickets.
