<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>As he is Minister of Finance, I do not want to listen to rumors, I wanted to hear from him himself.  

The rumors that I have heard which I did not believe, the allocation has been used up on a project 

in Aitutaki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, we have heard the Member for Amuri/Ureia talk about this project in 

Aitutaki.  Therefore, my question is, is it true that the allocation has been used up in Aitutaki?  If 

the Honourable Prime Minister can answer my question so our people can hear it directly from 

you.  Thank you very much.
