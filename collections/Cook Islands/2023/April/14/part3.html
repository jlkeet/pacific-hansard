<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Minister Albert Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and good morning to you.  To the Clerk and your 

staff, all Members of Parliament who have been elected to serve our people, greetings to you all 

this morning. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  answer  a  question  that  the  Honourable  Member  of  Rakahanga  posed 

yesterday,  my  dear  Aunty  Tina.    If  I  may  just  clarify  the  question  at  Question  Time  and  the 

</span></div><div><span>123 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>question, </span><span>I quote, “In the Speech from the Throne, Government were praising themselves with the 

capital investments and projects here in Rarotonga and the Outer Islands” and “Rakahanga was 

mentioned” and the follow up question was, am I wrong or is there another pr</span><span>oject infrastructure? 

</span></div><div><span>Yes Mr Speaker, to answer her question, technically yes.  However, I must go back to the Speech 

from the Throne.   

</span></div><div><span>Now, the portion that she mentioned yesterday was a part of a bigger part of the Speech.  And I 

quote the Speech from </span><span>the Crown, “we have funded a number of initiatives aimed at a growing 

</span><span>economy reducing barriers and the competition growing labour force making government more 

</span><span>efficient in the Pa Enua.”</span></div><div><span>So,  to  answer  her  question  Mr  Speaker,  yes!    In  the  speech  from  the  throne,  the  question  was 

making reference to part of the speech that was referring to the funding that has been approved, 

specifically, for Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>So, these projects, Mr Speaker, are in the process, the funding has been approved.  But because 

the  team  is  still  in  Manihiki,  we  currently  have  some  funding  set  aside  to  do  some  work  in 

Rakahanga this year, our team are currently completing Phase 1 of the Manihiki Tukao Cyclone 

Centre refurbishment.   

</span></div><div><span>When this is finished early May, which is in a next few weeks, the team will move to Rakahanga, 

specifically  Mr  Speaker,  to  redo  the  spouting  on  both  the  Hospital  and  the  School.    Also,  the 

roofing is being procured for the Hospital and we would expect for this on the island in the next 

few months.  The reroofing will be undertaken hopefully by July.   

</span></div><div><span>Also Mr Speaker, Rakahanga is one of the last remaining island requiring a Cyclone Centre, along 

with Nassau may I add.  So, we have undertaken planning for the Rakahanga Cyclone Centre, the 

funding component for this particular project is still in progress.  Also, that has been approved on 

the ICI front.  There is a plan to repair for the Community water tanks for the Rakahanga CICC 

Hall, as well as the square tank next to the Church.   

</span></div><div><span>So, to answer the Honou</span><span>rable Member’s question, yes!  I hope the Honourable Member would 

</span><span>acknowledge and accept the information.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister and I see the Leader of the Opposition; you 

have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  everybody.    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  staff  of 

Parliament, Honourable Members of the House, the Government side and our side as well, Kia 

Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I ask my Supplementary Question, I would like to acknowledge on our children’s cultural 

</span><span>performances that took place last night.  I normally do not commend the Ministers on that side of 

the House but this morning, I would like to acknowledge the Minister of Education in regard to 

the festival from last night and the night before, it was very enjoyable.   

</span></div><div><span>124 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps we could consider cancelling Te Maeva Nui and having our children do the celebration 

instead, it was so enjoyable.  It can be seen also the performances of our children those children 

that cannot dance properly were the children of parents that does not know how to dance and those 

who can perform well are the children of parents that involves themselves in our cultural dance. 

</span></div><div><span>I was happy to hear the Minister declare in his speech last night that in the next festival, which will 

</span><span>be in two years’ time, the </span><span>schools in the Outer Islands will be part of the festival here on Rarotonga.  

The sad thing about this proposal is that I did not hear him say the schools in the Northern Group 

</span><span>will be part of this festival; he only mentioned the Southern Group islands’ sc</span><span>hool participation. 

</span></div><div><span>I know there are a lot of our little children in Rakahanga that can dance well in this school festival.  

So, I encourage you Minister to ask the Members of Parliament at the next festival to fill the seats 

at the front allocated for us so the bowls of the schools will be full of donations. 

</span></div><div><span>This is my Supplementary Question, but first I am happy to hear that the Minister of Infrastructure 

has changed because I am sure that going forward this project for Rakahanga will be actioned. 

</span></div><div><span>But I think the Minister has misquoted the speech from the throne because the paragraph he quoted, 

</span><span>this is the opening words, “we have funded.”  Meaning the project is done and we have done the 

</span><span>funding.  And after the quote, the examples of the Capital Investment project and it includes the 

</span><span>words, “have been developing in the past not in the future.</span></div><div><span>Maybe my interpretation of the Speech from the Throne is wrong but the way I see it is that the 

Government  is  commending  themselves  for  some  of  the  capital  investments  that  they  have 

completed in Rakahanga, something done already. 

</span></div><div><span>I also understand as mentioned of the many repairs required for the schools and the hospital.  But 

this is what I understand from the Speech from the Throne that there are some capital investment 

projects which I do not think, the answer must be, no!  But I am happy to hear that our Cyclone 

Centre will be build this term. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, can you please ask your question. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  The question is, when will our Cyclone Centre start? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    I  see  the  Minister  of 

Infrastructure; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, to put the Honourable Members fears and heartache to rest, 

once and for all, after Nassau. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you and I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Prime Minister as he has been 

Minister Responsible for CIIC in the past.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>As he is Minister of Finance, I do not want to listen to rumors, I wanted to hear from him himself.  

The rumors that I have heard which I did not believe, the allocation has been used up on a project 

in Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, we have heard the Member for Amuri/Ureia talk about this project in 

Aitutaki.  Therefore, my question is, is it true that the allocation has been used up in Aitutaki?  If 

the Honourable Prime Minister can answer my question so our people can hear it directly from 

you.  Thank you very much.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  And the work is still progressing and the harbour is being dredged back now. 

So the work is on its way to near completion.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Prime  Minister.    I  can  see  the  Honourable  Member  Robert 

Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and greetings to all Members of this House.  My 

question is to who is the Minister Responsible for the Police? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  It is the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER: </span><span> So, my question is for you Honourable Prime Minister.  A few days ago, I 

heard  the  Member  from  Titikaveka  talk  about  Community  Policing  because  back  in  2008,  the 

Community Policing program that was established in the Puaikura district, were stationed in the 

Community Hall.   They had been using the Community Hall as their office for eight years without 

rental payments.  However, in 2016, this program came to a halt.  The question to you Mr Prime 

Minister is, whether Government is thinking of reviving the Community Policing program again. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Honourable Member.  I can see the Leader of the Nation; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you very much for the very good question, raised by our Member for 

</span><span>Akaoa.   

</span></div><div><span>In fact, our Caucus had a discussion just a few weeks ago regarding improving the presence of our 

Police in our communities, particularly here on Rarotonga.  I can  advise, and in my discussion 

with  the  new  Police  Commissioner,  he  is  also  very  supportive  of  the  establishment  of  our 

Community Policing program. So, we will be working very closely with our community group to 

re-establish our Community Police within our districts as soon as possible.  This is also a request 

that is coming through from our communities as well.  That is, they want a presence of Police in 

</span><span>the community to help deter any petty crimes in particular but also to project a presence of safety 

</span><span>within the community.  So, I look forward to the establishment of the Community Police increasing 

a presence hopefully along the policy of not paying any rent to the Community Hall.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you to the Leader of the Nation.  I can see the Honourable Member Agnes 

Armstrong; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to everybody in the House today.  

Before I ask my question, I just wanted to briefly comment on the incentive for the reinstatement 

of  the  Community  Policing  program  on  Rarotonga.    I  just  wanted  to  acknowledge  the  former 

Member  of  Parliament  for  Titikaveka,  Selina  Napa,  for  requesting  the  above  incentive  for 

reinstatement.  I just wanted to say that this has been very productive, so thank you very much to 

the Government and especially to the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is to the Prime Minister; sorry, you are in the firing line today.  I just wanted to know 

how much is the Departure Tax on the airline tickets that we are collecting because the last time I 

knew  was  either  $55  or  $60.    It  is  of  interest  to  the  public  and  I  may  have  a  Supplementary 

Question.  Thank You. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I think this question, from memory and I am not 

quite accurate, I would like to come back with an accurate figure but I think it is about $62 at this 

stage.    In  the  Departure  Tax  Act,  there  is  a  provision  each  year  for  an  incremental  increase  in 

departure  tax.    So,  rather  than  after  a  period,  we  increase  the  departure  tax  which  can  cause 

difficulties with the airlines who collect this in their ticketing.  When we passed our Departure Tax 

Act, we put that provision in so that each year, there is a slight increase and it provides assurance 

in planning for the airlines to know what the departure tax amount is that they need to factor into 

their tickets. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    Honourable  Member,  you  may 

continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  The Supplementary Question is that of the amount that is charged, who 

is the beneficiary and if there is a proportion that is given to the collector as well? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Departure Tax, like all other taxes, Income Tax, VAT, goes into the general 

estimates of revenues.  There is no apportionment of any part of the departure tax; it is combined 

with all of Government revenue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  I see the Honourable Member Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Greetings  to  you  Mr  Speaker.    To  the  staff  and  all  of  us  Honourable 

</span><span>Members, greetings.  Mr Speaker, this question will not go to the Honourable Minister George 

</span><span>Maggie because he has left the Chamber.  My question is to the Prime Minister.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, the problems about weeds that we have been dealing in the past, what 

is the Government doing about it? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  In regards to the issue of marijuana weed, you are 

referring to; well I believe the Police have just completed a major drug bust in Aitutaki, which 

resulted in a number of convictions of people on the island of Aitutaki.  I do know the Police have 

their active team working on this issue as well.  Nevertheless, these are matters that are sensitive 

to  the  Police  and  not  matters  that  they  will  share  or  divulge  with  their  Minister.    From  what  I 

believe and understand Mr Speaker is that their work is progressing as it has been in the past with 

their detection services and the drug dogs and so forth.  That is about the extent I know.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Prime Minister.  Thank you Honourable Members.  We have 

come to the end of our Question Time.  We are back to the Orders of the Day.
