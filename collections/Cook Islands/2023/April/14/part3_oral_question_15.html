<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER: </span><span> So, my question is for you Honourable Prime Minister.  A few days ago, I 

heard  the  Member  from  Titikaveka  talk  about  Community  Policing  because  back  in  2008,  the 

Community Policing program that was established in the Puaikura district, were stationed in the 

Community Hall.   They had been using the Community Hall as their office for eight years without 

rental payments.  However, in 2016, this program came to a halt.  The question to you Mr Prime 

Minister is, whether Government is thinking of reviving the Community Policing program again.
