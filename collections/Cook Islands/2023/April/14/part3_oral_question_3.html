<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  everybody.    Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  staff  of 

Parliament, Honourable Members of the House, the Government side and our side as well, Kia 

Orana. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I ask my Supplementary Question, I would like to acknowledge on our children’s cultural 

</span><span>performances that took place last night.  I normally do not commend the Ministers on that side of 

the House but this morning, I would like to acknowledge the Minister of Education in regard to 

the festival from last night and the night before, it was very enjoyable.

<div><span>Friday, 14</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Second Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps we could consider cancelling Te Maeva Nui and having our children do the celebration 

instead, it was so enjoyable.  It can be seen also the performances of our children those children 

that cannot dance properly were the children of parents that does not know how to dance and those 

who can perform well are the children of parents that involves themselves in our cultural dance. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I was happy to hear the Minister declare in his speech last night that in the next festival, which will 

</span><span>be in two years’ time, the </span><span>schools in the Outer Islands will be part of the festival here on Rarotonga.  

The sad thing about this proposal is that I did not hear him say the schools in the Northern Group 

</span><span>will be part of this festival; he only mentioned the Southern Group islands’ sc</span><span>hool participation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I know there are a lot of our little children in Rakahanga that can dance well in this school festival.  

So, I encourage you Minister to ask the Members of Parliament at the next festival to fill the seats 

at the front allocated for us so the bowls of the schools will be full of donations. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is my Supplementary Question, but first I am happy to hear that the Minister of Infrastructure 

has changed because I am sure that going forward this project for Rakahanga will be actioned. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But I think the Minister has misquoted the speech from the throne because the paragraph he quoted, 

</span><span>this is the opening words, “we have funded.”  Meaning the project is done and we have done the 

</span><span>funding.  And after the quote, the examples of the Capital Investment project and it includes the 

</span><span>words, “have been developing in the past not in the future.</span></div>
<div><span>Maybe my interpretation of the Speech from the Throne is wrong but the way I see it is that the 

Government  is  commending  themselves  for  some  of  the  capital  investments  that  they  have 

completed in Rakahanga, something done already. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I also understand as mentioned of the many repairs required for the schools and the hospital.  But 

this is what I understand from the Speech from the Throne that there are some capital investment 

projects which I do not think, the answer must be, no!  But I am happy to hear that our Cyclone 

Centre will be build this term.
