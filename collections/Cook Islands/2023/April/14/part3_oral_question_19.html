<h3>Oral Question 19</h3>
<div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to everybody in the House today.  

Before I ask my question, I just wanted to briefly comment on the incentive for the reinstatement 

of  the  Community  Policing  program  on  Rarotonga.    I  just  wanted  to  acknowledge  the  former 

Member  of  Parliament  for  Titikaveka,  Selina  Napa,  for  requesting  the  above  incentive  for 

reinstatement.  I just wanted to say that this has been very productive, so thank you very much to 

the Government and especially to the Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is to the Prime Minister; sorry, you are in the firing line today.  I just wanted to know 

how much is the Departure Tax on the airline tickets that we are collecting because the last time I 

knew  was  either  $55  or  $60.    It  is  of  interest  to  the  public  and  I  may  have  a  Supplementary 

Question.  Thank You.
