<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have a question for the Minister of Agriculture.  I 

have two questions for the Prime Minister but because he is not present then I will wait for the 

next Sitting of Parliament.  This is a question to the Honourable Minister from the Members of 

Puaikura.  This is more a request from all the three Constituencies of Puaikura to you Honourable 

Minister, if you may please provide us a tractor.  I see that there are three tractors at the Ministry 

of Agriculture and implements to be used by the tractors are limited. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We, the people of Puaikura, would like to request you Minister for a tractor.  This request is from 

a hard-working individual, Mr Nat Unukua, if we can have a tractor for Puaikura to use.   

</span></div>
