<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON.  V.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  to  you  Honourable  Speaker  and  to  all  the  staff  of 

Parliament and greetings also to every Member of Parliament present here today.  I extend a very 

warm welcome to our people who are listening and watching to our Sitting today, greetings to you 

all. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To  the  Honourable  Member  of  Murienua,  the  Leader  of  the  Cook  Islands  United  Party  and 

Representative from Puaikura.  It is really hard for me to respond to the request that you have put 

forward  because  I  still  have  the  request  from  the  Honourable  Member  for  Matavera  and  other 

</span><span>Members of Parliament also.  And I have not been able to provide what has been requested by the 

other constituencies.  Can I just ask for you to wait as we in Agriculture try to investigate? 

</span></div>
<div><span>As has been requested by other constituencies even Nga-Pu-Toru who have requested a tractor for 

them, we will try our best and see as to how we can satisfy the needs of our people.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
