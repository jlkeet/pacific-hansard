<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, greetings to you Mr Speaker; a Speaker that I 

enjoy listening to in this House.  The purpose of my question reflects to the statement made earlier 

</span><span>about the Prime Ministerâ€™s portfolio being allocated to the Honourable Albert Nicholas, so my 

</span><span>question is for him. 

</span></div>
<div><span>May I say that the question that I am going to ask is a tough question.  The reason why I am saying 

this because there are a lot of our people asking about this matter.  This matter is in regards to the 

road in front of the school in Matavera. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I have some personal questions in regards to this because it is right next to the school.  The question 

to the Minister, what are your plans that you have proposed for the front road next to the Matavera 

School?  I wanted to bring to this House this matter because four people died in a motor vehicle 

accident on this road. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I wanted to ask for a clarification and explanation whether it is a good thing to install a speed bump 

on the road next to the school to slow down the traffic when they approach this section of our main 

road.  Further, if the Ministry have plans on their work for the purpose of protecting our children 

and people.
