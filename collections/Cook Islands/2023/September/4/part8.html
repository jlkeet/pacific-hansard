<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, greetings to you Mr Speaker; a Speaker that I 

enjoy listening to in this House.  The purpose of my question reflects to the statement made earlier 

</span><span>about the Prime Minister’s portfolio being allocated to the Honourable Albert Nicholas, so my 

</span><span>question is for him. 

</span></div><div><span>May I say that the question that I am going to ask is a tough question.  The reason why I am saying 

this because there are a lot of our people asking about this matter.  This matter is in regards to the 

road in front of the school in Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>I have some personal questions in regards to this because it is right next to the school.  The question 

to the Minister, what are your plans that you have proposed for the front road next to the Matavera 

School?  I wanted to bring to this House this matter because four people died in a motor vehicle 

accident on this road. 

</span></div><div><span>I wanted to ask for a clarification and explanation whether it is a good thing to install a speed bump 

on the road next to the school to slow down the traffic when they approach this section of our main 

road.  Further, if the Ministry have plans on their work for the purpose of protecting our children 

and people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert 

Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I answer the question, I would to say, 

</span><span>Kia Orana to you Honourable Speaker, Members of Parliament, staff of Parliament and our people 

listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>I was going to stand up and tell the Honourable Member that for his question I will respond to it 

tomorrow.    But  I  am  reminded  by  my  colleague  sitting  next  to  me  that  we  will  not  be  sitting 

</span><span>tomorrow, so I will try and answer your question now. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this road development work that has been carried out in front of the school, I would 

like to  remind  this House that the planning  and the construction of this road development  was 

</span><span>through the process of meeting with the PTA and the principal of the Matavera School.  During 

</span><span>the period of consultation in regards to this matter, I believe that all the members of the PTA of 

the Matavera School and all the teachers of the school agreed upon it.  But I would also like to 

remind this House that this road development was started before I came into this Ministerial Office.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 4 September 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fifth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The reason for the delay of this development work because the contractor was not prepared and 

ready to carry out the work.  It seems to me that the Member for Matavera is asking whether there 

will be a speed bump built on the road in front of the school.  I would like to inform and confirm 

with  him  that  the  speed  bump  was  not  in  the  proposed  road  development  program  agreed  and 

supported by the PTA and teachers of the Matavera School.  If we need to install a speed bump on 

this section of the road, maybe I ask that you investigate whether there will be a support by your 

village of the speed bump. 

</span></div><div><span>I am aware that there are many people who have laid their complaints in regards to this road work.  

What I have discovered that those people who are complaining, they do not have any background 

on  road  engineering  work.    One  of  these  people  is  a  Protocol  Officer,  another  is  an 

Environmentalist and these are Office Workers not used to open air service.  Another person makes 

</span><span>a  living  doing  people’s  lawn  mowing.    I  am  sure  that  was  has  been  planned  for  this</span><span>  road 

development  and  was  done  by  qualified  road  engineers.  What  has  been  designed  for  this 

development was not by the Prime Minister and I or the Minister before me; we did not do any of 

the planning.  It was designed by these qualified road engineers before it was taken to the PTA and 

the consultations with the Principal of Matavera School, before an agreement was made. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we need to understand that this has not been completed.  I believe, most of the marking 

will be completed by this afternoon in order to get a clear understanding how the bus depot will 

operate.   

</span></div><div><span>A question has been brought to my attention to why buses do not enter and exit the school grounds 

anymore, however, I believe that ICI had met with the Bus Company on this very topic which they 

have declined because it was affecting their timetable.  We need to understand that this bus is not 

a School Bus, it is a public Bus.  Therefore, this is the reason why this program came about. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, if there is a problem with the PTA and the School Principal regarding this program, 

ICI can easily terminate this project.  However, it was the PTA who proposed this and not the 

community members, and not because of these new Members of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I hope this is sufficient in response to your question Honourable Member.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.</span><span>I see the Honourable Member Robert Heather; 

you have the Floor.</span></div><div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you and greetings to you Mr Speaker and staff of this Parliament, 

Cabinet Ministers and all Members of this House, greetings to you all this afternoon.  I have a 

</span><span>short question for the Minister of CIIC. 

</span></div><div><span>In one of our past Sittings, I raised a problem concerning Arorangi School.  I believe an allocation 

have been made to renovate two classrooms for Arorangi School.  Since 2020 and up to this time, 

</span><span>no work has been done on these two classrooms.  We have no Parliament Sitting tomorrow so 

</span><span>maybe you can answer my question today.  What is the progress?  Will any work be done this year 

or not?

</span></div><div><span>Fifth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>Thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  for  Akaoa.    This  project,  the 

renovation of schools is not the responsibility of ICI but that of CIIC.  Right now, I do not know 

the  current  situation  and  where  the  project  is.    I  know  there  will  not  be  a  Parliament  Sitting 

tomorrow but I will find out what the current status is and where to and I will reach out to you 

personally. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Leader of the United Party; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have a question for the Minister of Agriculture.  I 

have two questions for the Prime Minister but because he is not present then I will wait for the 

next Sitting of Parliament.  This is a question to the Honourable Minister from the Members of 

Puaikura.  This is more a request from all the three Constituencies of Puaikura to you Honourable 

Minister, if you may please provide us a tractor.  I see that there are three tractors at the Ministry 

of Agriculture and implements to be used by the tractors are limited. 

</span></div><div><span>We, the people of Puaikura, would like to request you Minister for a tractor.  This request is from 

a hard-working individual, Mr Nat Unukua, if we can have a tractor for Puaikura to use.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honorable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister Rose Brown; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  to  you  Honourable  Speaker  and  to  all  the  staff  of 

Parliament and greetings also to every Member of Parliament present here today.  I extend a very 

warm welcome to our people who are listening and watching to our Sitting today, greetings to you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Honourable  Member  of  Murienua,  the  Leader  of  the  Cook  Islands  United  Party  and 

Representative from Puaikura.  It is really hard for me to respond to the request that you have put 

forward  because  I  still  have  the  request  from  the  Honourable  Member  for  Matavera  and  other 

</span><span>Members of Parliament also.  And I have not been able to provide what has been requested by the 

other constituencies.  Can I just ask for you to wait as we in Agriculture try to investigate? 

</span></div><div><span>As has been requested by other constituencies even Nga-Pu-Toru who have requested a tractor for 

them, we will try our best and see as to how we can satisfy the needs of our people.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is going to the Minister of Police or the 

</span><span>Minister of Justice, maybe the Associate Minister if you are able to reply to my question.  Before 

I ask the question, I have a short explanation.

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 4 September 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Fifth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>On 15</span><span>th</span><span> August 2023, the Cook Islands Newspaper reported, </span><span>“</span><span>Rarotonga is not safe.</span><span>”</span><span>  And then 

on 17</span><span>th</span><span> August, in the same newspaper, it was reported, that $6,000 were stolen from a visiting 

tourist.  In this matter, the High Commissioner of New Zealand was involved in assisting these 

visitors, especially those from New Zealand who were badly affected.  Mr Speaker, this is not a 

light matter but a serious matter for our country.  According to our newspaper, over $6,000 were 

stolen from our visitors between the period of 15</span><span>th</span><span> to 17</span><span>th</span><span> August 2023 and this report was from 

the police. 

</span></div><div><span>The purpose of my question is to find out if we have any other means to protect our visitors to our 

country.  In the newspaper article, one of those affected by their money being stolen quoted</span><span>, “I 

</span><span>love goi</span><span>ng to the Cook Islands, however this is bad.”  This is the problem</span><span> that many of our visitors 

are being faced with. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, that is my question and I will wait for any of you Ministers for your answers. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Tingika Elikana and 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and also thank you to the Honourable Member for 

Matavera for the question raised.  I think we all agree that each person is responsible for the safety 

of his own belongings and it is imperative on us individually to ensure the safety of our belongings 

and it does not matter where you go, be in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, we all 

have to take that responsibility seriously. 

</span></div><div><span>I am sure if the Member had read the full article, the police issued a warning towards the end of 

that article advising visitors to secure their accommodations, even when they are sleeping.  The 

same advice was given for our locals as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Of  concern  however,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is  the  way  the  matter  was  reported  in  the  newspaper.  

Particularly,  when  it  was  inferred  that  it  was  a  robbery  and  right  through  the  newspaper  it 

interchanges with burglaries.  If I refer to the opening statement, </span><span>“a Kiwi family w</span><span>ho arrived on 

Rarotonga  for  holiday  were  robbed  of  their  ca</span><span>sh,  passports  and  other  items.”    </span><span>Robbery,  Mr 

Speaker, implies some form of violence but when you read the whole story, there was no violence 

</span><span>presented against the families or the visitors involved.   I think, Mr Speaker, those who reports 

these issues need to do so in an accurate manner.  If it is a robbery, call it a robbery; if it is  a 

burglary, call it a burglary; if it is a theft, call it a theft.</span></div><div><span>Do not try and paint a picture just for the sake of selling the newspaper, you say it in a more serious 

</span><span>tone.  As my colleague from Matavera had stated, we rely on tourism and we need to look after 

our visitors and we need to show them the Cook Islands way of life and that also is a responsibility 

of those who write in public forums and news platforms like the newspaper, to ensure everything 

is accurate. 

</span></div><div><span>The demise that these visitors have experienced should not be used as a source for the sake of 

selling newspapers.  Thank you Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Fifth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member Tingika Elikana.  I see the Honourable Member 

Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I see we still have time for questions.  My question goes 

to the Minister for Cultural Development.  As we know, someone has been appointed as an Interim 

Head of Ministry for Cultural Development, until someone is appointed to permanently fill the 

position.  Is the Minister happy about this arrangement? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you to the Member for Matavera for the question.  The question is 

whether I am pleased with the appointment of the new interim Head for this Ministry.  The simple 

answer is, it is not for my own satisfaction, but for the satisfaction of the staff with a new leader 

for a short period of four months.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Members, we have come to the end of our  Question 

Time.
