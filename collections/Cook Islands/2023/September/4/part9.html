<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Land (Facilitation of Dealings) Amendment Bill 2023 Second Reading.   

</span></div><div><span>I call the Honourable Tina Browne for the Second Reading of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  With your indulgence, Mr Speaker and 

before I move for the Second Reading of the Bill, I would like to briefly explain that the Bill aims 

to align the original Act with the present-day definition of </span><span>“</span><span>owners</span><span>”</span><span>as set out in the Member’s 

</span><span>Bill to amend the Cook Islands Act 1915.  This Amendment ensures congruency and reduces any 

legal ambiguities between these Acts, notably the Bill includes a retrospective clause, meaning all 

past decisions under the Act will be considered using the new definitions, ensuring uniformity and 

legal accuracy. 

</span></div><div><span>With those said Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Land (Facilitation of Dealings) Amendment Bill 2023 be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Tina Browne.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, before I offer my support for the Motion, if I could just offer 

my  support  for  the  Bill  in  its  current  form  and  as  the  Honourable  Member  for  Rakahanga  has 

</span><span>alluded to, it goes hand in hand with the previous one that we have sent to the Bills Committee 

which is the Amendment to the Cook Islands Act 1915.  I understand there will be a further Motion 

for the same Bill to be referred to that Committee for it to be taken into public consultation.  On 

those basis, Mr Speaker I second the Motion for a Second Reading of this Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>417
