<h3>Oral Question 17</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I see we still have time for questions.  My question goes 

to the Minister for Cultural Development.  As we know, someone has been appointed as an Interim 

Head of Ministry for Cultural Development, until someone is appointed to permanently fill the 

position.  Is the Minister happy about this arrangement?
