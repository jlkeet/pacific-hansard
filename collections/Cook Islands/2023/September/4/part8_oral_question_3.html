<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I answer the question, I would to say, 

</span><span>Kia Orana to you Honourable Speaker, Members of Parliament, staff of Parliament and our people 

listening in. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I was going to stand up and tell the Honourable Member that for his question I will respond to it 

tomorrow.    But  I  am  reminded  by  my  colleague  sitting  next  to  me  that  we  will  not  be  sitting 

</span><span>tomorrow, so I will try and answer your question now. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, this road development work that has been carried out in front of the school, I would 

like to  remind  this House that the planning  and the construction of this road development  was 

</span><span>through the process of meeting with the PTA and the principal of the Matavera School.  During 

</span><span>the period of consultation in regards to this matter, I believe that all the members of the PTA of 

the Matavera School and all the teachers of the school agreed upon it.  But I would also like to 

remind this House that this road development was started before I came into this Ministerial Office.

</span></div>
<div><span>Fifth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>The reason for the delay of this development work because the contractor was not prepared and 

ready to carry out the work.  It seems to me that the Member for Matavera is asking whether there 

will be a speed bump built on the road in front of the school.  I would like to inform and confirm 

with  him  that  the  speed  bump  was  not  in  the  proposed  road  development  program  agreed  and 

supported by the PTA and teachers of the Matavera School.  If we need to install a speed bump on 

this section of the road, maybe I ask that you investigate whether there will be a support by your 

village of the speed bump. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I am aware that there are many people who have laid their complaints in regards to this road work.  

What I have discovered that those people who are complaining, they do not have any background 

on  road  engineering  work.    One  of  these  people  is  a  Protocol  Officer,  another  is  an 

Environmentalist and these are Office Workers not used to open air service.  Another person makes 

</span><span>a  living  doing  peopleâ€™s  lawn  mowing.    I  am  sure  that  was  has  been  planned  for  this</span><span>  road 

development  and  was  done  by  qualified  road  engineers.  What  has  been  designed  for  this 

development was not by the Prime Minister and I or the Minister before me; we did not do any of 

the planning.  It was designed by these qualified road engineers before it was taken to the PTA and 

the consultations with the Principal of Matavera School, before an agreement was made. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, we need to understand that this has not been completed.  I believe, most of the marking 

will be completed by this afternoon in order to get a clear understanding how the bus depot will 

operate.   

</span></div>
<div><span>A question has been brought to my attention to why buses do not enter and exit the school grounds 

anymore, however, I believe that ICI had met with the Bus Company on this very topic which they 

have declined because it was affecting their timetable.  We need to understand that this bus is not 

a School Bus, it is a public Bus.  Therefore, this is the reason why this program came about. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, if there is a problem with the PTA and the School Principal regarding this program, 

ICI can easily terminate this project.  However, it was the PTA who proposed this and not the 

community members, and not because of these new Members of Parliament. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I hope this is sufficient in response to your question Honourable Member.  Thank you.
