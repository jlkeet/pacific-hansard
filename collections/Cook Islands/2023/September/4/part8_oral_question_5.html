<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MR R. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you and greetings to you Mr Speaker and staff of this Parliament, 

Cabinet Ministers and all Members of this House, greetings to you all this afternoon.  I have a 

</span><span>short question for the Minister of CIIC. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In one of our past Sittings, I raised a problem concerning Arorangi School.  I believe an allocation 

have been made to renovate two classrooms for Arorangi School.  Since 2020 and up to this time, 

</span><span>no work has been done on these two classrooms.  We have no Parliament Sitting tomorrow so 

</span><span>maybe you can answer my question today.  What is the progress?  Will any work be done this year 

or not?
