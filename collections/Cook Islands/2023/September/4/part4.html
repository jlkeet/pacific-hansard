<div><span>PRESENTATION OF BILLS 

</span></div><div><span>Our  Bill  for  presentation  is  the  Land  (Facilitation  of  Dealings)  Amendment  Bill  2023.    My 

</span><span>apologies, I did not see you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  ELIKANA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Since  you  alluded  to  the  absence  of  the  Prime 

</span><span>Minister from this Parliament Sitting, I thought to rise and seek leave of absence on his behalf as 

he is currently in Indonesia representing the Pacific Islands Forum at the ASEAN Summit and 

</span><span>from there he will then travel to America for the United Nations General Assembly meeting and 

</span><span>followed by the Pacific Leaders and US Summit and also in the United State.   

</span></div><div><span>So, he will not be present during this Session of our Parliament  Sitting and so, I seek leave of 

absence on behalf of the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Leave accepted.  Honourable Member, can 

you confirm and advise the Chamber who is the second in charge? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Maybe because you see me standing, you probably </span><span>thinkâ€¦</span><span>(laughter).</span><span>  We 

have all the portfolios of the Prime Minister delegated to the Honourable Albert Nicholas, Minister 

for ICI. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and congratulations to the Honourable Minister 

Albert Nicholas.
