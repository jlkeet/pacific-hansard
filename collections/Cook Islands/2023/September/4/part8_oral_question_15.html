<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and also thank you to the Honourable Member for 

Matavera for the question raised.  I think we all agree that each person is responsible for the safety 

of his own belongings and it is imperative on us individually to ensure the safety of our belongings 

and it does not matter where you go, be in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, we all 

have to take that responsibility seriously. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I am sure if the Member had read the full article, the police issued a warning towards the end of 

that article advising visitors to secure their accommodations, even when they are sleeping.  The 

same advice was given for our locals as well. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Of  concern  however,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is  the  way  the  matter  was  reported  in  the  newspaper.  

Particularly,  when  it  was  inferred  that  it  was  a  robbery  and  right  through  the  newspaper  it 

interchanges with burglaries.  If I refer to the opening statement, </span><span>“a Kiwi family w</span><span>ho arrived on 

Rarotonga  for  holiday  were  robbed  of  their  ca</span><span>sh,  passports  and  other  items.”    </span><span>Robbery,  Mr 

Speaker, implies some form of violence but when you read the whole story, there was no violence 

</span><span>presented against the families or the visitors involved.   I think, Mr Speaker, those who reports 

these issues need to do so in an accurate manner.  If it is a robbery, call it a robbery; if it is  a 

burglary, call it a burglary; if it is a theft, call it a theft.</span></div>
<div><span>Do not try and paint a picture just for the sake of selling the newspaper, you say it in a more serious 

</span><span>tone.  As my colleague from Matavera had stated, we rely on tourism and we need to look after 

our visitors and we need to show them the Cook Islands way of life and that also is a responsibility 

of those who write in public forums and news platforms like the newspaper, to ensure everything 

is accurate. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The demise that these visitors have experienced should not be used as a source for the sake of 

selling newspapers.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
