<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is going to the Minister of Police or the 

</span><span>Minister of Justice, maybe the Associate Minister if you are able to reply to my question.  Before 

I ask the question, I have a short explanation.

<div><span>Fifth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>On 15</span><span>th</span><span> August 2023, the Cook Islands Newspaper reported, </span><span>“</span><span>Rarotonga is not safe.</span><span>”</span><span>  And then 

on 17</span><span>th</span><span> August, in the same newspaper, it was reported, that $6,000 were stolen from a visiting 

tourist.  In this matter, the High Commissioner of New Zealand was involved in assisting these 

visitors, especially those from New Zealand who were badly affected.  Mr Speaker, this is not a 

light matter but a serious matter for our country.  According to our newspaper, over $6,000 were 

stolen from our visitors between the period of 15</span><span>th</span><span> to 17</span><span>th</span><span> August 2023 and this report was from 

the police. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The purpose of my question is to find out if we have any other means to protect our visitors to our 

country.  In the newspaper article, one of those affected by their money being stolen quoted</span><span>, “I 

</span><span>love goi</span><span>ng to the Cook Islands, however this is bad.”  This is the problem</span><span> that many of our visitors 

are being faced with. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, that is my question and I will wait for any of you Ministers for your answers.
