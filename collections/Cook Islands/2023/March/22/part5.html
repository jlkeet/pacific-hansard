</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 22 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Today,  Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  provide  a  Ministerial  Statement  regarding  the  passing  of  her  late 

Majesty  Queen  Elizabeth  II.    This  is  the  first  occasion  for  this  Parliament  to  acknowledge  the 

passing of our former Head of State.  Her late Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II was our Queen and the 

Head of State of the Cook Islands.  And we, her people of the Cook Islands, mourned her passing 

when she left this world in September last year. 

</span></div><div><span>I was fortunate enough to be able to represent our country and attend her funeral.  And I shared 

with King Charles and the members of the Royal family that all of our people had deep admiration 

and respect for his Mother.   

</span></div><div><span>Her  Majesty  left  behind  an  enormous  legacy  of  dedicated  service  to  her  subjects,  including 

ourselves  and  around  the  world.    Her  reign  spanned  7  decades  and  saw  her  appoint  15  British 

Prime Ministers during her tenure as Queen.  As world leaders came and went, she endured and 

served her people. 

</span></div><div><span>As the world changed around her, she endured and provided the strength and constancy for her 

people.  Queen Elizabeth visited the Cook Islands in 1974 to open our international airport. 

</span></div><div><span>Next year, 2024, we will celebrate the 50 year anniversary of the opening of our airport and an 

invitation has gone out to the new King, King Charles, to personally attend as we will re-enact the 

momentous occasion when his Mother opened our airport 50 years ago. 

</span></div><div><span>And while her country may have lost a Queen, the world has lost a truly towering figure.  She will 

always be remembered with the utmost respect and fondness. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana and Kia Manuia. 

</span></div><div><span>I lay this Statement before this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I call the Leader of the Opposition and 

</span><span>the leaders of the United Cook Islands Party, One Cook Islands, to comment on the Ministerial 

Statement.  If not, we will move to the next business of the day. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  we  go  on,  the  leaders  of  each  of  the  Opposition  Party  designates  may  comment  on  the 

Statement for five minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tina Brown; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 22 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWN:</span><span>    Honourable  Speaker,  your  staff,  Honourable  Ministers  of  the 

Government and supporters of the Cook Islands Party, our supporters from the Democratic Party 

and the United Party and One Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  I want to congratulate the organizers of the Ceremonial Opening of the Parliament this 

morning, well done.  This is the first time I have attended a Ceremonial Opening and it was quite 

an experience. 

</span></div><div><span>While  we  were  sitting  in  the  Auditorium.  I  could  see  that  a  lot  of  our  people  were  fanning 

themselves as it was hot.  Maybe next time, if we have the cash, put some air condition in so we 

do not feel the heat. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand to support the Ministerial Statement that was given by the Honourable Prime Minister about 

the passing away of our late Queen.  I do not want to tell you what I know but I want to say that 

we women know that there are programmes and documentaries on Queen Elizabeth and Princess 

Margaret  and  also  about  the  Coronation  of  the  Queen,  Her  marriage.    All  this  is  shown  on 

television.   

</span></div><div><span>These documentaries are factual and it showed us the character of this Queen from the time her 

Father passed away until she assumed the role as Queen Elizabeth. 

</span></div><div><span>There were two things I learnt from her and maybe we in this House can look at this and be an 

example for us because yesterday, we took the Oath that we will do our work to the best of our 

ability.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  I  learnt  of  her  dedication  to  her  role  as  Queen.    This  means  that  even  though  she  was 

married, her people was her first priority and family came next.  That is what I gathered from these 

documentaries. 

</span></div><div><span>I can also see that she was trained for this role from a very young age and when it was time to 

</span><span>assume the role, because she became Queen as a result of the sudden passing of her Father.  They 

did not expect her Father to pass away suddenly. 

</span></div><div><span>For me, I had the opportunity to actually meet with her and shake hands with her when Sir Pupuke 

was given his Knighthood.  Even though it was a very short experience, it was an honour to have 

</span><span>met her.  In God’s leadin</span><span>g, she lived a very long life.  On that note, we from this side of the House 

would like to support the Ministerial Statement from the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Toanui 

Isamaela; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 22 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker and staff of this House, greetings to you all.  Kia Orana to the 

Honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and Members of the Government, greetings.   

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to the Opposition side, the different parties that we represent, greetings to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>There  is  a  saying  that  we  have  eaten  very  rich  food  and  what  have  been  spoken  by  the  Prime 

Minister before this House is so precious and so good to hear.   

</span></div><div><span>It is so true with the Statements that he has given that this woman has been a Head for our country, 

especially for this House.  It is so rightful of what he had commented about our Head of State.  He 

did not just remained in speaking about Queen Elizabeth but he continued to mention about King 

Charles.  King Charles will have to see what his Mother have done in leading her country and for 

him to learn. 

</span></div><div><span>We have heard the Statement made by the Honourable Prime Minister in inviting King Charles to 

be here to commemorate the 50</span><span>th</span><span> Anniversary of the opening of our airport, so it will be fitting if 

we can invite him to join with us.  That is the reason why I rise to give my support to the Statement 

given by the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Robert Heather;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  R.  HEATHER:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  staff.    Kia  Orana  to  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister and Cabinet Ministers and your supporters of the Party.  Kia Orana to the Opposition 

side. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  heard  the  responses  from  those  who  spoke  before  me  and  I  strongly  support  their 

</span><span>concepts.    I  really  wanted  to  comment  on  today’s  Speech  but  then  when  it  got  to  the  part  for 

</span><span>COVID-19,  I  started  to  get  hot  and  I  ignored  listening  to  the  Speech.    But  if  I  am  given  the 

</span><span>opportunity tomorrow to speak on it, I can make further comments to the Speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member Robert Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>Now we move to  the  establishment of Parliamentary Committees of the  18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament of the 

Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Pursuant to a Standing Order 113, I move:
