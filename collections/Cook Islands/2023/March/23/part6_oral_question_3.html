<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Member of Matavera and thank 

you for your question and maybe this is the time we need to explain to our people on this tight 

situation between our government and Air New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I see the problem is between a Company and our tax department on the matter, RMD.  This is not 

an issue of our country with Air New Zealand; it is a tax matter.

</span></div>
<div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>This means, the RMD considers this Company in this way: if you are a business company in the 

country trying to make revenue, then the law of the country or the Tax Revenue Act is applicable 

to your company.  Especially, Mr Speaker, when the government provides a subsidy to Air New 

Zealand and in that subsidy there is a provision for a profit by the Company.  It is only fair that 

that profit pay tax like all other companies pay taxes to the country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The RMD did collect tax from Air New Zealand but Air New Zealand disputed this in court.  The 

argument  being  that  under  international  airline  conventions,  countries  do  not  tax  each  other 

airlines.  It is a reciprocal arrangement where countries will not tax the airlines that operates in 

their  country  and  in  response,  those  countries  will  not  tax  your  airline  that  operates  in  their 

countries. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, as airlines operates in different countries around the world, they generally pay their tax in their 

home country.  But because we do not have an international airline, this benefit only goes one way.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The matter really came up when we started to subside Air New Zealand’s flights into our coun</span><span>try 

with the component of profit that was part of the subsidy.  So, this profit is calculated and paid 

into the New Zealand tax collector.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The outcome of the court’s decision was that they supported the application by Air New Zealand; 

</span><span>that Air New Zealand should not pay their tax due here in the Cook Islands regardless of the profit 

that we provide them, but that they should pay their tax in New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And the end result is, Mr Speaker that the tax department, our RMD here as they have done with 

other companies and other businesses are required now to make a refund back to Air New Zealand, 

because it is a tax matter.  There are matters of confidentiality involved but needless to say that 

matter has now been resolved in the courts and the RMD have been required to provide the refund 

to Air New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, a word of congratulations to you from this side of the House 

for being reappointed as Speaker for the Parliament of the Cook Islands.  Of course, to all Parties, 

</span><span>the Cook Islands Party, the Democratic Party, Once Cook Islands and likewise, the Cook Islands 

</span><span>United Party.

<div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>Congratulations also to the Clerk, Deputy Clerk and Chamber Clerk and the rest of the staff of 

Parliament. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our Scripture Reading by our Chaplain this afternoon, I truly support.  And of course, the obituary 

announcements  by  the  Speaker,  I  have  one  included  but  not  only  one,  but  many  for  this  year, 

especially with our people here and those abroad, since January. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One  cornerstone  that  was  made  in  history,  but  before  that,  I  would  like  to  convey  my  deepest 

condolences to the family of the late Mr Jack William Rotter.  In the year 1988, the first private 

quarry  was  established  and  was  established  by  T&amp;M  Heather  Ltd.    This  gentleman,  this  great 

friend, has been a cornerstone for this country for over 34 years and was supported by his family 

from New Zealand.  He served our country very well.  Mr Speaker and Honourable Member, if I 

</span><span>may, I would like to ask for God’s blessings on behalf of this Honourable House for Mr Rotter and 

</span><span>his family. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I was quite fortunate to be in New Zealand to bid farewell to this great friend when he passed away 

on 18</span><span>th</span><span> February. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I have a Supplementary Question to the Honourable Prime Minister.  As a saying 

</span><span>goes in Mangaian language, “</span><span>great minds think alike</span><span>.</span><span>”</span><span>  Mr Speaker, my Supplementary Question 

is regarding about the taxed-free flight with Air New Zealand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  last  year,  on  the  5</span><span>th</span><span>  of  August  2022,  $5.4  million  were  credited  back  to  Air  New 

Zealand as stated by the Honourable Prime Minister.  Therefore, my question is, whose mistake is 

this?  Could this refund be a mistake?  As indicated by the Honourable Prime Minister, could this 

$5.4 million be a mistake made by the IRD Ministry and not by the Government?  During COVID-

19 Mr Speaker, of course credit to our Prime Minister and Government for their immediate actions, 

but my question is, this $5.4 million of refund, is this borrowed money where we have to pay it 

back? 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Honourable Member for Matavera did  indicate, but  as indicated by  the Honourable Prime 

Minister,  the  matter  has  now  been  closed  by  the  Court.    But  my  question  Honourable  Prime 

Minister is, because this $5.4 million is quite costly, therefore, this mistake should be addressed 

with IRD because it would affect the tax payers of this country as they would be the ones liable 

for paying this back.  Again, my Supplementary Question is, is this the final payment or is there 

more that we have to pay?  Can the Honourable Prime Minister please elaborate? 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat Mr Speaker, I would like to seek leave of the whole House for today to attend 

</span><span>to a personal matter that is very important.
