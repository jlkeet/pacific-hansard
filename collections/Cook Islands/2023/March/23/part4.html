</span></div><div><span>Regarding: Solar Lights. 

</span></div><div><span>On behalf of Rarotonga Bowling Club Executive and all the members, I would like to extend to 

</span><span>you our very sincere appreciation to the Honourable George Angene for the gift of 20 solar lights 

presented to the Rarotonga Bowling to assist the Club with lighting their bowling green.   

</span></div><div><span>Most  times, our  games  go into the night and these lights  will  ensure games can be  completed.  

These gifts came at the right time as the Club is looking for funding to replace our aging lights 

and power poles.

</span><span>and they are now working and lighting our bowling green in the evenings since Friday the 18</span><span>th</span><span> of 

March 2023.
