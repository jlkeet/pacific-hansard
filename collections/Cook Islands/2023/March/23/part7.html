</span></div><div><span>The Address in Reply to His Excellency’s Speech.  I call the Leader of the House to move a Motion 

for Respectful Address in Reply to His Excellency’s Speech.</span></div><div><span>MR T. TANGATAPOTO:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That a respectful Address be presented to His Excellency  

</span><span>in reply to His Excellency’s Speech</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the House.   

</span></div><div><span>I call for a Seconder?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor to Honourable Members who wish to speak.  I recognize the Honourable 

Prime Minister, Honourable Mark Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before we begin our responses with replies to the 

Speech from the Throne, I rise to respectfully request leave of absence for Minister George Angene 

to attend to some urgent business. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Request  approved.    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  see  the 

Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Yesterday, we did the appointment of 

Committees and the names of the Committees were read out and adopted.  Today, there has been 

discussions with our Party about some Members who should be on the Committees but were not 

put on the Committees. 

</span></div><div><span>For us the Democratic Party, there are two Committees that are affected.  The first is in respect of 

the  Business  Committee,  we  have  agreed  that  Wesley  Kareroa  be  stood  down  in  place  of  Toa 

</span><span>Isamaela.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, in respect of the Privileges Committee, we have agreed that Vaitoti Tupa step down and 

be replaced by Wesley Kareroa.  We made these changes in Parliament Mr Speaker because it is 

our understanding that the Committees must be appointed by Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti 

Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Before my Reply to the Speech from the Throne, I wish to say a few words.  With 

your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to address my Constituency.  I would also like to ask 

the Chair that when I speak in our Maori language, for the Interpreters not to interpret my speech, 

to leave as it is. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, I request has been declined and we will continue with our 

interpretation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Greetings to us all in the Name of our Heavenly Father.  First of all, I thank God 

for the opportunity to serve in this Parliament House again.  Therefore, Kia Orana to all of my 

people  in  Matavera.    To  all  the  following  Churches  in  Matavera,  Holy  Spirit  Revival  Church, 

Sacred Heart Parish Catholic Church, Matavera SDA Church, Matavera CICC and the Cornerstone 

Friends Mission Church. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Can I call the Honourable…?</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Before we move on, it is just a matter of process because we have proposals 

for  changes  to  the  Committee  Members  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    She  is  also  correct 

because Parliament as a whole should agree on such changes.  I would like to stand on behalf of 

the Government in support of those changes.  That is the only reason why I stood up to offer my 

support for the proposed changes.  

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member of Parliament of Matavera may continue with his reply.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Thank you for interrupting the Honourable 

Vaitoti Tupa; you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>To all the Honourable Members in the past who have been Members of Parliament 

for Matavera, thank you.  To the people of my constituency, on behalf of myself, my wife and my 

family, we greet you all.

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank the Committee of Matavera and those responsible in cleaning our village, 

I salute you.  To our agricultural individuals and fishermen, may God continue to give you strength 

with your outstanding work serving our people. 

</span></div><div><span>To the many small businesses in Matavera, thank you for your work and thank you for what you 

do in our community. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  may  I  also  include  our  European  friends  and  families  from  Fiji,  Samoa,  Tonga, 

Kiribati, Indonesia and the Philippines, including our Permanent Residents currently residing in 

Matavera, please join us and let us work together to achieve the many programmes planned for 

our village. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would also like to thank my Committee Members of Matavera.  Chairman Papa 

Tanga Tairea, Campaign Manager Tereora Ngamata and Liz Obeda and all Committee Members 

who have supported and helped me, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would also like to acknowledge our referral patients to New Zealand, their families 

and everyone else. 

</span></div><div><span>May I also convey Mr Speaker, the 16 families who have lost their loved ones since the beginning 

</span><span>of this year, my condolences to them and I pray for God’s peace, guidance and comfort for them 

</span><span>all. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings also to our young people especially those who have gone overseas for further studies, 

Kia Orana to you all and best wishes with your studies. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would also like to thank my wife, Tauepa Tupa, who is very special and very dear 

to me.  I thank her for her support in what I do.  To my children and my families, thank you for 

your support. 

</span></div><div><span>May I also Mr Speaker acknowledge our daughter, Maneuneu Te Kare o te Moana.  I am very 

excited and am very happy to say that she graduated with her Law degree last year in April, and 

she is now pursuing her Marsters Degree in Law. 

</span></div><div><span>In saying that Mr Speaker, again, thank you to everyone for their support and for trusting in me to 

become their Member of Parliament.  This is what I want to share to everyone for this year 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, I would like to convey all of what has been spoken and for the support of 

</span><span>all these people of Rangiatea that have supported me to be their representative in this House.  This 

is what I have chosen as a word of encouragement for this year of 2023.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The Bible states, Matthew 20:28, </span><span>“Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but</span><span> to 

</span><span>minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”</span></div><div><span>That ends my speech to my Constituency.  Reverting back to what is being tabled today, the Reply 

to the Speech from the Throne. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, this is the reason why everything must be interpreted, so 

people  can  understand  what  you  are  saying,  like  the  Europeans,  the  Filipino  and  other  ethnic 

groups of people residing in you Constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Yes Mr Speaker, I have accepted your reasons of declining my request. 

</span></div><div><span>First  thing  Mr  Speaker,  my  thanks  to  the  government  of  the  day  for  their  work  that  was  seen 

</span><span>through the Speech delivered by the King’s Representative.</span></div><div><span>At the end of the Speech, it stated that part of the work has been done by the government, but still, 

many other things are being left out. 

</span></div><div><span>There are two things that I wish to highlight Mr Speaker that were not mentioned in the Speech.  

First of all, our Cook Island Maori language.  I have a question to the Minister Responsible for 

Education  that  there  seems  to  be  difference  with  our  language  spoken  in  the  Northern  Group 

Islands compared to the Southern Group. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to propose to the Minister Responsible for Education to boost and to increase courses 

for  our  language  and  to  incorporate  both  the  Northern  and  Southern  Group  languages  because 

currently, we can see some hindrances that are affecting our Maori language courses.  I propose 

for this to be included into the Maori Curriculum within our Education system and for this to start 

from our Preschool level to Tertiary level.   

</span></div><div><span>I can see some difficulties surrounding our Maori language that requires strengthening.  

</span></div><div><span>Speaking  the  Maori  language  are  taught  at  third  levels  in  our  Education  system.    This  is  a 

University level Mr Speaker!  Why is our language left to be taught at that level? 

</span></div><div><span>This is the reason why I wanted to raise this issue before you Mr Speaker, it is because such dialects 

are spoken all over the Cook Islands and nothing gets done when it comes to learning those dialects 

</span><span>until you enrol into Universities, then you start learning them.  Our language should be learnt from 

</span><span>a younger age until we get old. 

</span></div><div><span>34 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My second point that I would like to speak on Mr Speaker is the House of Ariki.  Although this is 

not mentioned in this Report, I understand that they are administered by the Ministry of Cultural 

Development, but can the government establish a Ministry Department for the House of Ariki?  

And can they be given their own budget?  We will be celebrating the arrival of Christianity and let 

me rephrase this, it was our House of Ariki who had brought us thus far. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, Part 9 of the Constitution states the “Functions of House of Ariki.”  Sub</span><span>-clause (a) 

states, </span><span>“It shall consider such matters relative to the welfare of the people of the Cook Islands as 

</span><span>m</span><span>ay be submitted to it by [Parliament] for its consideration…”</span></div><div><span>This  is  the  reason  why  I  am  suggesting  for  this  Ministry  to  be  established,  in  hope  to  help 

encourage and to be acknowledged. 

</span></div><div><span>My third point Mr Speaker is regarding the infrastructure of the Cook Islands.  I would like to 

acknowledge some Members of Parliament for their support in  this space.  To the Honourable 

Robert Tapaitau, Honourable George Angene, Honourable Vaine Mokoroa and the Honourable 

Prime Minister, Mark Brown.  Not forgetting my dear friend, the Honourable Sonny Williams.  

When he was working for ICI, and that was the time when I became Member of Parliament, we 

had no allocations in the improvement of our roads in Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>From  2016-18,  we  had  no  allocations  for  improving  the  roads  of  Rarotonga.    Not  even  to  the 

different villages.  Hence why I want to personally thank these Members for their support. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the purpose of this project is to help Matavera with their roads because the surface 

was so rough and full of potholes; hence the allocation. 

</span></div><div><span>I also recall Mr Speaker when the project was proposed, we hoped for the extension to include the 

Constituency of Ngatangiia.  Now that we have a new Member of Parliament for Ngatangiia, the 

road has been sealed already.   

</span></div><div><span>Right now Mr Speaker, I would like to turn my attention to the new Minister for ICI for assistance 

because I know him.  He is known as a person who would assist anyone regardless of their political 

party.  This is why I like talking about this Minister because he has a heart that is equally the same 

as the Honourable Robert Tapaitau.  But thank you for everything you have done for Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>My fourth point Mr Speaker is Climate Change.  I wish to remind this House that this is an ongoing 

issue for our country because we have seen cyclones in the past, cyclone that struck Manuhiri and 

</span><span>not forgetting the cyclone that made damages to Aitutaki as well as five cyclones in 2005 which 

</span><span>caused damages to the island of Rarotonga.  Mr Speaker, I support the proposal for improvement 

</span></div><div><span>35 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>for Climate Change, especially with the EMCI department who plays a big role for both the Outer 

Islands and us here on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, I support the 

comment made earlier in order to enable these two entities to give the nation assistance in cutting 

down on our loans.  I support the idea as stated in the Report for support with our loan burdens 

through these two offshore entities. 

</span></div><div><span>I would now like to comment on the Green Climate Fund which is already established under the 

current  government.    I  would  like  to  support  the  allocation  of  funding  for  this.    My  plea  to 

</span><span>government is on the application procedurals for this funding, especially for us Cook Islander’s in 

</span><span>sourcing this funding in terms of simplifying the application process to access this fund.  I know 

our people have difficulties with the English language because it is our second language.  I am 

saying this Mr Speaker because I have assisted some of our people in filling the applications.  I 

can confirm I have assisted eight people regarding their application forms.  I know out of that six 

had  their  applications  granted  and  two  were  not  successful  irrespective  that  you  have  to  pay 

something back.   

</span></div><div><span>This is my plea to government to make it easier for our people in applying for the fund.  I am not 

sure why the other twos applications were not granted although I assisted everyone the same across 

the board, maybe there were reasons unknown to me why the other two did not get the approval. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before my time is up, I would like to touch on the Seabed Minerals.  I support this 

</span><span>area Mr Speaker, especially on the researches…</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, your time is up.  I am sure the two that did not get approval 

are Members from the CIP.  I see the Honourable Member Tukaka Ama, Member of Parliament 

for Ngatangiia.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. AMA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker and staff of this Honourable House, Kia Orana.  I stand in reference 

</span><span>to what the Honourable Tupa has spoken and I will be calm and not yell out like him.  I humbly 

rise  to  deliver  my  maiden  speech  in  this  Honourable  House.    I  believe  we  have  done  enough 

greetings and well wishes in the House for today as we have been doing it since Tuesday and not 

forgetting the meals we have had.  Therefore, I want to spend my time in acknowledging my people 

in Ngatangiia. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to the Prime Minister Mark Brown and our side and Kia Orana to the Leader of the 

</span><span>Op</span><span>position and your side.  I recall one of Papa George Tamariki’s songs which depicts Ngatangiia 

</span><span>as </span><span>“a famed village from beyond times”.</span></div><div><span>36

</span></div><div><span>At this moment, I would like to convey a hearty thankful to my Committee Chairman, Ina Tararo, 

also known as Mr Wong, Secretary, Treasurer and all Committee Members who gave all your time 

and support from the election period to this day.  We have worked together for a long time with 

no rewards and today, we are rewarded by being Representatives in this House. I would also like 

to acknowledge my dear wife, our children, all my children, my families who stood by me with 

your support during this race.  A special thank you to the people of Ngatangiia extending from 

Teraoia to Tauaroa for believing in me and for  your corporation  for me to be  your Member to 

speak on your behalf in this House.  To all of you that believed in me, I can assure you that I will 

do my very best of what you require me to do. 

</span></div><div><span>To our two Chiefs in Ngatangiia, Pa Ariki and Kainuku Ariki and your tribes, thank you for your 

support and thank you for trusting in me to be your Member of Parliament for our Constituency 

so that I may be able to help support our culture and traditions.  I would also like to help reinforce 

some rights to our Traditional Leaders for them to be able to protect our people with their land 

issues.

of the Cook Islands Christian Church, Kia Orana to you.  To the Church of Latter Day Saints, to

</span><span>forth, greetings to you all.  To your Managers and people in charge, greetings to you all.  It is my 

intention to speak at this time to show my support for you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To our crop planters and our fishermen, greetings to you all in the Name of our Lord.  I will do my 

very best to help in whatever I can for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>To our elderly people, those who are ill, those who have lost their loved ones, greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To those seeking help, my door is always open and you know my phone number, please feel free 

to contact me.

changes for the Committee Members to be appointed. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, may I have this opportunity to address my Constituency?  I will not take long like the 

Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa.  If I had known he would be that long, I would have given him 

10 minutes of my time.  Like what the Member for Ngatangiia have said, our voices are not like 

the Member for Matavera. 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to you all.  Psalms 119:105 states, </span><span>“Thy word is a lamp unto</span><span> my feet, and a light unto

</span></div><div><span>To our elderlies and to  our little children that beautifies  you Puaikura, greetings to  you all and 

thank you for everything.  To our supporters who have put your trust in us three to represent you 

in  the  House  of  Parliament  today,  we  will  not  be  biases  and  not  care  for  you  even  though  we 

support different parties, regardless of the different parties, may the grace and the love of God be 

within us.   

</span></div><div><span>To our support groups and our cultural groups, thank you for everything you do.  May our God 

give you strength to continue in what you do. 

</span></div><div><span>To my staff at T&amp;M Ltd, I appreciate the strong support that you have given me without being 

paid so that we can all strive for our goals.  I am proud of you today because three from you have 

achieved much.  But I am quite sad because I am now unemployed.

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>May  our  Heavenly  Father  fill  your  pockets  and  I  ask  that  we  all  work  together.    May  our 

relationship to each other be united; we started as friends, but today we are a family. 

</span></div><div><span>You have heard what we have discussed, but there are some things that I want to share with you 

today.  Our people to be served, to be supported and to be cared for.  Our elderly people and those 

who are vulnerable, we need to ensure that they have Caregivers to care them and are available 

from Monday to Friday.  This will allow them time for breaks. 

</span></div><div><span>We would pray for our referral patients to New Zealand to be cared for and that accommodation 

be  provided  for  them.    There  are  difficulties  faced  by  our  people  who  are  not  accommodated 

properly when they get to New Zealand.  New Zealand should provide adequate support for an 

Officer to meet and greet our referral patients and to care for them. 

</span></div><div><span>There are certain things that we cannot see, especially with patients that are mentally ill.  Today, 

we are faced with much more problems and this includes the consumption of alcohol, the use of 

drugs, COVID-19 and the increase of cost of food inside the shops.  We also have the burdens that 

people have with their banks that causes issues within families.  We have a lot of issues that needs 

addressing for our Constituency and we would like to pledge the government for some support in 

these areas. 

</span></div><div><span>To my family, thank you again for your continuous help and encouragement and support through 

financial support which helped us in many ways for me to stand in this House and represent you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>To my loving wife, our children, our in-laws and all our grandchildren that are here and far, thank 

you so much for everything and for your support. 

</span></div><div><span>Some words of encouragement from our </span><span>Dad that “you serve your people like how you serve your 

household.”  Another of his favourite quotes, “God have not given us a weak heart, but a strong 

</span><span>heart with love and a care.”</span></div><div><span>May God bless us all.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I assume the Question you are going to put is to 

receive or adopt the Speech to the Throne? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I am coming to that Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span> If that is the case, I did not rise, I do want to reply, but I would 

like to take my 30 minutes and I am not being able to cope because I know that at about 5 minutes 

to 5.00 p.m., you will call an adjournment.  But if you are putting a Motion that we will adjourn, 

then I will sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I will put the Question that we will adjourn.  But when 

we come back, then  I will give  you the time for your Maiden Speech and reply to the Throne.  

When we come back, I will give the option to the Leader of the Opposition and I will not forget 

that.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>As I have said before, if there are no further speakers, I will put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Pardon me, I will not put any Questions to the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>As we have no further businesses, Parliament is now adjourned until Tuesday 11</span><span>th</span><span> April 2023, at 

1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>May I ask an Honourable Member to say our Closing Prayer please?  The Honourable Member 

Tereapii Maki-Kavana?
