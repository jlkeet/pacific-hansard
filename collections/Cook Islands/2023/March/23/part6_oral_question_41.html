<h3>Oral Question 41</h3>
<div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is not as exciting as what was 

previously asked.  Before I ask my question, I would like to comment on the attire or the tie of our 

Honourable  Member  George  Angene.    I  love  those  yellow  shells  as  they  are  all  the  way  from 

Mangaia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is to the Honourable Prime Minister or the Minister Responsible for Parliament.  My 

question is in this Sitting of the 18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament Session, would a Calendar of Events or Proposed 

Sittings be forthcoming to the Members?  Thank you. 

</span></div>
