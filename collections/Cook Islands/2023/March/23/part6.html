<div><span>QUESTION TIME 

</span></div><div><span>Today,  being  Thursday,  Question  Time  is  for  one  hour.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Matavera; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  My first question is to the Prime Minister.  

Can the Prime Minister report to the House whether the government have sorted the problem out 

with Air New Zealand?  Although some parts have been addressed by the Media, there are still 

</span><span>some unsolved that our people need to know. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to the Member of Matavera and thank 

you for your question and maybe this is the time we need to explain to our people on this tight 

situation between our government and Air New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the problem is between a Company and our tax department on the matter, RMD.  This is not 

an issue of our country with Air New Zealand; it is a tax matter. 

</span></div><div><span>20 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>This means, the RMD considers this Company in this way: if you are a business company in the 

country trying to make revenue, then the law of the country or the Tax Revenue Act is applicable 

to your company.  Especially, Mr Speaker, when the government provides a subsidy to Air New 

Zealand and in that subsidy there is a provision for a profit by the Company.  It is only fair that 

that profit pay tax like all other companies pay taxes to the country. 

</span></div><div><span>The RMD did collect tax from Air New Zealand but Air New Zealand disputed this in court.  The 

argument  being  that  under  international  airline  conventions,  countries  do  not  tax  each  other 

airlines.  It is a reciprocal arrangement where countries will not tax the airlines that operates in 

their  country  and  in  response,  those  countries  will  not  tax  your  airline  that  operates  in  their 

countries. 

</span></div><div><span>So, as airlines operates in different countries around the world, they generally pay their tax in their 

home country.  But because we do not have an international airline, this benefit only goes one way.   

</span></div><div><span>The matter really came up when we started to subside Air New Zealand’s flights into our coun</span><span>try 

with the component of profit that was part of the subsidy.  So, this profit is calculated and paid 

into the New Zealand tax collector.   

</span></div><div><span>The outcome of the court’s decision was that they supported the application by Air New Zealand; 

</span><span>that Air New Zealand should not pay their tax due here in the Cook Islands regardless of the profit 

that we provide them, but that they should pay their tax in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>And the end result is, Mr Speaker that the tax department, our RMD here as they have done with 

other companies and other businesses are required now to make a refund back to Air New Zealand, 

because it is a tax matter.  There are matters of confidentiality involved but needless to say that 

matter has now been resolved in the courts and the RMD have been required to provide the refund 

to Air New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, a word of congratulations to you from this side of the House 

for being reappointed as Speaker for the Parliament of the Cook Islands.  Of course, to all Parties, 

</span><span>the Cook Islands Party, the Democratic Party, Once Cook Islands and likewise, the Cook Islands 

</span><span>United Party.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Congratulations also to the Clerk, Deputy Clerk and Chamber Clerk and the rest of the staff of 

Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Scripture Reading by our Chaplain this afternoon, I truly support.  And of course, the obituary 

announcements  by  the  Speaker,  I  have  one  included  but  not  only  one,  but  many  for  this  year, 

especially with our people here and those abroad, since January. 

</span></div><div><span>One  cornerstone  that  was  made  in  history,  but  before  that,  I  would  like  to  convey  my  deepest 

condolences to the family of the late Mr Jack William Rotter.  In the year 1988, the first private 

quarry  was  established  and  was  established  by  T&amp;M  Heather  Ltd.    This  gentleman,  this  great 

friend, has been a cornerstone for this country for over 34 years and was supported by his family 

from New Zealand.  He served our country very well.  Mr Speaker and Honourable Member, if I 

</span><span>may, I would like to ask for God’s blessings on behalf of this Honourable House for Mr Rotter and 

</span><span>his family. 

</span></div><div><span>I was quite fortunate to be in New Zealand to bid farewell to this great friend when he passed away 

on 18</span><span>th</span><span> February. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have a Supplementary Question to the Honourable Prime Minister.  As a saying 

</span><span>goes in Mangaian language, “</span><span>great minds think alike</span><span>.</span><span>”</span><span>  Mr Speaker, my Supplementary Question 

is regarding about the taxed-free flight with Air New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  last  year,  on  the  5</span><span>th</span><span>  of  August  2022,  $5.4  million  were  credited  back  to  Air  New 

Zealand as stated by the Honourable Prime Minister.  Therefore, my question is, whose mistake is 

this?  Could this refund be a mistake?  As indicated by the Honourable Prime Minister, could this 

$5.4 million be a mistake made by the IRD Ministry and not by the Government?  During COVID-

19 Mr Speaker, of course credit to our Prime Minister and Government for their immediate actions, 

but my question is, this $5.4 million of refund, is this borrowed money where we have to pay it 

back? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member for Matavera did  indicate, but  as indicated by  the Honourable Prime 

Minister,  the  matter  has  now  been  closed  by  the  Court.    But  my  question  Honourable  Prime 

Minister is, because this $5.4 million is quite costly, therefore, this mistake should be addressed 

with IRD because it would affect the tax payers of this country as they would be the ones liable 

for paying this back.  Again, my Supplementary Question is, is this the final payment or is there 

more that we have to pay?  Can the Honourable Prime Minister please elaborate? 

</span></div><div><span>Before I take my seat Mr Speaker, I would like to seek leave of the whole House for today to attend 

</span><span>to a personal matter that is very important.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you to the Honourable Member for Murienua 

for the Supplementary Question.  Simply put, we did not lose any money, we just failed to collect 

the revenue.  So that money that was collected by the IRD is not money that was lost, it was money 

that had to be returned.  As to whether this is the final amount, yes, this is the final amount of the 

payment which is the Court settlement that was announced. 

</span></div><div><span>As to whether this was a mistake, I cannot call that a mistake Mr Speaker.  This was a decision by 

the Court and it was on a matter of law and as we know in Court, when you have two lawyers, 

generally one will win their case on a point of law and one will lose their case on a point of law. 

</span></div><div><span>A case in point Mr Speaker, is the recent Petitions that we have just gone through over the last few 

months where the lawyers for the Cook Islands United Party presented a case before the Court for 

a Judgment.  The findings of the Court adjudicated that their case had no merit and failed.  But I 

would not call that a mistake.  It is the purpose of our Judiciary, to adjudicate and make a ruling if 

there is a difference of opinion on matters of law. 

</span></div><div><span>However, the payment to the lawyers, I would consider that a loss which is very different from the 

refund that we paid to Air New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Point of Order Mr Speaker! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>What is your Point of Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Irrelevance, Mr Speaker.  Irrelevant to the question that was posed and the 

answer from the Prime Minister is going somewhere else.  If I may answer the last comment made 

by our Prime Minister, the Court saw merit, not that there was no merit.  I have here the Appeal 

</span><span>Court Judgment Mr Speaker, so I ask sincerely not to diverse somewhere else with the question.  

</span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I was just concluding and I think I have made my 

point, thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Members, I will allow for another Member to ask a question.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Teariki Heather, your seek of leave is approved.   

</span></div><div><span>23 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I ask my question, hearing you 

announce the obituaries this afternoon, I want to give condolences from the Democratic Party to 

our  family  at  the  Manihiki  Hostel  for  Nga  Vakatini  Greig.    The  family  is  waiting  to  travel  to 

Manihiki on the barge, but we are unsure when the barge will leave, but it is scheduled to depart 

today.  His wife and family are at the Manihiki Hostel and we want to pass on our condolences to 

the family.  Even though this brother lives on Manihiki, he is also from Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>This question is to the Prime Minister.  The first question from the Honourable Member Vaitoti 

Tupa that I heard, is asking the Prime Minister if the tax problem with Air New Zealand is solved?  

The Supplementary Question from the Leader of the Cook Islands United is regarding the money 

that was refunded. 

</span></div><div><span>I heard the answer from the Prime Minister, he did not think that any money has been lost but he 

believes the money that was lost is the cash paid to the lawyer.  Here is the question, how much 

money was lost in paying the lawyer? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the floor 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you very much to the Leader of the Opposition.  The lawyer is smart 

to ask about the payment to the lawyer. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, may I ask that I be able to respond to this question at our next Sitting so that I can get 

an accurate figure?  Certainly, there is costs associated with paying the lawyers involved in this 

case.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister for the Ministry 

of Cultural Development.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when I look at the Honourable Member George Angene, he is responsible for Cultural 

Development, Corrective Services and also for the Punanga Nui.  I see that he is doing his work 

very well.  But now, I noticed him doing other things because when I look at these things, it is not 

</span><span>according to what he has been given.  

</span></div><div><span>24 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>So the question is, is this a private business of his or is there another reason of him doing these 

things  because  he  is  digging  graves  in  preparation  for  the  burial?    So  I  would  like  to  ask  him 

whether this is a private business. 

</span></div><div><span>I recall when my father-in-law passed away, T&amp;M Ltd did everything for his funeral.  So I would 

like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Member  to  confirm  whether  this  is  a  private  business  of  his  or 

something else. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  G.  ANGENE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Matavera, Honourable Vaitoti Tupa for the question.  The question is whether burial services is a 

private business of mine?  When you clarify these types of questions, it relates equally to people 

selling chestnuts on the side of the road.  Anyone can sell chestnuts on the side of the road and this 

is not business.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, these types of questions will affect people in the heart. 

</span></div><div><span>I have been digging graves since my grandmother passed away in 1983.  Costs of funeral services 

that are provided by Companies are a burden to families because of how costly they are.  When I 

saw this, I wanted to do something about it and then offered to help our people instead. 

</span></div><div><span>I wanted to clarify to this Honourable House that the work I do to support these families is free of 

charge.  I think from now, I will bring names of those who have passed away and will give them 

to the Deputy Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, to answer the question by the Honourable Member of Matavera whether this is a private 

business or not, let me answer this before the House.  This is not  a private business.   It is just 

basically me lending a helping hand to our people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister and I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and I thank the Honourable Minister for his answer.  I do 

not have any further questions for you, however, I have a question for the Honourable Minister of 

Education. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we will soon be celebrating the 20</span><span>0 Years’ Bicentennial for the arrival of Christianity.   

</span><span>Perhaps the Honourable Minister for Education could clarify more on this.  For Nga-Pu-Toru, their 

</span><span>Bicentennial Celebrations will occur on the 19</span><span>th</span><span>, 20</span><span>th</span><span> and the 23</span><span>rd</span><span> of July.  My question relates to 

the Education plans for the Schools on these three islands.  Will there be School Holidays given 

</span></div><div><span>25 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>to  these  Schools  on  these  three  islands  to  help  with  the  preparation  for  the  Bicentennial 

Celebrations?  We are well aware of the days allocated for School Holidays which is set for April 

this year and the last few days of July for the Constitution Celebration. 

</span></div><div><span>My  question  then  is,  whether  the  Ministry  of  Education  have  included  in  their  plans  for  the 

involvement of our children on the islands of Atiu, Mauke and Mitiaro with their Bicentennial 

Celebrations? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Education; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, greetings to all of us this afternoon.  I 

stand to congratulate you Mr Speaker for being re-appointed as Speaker for this House.  As this is 

the deliberation in this House, I therefore would like to welcome all the new Members into this 

Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to say Kia Orana to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Members on 

the Government side.  Kia Orana also to the Leader of the Opposition and your Members from the 

Democratic Party as well as Members of the United Party. 

</span></div><div><span>One thing that I have picked up that the Clerk may have forgotten to mention is the history or some 

of the unique moments of Parliament, where one of the Members of the United Party is my brother-

in-law.  However, I do hope that he will correct his records. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to express my gratitude to the Leader of One Cook Islands Party. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Member of Parliament for Matavera for his question.  Mr Speaker, the 

200 Years Bicentennial Celebration for Aitutaki was celebrated in 2021 and requests were received 

from Principals of Araura College and Schools around Aitutaki, including requests from Senior 

</span><span>Students of Nga-Pu-Toru, to be able to attend and witness the Celebration in Aitutaki.   

</span></div><div><span>As this was a one-off celebration in Aitutaki, Cabinet met and discussed the proposed requests 

from the Schools of Aitutaki and Senior Classes of Nga-Pu-Toru, in which they approved for these 

students to attend the Bicentennial Celebration of Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to the 200 Years Bicentennial Celebration for Nga-Pu-Toru and Rarotonga, the Cabinet 

have spent some time in the past few months and last year discussing about this specifically.  This 

</span><span>subject was raised in Cabinet and it was decided that when we get to those dates, Schools will be 

</span><span>allowed to attend these events just as I had said about these special events being a one-off event.

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that our people listening in to our Parliament will be happy to hear that our government 

have prioritised Church events to be more important than anything else.  I am aware that Titikaveka 

CICC is responsible for the planning of the 200 Years Bicentennial Celebration here in Rarotonga 

and  the  Honourable  Sonny  Williams,  Member  of  Parliament  for  Titikaveka,  is  also  part  of  the 

Committee in putting these programs together for the Celebration here in Rarotonga.  Although a 

program has not been final</span><span>ised yet, the government, Cabinet and the Member’s Committee are 

</span><span>working together to put a proper program for this special event.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  in  response  to  the  question  raised  by  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Matavera,  the 

answer  is  yes.    Yes,  the  government  will  allow  School  students  to  attend  this  special  event  in 

celebrating the arrival of Christianity into our country. 

</span></div><div><span>Hopefully, my clarification is clear and that I have answered the question correctly. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  I stand to ask my question to those people responsible for the 

Cook Islands Party radio program.  I recall about three weeks ago, the agreement was set for the 

improvement of the airport in Manihiki.  The work for the upgrading of the airport in Manihiki 

can start.   

</span></div><div><span>But I have been asked by the landowners of whom I represent to ask this question in this House 

because there are news that has been mentioned on this program.  Maybe the response from this 

question will confirm the truth about this matter.  What I was told even though I did not listen to 

the program, but I was told that the blame was on the landowners and maybe the lawyers as well 

for the delay in the upgrade. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Minister, Albert Nicholas. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Speaker!  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  I know she is just about to ask a question and I cannot answer a question 

based on hearsay.  I need a question based on facts. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Here is the question.  Did you state on the radio, that the delay 

</span><span>for the confirmation  for  the agreement on the Manihiki  airport  is  the landowners?  That  is  my 

question.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 23 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I do not recall making those sort of comments and if I can 

stress once again and repeat my Point of Order.  I cannot give an answer to a question that is merely 

raised on hearsay and not facts. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, can you please settle that outside of Parliament?  Seeing 

that there is no actual fact in the discussions and question raised, can you Honourable Members 

settle this outside of Parliament? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, if it will help my Aunty across the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Are you asking her a question? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  I am posing a question to the Chair, Mr Speaker.  If it will help her, I am 

willing to give a factual update of the airport program in Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I think that is more appropriate Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  And the fact of the matter concerning Manihiki airport Mr Speaker is, 

we are at this point in time in negotiating with the sole tenderer of that project.  We are at the 

negotiation stages concerning the cost of the tender and the possible cost of the project moving 

forward. 

</span></div><div><span>For our information Mr Speaker, there was only one applicant to the tender for that project when 

it went to tender and we are at the negotiation stages at this point in time and thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I think the Honourable Tina Browne will be 

happy with that. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My nephew answered a question which 

</span><span>was never asked.  I am grateful however, to his explanation as to the way forward. 

</span></div><div><span>And could I be afforded the same privilege to explain what I understand the position to be with 

regard to the enduring agreement that was reached by the parties in court three weeks ago? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Member,  I  do  not  think  that  I  will  agree  with  the  issue  being 

debated. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, it is not a debate, it is just stating the facts.

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may go ahead.  Can you just make it short? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. BROWNE:</span><span>  Very short, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>The negotiation started in December, last year.  And all the parties were keen to make it happen 

by the end of March.  The reason for that is because of the escalating cost of materials.  However, 

during  the  months  that  followed,  we  have  to  go  through  three  plans.    The  first  plan  that  was 

provided to the landowners was of an area of approximately 24 hectares.  The second plan changed, 

it was amended to 20 hectares.  Then, the third and final plan was 18 hectares.  That is the reason 

for the delay, not because the landowners were dragging their feet, it was because the final plan 

had not been finalised. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Honourable Member.  I think the good news is the airport 

is going ahead.  I see the Honourable Member Agnes Armstrong; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is not as exciting as what was 

previously asked.  Before I ask my question, I would like to comment on the attire or the tie of our 

Honourable  Member  George  Angene.    I  love  those  yellow  shells  as  they  are  all  the  way  from 

Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is to the Honourable Prime Minister or the Minister Responsible for Parliament.  My 

question is in this Sitting of the 18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament Session, would a Calendar of Events or Proposed 

Sittings be forthcoming to the Members?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you for the question from one of my most 

favourite  Members  of  the  Opposition.    The  new  Standing  Orders  Mr  Speaker,  provides  for  a 

</span><span>Business Committee</span><span> and also the establishment of a </span><span>Bills, Petitions and Papers Committee</span><span> and it 

</span><span>is the role of these Committees to prepare a Calendar of Sittings and Bills that will be presented 

before the House.  Of course, on these Committees are Members from each of our different parties 

that are within this House.  I am sure we would be able to put together a Calendar of Sittings for 

this House during the year.  

</span></div><div><span>However, as a Member of this House for 12 years and as a Member of the Government, it is no 

surprise  that  on  occasions,  the  Governments  business  will  come  in  and  interfere  with  the 

</span><span>Parliamentary  Sittings.    And  on  occasion,  the  Prime  Minister  or  Ministers  may  be  required  to 

</span><span>attend meetings and be away, and that may require us to adjust our schedule as need be because 

on occasion, these invitations come at a very short notice.  Unfortunately, we did not approve the

work around that but as much as possible, we will have a schedule in place for all of the Members 

of this House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Agnes 

Armstrong; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS. A. ARMSTRONG:</span><span>  I have another question and is directed to the Minister for Agriculture.  

Sometimes back last year or the year before that an excavator was purchased which is supposedly 

earmarked  for  Mangaia.    To  date,  we  have  not  seen  anything  or  heard  anything  about  this 

excavator.  So, I am asking if anyone can enlighten us as we are still waiting.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKE</span><span>R:  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister Rose Brown; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Honourable Member 

for  the  important  question  you  have  asked.    However,  firstly,  a  greetings  to  all  of  us  elected 

Members from our various constituencies in this House.  Above all, I would like to congratulate 

you Mr Speaker, a representative of Nga-Pu-</span><span>Toru on your reappointment to the Speakers’ position.  

</span><span>To the Clerk, Deputy Clerk and staff of this Honourable House, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I like this question and the simple answer is, if you are on this side of the House this speeds up the 

process  in  getting things to  your island.   And for us the Government,  helping our people even 

though the machinery did not arrive on Mangaia as it is on Mitiaro, however there is an excavator 

allocated for Mangaia and it is just a matter of getting the barge available so the excavator can be 

transported to Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  Honourable Members we have come to the 

end  of  Question  Time.    I  think  it  is  time  for  a  break.    It  is  now  time  for  recess.    Honourable 

</span><span>Members, under our new Standing Orders, I hope every Member in this House got copy of the 

</span><span>new Standing Orders and if you do not have any, please approach our Parliamentary staff so you 

can have access to our new Standing Orders.  Like I said, under our new Standing Orders, our 

lunch break is for 45 minutes and not 30 minutes as it was before.  That is a new extension to our 

recess. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now suspend our Sitting for lunch and we will resume at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>That should give sufficient time for recess and I expect you all back in Chamber before we start. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.27 p.m.
