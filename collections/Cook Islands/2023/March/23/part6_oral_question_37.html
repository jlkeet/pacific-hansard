<h3>Oral Question 37</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My nephew answered a question which 

</span><span>was never asked.  I am grateful however, to his explanation as to the way forward. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And could I be afforded the same privilege to explain what I understand the position to be with 

regard to the enduring agreement that was reached by the parties in court three weeks ago? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Member,  I  do  not  think  that  I  will  agree  with  the  issue  being 

debated. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, it is not a debate, it is just stating the facts.
