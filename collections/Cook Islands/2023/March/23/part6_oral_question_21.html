<h3>Oral Question 21</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, greetings to all of us this afternoon.  I 

stand to congratulate you Mr Speaker for being re-appointed as Speaker for this House.  As this is 

the deliberation in this House, I therefore would like to welcome all the new Members into this 

Parliament. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to say Kia Orana to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Members on 

the Government side.  Kia Orana also to the Leader of the Opposition and your Members from the 

Democratic Party as well as Members of the United Party. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One thing that I have picked up that the Clerk may have forgotten to mention is the history or some 

of the unique moments of Parliament, where one of the Members of the United Party is my brother-

in-law.  However, I do hope that he will correct his records. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to express my gratitude to the Leader of One Cook Islands Party. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the Member of Parliament for Matavera for his question.  Mr Speaker, the 

200 Years Bicentennial Celebration for Aitutaki was celebrated in 2021 and requests were received 

from Principals of Araura College and Schools around Aitutaki, including requests from Senior 

</span><span>Students of Nga-Pu-Toru, to be able to attend and witness the Celebration in Aitutaki.   

</span></div>
<div><span>As this was a one-off celebration in Aitutaki, Cabinet met and discussed the proposed requests 

from the Schools of Aitutaki and Senior Classes of Nga-Pu-Toru, in which they approved for these 

students to attend the Bicentennial Celebration of Aitutaki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In regards to the 200 Years Bicentennial Celebration for Nga-Pu-Toru and Rarotonga, the Cabinet 

have spent some time in the past few months and last year discussing about this specifically.  This 

</span><span>subject was raised in Cabinet and it was decided that when we get to those dates, Schools will be 

</span><span>allowed to attend these events just as I had said about these special events being a one-off event.

</span></div>
<div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>I believe that our people listening in to our Parliament will be happy to hear that our government 

have prioritised Church events to be more important than anything else.  I am aware that Titikaveka 

CICC is responsible for the planning of the 200 Years Bicentennial Celebration here in Rarotonga 

and  the  Honourable  Sonny  Williams,  Member  of  Parliament  for  Titikaveka,  is  also  part  of  the 

Committee in putting these programs together for the Celebration here in Rarotonga.  Although a 

program has not been final</span><span>ised yet, the government, Cabinet and the Memberâ€™s Committee are 

</span><span>working together to put a proper program for this special event.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  in  response  to  the  question  raised  by  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Matavera,  the 

answer  is  yes.    Yes,  the  government  will  allow  School  students  to  attend  this  special  event  in 

celebrating the arrival of Christianity into our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully, my clarification is clear and that I have answered the question correctly. 

</span></div>
