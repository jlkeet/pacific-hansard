<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I ask my question, hearing you 

announce the obituaries this afternoon, I want to give condolences from the Democratic Party to 

our  family  at  the  Manihiki  Hostel  for  Nga  Vakatini  Greig.    The  family  is  waiting  to  travel  to 

Manihiki on the barge, but we are unsure when the barge will leave, but it is scheduled to depart 

today.  His wife and family are at the Manihiki Hostel and we want to pass on our condolences to 

the family.  Even though this brother lives on Manihiki, he is also from Rakahanga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This question is to the Prime Minister.  The first question from the Honourable Member Vaitoti 

Tupa that I heard, is asking the Prime Minister if the tax problem with Air New Zealand is solved?  

The Supplementary Question from the Leader of the Cook Islands United is regarding the money 

that was refunded. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I heard the answer from the Prime Minister, he did not think that any money has been lost but he 

believes the money that was lost is the cash paid to the lawyer.  Here is the question, how much 

money was lost in paying the lawyer?
