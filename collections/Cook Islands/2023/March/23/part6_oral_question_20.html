<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and I thank the Honourable Minister for his answer.  I do 

not have any further questions for you, however, I have a question for the Honourable Minister of 

Education. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, we will soon be celebrating the 20</span><span>0 Yearsâ€™ Bicentennial for the arrival of Christianity.   

</span><span>Perhaps the Honourable Minister for Education could clarify more on this.  For Nga-Pu-Toru, their 

</span><span>Bicentennial Celebrations will occur on the 19</span><span>th</span><span>, 20</span><span>th</span><span> and the 23</span><span>rd</span><span> of July.  My question relates to 

the Education plans for the Schools on these three islands.  Will there be School Holidays given

</span></div>
<div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>to  these  Schools  on  these  three  islands  to  help  with  the  preparation  for  the  Bicentennial 

Celebrations?  We are well aware of the days allocated for School Holidays which is set for April 

this year and the last few days of July for the Constitution Celebration. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My  question  then  is,  whether  the  Ministry  of  Education  have  included  in  their  plans  for  the 

involvement of our children on the islands of Atiu, Mauke and Mitiaro with their Bicentennial 

Celebrations? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Education; you have the Floor.
