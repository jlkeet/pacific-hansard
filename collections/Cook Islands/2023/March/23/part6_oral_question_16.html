<h3>Oral Question 16</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Minister for the Ministry 

of Cultural Development.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, when I look at the Honourable Member George Angene, he is responsible for Cultural 

Development, Corrective Services and also for the Punanga Nui.  I see that he is doing his work 

very well.  But now, I noticed him doing other things because when I look at these things, it is not 

</span><span>according to what he has been given.

</span></div>
<div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>So the question is, is this a private business of his or is there another reason of him doing these 

things  because  he  is  digging  graves  in  preparation  for  the  burial?    So  I  would  like  to  ask  him 

whether this is a private business. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I recall when my father-in-law passed away, T&amp;M Ltd did everything for his funeral.  So I would 

like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Member  to  confirm  whether  this  is  a  private  business  of  his  or 

something else.
