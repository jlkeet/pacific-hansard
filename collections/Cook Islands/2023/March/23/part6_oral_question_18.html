<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>HON.  G.  ANGENE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  for 

Matavera, Honourable Vaitoti Tupa for the question.  The question is whether burial services is a 

private business of mine?  When you clarify these types of questions, it relates equally to people 

selling chestnuts on the side of the road.  Anyone can sell chestnuts on the side of the road and this 

is not business.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, these types of questions will affect people in the heart. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I have been digging graves since my grandmother passed away in 1983.  Costs of funeral services 

that are provided by Companies are a burden to families because of how costly they are.  When I 

saw this, I wanted to do something about it and then offered to help our people instead. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I wanted to clarify to this Honourable House that the work I do to support these families is free of 

charge.  I think from now, I will bring names of those who have passed away and will give them 

to the Deputy Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, to answer the question by the Honourable Member of Matavera whether this is a private 

business or not, let me answer this before the House.  This is not  a private business.   It is just 

basically me lending a helping hand to our people. 

</span></div>
