<h3>Oral Question 23</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  I stand to ask my question to those people responsible for the 

Cook Islands Party radio program.  I recall about three weeks ago, the agreement was set for the 

improvement of the airport in Manihiki.  The work for the upgrading of the airport in Manihiki 

can start.   

</span></div>
<div><span>But I have been asked by the landowners of whom I represent to ask this question in this House 

because there are news that has been mentioned on this program.  Maybe the response from this 

question will confirm the truth about this matter.  What I was told even though I did not listen to 

the program, but I was told that the blame was on the landowners and maybe the lawyers as well 

for the delay in the upgrade.
