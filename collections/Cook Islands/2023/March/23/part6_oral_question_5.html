<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank you to the Honourable Member for Murienua 

for the Supplementary Question.  Simply put, we did not lose any money, we just failed to collect 

the revenue.  So that money that was collected by the IRD is not money that was lost, it was money 

that had to be returned.  As to whether this is the final amount, yes, this is the final amount of the 

payment which is the Court settlement that was announced. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As to whether this was a mistake, I cannot call that a mistake Mr Speaker.  This was a decision by 

the Court and it was on a matter of law and as we know in Court, when you have two lawyers, 

generally one will win their case on a point of law and one will lose their case on a point of law. 

</span></div>
<div><span>A case in point Mr Speaker, is the recent Petitions that we have just gone through over the last few 

months where the lawyers for the Cook Islands United Party presented a case before the Court for 

a Judgment.  The findings of the Court adjudicated that their case had no merit and failed.  But I 

would not call that a mistake.  It is the purpose of our Judiciary, to adjudicate and make a ruling if 

there is a difference of opinion on matters of law. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, the payment to the lawyers, I would consider that a loss which is very different from the 

refund that we paid to Air New Zealand. 

</span></div>
