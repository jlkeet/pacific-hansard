<h3>Oral Question 48</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  Honourable Members we have come to the 

end  of  Question  Time.    I  think  it  is  time  for  a  break.    It  is  now  time  for  recess.    Honourable 

</span><span>Members, under our new Standing Orders, I hope every Member in this House got copy of the 

</span><span>new Standing Orders and if you do not have any, please approach our Parliamentary staff so you 

can have access to our new Standing Orders.  Like I said, under our new Standing Orders, our 

lunch break is for 45 minutes and not 30 minutes as it was before.  That is a new extension to our 

recess. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I will now suspend our Sitting for lunch and we will resume at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div>
<div><span>That should give sufficient time for recess and I expect you all back in Chamber before we start. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.27 p.m.
