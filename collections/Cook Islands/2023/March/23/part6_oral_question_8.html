<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Irrelevance, Mr Speaker.  Irrelevant to the question that was posed and the 

answer from the Prime Minister is going somewhere else.  If I may answer the last comment made 

by our Prime Minister, the Court saw merit, not that there was no merit.  I have here the Appeal 

</span><span>Court Judgment Mr Speaker, so I ask sincerely not to diverse somewhere else with the question.  

</span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.
