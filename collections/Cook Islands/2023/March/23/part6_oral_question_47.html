<h3>Oral Question 47</h3>
<div><span>HON. V. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Honourable Member 

for  the  important  question  you  have  asked.    However,  firstly,  a  greetings  to  all  of  us  elected 

Members from our various constituencies in this House.  Above all, I would like to congratulate 

you Mr Speaker, a representative of Nga-Pu-</span><span>Toru on your reappointment to the Speakersâ€™ position.  

</span><span>To the Clerk, Deputy Clerk and staff of this Honourable House, Kia Orana. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I like this question and the simple answer is, if you are on this side of the House this speeds up the 

process  in  getting things to  your island.   And for us the Government,  helping our people even 

though the machinery did not arrive on Mangaia as it is on Mitiaro, however there is an excavator 

allocated for Mangaia and it is just a matter of getting the barge available so the excavator can be 

transported to Mangaia.
