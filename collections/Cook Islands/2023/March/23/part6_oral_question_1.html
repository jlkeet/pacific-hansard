<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  My first question is to the Prime Minister.  

Can the Prime Minister report to the House whether the government have sorted the problem out 

with Air New Zealand?  Although some parts have been addressed by the Media, there are still 

</span><span>some unsolved that our people need to know. 

</span></div>
