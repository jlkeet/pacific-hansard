<h3>Oral Question 39</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. BROWNE:</span><span>  Very short, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The negotiation started in December, last year.  And all the parties were keen to make it happen 

by the end of March.  The reason for that is because of the escalating cost of materials.  However, 

during  the  months  that  followed,  we  have  to  go  through  three  plans.    The  first  plan  that  was 

provided to the landowners was of an area of approximately 24 hectares.  The second plan changed, 

it was amended to 20 hectares.  Then, the third and final plan was 18 hectares.  That is the reason 

for the delay, not because the landowners were dragging their feet, it was because the final plan 

had not been finalised.
