</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We will now go on to the next business which is the swearing in of the Members.  As the Clerk 

has previously read the names of Members of Parliament earlier today, the Clerk will call each 

name in alphabetical order.  You will come up to the Table in front here when your name is being 

called.  You will take the Oath and you will sign and then you will take your seat again.  You will 

have in front of you the Oath in Maori and in English.  You may select which one you prefer to 

read and you will have your hand on the Bible as you take your Oath.   

</span></div><div><span>I will now proceed to the Table where we will begin with the swearing in of our Members.
