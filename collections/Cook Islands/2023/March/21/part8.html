</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 21 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Thank  you  for  supporting  the  Motion.    It 

seems like as if there are no other nominations, therefore, I declare the Honourable Tingika Elikana 

as the Deputy Speaker of Parliament.  Can we give a hand of applause for the Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>As we have no further business, Honourable Members, Parliament is adjourned until 10.00 a.m. 

</span><span>tomorrow to hear the speech from the Kingâ€™s Representati</span><span>ve. 

</span></div><div><span>Before we proceed to our Closing Prayer, after we adjourn, may I ask all Honourable Members to 

please assemble in front of the Parliament House for a photo session?  After our photo session, we 

will then go to the seaside of our Parliament House where a special </span><span>kaikai</span><span> has been prepared for 

us and all our guests. 

</span></div><div><span>And before I ask one of the Honourable Members to say our Closing Prayer, I was quite amazed 

to see the Honourable Member from Tupapa/Maraerenga in his suit today, he could be promoting 

and/or supporting a new venture in his village where you can buy a suit like his because now and 

then, he always wears a different colour of suit when he comes to Parliament.  And for that honour, 

I would like to ask him to say our Closing Prayer.
