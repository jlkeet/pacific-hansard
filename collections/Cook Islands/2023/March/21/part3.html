<div><span>OPENING PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR CLERK (T. VAINERERE): </span><span> Please be seated.  Kia Orana everybody.  Honourable Members 

and all our visitors and guests in the Public Gallery, greetings and welcome to the First Sitting of 

the 18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>Before we tackle the Official Business of the Day, we have a few clarifications that I would like 

to share with the Members as well as the guests in the Public Gallery as well as those who are 

watching by livestream. 

</span></div><div><span>We have the new numbering model for our Parliament of the Cook Islands with this Parliament 

being  known  as  the  18</span><span>th</span><span>  Parliament  of  the  Cook  Islands.    We  make  a  point  of  clarifying  this 

morning because of the many questions that we have received regarding this new numbering. 

</span></div><div><span>For explanation, the Legislative Assembly as we know it now, otherwise known as the Parliament 

was established by an Act of the New Zealand Parliament on 25</span><span>th</span><span> October 1957.  So the Cook 

Islands Amendment Act of 1957, Section 32 to 50 describes the establishment and the composition 

of the new Legislative Assembly of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>So the very first General Election by Universal Suffrage in the Cook Islands was held on October 

13</span><span>th</span><span>, 1958 and that effectively sets up the Legislative Assembly as we know it now.  So, from that 

first Parliament in 1958 to 2022, we have had 18 General Elections altogether.  I hope that clarifies 

the matter for everybody. 

</span></div><div><span>Under our new Standing Orders which came into force on 1</span><span>st</span><span> July 2022, we have a number of 

changes to the way we do business in Parliament.  I hope the Honourable Members will bear with 

us the staff, as we try to navigate this new Standing Orders together.  We are learning and you will 

also learn together with us.   

</span></div><div><span>So there are  a few things that  I want  to  point out  in  terms  of some unique features of the 18</span><span>th</span><span>

Parliament.

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 21 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Political entities are required to be recognized in Parliament under our Standing, Orders.  So today, 

we have in the House the Cook Islands Party, the Democratic Party, the Cook Islands United Party, 

One Cook Islands and three Independents.   

</span></div><div><span>We have a number of distinctions amongst the Members.  The first one, under our Westminster 

system, we have a Father of the House.  In our Parliament, we have two of them but we can only 

have one father, so I have to choose which of the two will be the Father for this Parliament.  So 

Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members, our two Fathers by virtue of their longest service in 

the House happens to be the Honourable Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, Honourable Mark 

Brown for 13 years of service, followed by the Honourable George Angene, also with 13 years of 

service.  So I am going to have to choose one of them to be the Father of the House and on this 

day, because of something called the alphabet,  I choose the Honourable George Angene as the 

Father of the House of the 18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament.  Give him a big hand.   

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>Just a point of confirmation, Honourable Father of the House, there is no extra salary or allowances 

attached to this appointment.  So do not come and ask for anything afterwards. 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  a  distinction  of  the  Mother  of  the  House  and  that  Honour  goes  to  the  Member  for 

Manihiki, Mrs Akaiti Puna, Mother of the House.  Again, there is no allowances for this one. 

</span></div><div><span>Some of the unique features of our Members in the House today, we have a mother and daughter 

combination in the form of the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown and her daughter Tehani 

Brown; give them a big hand please. 

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>We  have  a  brother  and  brother  combination  today;  please  put  your  hands  together  for  the 

</span><span>Honourable Teariki Heather and the Honourable Robert Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>We have a sister and brother combination today; please put your hands together for the Honourable 

Akaiti Puna and Honourable Tukaka Ama.   

</span></div><div><span>(Applause)

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 21 March 2023 

</span></div><div><span>First Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our  youngest Member of the  House in this Parliament  is  the  Leader of the House; Ms  Tehani 

Brown.   

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>We have a first here, the first Parliamentary Service staff to ever become a Member of Parliament, 

the Honourable Member for Titikaveka, Honourable Sonny Williams.   

</span></div><div><span>We have three new Items that has been added to our procedures; we have a Mace that will follow 

or lead the Speaker into the House from now and onwards and it will also lead the Speaker out of 

the House.  The Mace will be positioned on the Table in the front.   

</span></div><div><span>Right  now,  there  is  no  Mace  there  because  the  Speaker  has  yet  to  take  his  Chair;  that  is  Item 

number one.  The other one will be a Black Rod and this will come into use tomorrow for the 

</span><span>Summoning of the Members to attend to the King’s Representative’</span><span>s Chamber for the Ceremonial 

Opening of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>And then, you will see this item of furniture that I am using ahead of the Speaker who owns this 

Chair.  This is a new addition through the retirement of the other Chair for reasons known to me 

and my staff and some of the Members.  You can go to the website of the Parliament of the Cook 

Islands and read the stories about these three new Items. 

</span></div><div><span>Our first business for this afternoon is prescribed under Standing Order 06.   

</span></div><div><span>Pursuant  to  Standing Order 06 (a),  I  hereby  read the notice summoning  Parliament to  meet.    I 

therefore, read from the Kings Representative, the following: 

</span></div><div><span>“Appointment of the first meeting of the 18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Members  elected  to  serve  in  the  Parliament  </span><span>–</span><span>  greetings.    Whereas  the  Parliament  was 

</span><span>dissolved  and  whereas  I  have  thought  fit  to  convene  the  first  meeting.    Therefore,  pursuant  to 

Article 29 of the Constitution of the Cook Islands, I, Tom Marsters, Kings Representative do hereby

</span><span>and to take into consideration the state and welfare of the Cook Islands and therein to do as may 

</span><span>seem necessary.
