<h3>Oral Question 20</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Yes, Mr Speaker like what Minister George Angene said in the past, this 

is Question Time and not story time. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion to my response, Mr Speaker it has already been arranged that at a certain time, Triad 

will come back and work on this road.  However, we had the election and that is the cause of the 

delay on the work.  So, now before they move on to the roading work in Muri, they have been 

instructed to complete the job in Tupapa before moving on to another village and that is what we 

can see with the road work in Tupapa.
