<h3>Oral Question 24</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>I  think,  Mr  Speaker  I  would  like  to  tell  a  story  before  I  answer  this 

question.  However, I see my aunty on that side is not happy when I got up.  So, to briefly answer 

</span><span>the  question  from  the  Honourable  Member  for  Ruaau,  Ngatangiiaâ€™s  road  is  done  so  when 

</span><span>Titikaveka is completed then we will proceed to Puaikura.  I believe that is a very clear answer but 

do not ask me when it will be done because money speaks for everything.  However, the work on 

our main road in Rarotonga we will come back to Nikao then to Titikaveka then to you Arorangi. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I know you will ask about your back road, the parts that are not completed towards the boundary 

of Akaoa.  Once the bitumen container arrives then we will discuss it further.  I believe the response 

is clear.
