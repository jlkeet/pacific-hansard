<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.   Kia Orana to all of us and our people listening to 

our parliament sitting.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I  want  to  make  a  short  explanation  and  pose  my  question  to  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert 

Nicholas.  This is regards to our electricity and you have been in this work for a long time.  The 

Minister mentioned the lowering of the cost on our people and this is what came to my mind to 

</span><span>ask my question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>As we know Mr Speaker, the cost to lay a power line from the power pole to any home regardless 

of the distance, it is the homeowner that bears the cost and we can see that today.  Mr Speaker, this 

is a big burden that our people are taking.  The reason is they have to buy the meter box probably 

</span><span>supplied by CITC today and store it away at home to keep it dry.  Maybe in the future Mr Speaker 

if government can look into this and subsidise the cost faced by our people. I know the people are 

suffering because my company is involved in digging the trenches and laying of the cables. So, 

the question is if the government can assist. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  Honourable Member, you have the Floor?
