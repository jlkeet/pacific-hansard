<h3>Oral Question 22</h3>
<div><span>MR T. VARU:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  You are quite right in saying I have tried to get up three 

or four times to raise my question.  Perhaps my question is more significant.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker and your staff in this House and to the government side, your 

</span><span>Leader, the Opposition side and the three of us in our corner, our Leader, Kia Orana.  Kia Orana 

to our people listening in. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question, Mr Speaker is  to the Honourable Minister Nicholas but  I see that he is  busy this 

</span><span>morning.  I believe Mr Speaker today or tomorrow are our final days for the Meeting of this House.  

</span><span>I would like to pose this question to the Minister before the end of this year.

<div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question has been an issue raised in our village of Arorangi and I would like them to hear the 

response  from  the  Minister  this  afternoon.    The  question  here  Honourable  Minister  is  what  is 

</span><span>governmentâ€™s plan or arrangement for the tarsealing of the roads in our constituency?  This is my 

</span><span>plea to you Minister, if it is possible for you to tell us and I am sure they are listening in Puaikura.  

I have asked this question many times in the past.  Thank you.
