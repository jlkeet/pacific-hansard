<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Member 

for that question.  The situation on this road is that it was already worked on before I took this 

post.  I am not sure whether it was during the time when the Member was the Minister for CIIC

<div><span>but I cannot be too sure.  However, Mr Speaker the upgrading work that was done on this road 

back then was a test run at the time.  They were trying out bitumen mixtures to find out whether it 

would be appropriate to use to tar seal the road.</span></div>
