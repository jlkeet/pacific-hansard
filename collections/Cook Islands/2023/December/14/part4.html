<div><span>OBITUARIES 

</span></div><div><span>First of all, our condolences to the people of Atiu.  I have a name here, Rae Simpson.  This Papa 

used to work for the Energy Power Department of Atiu.  One time when I went to visit him in 

</span><span>Atiu, he was driving around on his bike and was carrying a ladder with him.  It was a bit different 

</span><span>back in those days compared to how we do things today.  Today, you have cars.  In those days, we 

</span><span>had motorbikes.  Therefore, our condolences to his wife, their family and the people of Atiu.  May 

</span><span>God comforts you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Our second obituary notice is Mama Kai Gore, from the Village of Areore of Atiu.  She is a good 

</span><span>person that supports the Church and the people of Atiu.

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our third obituary notice is Bobby Touna, also from Atiu.  All these individuals are good people 

of Atiu.  Therefore, our deepest condolences to you all and may God comfort you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Our fourth one, Mama Nana Kamo Mataroa from Arorangi.  Our condolences to the entire family; 

I believe that this Mama is back from New Zealand, therefore, on behalf of everyone here today 

and of the Honourable Teariki Heather, we would like to convey our condolences to the family. 

</span></div><div><span>The fifth notice is Mama Tiare Nicholas Estall, from the village of Nikao on Harley Street.  Our 

condolences to the family; this Mama is a relative of the Honourable Minister Albert Nicholas.   

</span></div><div><span>Last notice, Tangata Orureau, he lived in Mangaia his entire life but he is from the island of Mauke.  

Our condolences to the family.  I can see that none of the Members of Parliament from Mangaia 

does not know this person; he lives in Makatea, yes Kaumata.  He has a different name in Mangaia, 

but his real name is Tangata Orureau and the people of Mangaia usually calls him Papa Ta.  This 

Papa is going to be taken back to Mauke for his burial, I believe on Friday.  Therefore, I would 

like  to  convey  our  condolences  to  the  family  because  his  son  is  the  CEO  for  the  Honourable 

Minister George Angene. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, on behalf of this Honourable House, I would like to convey our deepest condolences to 

all the families of the people that I have announced earlier and may God comfort them all.
