<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:   </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and also  the Member of  Matavera, the financial 

spokesman for the Opposition side for that important question.  This week the Cabinet received 

the half-year fiscal economic update as a requirement under the Ministry of Finance Act to provide 

a snapshot of the six months of this financial year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This  report  is  now  available  online  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  website  but  I  can  give  us  some 

updates and highlights of this particular report.  The good news is that we are on track to achieve 

the GDP levels of pre-COVID in this financial year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Although we have lost the four years of productivity in that time due to our very good financial 

stimulus  that  we  provided  during  COVID  we  have  enabled  our  industry  and  our  economy  to 

rebound very, very quickly so that this financial year we are back at the pre-COVID levels.   

</span></div>
<div><span>You mentioned the Pacific growth rate around 3 percent for the region, our growth rate for the 

Cook Islands is just under 10 percent in the same period.  So this is of course all on the back of the 

recovery of our tourism industry and despite our visitor arrival numbers still being about 20 percent 

less than pre-</span><span>COVID levels, it’s clear that the revenue that’s been generated is more on a per capita 

</span><span>basis than what was pre-COVID. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And of course the reason why we are not at the pre-COVID visitor arrival levels is because we are 

just a number of flights short during the week, maybe three or four flights a week short and of 

course this has been due to the difficulties faced by Air New Zealand in particular trying to fill the 

demand. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our Members will recall prior to COVID that we had Air New Zealand, we had Jetstar and we had 

Virgin Australia flying into our country so those three or four flights that we have a short fall on 

</span><span>represent the carrying load that the Virgin Australia flights used to bring into our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But despite that we have been able to build up our airline links also with Hawaiian Airlines as we 

</span><span>see and also Jetstar’s direct flights from Sydney which next year will increase to  four flights a 

</span><span>week. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And of course let us not forget our improving connectivity with French Polynesia and Tahiti with 

three to four flights a week flying in and enabling the connection to the North American market 

through Papeete.  But the government is committed to accelerating our economic growth so that 

</span><span>we can recover those four years of lost prosperity during COVID.  We cannot just rely on our 

</span><span>tourism; we have to look at diversifying our economy, which is why today in this House we will 

see a Bill introduced which is a new financial product that we are looking to promote; that is the 

sound of the economy that you are hearing.

</span></div>
<div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>And of course let us not forget the work that our country has been involved in with the seabed 

minerals as a potential future prosperity for our country.  In this, our second year of exploration, 

there has been growing interest internationally on the shift towards renewable energy and the need 

for critical metals, which are contained in our seabed minerals. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We are at a point in time in the world where there is a convergence of interest in countries procuring 

critical metals for their renewable energy, but also looking at ways to diversify that supply away 

from current sources which at the moment, the critical metals that are being looked after.  Those 

sources are controlled by China as companies that own many of these mines and in particular, for 

cobalt the supply comes out of the Democratic Republic of Congo.   

</span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  of  course,  the  many  driving  factor  behind  our  exploration  is  the  need  for  these 

companies to demonstrate the protection of our ocean and the means which we can harvest our 

nodules in a way that does not damage our ocean.  So, our very strong reliance on good sound 

science  and  evidence-based  decision  making  following  the  rule  of  law,  particularly  the  UN 

Convention of the Law of the Sea.  These are all the principles that we adhere to, in our Seabed 

Minerals sector. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, all in all, Mr Speaker the outlook is that our economy is recovering and we are growing in a 

lot faster than many of our other pacific countries but we also do have the challenges that face, not 

just us but other countries, particularly the challenges of inflation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I think this is enough as an answer to the question Mr Speaker.  So, thank you very much.
