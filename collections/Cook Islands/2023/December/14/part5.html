<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>This being Thursday, Question Time is for one hour.  Yesterday the Honourable 

Albert Nicholas requested to reserve his response to the question raised by the Honourable Robert 

Heather  and  to  return  today  with  the  answer  but  I  believe  he  is  not  present  today  due  to  the 

bereavement of his Aunty I think.   

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity to ask a question.  My 

question is to the Leader of our Nation.  We know now that we have reach half of the year but I 

will thank the Leader of the Nation for answering the question I posed yesterday regarding the 

loans that was granted to our business people. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe this is a simple question that I am asking and this is on the gross, the GDP of this nation.  

During the presentation of the Budget this year, he told us about the future projection of the growth 

of this Nation.  We all know this will be of benefit to whoever will govern our country and the 

work they are tasked to do according to the Budget.  The growth domestic product is something 

</span><span>that we believe will help our Nation.  We can see whether this is going up or going down because 

</span><span>some example it is being said that in the Pacific it has reached 3.3 percent. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Can I ask the Honourable Member to ask your question.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>This is the question to the Leader of the Nation, what is our position at this time, 

the Cook Islands because half the year has gone by?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:   </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and also  the Member of  Matavera, the financial 

spokesman for the Opposition side for that important question.  This week the Cabinet received 

the half-year fiscal economic update as a requirement under the Ministry of Finance Act to provide 

a snapshot of the six months of this financial year. 

</span></div><div><span>This  report  is  now  available  online  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  website  but  I  can  give  us  some 

updates and highlights of this particular report.  The good news is that we are on track to achieve 

the GDP levels of pre-COVID in this financial year. 

</span></div><div><span>Although we have lost the four years of productivity in that time due to our very good financial 

stimulus  that  we  provided  during  COVID  we  have  enabled  our  industry  and  our  economy  to 

rebound very, very quickly so that this financial year we are back at the pre-COVID levels.   

</span></div><div><span>You mentioned the Pacific growth rate around 3 percent for the region, our growth rate for the 

Cook Islands is just under 10 percent in the same period.  So this is of course all on the back of the 

recovery of our tourism industry and despite our visitor arrival numbers still being about 20 percent 

less than pre-</span><span>COVID levels, it’s clear that the revenue that’s been generated is more on a per capita 

</span><span>basis than what was pre-COVID. 

</span></div><div><span>And of course the reason why we are not at the pre-COVID visitor arrival levels is because we are 

just a number of flights short during the week, maybe three or four flights a week short and of 

course this has been due to the difficulties faced by Air New Zealand in particular trying to fill the 

demand. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Members will recall prior to COVID that we had Air New Zealand, we had Jetstar and we had 

Virgin Australia flying into our country so those three or four flights that we have a short fall on 

</span><span>represent the carrying load that the Virgin Australia flights used to bring into our country. 

</span></div><div><span>But despite that we have been able to build up our airline links also with Hawaiian Airlines as we 

</span><span>see and also Jetstar’s direct flights from Sydney which next year will increase to  four flights a 

</span><span>week. 

</span></div><div><span>And of course let us not forget our improving connectivity with French Polynesia and Tahiti with 

three to four flights a week flying in and enabling the connection to the North American market 

through Papeete.  But the government is committed to accelerating our economic growth so that 

</span><span>we can recover those four years of lost prosperity during COVID.  We cannot just rely on our 

</span><span>tourism; we have to look at diversifying our economy, which is why today in this House we will 

see a Bill introduced which is a new financial product that we are looking to promote; that is the 

sound of the economy that you are hearing. 

</span></div><div><span>446 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>And of course let us not forget the work that our country has been involved in with the seabed 

minerals as a potential future prosperity for our country.  In this, our second year of exploration, 

there has been growing interest internationally on the shift towards renewable energy and the need 

for critical metals, which are contained in our seabed minerals. 

</span></div><div><span>We are at a point in time in the world where there is a convergence of interest in countries procuring 

critical metals for their renewable energy, but also looking at ways to diversify that supply away 

from current sources which at the moment, the critical metals that are being looked after.  Those 

sources are controlled by China as companies that own many of these mines and in particular, for 

cobalt the supply comes out of the Democratic Republic of Congo.   

</span></div><div><span>In  addition,  of  course,  the  many  driving  factor  behind  our  exploration  is  the  need  for  these 

companies to demonstrate the protection of our ocean and the means which we can harvest our 

nodules in a way that does not damage our ocean.  So, our very strong reliance on good sound 

science  and  evidence-based  decision  making  following  the  rule  of  law,  particularly  the  UN 

Convention of the Law of the Sea.  These are all the principles that we adhere to, in our Seabed 

Minerals sector. 

</span></div><div><span>So, all in all, Mr Speaker the outlook is that our economy is recovering and we are growing in a 

lot faster than many of our other pacific countries but we also do have the challenges that face, not 

just us but other countries, particularly the challenges of inflation. 

</span></div><div><span>I think this is enough as an answer to the question Mr Speaker.  So, thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Minister Albert 

Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and all your staff and all of us 

in this House and to our people listening in to our Sitting. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  bring  forth  some  information  to  answer  the  question  posed  to  myself 

yesterday by the Honourable Member from Akaoa, the Honourable Robert Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>So, basically Mr Speaker in a nutshell, there is not a coercive policy that overarches over these 

three agencies or four agencies which is TAU, Vodafone, TTV and ICI.  This is concerning the 

issue of road trenching for services.  So, Mr Speaker each utility operator has its own policy and 

construction standards to comply with.   

</span></div><div><span>A service coordination committee was formed back in 2019, comprising of TAU, Vodafone, TTV 

and ICI.  This committee meets every fortnight to discuss matters such as new developments, up-

coming work, future plans and any issues or changes.   I do  acknowledge the comments  of the 

</span><span>Honourable Member yesterday, that there seems to be no coordination between these agencies. 

</span></div><div><span>And I understand this concern Mr Speaker, because at the end of the day all these excess costs 

only go to put pressure on the end-user or the customer.  Such as trenching one trench as oppose 

</span></div><div><span>447 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>to trenching two separate trenches for services such as power, water or Vodafone.  As you are 

aware probably yourself, Honourable Speaker, all these costs are passed on to the customer. 

</span></div><div><span>And I guess what I am trying to say, Mr Speaker is this lack of coordination is putting surmountable 

pressure on our people.  After all, Mr Speaker, why two trenches when one would suffice.  So, I 

guess this is where the Honourable Members concerns is coming from or steaming from.  But I 

believe the Honourable Member will be satisfied to hear that I was informed this morning that a 

memorandum of understanding between all these agencies which is TAU, Vodafone, TTV and 

ICI. 

</span></div><div><span>It is soon to be signed in the next week.  This MOU, Mr Speaker, aims to formally document many 

of the improved processes and coordination work between these agencies with respect to trenching.  

Also, with new applications spacing requirements and spacing between service lines and future 

proving and cost savings. 

</span></div><div><span>I love the phrasing of these words, Mr Speaker but it remains to be seen whether it will be applied 

in the future.  So, I guess Mr Speaker in moving forward, I guess the onus is on the Honourable 

Member from Akaoa to keep reminding me, if these processes are not applied.  And the onus is on 

myself  as  Minister,  Honourable  Speaker  to  make  sure  that  these  processes  do  get  applied 

accordingly.  To help lower the cost to our people.  So, their life spending is easier. 

</span></div><div><span>I  hope  that  the  information  was  sufficient  to  answer  the  Honourable  Members  question  posed 

yesterday, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister and I see the Leader of the United Cook Island; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.   Kia Orana to all of us and our people listening to 

our parliament sitting.  

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  make  a  short  explanation  and  pose  my  question  to  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert 

Nicholas.  This is regards to our electricity and you have been in this work for a long time.  The 

Minister mentioned the lowering of the cost on our people and this is what came to my mind to 

</span><span>ask my question. 

</span></div><div><span>As we know Mr Speaker, the cost to lay a power line from the power pole to any home regardless 

of the distance, it is the homeowner that bears the cost and we can see that today.  Mr Speaker, this 

is a big burden that our people are taking.  The reason is they have to buy the meter box probably 

</span><span>supplied by CITC today and store it away at home to keep it dry.  Maybe in the future Mr Speaker 

if government can look into this and subsidise the cost faced by our people. I know the people are 

suffering because my company is involved in digging the trenches and laying of the cables. So, 

the question is if the government can assist. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  Honourable Member, you have the Floor?

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you to the Honourable Member from Murienua.  I am thinking if 

the T&amp;M digs the trenches free, maybe the cost will be less on our people.  Yes, Mr Speaker this 

has always been place by TAU from before and I think it also goes back to the time when the 

Member was the Deputy Prime Minister.  Mr Speaker, Te Aponga will lay the power likewise the 

waterworks and Vodafone to your boundary and it is up to you to run it from your boundary to 

your house.  It is not only the system here Mr Speaker but throughout the region it is the common 

practice but I heed the call of the Honourable Member from Murienua because there are certain 

aspects where new buildings are being built on hills.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, some new houses are being built about over 100 metres inland and it does not have a 

public road but a private access way.  However, according to TAU they will only bring the power 

where the public road ends and that is it.  If your house is more than 100 metres from the end of 

the public road, it will be a great burden on you.  Under the TAU policy Mr Speaker, it is your 

responsibility to pay all the costs from the end of the public road to your house.  However, if the 

family members want to build their houses around that area or behind you then if they connect to 

the line that you have paid then they have to pay a portion to you.  This is an area where the families 

are having difficulties and not aware of today.  

</span></div><div><span>I acknowledge the concerns Mr Speaker and I see it is about time to consider ways to lessen the 

burden on our people as the Honourable Member from Murienua has complained about.  However, 

seeing that we are coming to a close this year, maybe in the new year, I will have dialogue with 

the Board Chair and the CIIC to look at ways in reducing the burden on our people.  Nevertheless, 

I am putting the burden on you to also remind me of this issue so we can face it in the future. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member Teariki Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Also thank you for the clarification 

in  the  response  from  the  Honourable  Minister.    Before  the  second  question,  the  principles  and 

merits  on  this  has  already  been  explained  by  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    The  reason  Mr 

Speaker is that the explanation is clear to our people.  As he had stated, the person who wanted 

this service should pay for everything but once you switch the light on is when you start paying 

for it.  The intention in the request is if government through Te Aponga Uira has collected this 

money during all these times, then why can they not reduce some of the costs?  Not with T&amp;M, if 

</span><span>T&amp;M is not paid, then there is tax for us to claim in the country.  

</span></div><div><span>The second question Honourable Member is on the latest digging about two weeks ago on the main 

road in front of the dental at the Tupapa Outpatient. The question is why was this dug up again?  

It has been less than two years.  The problem is, how much more money are the taxpayers of this 

</span><span>country going to fork out to beautify this road again and yet it has already been beautified.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  Honourable Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Member 

for that question.  The situation on this road is that it was already worked on before I took this 

post.  I am not sure whether it was during the time when the Member was the Minister for CIIC 

</span></div><div><span>449 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>but I cannot be too sure.  However, Mr Speaker the upgrading work that was done on this road 

back then was a test run at the time.  They were trying out bitumen mixtures to find out whether it 

would be appropriate to use to tar seal the road.</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>The  Secretary  at  the  time  has  said  this  test  run  be  conducted  at  the 

Outpatient  road  and  I  believe  that  job  was  conducted  in  a  span  of  a  hundred  metres  and  the 

arrangement at the time was that Triad will come back and do the job again when the time is right. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to everyone this afternoon.  

I rise Mr Speaker as I look at Standing Order 244, it is very simple, ask the question and give the 

answer  and  the  answer  must  be  concise  and  to  the  point.    Our  responses  to  the  questions  this 

afternoon  is  boring.    So,  I  would  like  to  ask  that  when  a  question  is  posed  and  the  answer  be 

concise. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:   </span><span>May I ask Members to  remain in  your seats?  Honourable Members, we all 

understand how this Session is conducted.  There is no need to tell a story.  All you have to do is 

ask the question and the response be concise and precise at the same time.  Honourable Minister 

Albert Nicholas, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Yes, Mr Speaker like what Minister George Angene said in the past, this 

is Question Time and not story time. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion to my response, Mr Speaker it has already been arranged that at a certain time, Triad 

will come back and work on this road.  However, we had the election and that is the cause of the 

delay on the work.  So, now before they move on to the roading work in Muri, they have been 

instructed to complete the job in Tupapa before moving on to another village and that is what we 

can see with the road work in Tupapa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please bear with me Honourable Leader of the Opposition, I feel for the Member 

next  to  you as I think this is  the third time he had tried to  stand up and please, let us give the 

opportunity to him to ask his question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VARU:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  You are quite right in saying I have tried to get up three 

or four times to raise my question.  Perhaps my question is more significant.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker and your staff in this House and to the government side, your 

</span><span>Leader, the Opposition side and the three of us in our corner, our Leader, Kia Orana.  Kia Orana 

to our people listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>My question, Mr Speaker is  to the Honourable Minister Nicholas but  I see that he is  busy this 

</span><span>morning.  I believe Mr Speaker today or tomorrow are our final days for the Meeting of this House.  

</span><span>I would like to pose this question to the Minister before the end of this year.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>My question has been an issue raised in our village of Arorangi and I would like them to hear the 

response  from  the  Minister  this  afternoon.    The  question  here  Honourable  Minister  is  what  is 

</span><span>government’s plan or arrangement for the tarsealing of the roads in our constituency?  This is my 

</span><span>plea to you Minister, if it is possible for you to tell us and I am sure they are listening in Puaikura.  

I have asked this question many times in the past.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I believe that the Minister will give you a 

short answer. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:    </span><span>I  think,  Mr  Speaker  I  would  like  to  tell  a  story  before  I  answer  this 

question.  However, I see my aunty on that side is not happy when I got up.  So, to briefly answer 

</span><span>the  question  from  the  Honourable  Member  for  Ruaau,  Ngatangiia’s  road  is  done  so  when 

</span><span>Titikaveka is completed then we will proceed to Puaikura.  I believe that is a very clear answer but 

do not ask me when it will be done because money speaks for everything.  However, the work on 

our main road in Rarotonga we will come back to Nikao then to Titikaveka then to you Arorangi. 

</span></div><div><span>I know you will ask about your back road, the parts that are not completed towards the boundary 

of Akaoa.  Once the bitumen container arrives then we will discuss it further.  I believe the response 

is clear. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you have 

eight minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Yesterday, I asked a question on the 

charter  of  the  boat  to  Pukapuka  because  what  I  understand  is  that  charter  was  subsidized  by 

government to the tune of $637,000.  When the Member for Pukapuka/Nassau gave his answer, 

he was explaining how long it took to arrange the charter. 

</span></div><div><span>So this is the question, there are three questions, if it is  possible to  confirm  that this charter is 

subsidized by the taxpayers money.  Secondly, if the government have a policy, because we have 

not seen this policy that holidays in the Pa Enua will be subsidized and three, if the answer is yes 

there is a policy then can we have a copy or share to us how we can access that assistance.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Tingika 

Elikana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for the question posed 

</span><span>to this House.  As I had mentioned yesterday in this House, there was a time span of about three 

years in the planning and preparation for this trip.   

</span></div><div><span>The question that was asked yesterday was, how did we access to this charter?  That is why I took 

</span><span>some time to come back with my reply because I had to go back in time to formulate a responsible 

</span><span>reply in regards to the money to pay for the charter of this ship.  The amount of money for the 

charter is what the company, Samoa Shipping Corporation; owner of the ship gave us $637,000.  

This is what the government paid so that we can get the ship.

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to what I mentioned yesterday.  The Minister of Finance and the Secretary of Finance 

they have made it quite clear that a return of the spending must come back to government.  As I 

told  you  that  the  fare  on  the  ship  is  $1,000  per  adult  one  way,  therefore  $2,000  return  trip  to 

Pukapuka back to Rarotonga.  The criteria for adults specified is 12 years upwards.  The children 

are  classified  from  2  years  up  to  12  years;  the  fare  for  children  one  way  to  Pukapuka  back  to 

Rarotonga  is  $250.    My  people  did  not  complain  they  are  happy  with  the  spending  of  the 

government, they eagerly paid the fares for this trip. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, can you answer the last question, the number 3? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  I cannot go there because I want them to understand the full story because 

the  question  is  like,  condemning  government  for  subsiding  this  charter.    The  fare  was  not 

subsidised by government and I was about to go on about the freight. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to the freight, the government gave the same rate given to all the Outer Islands.  Oh, I 

</span><span>see that our time is up…  </span><span>(Giggles).</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I think you should sit down Honourable Member, please. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span> The time is up and I will sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I think we will finish off from there and when we come back next year, I would 

like you to stand up again and finish off your answer. 

</span></div><div><span>We have come to the end of Question Time.
