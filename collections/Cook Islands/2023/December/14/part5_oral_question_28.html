<h3>Oral Question 28</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for the question posed 

</span><span>to this House.  As I had mentioned yesterday in this House, there was a time span of about three 

years in the planning and preparation for this trip.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The question that was asked yesterday was, how did we access to this charter?  That is why I took 

</span><span>some time to come back with my reply because I had to go back in time to formulate a responsible 

</span><span>reply in regards to the money to pay for the charter of this ship.  The amount of money for the 

charter is what the company, Samoa Shipping Corporation; owner of the ship gave us $637,000.  

This is what the government paid so that we can get the ship.

<div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>In regards to what I mentioned yesterday.  The Minister of Finance and the Secretary of Finance 

they have made it quite clear that a return of the spending must come back to government.  As I 

told  you  that  the  fare  on  the  ship  is  $1,000  per  adult  one  way,  therefore  $2,000  return  trip  to 

Pukapuka back to Rarotonga.  The criteria for adults specified is 12 years upwards.  The children 

are  classified  from  2  years  up  to  12  years;  the  fare  for  children  one  way  to  Pukapuka  back  to 

Rarotonga  is  $250.    My  people  did  not  complain  they  are  happy  with  the  spending  of  the 

government, they eagerly paid the fares for this trip.
