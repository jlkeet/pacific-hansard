<h3>Oral Question 30</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  I cannot go there because I want them to understand the full story because 

the  question  is  like,  condemning  government  for  subsiding  this  charter.    The  fare  was  not 

subsidised by government and I was about to go on about the freight. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In regards to the freight, the government gave the same rate given to all the Outer Islands.  Oh, I 

</span><span>see that our time is upâ€¦  </span><span>(Giggles).</span></div>
