<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you to the Honourable Member from Murienua.  I am thinking if 

the T&amp;M digs the trenches free, maybe the cost will be less on our people.  Yes, Mr Speaker this 

has always been place by TAU from before and I think it also goes back to the time when the 

Member was the Deputy Prime Minister.  Mr Speaker, Te Aponga will lay the power likewise the 

waterworks and Vodafone to your boundary and it is up to you to run it from your boundary to 

your house.  It is not only the system here Mr Speaker but throughout the region it is the common 

practice but I heed the call of the Honourable Member from Murienua because there are certain 

aspects where new buildings are being built on hills.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, some new houses are being built about over 100 metres inland and it does not have a 

public road but a private access way.  However, according to TAU they will only bring the power 

where the public road ends and that is it.  If your house is more than 100 metres from the end of 

the public road, it will be a great burden on you.  Under the TAU policy Mr Speaker, it is your 

responsibility to pay all the costs from the end of the public road to your house.  However, if the 

family members want to build their houses around that area or behind you then if they connect to 

the line that you have paid then they have to pay a portion to you.  This is an area where the families 

are having difficulties and not aware of today.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I acknowledge the concerns Mr Speaker and I see it is about time to consider ways to lessen the 

burden on our people as the Honourable Member from Murienua has complained about.  However, 

seeing that we are coming to a close this year, maybe in the new year, I will have dialogue with 

the Board Chair and the CIIC to look at ways in reducing the burden on our people.  Nevertheless, 

I am putting the burden on you to also remind me of this issue so we can face it in the future.
