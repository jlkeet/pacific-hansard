<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Also thank you for the clarification 

in  the  response  from  the  Honourable  Minister.    Before  the  second  question,  the  principles  and 

merits  on  this  has  already  been  explained  by  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    The  reason  Mr 

Speaker is that the explanation is clear to our people.  As he had stated, the person who wanted 

this service should pay for everything but once you switch the light on is when you start paying 

for it.  The intention in the request is if government through Te Aponga Uira has collected this 

money during all these times, then why can they not reduce some of the costs?  Not with T&amp;M, if 

</span><span>T&amp;M is not paid, then there is tax for us to claim in the country.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The second question Honourable Member is on the latest digging about two weeks ago on the main 

road in front of the dental at the Tupapa Outpatient. The question is why was this dug up again?  

It has been less than two years.  The problem is, how much more money are the taxpayers of this 

</span><span>country going to fork out to beautify this road again and yet it has already been beautified.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div>
