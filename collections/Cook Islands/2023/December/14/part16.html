Constituency on the island of Aitutaki.  To all the Island Council Members, Merry Christmas and 

Happy New Year to you all.  To our bereaved families, may the Lord blesses you all.

and with the upcoming Communion, may God bless you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I was not going to convey any Seasonal Greetings for my elderly members of my Constituency 

because next week Wednesday, I am going to host a feast for all of them.  Please note, this is not 

a campaign, it is a way of giving back and thanking all my elderly people for their time is near, 

and it is our responsibility to care and to provide them with some piece offering and not wait until 

they pass away, other people might reap the benefits.  Therefore, may God bless us all.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>to enable us to enter this House.  God bless you all for all your support, and special greetings to 

our elderlies who we need to look after well after all, they have taken good care of us all.  To you 

Mr Speaker and the two Clerks, a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>For the information of all Members, the Member of Parliament for Mauke has 

already hosted his Christmas reception and I know for sure he will hold another reception next 

week.  Therefore, may this also apply to those Members who have already hosted the elderlies 

prior Christmas. Now I would like to ask the Leader of the Opposition to the floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker for giving us the Democratic 

</span><span>Party time to express  our Season’s  </span><span>Greetings to  our people.  Firstly, to you, Clerk and staff of 

Parliament, we wish to thank you all for the administration of this House during our Parliamentary 

</span><span>Sittings.  Season’s greetings to the Prime Minister and your good wife and family, Deputy Prime</span><span>

Minister, your wife and  family  and all Ministers, those  I like  and those  I do not  like and your 

</span><span>wives.  Season’s Greetings to  all Members of Parliament on that side and your wives.  To the 

Leader of the One Cook Islands, thank you for your season’s wishes</span><span> to us and also the United 

Party.    On  behalf  of  the  Democratic  Party,  not  just  from  the  Democratic  Party  but  from  the 

Members  of  Mangaia  and  Matavera,  since  only  one  spoke-person  is  allowed  to  convey  our 

Christmas wishes.  

</span></div><div><span>At this juncture, we would like </span><span>to convey our season’s wishes to the King’s Representative and 

</span><span>his wife and their family.  To the many faith based organisations in the Cook Islands, please accept 

our best wishes for the season.  To the Kaumaiti Nui and Kaumaiti Iti, House of Ariki and Koutu 

Nui, our good wishes for the season.  To Numangatini and the Kavanas of Mangaia, if you are 

listening to the radio, on behalf of your Members, I convey their best wishes for the season.  To 

our  Democratic  Party  executives,  we  give  our  warm  wishes  for  the  hard  work  rendered  in 

supporting us since they were only elected in office for a year however, our warm wishes to you 

all  and  everyone  listening  in  the  Northern  Group  and  Southern  Group.    Those  in  prison,  the 

vulnerable namely elderlies, children, infir</span><span>med/destitute our season’s greetings to you all. </span></div><div><span>To the island of Rakahanga, since it is common for me to travel to Rakahanga prior Christmas 

however, due to  the busyness  of flights and lack of funds by Parliament,  no flight charter was 

available  to  take  us  to  the  North.    Perhaps  there  will  be  sufficient  funds  in  the  Supplementary 

</span><span>Budget that will enable us to travel Northern Group.   

</span></div><div><span>To the Mayor, Island Councillors and all public servants, our three faith-based churches, Catholic, 

SDA and CICC, all our elderlies, youth and children with particular mention to Papa Te our oldest 

man; I give you my Christmas greetings.  Since I cannot join you nevertheless, until such time we 

</span><span>are able to charter a boat we will send your food parcels for your celebrations next year.  Christmas 

is about the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.  It is about how He came to give us love, hope and joy.  

Therefore, during Christmas we should be sharing love, hope and joy with our families.  Put aside 

</span><span>politics and enjoy each other’s com</span><span>pany so Merry Christmas and Happy New year to all of us.  

</span><span>Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>Now I call on the Prime Minister for your Season’s Greetings.</span></div><div><span>465

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  very  much  Mr  Speaker.    Firstly,  Kia  Orana  to  everyone  in 

particular to all Members of this House.  To you Mr Speaker, Clerk and Staff of Parliament, Merry 

Christmas to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I wish to greet our King’s Representative Sir Tom Marsters and Lady Tuaine Marsters and our 

retired  former  Queen’s  Representative  Sir  Frederick  Goodwin  whom  we  </span><span>met  yesterday  at  our 

funeral service and it was wonderful to see his activeness.  Greetings to our Ui Ariki of our country, 

Kaumaiti Nui, Ui Ariki of all islands and special greetings to the Ui ariki of Teau o Tonga, Makea, 

Karika, Vakatini and Numangatini and your tribes.  

</span></div><div><span>At  this  moment  I  would  like  to  really  Mr  Speaker,  acknowledge  my  Cabinet  and  our  Caucus 

Members of the government side for the tremendous work they have done this year.  This has been 

an  exceptional  year  for  our  country  and  the  Ministers  that  I  have  in  our  cabinet,  our  associate 

ministers, and our assistant ministers have all done their part to carry the load.  

</span></div><div><span>This was also the year that we were appointed the Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum so aside from 

doing our own national duties; it was my privilege and honour to be representing our Pacific as 

well.  So, in saying that, if I look back in this year my first engagement was to re-despatch to Japan 

to meet with the Prime Minister of Japan to raise our concerns in the Pacific about the discharge 

of the nuclear waste water in Japan.  And it was from there I was invited to the G7 meeting again 

hosted in Hiroshima to carry the Pacific Islands flag at this particular very prestigious meeting of 

the 7 biggest economies in the world.  

</span></div><div><span>From there, to the India Summit with the Pacific Island countries in the US summit in the Pacific 

Island countries in PNG then to the UN General Assembly where for the first time the Cook Islands 

sat behind their name and flag in the United Nations in addressing the assembly. Also from there 

the presidential  summit again  where  I had the honour to  co-chair our presidential  summit with 

President Joe Biden at the White House.  

</span></div><div><span>In addition, of course from there, an invitation extended to the Cook Islands to attend a conference 

at  the  International  Energy  Agency  the  only  Pacific  island  country  to  be  invited  and  the  only 

country that deals with minerals. This particular conference was to do with critical minerals supply 

and we were there with some of the biggest mining companies in the world and some of the biggest 

</span><span>mining countries in the world.  

</span></div><div><span>Of course we wrapped up this year here with our Pacific Islands Forum hosting of our leaders and 

what  a terrific outcome  that was  and  I still have very good comments  from  all  the people that 

attended our hosting of our Pacific Island Leaders forum and again, I take my hat off to our team 

</span><span>that put their hands up to really help out in what was in some challenging circumstances.  

</span></div><div><span>And the year wrapped up of course with my attendance at the COP meeting in Dubai just last week 

</span><span>where one of the outcomes from our leader’s meeting, the Pacific Resilience Fund Facility (PRFF).  

</span><span>The PRFF was something that we put together nearly 6 years ago as Finance Ministers to help 

</span><span>Pacific countries access climate financing much more quickly than we normally would through 

the Green Climate Fund.  At our Pacific Forum Leaders meeting in November, Saudi Arabia flew 

here in their private jet and their Minister contributed $50 million towards this facility that we had 

</span></div><div><span>466 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>set up.  The COP meeting just last week, Australia has committed $100 million to it and so we are 

well on our way towards our target of a half a billion dollars to help Pacific island countries with 

resilience  building    projects  in  the  face  of  climate  change,  foreshore  protection,  infrastructure 

protection, all of these things that are affecting our small island countries.  So, a good result for 

our Pacific, a very good result for the Cook Islands in that our profile in the international stage has 

never been as high as it is today.  

</span></div><div><span>So, with my cabinet team, I would like to acknowledge Minister Mokoroa for his dedication and 

work  in  the  Ministry  of  Justice  and  also  in  the  Ministry  of  Education  where  we  have  a  new 

Secretary that will be coming on board in the new year and we have to set ourselves some new 

challenges to improve the academic achievements of our students to try and find the gaps why 

some  like  our  girls  are  doing  well  but  why  our  boys  are  not  achieving  the  same  in  academic.  

Minister Mokoroa has done a tremendous job to get that moving. 

</span></div><div><span>Minister Maggie, since he became the Minister for Corrective Services, we have seen the co-horde 

of prison inmates at a high of 60 has now dropped to just over 30 nearly half but during his time 

as a Minister, there has not been one-person break out of jail during that time.  That is because the 

approach that he takes, he goes up every morning during their devotion, he is up there.  He is up 

there  every  night  when  they  have  their  Closing  Prayer.    These  are  not  the  usual  way  that 

government  service operates but  of  course this is  not  a usual  Minister that  we have and it is  a 

unique one and he is getting the result, so thank you very much minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Deputy Prime Minister, in charge of our Transportation portfolio again, as a big load to carry in 

the new year with our new ship that is coming in and looking at ways to improve our transportation 

links domestically but also internationally.  

</span></div><div><span>Minister Rose here with the responsibility for the Ministry of Health, one of our most important 

Ministries where the government was able to change its policy on the referral patients this year 

because of the big demand of people who needed urgent surgery urgent medical care to allow for 

private surgeries to be undertaken at the cost of the government.  This is a change in policy that 

we did because we recognise that there is a need to put more money into this area.  There is people 

who are sick that must undergo urgent surgery and not without having to wait in the waiting line 

but go through private surgery.  We have been able to implement this new policy even though it 

</span><span>added cost, it is something that we as a government recognise and needed to be done, so thank you 

very much. 

</span></div><div><span>And of course our Minister for Infrastructure Cook Islands has been going flat out since this year 

as we can see with the road works has been done but some of the other achievements that have 

</span><span>been done also include our harbour in Avatiu.  So, in Aitutaki that has been dredged right out, 

there was a long work in progress but that is worked really well and also, just the launching of the 

new 90 tonne crane in Aitutaki.  Some of the things that we are looking at making sure we put into 

practice.  Our new ship that I mention that is arriving next year to improve our inter island domestic 

</span><span>shipping service.  That is going to be a real game change for our country.  

</span></div><div><span>And of course, the Pa Enua tax that we amended that we passed in June that took effect in July.  

So, to our people in the Pa Enua who are employed, do not forget from July to December this year,

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>you will not pay taxes unless your wages reach $60k per annum tax free threshold so all of these 

things are to try and improve the lives of our people.  And this year of course, even though it was 

challenging, we managed to increase our Old Age Pension, increase it by a few more dollars, we 

increased our care-givers payments again, another important  area that we wanted to look after.  

The destitute and vulnerable again, another increase in those and also next week, our Christmas 

bonus will be paid to those qualified to collect next week and this will be paid into our accounts 

so congratulations.  

</span></div><div><span>Another appreciation to all public servants on Rarotonga as well as in the Pa Enua.  On that note, 

our warm wishes to all our people in the Pa Enua in Mangaia, Aitutaki, Ngaputoru, Mitiaro, Mauke 

and Atiu from the government.  Also to the Northern Group Islands Pukapuka/Nassau, Manihiki, 

Rakahanga,  Tongareva,  Pamati  and  us  on  Tumutevarovaro,  have  a  very  safe  and  prosperous 

Christmas to us all.  

</span></div><div><span>I have just outline this year what we have done and next year, we will work full speed once we 

commence in February with our Supplementary Budget that has been mentioned.  We have a full 

program ahead of us for next year so whilst now this is a short relaxing time for us Members as 

next year we will go full speed no hand brakes. 

</span></div><div><span>Words  of  comfort  is  extended  to  bereaved  families  who  have  lost  loved  one  around  this  time 

especially Christmas time.  As has been mentioned, Christmas is a time of remembrance of the 

birth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who gave us the gift of eternal life, eternal spiritual life.  

So, enjoy the life that we have over this Christmas period and be safe.  To those who will get sick, 

here is the good news that a law has been passed for a new drug that you can try in the coming 

</span><span>weeks once the King’s Representative enacts it.  So, with those good news, Merry Christmas and 

</span><span>Happy New Year to all.  Kia Orana e kia manuia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you very much to all the Leaders of the different Parties in our country.  

</span><span>My  personal  season’s  greetings  to  the  Solicitor  General  and  his  family,  Merry  Christmas  and 

</span><span>Happy New Year.  Secondly, to my wife, children and grandchildren, Merry Christmas and Happy 

New Year to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  members,  we  have  come  to  the  end  of  our  business  for  today.    We  now  adjourn
