</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I now call the Chairperson of the Bills, Petitions and Papers Committee, the Honourable Akaiti

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. PUNA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, Pursuant to Standing Order 156 (1) I move:

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion?  I can see 

the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I rise to voice a couple of concerns in regards to 

</span><span>this particular Paper in this Report.  I think it is timely to remind our Members and our listeners 

</span><span>that this is not a </span><span>Government Bill, this is a Private Member’s Bill.</span></div><div><span>459 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I am well aware that in the public consultations that took place around Rarotonga that there was a 

number of concerns raised by members of the public about the consequences of this particular Bill 

and that there have been some calls in these consultations for more time, for more consultations to 

take place in regards to this Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>In  that  regard  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  suggest  that  Recommendation  No.  2,  be  prioritised  in  the 

recommendations of this Report, that the appointment of a Sub-Committee to assist the Committee 

with the review of the Bills to take place as a precedence before any further consultations take 

place. 

</span></div><div><span>It occurs to me that this Bill has not gone through the proper government rigor of assessment that 

it  would  normally  have  done  if  it  was  a  government  sponsored  Bill.    So,  I  would  very  much 

welcome the input of the likes of our Crown Law office, our Ministry of Justice and any other 

government  entities  to  very  seriously  review  this  particular  Bill  and  as  proposed  in  the 

Recommendations, ensure that there are no unintended consequences. 

</span></div><div><span>So, with those provisos Mr Speaker, I second the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Prime Minister Mark Brown 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you and can I have the Leader of the Opposition, now. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I thought I was to second the Motion because I am 

the Vice-Chairman of this Committee.  I stand however to give some comfort to the Prime Minister 

comments  as  those  thoughts  are  the  views  of  this  Committee  and  that  is  to  appoint  a  Sub-

Committee who are more enlightened than we are to scrutinise these two Bills properly. 

</span></div><div><span>And with the inputs and assistance of the expert committee then after that we will then conduct a 

public consultation  to  the public and Outer  Islands.  Of course, this is  the practice as we have 

known, Mr Speaker with some amendments to be made to the Bills and there will be some minor 

impacts that we may not detect in the first place.  As you have stated to those agencies these will 

be those appointed to the Sub-Committee, experts. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I render my support to this Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Let me make the announcement: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Prime Minister and  

with the dual support from the Leader of the Opposition 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>460 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee, the Honourable Tingika Elikana, on the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, before I move a Motion regarding Paper 125, entitled </span><span>–</span><span> Report 

by the Public Accounts Committee Annual Review 2021-2022 and Other Reviews.   

</span></div><div><span>If I may just say a few words on this Paper Mr Speaker, and that is to thank the hard work of the 

Committee Members of the Public Accounts Committee.  Also, the advisor who is our Auditor, 

for the hard work that they put into reviewing the Reports which relates to the finalisation of the 

Report now before Parliament.  I would like to edge all Members of Parliament to take time to 

read the Report.  And more so, our Ministers responsible for Government entities and State-Owned 

entities  and  Crown  agencies  as  there  are  very  important  matters  that  we  need  to  take  into 

consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>I will not be going into all of them but to just pick on one very important point and I hope the Head 

of  Ministries  are  listening  into  the  radio.    The  Committee  found  a  disconnection  between  the 

business plan outputs presented to Parliament, which led to the appropriation of sums from the 

public purse to those Ministries and entities.  Unfortunately, in their Reports, it was very difficult 

for  the  Committee  to  see  in  terms  of  how  these  funds  were  used,  an  area  of  concern  that  the 

Committee have found, to improve our accountability and our use of public funds within the public 

service, the Crown agencies and the State-Owned Enterprises. 

</span></div><div><span>I think I need to comment on behalf of the Committee.  Parliament appropriate funds to Ministries, 

Agencies  and  Crown  entities.    Therefore,  Government  Agencies,  State-Owned  Enterprises  and 

Crown Agencies must account the funds being used back to Parliament.  The reason why I brought 

this  up  is  that  some  of  the  Ministries,  Crown  Agencies  and  State-Owned  Enterprises  failed  to 

provide their Reports on the performance plans and expenditure to the Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>That besides, Mr Speaker, in accordance with Standing Orders 156 (1), I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament take note of the Report by the 

Public Accounts Committee Annual Review 2021-2022 and Other Reviews 

which are hereby refer to the various government agencies for implementation of the 

</span><span>recommendations 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>recommendations. 

</span></div><div><span>  Thank  you. 

</span></div><div><span>  Seconded  by  the  Honourable  Tingika  Elikana  with 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I was moving the Motion, I think you need to ask for a Seconder, 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Sorry about that Honourable Members.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister Vaine Mokoroa</span></div><div><span>461
