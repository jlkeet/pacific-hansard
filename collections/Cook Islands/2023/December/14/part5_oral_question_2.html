<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity to ask a question.  My 

question is to the Leader of our Nation.  We know now that we have reach half of the year but I 

will thank the Leader of the Nation for answering the question I posed yesterday regarding the 

loans that was granted to our business people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I believe this is a simple question that I am asking and this is on the gross, the GDP of this nation.  

During the presentation of the Budget this year, he told us about the future projection of the growth 

of this Nation.  We all know this will be of benefit to whoever will govern our country and the 

work they are tasked to do according to the Budget.  The growth domestic product is something 

</span><span>that we believe will help our Nation.  We can see whether this is going up or going down because 

</span><span>some example it is being said that in the Pacific it has reached 3.3 percent. 

</span></div>
