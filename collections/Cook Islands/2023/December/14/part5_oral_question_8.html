<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and all your staff and all of us 

in this House and to our people listening in to our Sitting. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  bring  forth  some  information  to  answer  the  question  posed  to  myself 

yesterday by the Honourable Member from Akaoa, the Honourable Robert Heather. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, basically Mr Speaker in a nutshell, there is not a coercive policy that overarches over these 

three agencies or four agencies which is TAU, Vodafone, TTV and ICI.  This is concerning the 

issue of road trenching for services.  So, Mr Speaker each utility operator has its own policy and 

construction standards to comply with.   

</span></div>
<div><span>A service coordination committee was formed back in 2019, comprising of TAU, Vodafone, TTV 

and ICI.  This committee meets every fortnight to discuss matters such as new developments, up-

coming work, future plans and any issues or changes.   I do  acknowledge the comments  of the 

</span><span>Honourable Member yesterday, that there seems to be no coordination between these agencies. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And I understand this concern Mr Speaker, because at the end of the day all these excess costs 

only go to put pressure on the end-user or the customer.  Such as trenching one trench as oppose

<div><span>Thursday, 14 December 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>to trenching two separate trenches for services such as power, water or Vodafone.  As you are 

aware probably yourself, Honourable Speaker, all these costs are passed on to the customer. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And I guess what I am trying to say, Mr Speaker is this lack of coordination is putting surmountable 

pressure on our people.  After all, Mr Speaker, why two trenches when one would suffice.  So, I 

guess this is where the Honourable Members concerns is coming from or steaming from.  But I 

believe the Honourable Member will be satisfied to hear that I was informed this morning that a 

memorandum of understanding between all these agencies which is TAU, Vodafone, TTV and 

ICI. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is soon to be signed in the next week.  This MOU, Mr Speaker, aims to formally document many 

of the improved processes and coordination work between these agencies with respect to trenching.  

Also, with new applications spacing requirements and spacing between service lines and future 

proving and cost savings. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I love the phrasing of these words, Mr Speaker but it remains to be seen whether it will be applied 

in the future.  So, I guess Mr Speaker in moving forward, I guess the onus is on the Honourable 

Member from Akaoa to keep reminding me, if these processes are not applied.  And the onus is on 

myself  as  Minister,  Honourable  Speaker  to  make  sure  that  these  processes  do  get  applied 

accordingly.  To help lower the cost to our people.  So, their life spending is easier. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I  hope  that  the  information  was  sufficient  to  answer  the  Honourable  Members  question  posed 

yesterday, thank you.
