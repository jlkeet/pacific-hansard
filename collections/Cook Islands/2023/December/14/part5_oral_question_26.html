<h3>Oral Question 26</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Yesterday, I asked a question on the 

charter  of  the  boat  to  Pukapuka  because  what  I  understand  is  that  charter  was  subsidized  by 

government to the tune of $637,000.  When the Member for Pukapuka/Nassau gave his answer, 

he was explaining how long it took to arrange the charter. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So this is the question, there are three questions, if it is  possible to  confirm  that this charter is 

subsidized by the taxpayers money.  Secondly, if the government have a policy, because we have 

not seen this policy that holidays in the Pa Enua will be subsidized and three, if the answer is yes 

there is a policy then can we have a copy or share to us how we can access that assistance.  Thank 

you.
