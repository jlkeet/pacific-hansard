<div><span>OBITUARIES 

</span></div><div><span>I have noticed some of our community members who have passed on and I would like to convey 

our condolences to all those affected. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, to Mama Mavis Aitupari, an Aunt for one of our Members of Parliament, we would like 

to  express  our  deepest  condolences  to  the  family  of  this  Mama  and  to  her  nephew  here  in 

Parliament.  I know Mama Mavis Aitupari; she is a hardworking woman of Takuvaine, who is 

involved  in  many  active  groups.    This  news  of  her  passing  is  very  shocking,  but  I  wanted  to 

acknowledge her husband, perhaps some of you know him.  I want to share a story about him.   

</span></div><div><span>This Papa is a former student of Mitiaro Primary School, which many teachers disliked him.  In 

those days, when it comes to English Spelling in the mornings, one of the teachers will always find 

a way for this Papa to make a mistake.  On this particular morning, when their English Spelling 

started, the teacher called this Papa to stand up and to spell the word CROCODILE.  This Papa 

started to panic and then he started spelling the word crocodile, C-O-C-O-N-U-T.  Everybody was 

laughing at him including the teacher knowing that he was wrong.  The teacher went back to his 

office and when he realised the word that this Papa had spelt, he had spelt COCONUT and not 

CROCODILE.   

</span></div><div><span>This  is  a  lesson  for  us  all  not  to  judge  people  by  their  character.    Therefore,  I  would  like  to 

acknowledge him for caring his wife regardless of his attitude and character.

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, our condolences to the family of Tangaina Patia from Tutakimoa, who is also from the 

island of Mauke, who also holds a Mataiapo Title.  Therefore, our sincerest condolences to his 

wife and to the entire family in New Zealand and on Mauke as well.  Papa Tangaina Patia is an 

entertainer for the people of Tupapa especially in sports such as rugby, for being the fastest player 

in Team Number 1; I am faster though.   

</span></div><div><span>Our third Obituary Notice is to one of our former Member of Parliament, Mr Manuela Kitai.  We 

all  know  him,  for  he  has  been  a  Member  of  Parliament  for  quite  some  time,  representing  the 

Constituency of Vaipae-Vaipeka-Tautu.  Therefore, on behalf of this Honourable House, we would 

like  to  convey  our  deepest  condolences  to  this  Member  who  have  passed  away  and  to  those 

mentioned above.
