<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for Matavera for his 

important question.  During the COVID period, government granted loans to businesses to help 

them, there was about 151 businesses or loans that were issued out, and they totalled about $6.9 

</span><span>million in loans at a rate of 3 percent per annum.  But if it was repaid within 12 months, it would 

</span><span>be a 1 percent interest rate.

<div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>This is the update to everyone, as of the end of September.  There are 116 loans remaining out of 

the 151 and the outstanding balance is $3.6 million.  So, almost $3.3 million of loans has been 

repaid as well as small amount of interest. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, some businesses are doing better than others and are taking longer to repay their loans.  So, 

out  of the remaining 116 loans there are 47 loans that are in  arrears.  And the total  amount of 

arrears on those loans that are behind is approximately $300,000.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, we can say then, that out of the $6.9 million that was lent out, the arrears represent less than 5 

percent.  And the name of this particular facility, Mr Speaker is the Business Continuity Credit 

Facility and it is managed by the Bank of the Cook Islands.  I have to say, this is one of the better 

initiatives that we have put in place during COVID, Mr Speaker because it certainly, helped the 

number of our businesses to stay afloat when our borders were closed.  And better than that, it 

enabled them to hit the ground running when we opened our borders for our tourism.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.
