<div><span>ORAL QUESTIONS 

</span></div><div><span>It is now question time and that will be for 30 minutes.  As expected, I see the Honourable Vaitoti 

Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to convey some words of condolences to those who have 

passed away as per  your announcement.  Firstly, to the family of Mr Manuela Kitai, as he had 

served in this House in previous years as a Member of Parliament, I believe we started together.  

Therefore, to his family, please accept my condolences for the passing of Papa Kitai. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, to Papa Tangaina Patia, as alluded by you Mr Speaker, they usually congregate at the 

Avatiu  Harbour  and  right  now,  most  of  them  have  passed  away.    Therefore,  my  words  of 

condolences to the families of Papa Tangaina Patia.  I also believe that the Member of Parliament 

for Tupapa and I played rugby with him for Tupapa. 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, to our Mama Mavis, she had worked with my mum, Mama Ngai in Takuvaine and her 

partner Tuku Tunoa, I believe we were at Tereora together in 1971.  He is a well-known rugby 

player  for  Takuvaine  and  he  was  a  very  good  Mathematician;  not  too  sure  about  Spelling  but 

definitely a good Mathematician. 

</span></div><div><span>My question, Mr Speaker goes out to the Prime Minister.  During the COVID, an illustration Mr 

Speaker, the government gave some grants to help some of the businesses in the country; I believe 

the  amount  was  about  $7  million.    Mr  Speaker,  according  to  an  article  published  in  the  Cook 

Islands  News  on  16  August  2023;  there  were  funds  that  the  businesses  did  not  use  and  the 

government have asked for reimbursement.  Apparently, according to an agreement between the 

government and businesses, these agreements were not completed.  Therefore, I wanted to thank 

the government for helping these businesses during COVID.  As for the unused funds, if this can 

be returned, maybe the government can use it to help with some of their work. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister,  my  question  is  what  is  the  update  of  the  funds  granted  to  these 

</span><span>businesses in terms of reimbursement? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for Matavera for his 

important question.  During the COVID period, government granted loans to businesses to help 

them, there was about 151 businesses or loans that were issued out, and they totalled about $6.9 

</span><span>million in loans at a rate of 3 percent per annum.  But if it was repaid within 12 months, it would 

</span><span>be a 1 percent interest rate. 

</span></div><div><span>428 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 13 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>This is the update to everyone, as of the end of September.  There are 116 loans remaining out of 

the 151 and the outstanding balance is $3.6 million.  So, almost $3.3 million of loans has been 

repaid as well as small amount of interest. 

</span></div><div><span>So, some businesses are doing better than others and are taking longer to repay their loans.  So, 

out  of the remaining 116 loans there are 47 loans that are in  arrears.  And the total  amount of 

arrears on those loans that are behind is approximately $300,000.   

</span></div><div><span>So, we can say then, that out of the $6.9 million that was lent out, the arrears represent less than 5 

percent.  And the name of this particular facility, Mr Speaker is the Business Continuity Credit 

Facility and it is managed by the Bank of the Cook Islands.  I have to say, this is one of the better 

initiatives that we have put in place during COVID, Mr Speaker because it certainly, helped the 

number of our businesses to stay afloat when our borders were closed.  And better than that, it 

enabled them to hit the ground running when we opened our borders for our tourism.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Robert Heather; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  R.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Firstly,  Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister  and 

everyone in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>My question, Mr Speaker is to the Minister for the Cook Islands Investment Corporation and this 

is in regards to the Te Aponga Uira and the To Tatou Vai.  I would like to shorten my question 

because these issues have been brought to my attention by our people. 

</span></div><div><span>The issue here is the digging of the trenches for electricity.  We know in the past that these cables 

and pipes are laid all at once; the electricity, the water pipes and the telephone lines.  The problem 

we see today is there are two digging of trenches and the one for the Te Aponga Uira electricity 

lines and the pipes for To Tatou Vai.  This is beneficial to the businesses responsible for these 

kinds of jobs but not for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Since  our  people  have  to  pay  twice  to  the  To  Tatou  Vai  and  as  well  to  the  Te  Aponga  Uira.  

</span><span>Therefore, my question to the Minister Responsible for CIIC is, whether you are aware of what is 

happening or whether there is a new policy for this kind of projects. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert 

Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Now, I am looking at the time, maybe it is best 

</span><span>that we take a break for lunch before I answer the Honourable Members’ questi</span><span>on. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I suspend our Sitting until we come back after lunch. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting Suspended at 2.23 p.m.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 13 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.12 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please be seated. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  we  adjourned,  the  Honourable  Minister  Albert  Nicholas  was  about  to  take  the  Floor.  

Therefore, now we are back, I am calling the Honourable Minister back on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff and those who 

are in this House.  Also, extend the greetings to our people who are listening in and watching as 

well.  

</span></div><div><span>I want to thank the Honourable Member from Akaoa for asking this question just before we went 

for lunch.  So, during the break, I tried to contact these two agencies that are responsible to me and 

there was  no reply.  Mr Speaker,  I wanted to  dig  deep into the question that  was  asked by the 

Honourable Member because I agree, he is right  in that this job was done inappropriately.  Mr 

Speaker, when you look at our roads today there are works that still needs to be done to beautify 

our roads.  Government is making a huge investment in our roads.  Regardless of that, I agree it is 

</span><span>not  appropriate  at  what  these  departments  or  agencies  and  SOE’s  are  doing  to  our  new  sealed 

</span><span>roads.  

</span></div><div><span>Briefly Mr Speaker, I would like to get to the bottom of this concern.  Just so we are aware Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, it is ICI’s policy that when you damage or do any work on our roads, you must return it 

</span><span>back to its original condition.  So, Honourable Speaker and the Honourable Member who asked 

the question, if I can be given some time to come back tomorrow and I will have a response to the 

question and for our people to hear.  I will come back tomorrow and let you know the policy that 

ICI now follows on the harmful effects to our roads.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER</span><span>:  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, 

Tina Pupuke Browne; you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to us all in this House.  I am 

not too sure who to ask the question to but I will direct it to the Minister of Finance.  These days, 

we are reading in the Cook Islands News about this chartered boat travelling to Pukapuka.  I am 

</span><span>interested in this charter because for us from the outer islands, we are interested in shipping.  When 

</span><span>I  think  about  it,  we  have  a  function  in  Rakahanga  next  year  and  the  question  is,  what  is  the 

</span><span>government’s policy on paying for the charter chartered by the Member from Pukapuka?  And, 

</span><span>how can I as a Member from Rakahanga apply for my family and relatives residing in New Zealand 

and Rarotonga qualify for a government subsidised trip to Rakahanga next year?  I was asking the 

question to the Minister of Finance. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I can see the Honourable 

Member Tingika Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>I thank the Honourable Member for the striking question.  I would like us all 

to understand that this venture has been planned for the past three years now.  During those time 

there were three groups of people that came together to discuss about it.  The first group were our 

</span></div><div><span>430 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 13 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>people from Tongareva as they wanted to travel back to take part in the opening of the newly built 

CICC Mission House in Omoka that was gutted by fire.  The second group was the Matauia Family 

from Palmerston Island and the third were our children from the island of Nassau with a couple of 

families from Pukapuka tagging along.   

</span></div><div><span>So, we all know that the CICC Mission house is incomplete so the Tongareva group withdrew.  

The  Matauia  Family  from  Palmerston  also  withdrew  because  they  are  not  ready  to  travel  to 

Palmerston.  And that leaves the Nassau families and a few from Pukapuka.  We know the vessel 

is already on its way and arrives in Nassau on Saturday morning.  They are very happy because 

this vessel has just been completed last year.  I was told that this boat can travel fast and I have sat 

in one of the seats, it feels like travelling on a plane. 

</span></div><div><span>I am thankful to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition for the question because this gave me 

an opportunity to thank the government on behalf of the people of Pukapuka.  As I have said, the 

Government of Japan had just handed over this vessel to the Samoan Government last year.  I am 

happy my people from Pukapuka and Nassau are the first passengers to travel on this boat apart 

from the Samoan people.  This is my short explanation.  The planning has been going on for three 

years and is not a sudden occurrence.  

</span></div><div><span>And the charter by government is in excess of just over half a million dollars.  But  I want  our 

people to understand that our leader who is responsible for our finances, and the Minister and I 

thought the people from China or India are the best economists and I want our people to know that 

the  boat  used  by  the  people  from  Nassau/Pukapuka  is  not  subsidised  by  government.    These 

passengers paid for their own fares and I will tell you the cost.  It is $2,000 per person for a return 

trip.  For us to travel on this boat, we would say it is very expensive.  However, the Minister of 

Finance and the Financial Secretary has done a good job according to the passengers onboard the 

ship.  

</span></div><div><span>The freight for their cargoes was paid at a subsidised rate.  The only drawback is to apologise to 

our people in Nga-Pu-Toru because the barge will be going to these islands.  Sorry, we do not have 

any  rice,  sugar  and  flour  in  store  because  everything  were  purchased  by  families  of 

Nassau/Pukapuka.  We should all be happy because these people came and bought the food from 

here, paid for the freight and their fares to help our people. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I have to interrupt you.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  The short answer to the Honourable Member is the airport in Manihiki will 

be finished next year.  Therefore, make use of the flights and leave the boat to us. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Tomorrow, you will reply to the Application Process of that project.
