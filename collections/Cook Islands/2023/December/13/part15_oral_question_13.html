<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>I thank the Honourable Member for the striking question.  I would like us all 

to understand that this venture has been planned for the past three years now.  During those time 

there were three groups of people that came together to discuss about it.  The first group were our

</span></div>
<div><span>Wednesday, 13 December 2023 

</span></div>
<div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div>
<div><span>people from Tongareva as they wanted to travel back to take part in the opening of the newly built 

CICC Mission House in Omoka that was gutted by fire.  The second group was the Matauia Family 

from Palmerston Island and the third were our children from the island of Nassau with a couple of 

families from Pukapuka tagging along.   

</span></div>
<div><span>So, we all know that the CICC Mission house is incomplete so the Tongareva group withdrew.  

The  Matauia  Family  from  Palmerston  also  withdrew  because  they  are  not  ready  to  travel  to 

Palmerston.  And that leaves the Nassau families and a few from Pukapuka.  We know the vessel 

is already on its way and arrives in Nassau on Saturday morning.  They are very happy because 

this vessel has just been completed last year.  I was told that this boat can travel fast and I have sat 

in one of the seats, it feels like travelling on a plane. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I am thankful to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition for the question because this gave me 

an opportunity to thank the government on behalf of the people of Pukapuka.  As I have said, the 

Government of Japan had just handed over this vessel to the Samoan Government last year.  I am 

happy my people from Pukapuka and Nassau are the first passengers to travel on this boat apart 

from the Samoan people.  This is my short explanation.  The planning has been going on for three 

years and is not a sudden occurrence.  

</span></div>
<div><span>And the charter by government is in excess of just over half a million dollars.  But  I want  our 

people to understand that our leader who is responsible for our finances, and the Minister and I 

thought the people from China or India are the best economists and I want our people to know that 

the  boat  used  by  the  people  from  Nassau/Pukapuka  is  not  subsidised  by  government.    These 

passengers paid for their own fares and I will tell you the cost.  It is $2,000 per person for a return 

trip.  For us to travel on this boat, we would say it is very expensive.  However, the Minister of 

Finance and the Financial Secretary has done a good job according to the passengers onboard the 

ship.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The freight for their cargoes was paid at a subsidised rate.  The only drawback is to apologise to 

our people in Nga-Pu-Toru because the barge will be going to these islands.  Sorry, we do not have 

any  rice,  sugar  and  flour  in  store  because  everything  were  purchased  by  families  of 

Nassau/Pukapuka.  We should all be happy because these people came and bought the food from 

here, paid for the freight and their fares to help our people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I have to interrupt you.  

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  The short answer to the Honourable Member is the airport in Manihiki will 

be finished next year.  Therefore, make use of the flights and leave the boat to us. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Tomorrow, you will reply to the Application Process of that project.
