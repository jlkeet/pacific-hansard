<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to us all in this House.  I am 

not too sure who to ask the question to but I will direct it to the Minister of Finance.  These days, 

we are reading in the Cook Islands News about this chartered boat travelling to Pukapuka.  I am 

</span><span>interested in this charter because for us from the outer islands, we are interested in shipping.  When 

</span><span>I  think  about  it,  we  have  a  function  in  Rakahanga  next  year  and  the  question  is,  what  is  the 

</span><span>governmentâ€™s policy on paying for the charter chartered by the Member from Pukapuka?  And, 

</span><span>how can I as a Member from Rakahanga apply for my family and relatives residing in New Zealand 

and Rarotonga qualify for a government subsidised trip to Rakahanga next year?  I was asking the 

question to the Minister of Finance.
