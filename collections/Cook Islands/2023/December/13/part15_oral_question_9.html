<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff and those who 

are in this House.  Also, extend the greetings to our people who are listening in and watching as 

well.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank the Honourable Member from Akaoa for asking this question just before we went 

for lunch.  So, during the break, I tried to contact these two agencies that are responsible to me and 

there was  no reply.  Mr Speaker,  I wanted to  dig  deep into the question that  was  asked by the 

Honourable Member because I agree, he is right  in that this job was done inappropriately.  Mr 

Speaker, when you look at our roads today there are works that still needs to be done to beautify 

our roads.  Government is making a huge investment in our roads.  Regardless of that, I agree it is 

</span><span>not  appropriate  at  what  these  departments  or  agencies  and  SOE’s  are  doing  to  our  new  sealed 

</span><span>roads.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Briefly Mr Speaker, I would like to get to the bottom of this concern.  Just so we are aware Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, it is ICI’s policy that when you damage or do any work on our roads, you must return it 

</span><span>back to its original condition.  So, Honourable Speaker and the Honourable Member who asked 

the question, if I can be given some time to come back tomorrow and I will have a response to the 

question and for our people to hear.  I will come back tomorrow and let you know the policy that 

ICI now follows on the harmful effects to our roads.  Thank you.
