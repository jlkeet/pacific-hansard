<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to convey some words of condolences to those who have 

passed away as per  your announcement.  Firstly, to the family of Mr Manuela Kitai, as he had 

served in this House in previous years as a Member of Parliament, I believe we started together.  

Therefore, to his family, please accept my condolences for the passing of Papa Kitai. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, to Papa Tangaina Patia, as alluded by you Mr Speaker, they usually congregate at the 

Avatiu  Harbour  and  right  now,  most  of  them  have  passed  away.    Therefore,  my  words  of 

condolences to the families of Papa Tangaina Patia.  I also believe that the Member of Parliament 

for Tupapa and I played rugby with him for Tupapa. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, to our Mama Mavis, she had worked with my mum, Mama Ngai in Takuvaine and her 

partner Tuku Tunoa, I believe we were at Tereora together in 1971.  He is a well-known rugby 

player  for  Takuvaine  and  he  was  a  very  good  Mathematician;  not  too  sure  about  Spelling  but 

definitely a good Mathematician. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question, Mr Speaker goes out to the Prime Minister.  During the COVID, an illustration Mr 

Speaker, the government gave some grants to help some of the businesses in the country; I believe 

the  amount  was  about  $7  million.    Mr  Speaker,  according  to  an  article  published  in  the  Cook 

Islands  News  on  16  August  2023;  there  were  funds  that  the  businesses  did  not  use  and  the 

government have asked for reimbursement.  Apparently, according to an agreement between the 

government and businesses, these agreements were not completed.  Therefore, I wanted to thank 

the government for helping these businesses during COVID.  As for the unused funds, if this can 

be returned, maybe the government can use it to help with some of their work. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister,  my  question  is  what  is  the  update  of  the  funds  granted  to  these 

</span><span>businesses in terms of reimbursement?
