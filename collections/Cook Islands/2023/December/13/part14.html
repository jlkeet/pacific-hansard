<div><span>STATEMENTS BY MINISTER 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:   </span><span>Thank  you Mr Speaker.   Firstly,  I convey appreciation for the words of 

condolences for the passing away of our Aunty from the village of Parekura, Takuvaine. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise Mr Speaker to provide a Ministerial Statement on the recent pardon that was bestowed by 

the  Kings  Representative  on  Papa  Arapati  Henry.    And  it  is  only  fitting  that  this  House  is  the 

appropriate  venue  to  advice  Members  and  also  the  members  of  the  public  about  this  historic 

occasion that was undertaken just a couple of months ago. 

</span></div><div><span>In the Book of Luke 6:37, it says: </span><span>“Do not judge, and you will not be judged.  Do not condemn, 

and you will not be condemned.  Forgive, and you will be forgiven.”</span></div><div><span>I  find  this  Bible  Verse  so  poignant  and  appropriate  as  we  mark  the  occasion  which  was,  the 

</span><span>decision for the King’s Representative Sir Tom Marsters, to exercise the Prerogative of Mercy and 

</span><span>Pardon in Papa Arapati Royle Henry. 

</span></div><div><span>It  was  also  fitting  that  this  announcement  was  made  before  the  opening  ceremony  of  the  52</span><span>nd</span><span>

Pacific  Islands  Forum  Leaders  meeting.    Fitting  because  it  highlights  the  significance  of  Papa 

</span><span>Arapati’s contribution to the establishment of the first Pacific Islands Forum meeting more than 

</span><span>50 years ago, and our role as a founding member of this institution. 

</span></div><div><span>This pardon for Papa Arapati has been a long time coming, far too long in my very humble opinion.  

A sentiment I believe is shared by my fellow elected Members of Parliament past and present and 

the people of the Cook Islands.  Forgiveness is one of the most powerful expressions of love and

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>we owe Papa Arapati a great debt of gratitude and love for all that he did for our country and for 

our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Recently our Executive Council approved the decision for the King’s Representative to pardon 

</span><span>Papa  Arapati,  following  the  recommendation  of  the  Chair  of  the  Parole  Board,  Chief  Justice 

Patrick Keane, in accordance with the Criminal Records Act 1991.  This is the first pardon to be 

</span><span>exercised by our King’s Representative.  The Board received the application by Papa Arapati’s 

</span><span>grandson, Howard Henry for the posthumous pardon.  In order that Papa Arapati, be pardoned by 

the King's Representative for his 1978 offences, the Board had to be satisfied, after inquiry, that 

those convictions should no longer reflect adversely on his character.  And let us never forget, his 

character and </span><span>mana</span><span>, built the foundations of what the Cook Islands is today. 

</span></div><div><span>Papa Arapati was the founder and first leader of the Cook Islands Party.  When the Cook Islands 

was granted self-</span><span>governance in August 1965, he became our Nation’s first Premier.  The creation 

</span><span>of the House of Ariki had been proposed by the Cook Islands Party long before self-governance, 

and as Premier, Papa Arapati oversaw its implementation. He recognized the importance of one of 

our  pillars  of  our  Cook  Islands  society  in  providing  balance  and  protecting  our  traditions  and 

customs. 

</span></div><div><span>He also introduced a welfare system in the 1</span><span>960’s that is the envy of many of our Pacific Island 

</span><span>neighbours.  The Old Age Pension that he introduced was funded by the new philatelic bureau at 

the time.  This a legacy that is remembered by our pensioners as a gift introduced by Papa Arapati.  

This includes the child benefit that no other Pacific Islands country in the region enjoys.   

</span></div><div><span>Papa Arapati strongly opposed the French nuclear testing in the Pacific and was a strong proponent 

for a nuclear free Pacific.  That led to another legacy in the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty 

or now known as the Treaty of Rarotonga signed in 1985.  He designed a new national flag which 

consisted of 15 gold stars in a circle on a green background, a flag that represents our national 

colours and reflects our identity as the Cook Islands and something may be for us to reconsider as 

a country.  

</span></div><div><span>In 1974, he hosted a royal visit from Queen Elizabeth II in Rarotonga, where he was appointed a 

Knight  Commander  of  the  Order  of  the  British  Empire.    The  occasion  was  the  opening  of  the 

</span><span>Rarotonga International Airport, which we will celebrate its 50-year anniversary next year.  And 

</span><span>our airport Mr Speaker now underpins our tourism industry and our economic prosperity, a level 

of prosperity that has led to our graduation as a high income country by OECD standards, a vision 

of Papa Arapati that resonates especially today. 

</span></div><div><span>In 1974, he spoke at the 3</span><span>rd</span><span> UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in Caracas,  Venezuela, and 

strongly  advocated  for  the  establishment  of  the  200  NM  Exclusive  Economic  Zone  (EEZ) 

especially for small island states as a means to enhance their prosperity and potential productivity.  

This is a legacy that endures today that ensures Pacific countries benefit from our fishery and our 

</span><span>potential seabed mineral wealth.  

</span></div><div><span>His achievements were many, I could go on and on, but I do not need to.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 13 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Papa  Arapati’s  offences,  to  which  he  pleaded  guilty  on  the  advice  of  his  legal  counsel,  were 

</span><span>serious.  But the fact was, he pleaded guilty.  He accepted personal responsibility and assumed full 

accountability for his actions, making sure no one else took the blame.  This was an action taken 

by a man of honour and one he never spoke about again in public. 

</span></div><div><span>A Motion was tabled in Parliament on 4 June 2004 by the then Prime Minister of the time, the 

Honourable Dr. Robert Woonton, recommending that the Queen's Representative at the time, Sir 

</span><span>Frederick Goodwin, exercise in Papa Arapati’s favour, the Prerogative of Mercy and Pardon.  This 

</span><span>Motion was passed unanimously by all Members of Parliament at the time.  As the speeches made 

at that time confirmed, the resolution was carried unanimously because all Members agreed that 

Albert Henry's life of public service had been so extraordinary, and his contribution to the Cook 

Islands and its peoples so unique, that those convictions should no longer reflect adversely on his 

character.    Those  speeches  also  affirmed  that  all  MPs  considered  those  convictions  should  be 

vacated.  They had become, as Prime Minister Woonton  said  at  the time, a source of disunity, 

which only a pardon could cure; a theme echoed by others who spoke in the debate.  

</span></div><div><span>It was highly unfortunate however, that at the end of that Parliamentary term in 2004, the Queen's 

Representative Sir Frederick was not invited to exercise the Prerogative of Mercy and Pardon, and 

that the resolution itself lapsed.  

</span></div><div><span>This year therefore, the Executive Council believed unanimously that it was now proper to revive 

the resolution and to give it effect.  Relying on that resolution and set against the whole trajectory 

of his remarkable life, his convictions should no longer reflect adversely on his character.  

</span></div><div><span>At the beginning of this address,  I spoke about forgiveness.  We cannot continue to deny Papa 

Arapati the acknowledgement and credit he so rightly deserves as he led our country during a time 

of great political transformation.  He was a man of tremendous oratory skill in both Maori and 

English.  At a time when we as a people needed our voices heard, he spoke eloquently for all of 

us.  The tireless work that he did in advocating for our independence and sovereignty, for the right 

of Cook Islanders to elect their own government, to govern ourselves as a nation of 15 islands for 

the benefit of our people, this is what Papa Arapati is remembered for. 

</span></div><div><span>His  long  list  of  notable  and  outstanding  achievements  and  his  extraordinary  life  impacted 

</span><span>thousands of Cook Islanders at home and around the world.  Papa Arapati epitomised what it meant 

</span><span>to be a proud Cook Islander.  A rightly legacy to remember the first leader of our modern country.  

</span></div><div><span>Psalm 23, verse 6 says </span><span>“surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I 

will dwell in the House of the Lord forever”.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I humbly submit to this House this Statement in acknowledgement of the Pardon for 

Albert Royle Henry.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I also wanted to let the Prime Minister 

deliver his Statement before I acknowledge the presence of a special guest in the Public Gallery,
