<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MR  R.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Firstly,  Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister  and 

everyone in this House. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question, Mr Speaker is to the Minister for the Cook Islands Investment Corporation and this 

is in regards to the Te Aponga Uira and the To Tatou Vai.  I would like to shorten my question 

because these issues have been brought to my attention by our people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The issue here is the digging of the trenches for electricity.  We know in the past that these cables 

and pipes are laid all at once; the electricity, the water pipes and the telephone lines.  The problem 

we see today is there are two digging of trenches and the one for the Te Aponga Uira electricity 

lines and the pipes for To Tatou Vai.  This is beneficial to the businesses responsible for these 

kinds of jobs but not for our people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Since  our  people  have  to  pay  twice  to  the  To  Tatou  Vai  and  as  well  to  the  Te  Aponga  Uira.  

</span><span>Therefore, my question to the Minister Responsible for CIIC is, whether you are aware of what is 

happening or whether there is a new policy for this kind of projects. 

</span></div>
