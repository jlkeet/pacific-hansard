</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Minister Rose Brown.  I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Prime Minister, Mark Brown</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I now open the Floor to Honourable Members to speak on the Principles and 

Merits of the Bill.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  This Bill has been a result of some discussion and 

also the result of our referendum that we held in the last election and that is to allow for use of 

medicinal cannabis to help alleviate certain pains and certain illnesses that people have had.   

</span></div><div><span>It  became  apparent,  Mr  Speaker  that  people  were  using  medicinal  cannabis  to  help  alleviate 

arthritis pain, to help alleviate in some cases asthma illness for breathing but it was all being done 

in contravention of the current law and legislation which prohibits the use of any cannabis product.  

Government was aware that medicinal cannabis is one of the fastest growing industries around the 

world with many countries adopting it as a form of therapy and a form of medicine.    

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, when we held the election, we also called for a referendum and asked the question to 

our people.  Should we change our laws to allow medicinal cannabis to be used and to allow for 

research?  Sixty two percent of </span><span>our people supported the referendum, Mr Speaker.  That’s more 

</span><span>than triple the number that voted for the Opposition.  But it is also more than the number that voted 

for the government.  

</span></div><div><span>So, I can say that, yes our people certainly gave a very clear message that, yes, they wanted this 

changed and to be applied and it is up to the government to see as to how we can adopt it. 

</span></div><div><span>The first step, Mr Speaker is to amend the Narcotics and Misuse of Drugs Act; it was to amend the 

Act, Narcotics and Misuse of Drugs Act.  There is a list of prohibited substances that are listed in 

this Act, and cannabis is one of them in all of its forms. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, by providing an exemption, this Bill provides the exemption for cannabis products to 

be  removed  from  that  particular  list  of  prohibited  substances.    This  will  allow  therefore,  Mr 

Speaker the importation of prescribed medicinal cannabis products to be able to be brought into 

</span><span>the  country.    It  will  allow  individuals  to  bring  in  prescribed  medicinal  cannabis  provided  it  is 

</span><span>accompanied by evidence that it was prescribed by an overseas medical practitioner. 

</span></div><div><span>The amendment will also allow providers of medicines here, pharmacies, the hospital and so forth 

to be able to bring in medicinal cannabis for them to prescribe domestically as well. 

</span></div><div><span>We also identified in the list of prohibited substances that there are some of our people who are 

returning home with terminal cases and in many of these cases they are bringing back or they are 

wanting to bring back specific pain relief which is on the band substances list. 

</span></div><div><span>So, we have also taken the opportunity within this amendment to allow certain opiate medicines 

that are used for pain relief or for end-of-life care, to allow them to use it for their personal use as 

part of their palliate care. 

</span></div><div><span>435 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 13 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Once this Bill is passed Mr Speaker, there will be further amendments that will be required under 

the Narcotics Regulations and also the Ministry of Health, pharmacy and Therapeutic products 

Regulations.  So, as this Bill will remove the cannabis as part of the prohibited substances, it will 

then fall under the Therapeutic Regulations, under the Ministry of Health, where it is treated as a 

health product rather than as a prohibited narcotic. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the concerns that we have identified and we do not want that to be reflected here is in other 

countries where they have allowed the use of medicinal cannabis, the regulations around its use 

have  been  so  prescriptive  that  it  has  escalated  and  push  the  price  of  medicinal  cannabis  to  be 

unaffordable. 

</span></div><div><span>So, we have identified some of these pitfalls and we will ensure that when we do put the regulations 

</span><span>in place that it doesn’t make the cost of therapeutic or medicinal cannabis unaffordable for our 

</span><span>people.  So, I have heard that some of the ways that this product can be used is to be boiled up as 

a tea and drunk as tea.  Others where the extract has been taken out as an oil to be applied either 

inhaling the oil or massage onto affected areas. 

</span></div><div><span>But it is important, Mr Speaker that our people understand that when we talk about cannabis there 

are many different forms of cannabis.  I think there is a lot of stigmas associated with the narcotics 

</span><span>side of cannabis which has the THC component, which is the component that provides the ‘high’ 

</span><span>if you like, for users. 

</span></div><div><span>If you </span><span>don’t understand THC, you can google and find out.  It is TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL.  

</span><span>This is very different from the other product that the medicinal side of cannabis, which is the CBD.  

This is the one that is used more for the therapeutic and medicinal side, which does not provide 

you with the narcotic high but it does provide you with the medicinal aspect of pain relief and 

other useful effects  for  curing.  As  I said,  anything from  arthritis  pain  through to  relaxation of 

breathing, your breathing channels to allow a much more comfortable sleep. 

</span></div><div><span>We must distinguish also from the other cannabis product which is hemp.  And hemp of course is 

a very useful product where the fibres that are used in the manufacturing of clothing and the seeds 

and  flowers  are  used  in  health  products.    One  of  the  outcomes  of  our  Committee  that  was 

established to look at these amendments to the Bill was chaired by the Honourable Member for 

</span><span>Pukapuka, Tingika Elikana.  He was an appointed chair because of any personnel experience with 

</span><span>cannabis by the way.   

</span></div><div><span>But purely from the legal perspective that we needed some good expert thinking.  One of the things 

that came out of our study was to increase the amount of public awareness and education to our 

people.  That while there may be a sense of fear or concern about using cannabis as medicinal 

product, we must make sure that our people are aware that there is a difference in these cannabis 

products.  Some of them are useful for health reasons and of course some of it can be harmful if it 

is misused. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I look forward Mr Speaker to the rolling out of our medicinal cannabis industry, our regime 

and welcome those people who will be prescribed as medication to help them improve their healthy 

living.  Thank you Mr Speaker.

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  would  like  to  suggest  that  the 

Honourable Members Teokotai Herman and Tukaka Ama should be part of the educational process 

into the community. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa: you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Firstly, on the Bill to help those who are 

suffering with some form of specialised sicknesses and those returning home for those purposes. 

Even  though  62  percent  of  our  people  agreed  to  have  this  Act  amended,  however,  I  know  38 

percent had doubts on this.  I do not have any problems on this Amendment Bill.  I was happy to 

hear from  the Prime Minister that a Regulation  will be passed because  Mr Speaker, one area  I 

would like to be looked at is Clause 4 which says, </span><span>‘In this </span><span>section overseas medical practitioner 

means  a  person  registered  as  a  medical  practitioner  by  the  competent  authority  of  a  foreign 

</span><span>country’. </span></div><div><span>That is why Mr Speaker I was glad when the Prime Minister said a Regulation will be passed.  I 

also believe under this those who are registered will be diligently screened, as we know nowadays 

Mr Speaker that everything activates at the push of a button.   

</span></div><div><span>There are issues regarding their credentials, we will not know where these people are from, maybe 

from New Zealand or from Australia or elsewhere.  And I believe Mr Speaker this Regulation will 

be administered by Te Marae Ora.  Mr Speaker, also in regards to the lists and prescriptions taken 

by these people, I believe we all know that this is happening in our country.  Maybe in this way 

the Regulations is an avenue to address the needs of these people who have already done this. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, what came through the newspaper is that most of these people that are breaking the 

laws are those taking this cannabis.  These are mainly our young people because they are taking 

this cannabis without a prescription from a medical practitioner.  That is why I thought maybe 

under this Regulation, professional help with the prescriptions can be administered correctly to the 

users because we know today these are taking place out of Rarotonga.  

</span></div><div><span>I believe it is happening both in the South and the Northern islands in our country.  I agree with 

</span><span>the Prime Minister for this Regulation to be strictly enforced to tackle all these issues.  I also read 

</span><span>write-ups in the newspaper by these people especially this friend of ours from Arorangi as well 

from  a  former  Member  of  Parliament  from  Titikaveka.    What  they  have  written  is  not  enough 

information given.  I am glad as to me, this is a step we are about to take to allow these people to 

continue taking the prescription once they come to our shores.  We also heard the verification from 

the Prime Minister on the nature of this cannabis.  

</span></div><div><span>Maybe the cannabis will be suitable to me because I have not tried it yet.  As I see it, my lifetime 

is  about  to end and this might  be able to  help  and liven the organs in  my body.  But  the main 

</span><span>principle Mr Speaker is that we are debating to see that this is passed as law.  Mr Speaker, although 

</span><span>my time is not up, I will spare it for anyone who wishes to speak and I support the conditions under 

this new law.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. I see the Honourable Teariki Heather; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and all your staff in this House, the government, 

Prime Minister, Ministers, Members and to us on this side and the colleague from Aitutaki.  Kia 

Orana to all of us today.  

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give on behalf of the United Party our thoughts.  Before doing so, going on the numbers 

explained by the Prime Minister which is 62 percent in agreement and 38 percent doubtful.  What 

I believe Mr Speaker, from this count of 62 percent mentioned is that government Members are 

included in this.  We are the 38 percent and it is not on opposing it.  During that electoral time as 

the Prime Minister has explained, this referendum was introduced.  Maybe the Prime Minister is 

right in saying that they were elected by this 62 percent of our people.  Mr Speaker, we all know, 

we heard and we smelled this cannabis and this has been shown to us by our people and children.  

</span></div><div><span>There is our principal Act that was passed in this House and we were not able to look after people 

through this Act.  During this moment, we have the Amendment Bill to amend, the principal Act 

of this country that we are debating this afternoon.  We have heard the principles and merits of this 

Amendment Bill from our Prime Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>Our problem in this amendment is the authority to be given to our hospital pharmacy and also the 

CITC pharmacy to import this medicine into our country.  Maybe there are times we have seen in 

our homes and I mention the Honourable Minister George Angene as to what the Prime Minister 

has said is high.  Maybe that is why he is quick tempered, maybe this weed is interfering with the 

mind.  The spirit and the intention of this Bill, we give our support. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, there is no indication of the agency who will be responsible for administering this but 

maybe it is under the Ministry of Health or the Police. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>My Point of Order Mr Speaker is that I am just a bit concerned to the 

</span><span>Honourable Member from Murienua’s comments about 30 seconds ago and the concern is, Mr 

</span><span>Speaker the comments the Honourable Member made suggests that the Honourable Minister from 

Tupapa-Maraerenga is a cons</span><span>umer of cannabis.  So that’s my Point of Order.  Mr Speaker, if we 

</span><span>can seek  clarification or ask the Honourable Member maybe just to  remove that portion of his 

comments. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  Can I have the Honourable Member to clarify 

more on what you said? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:  </span><span>I am speaking in line with the thoughts that has been shared by the Prime 

Minister in regard to the Chairman of this Committee that was selected by government.  I am not 

suggesting Mr Speaker and therefore I am not saying that the Honourable Minister is taking this.

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>They are not my intentions Honourable Speaker.  But if the Minister wish for me to withdraw then 

I withdraw that statement, gladly. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  In regards to this issue, it is not just foreigners coming into our country.  In 

regards to our old people and children with autism, we have carefully considered this Bill that is 

brought before the House the issues they were facing throughout their life daily but we will not 

agree to any other forms of narcotics that is consumed in our country.  Because I know many of 

our young people not just consume alcohol but also this narcotic and I feel sorry for our young 

people and this is a problem. 

</span></div><div><span>Members of this House cannot say they do not know this problem and they have not seen it and 

refuse to hear that this is happening.  On these grounds that I have shared, I give our support to the 

merits that has been raised before the House and also in the Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, Tina Pupuke Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Before I speak on the Bill, I wish to 

convey our condolences to the family of Danny Piho.  This Papa died in Auckland and his body 

was returned to Rarotonga and last Thursday was flown to Rakahanga and yesterday the family 

returned from Rakahanga.  So, from us here on the Opposition side we convey words of sympathy 

to all the families in Rakahanga, here as well as in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>I listened carefully to the explanations given by the Prime Minister in regards to the purpose of the 

Bill but when I heard what he was explaining from what he was told about cannabis and from what 

he was told that you can boil it and drink it like tea.  But when he spoke on the method of using 

this drug and when I think about it, I do not think he heard about it but I think he has tried it and 

that is why he knows how to use the cannabis. 

</span></div><div><span>I have read in the Cook Islands News in the public forum on the thoughts on this subject and some 

of the ideas is similar to what this Bill is about.  What I understand is most of these people who 

</span><span>have written to register their thoughts, they are coming from a commercial side. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe this is the first step which I believe is beneficial to our people and I also see in this House 

that most of us are in our sixties and the time will come that we will drink this tea before we go to 

sleep. 

</span></div><div><span>So, the steps or the requirements set in this Bill is that you make sure before you bring this narcotic 

to the island you have to get a prescription from a registered GP. 

</span></div><div><span>I also agree with the change that our Pharmacy at the hospital to bring as suppliers so that we can 

</span><span>supply our people here hopefully in accordance with a prescription as well.

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 13 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I also read the views of those who are interested in this Bill that this needs to be increased because 

under our current regulations they are allowed to do that.  But for me I believe that these small 

concerns and issues have been looked at by Crown Law Office and if there are doubts these are 

the steps that can be taken in order to allow them to bring this narcotic into the country.  Which 

means then on your arrival at the airport you have to show the prescription to the Customs in order 

that you be allowed to bring your medicine in.  But if you come in with two kilograms of cannabis 

without a prescription then there will be some questions asked. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe, Mr Speaker as I have said, this is the first step and I believe the time will come when we 

will accept drugs into our country.  May be not now but may be in the future.  The reason for this 

is  because there is  not much difference between alcohol and cannabis.   However we know the 

referendum that was held was for medicinal purposes.  Our people have given their view because 

when I went to Rakahanga, no one opposed to the referendum.  Everyone considered that, that is 

not an issue. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I stand Mr Speaker for us on the Opposition side, to support the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Minister 

George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity to give my views in 

regards to this Bill.  In regards to this Bill that we are discussing and because 62 percent of our 

people gave their support for this to happen. 

</span></div><div><span>And  I  hear  some  Members  of  this  House  mentioning  about  people  bringing  narcotics  into  the 

country.  This is being planted right here in our country, maybe this is a means that we can support 

them.  The reason why I am speaking before the House that we should grow it here.  When we 

enforce this Act, my question is, what are we going to do with our boys in prison? 

</span></div><div><span>We  are  going  to  enforce  this  law  sooner  and  they  have  already  been  convicted  and  are  being 

imprisoned.  In regards to the leaves of this plant that it will become a medicine and have medicinal 

value.  I always observe this animal, goat.  It will eat all kinds of leaves, any green leaf.  So, if we 

give this plant for the goat to eat and if something bad happen to it, then it will not be a good plant 

</span><span>for us.  But if the goat keeps standing after eating the plant, then it should be good for us. 

</span></div><div><span>If we are looking at getting our supplies from New Zealand then it will be a way for us promoting 

other businesses.  But the intention of this Bill, I as Member of Parliament for Tupapa supports 

this Bill.  I would also like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for giving your support to the 

Bill, including the Leader of the United Party. 

</span></div><div><span>I thank the Honourable Member for withdrawing his statement before this House, I am not angry 

about it.  Thank you to the Honourable Member for Murienua.  Thank you all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    The  statement  made  by  the  Honourable 

Teariki Heather has been withdrawn.  I see the Honourable Member Teokotai Herman; you have 

the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HERMAN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you and all Honourable Members of this House 

including our people listening and watching us live. 

</span></div><div><span>I could not just sit and not speak on this Bill.  Even though I will support this Bill but I am slow 

on this matter.  Mr Speaker, just as the Minister of Corrective Services spoke earlier, most of the 

young people in prison associate with cannabis are from my island of Aitutaki, especially in the 

cultivation and use of cannabis. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to tell a story.  When I was still a young boy; my grandfather was John Herman, I remember 

many times he will give me an envelope.  I was to take this envelope to the Post Office and the 

Manager of the Bond Store in those days, was Makea Joseph.  On this particular day when I went 

to the Bond Store, the person looking after the store was replaced, it was Mokoenga Kavana on 

this day.  He was looking forward to see me with the envelope. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I was not sure what the content of the envelope or the intention of the exchange.  All 

I  know  is  that  my  grandfather  ordered  me  to  make  sure  the  envelope  get  into  the  hands  of 

Mokoenga and not anyone else. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I remember in the evening, Mokoenga comes to our home all dressed up with a flower 

necklace and with a big box.  The content of the box is full of alcohol, whiskey and other kinds of 

alcohol.  There will be a party at our home that evening, those that come to the  party included 

Terepai Maoate, Tukua Cameron, Matai Simiona and all these elderlies that have gone.  They had 

a good party. 

</span></div><div><span>It was later that I found out that the envelope contained a license that Terepai Maoate, a medical 

doctor, have signed to allow them to purchase alcohol from the Bond Store.  Mr Speaker, in those 

days under the Blue Law, the Cook Islands Maori people were not allowed to buy or drink alcohol.  

The only time you can purchase alcohol is when you are sick and it will be prescribed for you by 

a medical doctor. 

</span></div><div><span>The sick old men like King George who fishes and gets cold are the sick ones that need strong 

drinks to warm the body.  This is the permit Mr Speaker that would allow you to purchase alcohol 

</span><span>in those days but it will have to be the medical doctor to sign the permit for you.  We might ask 

</span><span>where that law is today, it is gone, there is no such law today. 

</span></div><div><span>Today, our law allows 18 years and over to purchase alcohol and any amount they want.  There 

are laws that have been established to control our purchase and consumption of alcohol.  We know 

the  bad  side  and  the  good  side  of  alcohol.    But  each  person  is  responsible  for  what  they  will 

consume, that was medicine in those days. 

</span></div><div><span>I will come back to the subject of cannabis or marijuana.  Mr Speaker, I believe we are hiding 

</span><span>behind this word, medicinal cannabis.  My friends in Aitutaki supported this referendum during 

</span><span>the election.  They believed it will permit them to plant, cultivate, harvest and sell the marijuana; 

also, to use it as medicine.  Mr Speaker, if only they knew the intention of this Bill to buy the 

medicinal cannabis from New Zealand, they will not support the referendum.

</span></div><div><span>On our islands, the magic mushroom grows and thrives.  On an island where cattle are kept, magic 

mushroom grows. This is a potent plant more than cannabis.  What are we to do?  I am sure that 

we are aware of it during those days our children will be taking these mushrooms that is grown 

and consume it.  So, are we going to destroy our cows?  Mr Speaker, I stand to give my support to 

this Bill.  But I urge that we should take it faster to the point where you cultivate and consume 

your own.  Mr Speaker, those are my thoughts.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR.  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  Teokotai  Herman.    I  see  the  Honourable

Opposition side, Kia Orana.  I have no intention to speak but because I am enjoying the discussion, 

I decided to speak.  

</span></div><div><span>Before  that  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  extend  my  words  of  sympathy  to  those  lost  love  one.  

Although you have conveyed our condolences on our behalf to the family of our former Member, 

but myself I would like to give my condolences because this man is my first cousin in our family.  

Secondly, I would like to convey my condolences to my father who passed away yesterday in New 

Zealand  namely  Tamarua  Kiria.    My  condolences  to  the  families  in  Aitutaki,  Rarotonga,  New 

Zealand  and  Australia.    Thirdly,  to  our  daughter  who  would  be  returned  from  Australia  to  be 

</span><span>returned to Aitutaki tonight. So, Mr Speaker if I am not around then I am on this family’s charter 

</span><span>flight on the way to Aitutaki as I am their family orator in Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to the Bill before the House.  To me, we are too late in bringing this legislation.  Like 

my colleague has said earlier on, most of our young people are in jail because of the cultivation of 

cannabis on the island.  However, Mr Speaker I go back to the time when I was in Parliament, 

actually the old Parliament House.  I recall the Member of Parliament from Rakahanga and you 

Mr  Speaker  was  in  Parliament.    The  Member  from  Rakahanga  said  that  during  his  time  in 

Australia, they would sell this weed.  During that time, he said if government sells it, we would 

have already made a lot of money.  However, we took it as a joke at the time.  The Prime Minister 

and Minister Angene is asking who that person was.  I recall Mr Speaker that issue was brought 

into this House.  

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, also in the House, the Honourable Member Angene and Honourable Member Pumati 

both One Cook Islands at the time. It was the Member Pumati who said we should sell marijuana; 

sorry Mr Speaker I am wrong. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I do not want a retaliation from the other side. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  I am making some illustrations to align with this Bill.  The Member Pumati 

did not say that we sell the marijuana but for us to plant it because this is the medicine that cured 

</span><span>him.  Those of us in the House know this man and that he had passed away.  Now today, we are 

</span><span>discussing that.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 13 December 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Sixth Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>I have no problems with what government is doing because they have laid the steps to undertake 

this.  As it will also be looked at if you were travelling and the type of prescriptions you are entitled 

to have on you.  But when we look at the capsules, you can open it and put something else in it 

and close it.  Once you show your prescription from the doctor then you are cleared.  But what is 

in the capsule?  But government has laid the steps to ensure nothing goes wrong.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I support this Bill before the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Thank you Honourable Members for your 

contributions to the Bill  today.  When we come back tomorrow, we will go back into it again.  

Therefore, we have come to the end of our Session for today.  Our time is up.  When there is many 

discussions, the time goes fast.  

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Can I ask the Honourable Member Tereapii Maki to close us with a Closing Prayer?
