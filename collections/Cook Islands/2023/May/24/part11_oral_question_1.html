<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Minister of ICI.  I have an easy 

question  for  the  Minister.    Honourable  Minister,  the  road  from  BCI  in  town  to  Avana  is  very 

smooth.    My  questions  is,  do  you  have  any  plans  in  applying  hot-mixed for  the  road  from  the 

bridge  of  Avana  to  Titikaveka?    We  all  know  that  Ngatangiia  is  one  of  the  busiest  village  in 

Rarotonga.    I  would  like  to  help  the  Honourable  Member  of  Ngatangiia  with  his  plea  for  the 

complete repair of the main road of his village, hence my question, if the Minister has any plans 

to complete the roadwork project to Titikaveka with hot-mixed.  Thank you.
