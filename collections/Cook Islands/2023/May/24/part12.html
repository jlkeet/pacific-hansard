</span></div><div><span>I call the Minister of Finance for the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Appropriation Bill 2023 be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and all the staff 

of this Honourable House. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana  also  the  King’s  Representative,  Sir  Tom  Marsters  and  Lady  Marsters.    To  all  our 

</span><span>Members of Parliament, the Opposition, your Leader, Deputy and Members of the Cook Islands 

United Party, Kia Orana.  Kia Orana to all the Honourable Members on the Government side from 

the Member of Parliament for Amuri/Ureia and around to the Member of Parliament for Nikao, 

Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>To  all  our  people  who  are  listening  to  our  Parliament  Sitting,  those  in  the  Outer  Islands  and 

overseas in New Zealand and Australia, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before I continue, let me just take a moment to acknowledge a milestone of a great 

</span><span>importance that occurred earlier this month.  It was on 6</span><span>th</span><span> May, which was the coronation of His 

</span><span>Majesty,  King  Charles  III  that  took  place,  an  event  that  was  attended  by  Sir  Tom  and  Lady 

Marsters.  On behalf of our Cook Islands Nation, we extend our heartfelt congratulations to the 

King and long may he reign. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, Members of Parliament I am pleased to be here to talk about the Government’s 2023 

</span><span>Budget, the key financing mechanism that will help guide our economy as it continues to get back 

on track.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the last year has shown how resilient we are as a nation, and as a people.  We have 

</span><span>experienced  the  largest  economic  recession  in  Cook  Islands’  history,  and  one  of  the  largest

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>economic contractions in the world.  But Mr Speaker, as a country we rose to face those challenges 

together.  And together, we are prevailing. 

</span></div><div><span>In 2021, the Budget theme was the “Revival Budget”.  The Revival Budget focused on critical 

</span><span>measures aimed at safeguarding our people and stimulating our economy and we transitioned from 

a phase of response to recovery navigating the uncertain times of global events with resilience and 

resolve.  Mr Speaker, our strategic economic measures have indeed proven effective as we have 

seen our economy surge by an impressive 21 percent this year, which is a testament to our shared 

determination and drive.  Upon the reopening of our Borders last year, we witnessed the fruits of 

our hard work as we saw a welcoming influx of tourists fueling much of this remarkable economic 

growth.  This past year would have seen almost 130 thousand visitors gracing our shores which 

has been a welcome relief for our people and our local businesses.  Our Budget 2022, the theme 

</span><span>was “</span><span>K</span><span>eeping the Faith” and Mr Speaker</span><span>, over the last year, we have held this Faith in the measures 

introduced for our health and economic response.  As a result, we now find ourselves in a stronger 

position tha</span><span>n we were since December 2021.  Last year’s Budget lay the economic foundations for 

</span><span>a speedy recovery and future growth. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Members,  before  I  introduce  this  year’s  Budg</span><span>et  with  the  end  of  the  COVID-19 

pandemic and the public health emergency of international concern, it is fitting to acknowledge 

the generosity of our Development Partners who have collectively provided $112 million over the 

last four years to directly support our response to the pandemic, plus an additional $40 million to 

support our infrastructure investment going forward. 

</span></div><div><span>On behalf of the Cook Islands Government and people, I extend my appreciation and thanks to the 

</span><span>Asian  Development  Bank,  the  People’s  R</span><span>epublic  of  China,  the  Government  of  Japan,  the 

Australian Government and also the International Labour Organisation for all your support.  

</span></div><div><span>However,  a  special  commendation  is  due  to  the  New  Zealand  Government.    Their  significant 

contribution of $21.4 million in Budgetary support this year alone, and an overall support of $107 

</span><span>million over the last four years has been a cornerstone of our economic recovery. 

</span></div><div><span>The 2023 Budget  is  about  “N</span><span>urturing our Nation</span><span>”</span><span>.  Nurturing can be compared to  a season of 

growth and renewal after a time of difficulty and hardship.  This can be seen in the Book of Isaiah 

61:3, which says, </span><span>“</span><span>To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, 

the oil of joy for mourning, a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called 

</span><span>trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord that he may be glorified”.</span></div><div><span>Just as a season of growth requires tending to the soil, planting seeds and watering them, nurturing 

</span><span>a Nation requires  intentional  efforts to  heal  and  rebuild after difficult circumstances.  This  can

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>include  investing  in  education  and  health  care,  creating  economic  opportunities  for  economic 

growth and job creations and promoting social and political unity.   

</span></div><div><span>Working together as a community to create a better future for all is essential in the nurturing of a 

Nation.  Just as plants rely on each for support and nutrients, individuals in a Nation must support 

and uplift each other to thrive and flourish by focusing on the common good and working towards 

a shared vision of a better future, a Nation can emerge from adversity stronger and more united 

than ever before. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  todays  Budget  is  one  that  shows  the  Government’s  commit</span><span>ment  to  fiscal 

responsibility through rebuilding our financial reserves which were depleted in the aftermath of 

the pandemic,  while ensuring we  extend our hand to  the most vulnerable in  our Society.  This 

delicate balance prepares us for the uncertainties of the future, fortifying us to face any forthcoming 

challenges.   

</span></div><div><span>While our Country has been through a great trial, with one of the largest falls in GDP in the world, 

we are still standing, and the future looks promising.  This promise further delegates the Policy 

taken during the pandemic to support our people and ensure our businesses were ready to respond 

the moment our Borders reopened.   

</span></div><div><span>The responsibility shown in this Budget allows us to provide support to members of our society 

who are struggling and recognizing those who give their time for people who are unable to care 

for themselves.  This Budget allows for the increase in financial assistance to allow these people 

to care for their loved ones as well as those who are struggling to make ends-meet.  Along with 

the changes to the Minimum Wage, this support is important in an environment with the rising 

costs of living.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  let  us  turn  our  attention  to  the  exciting  developments  in  our  Nation’s  tourism 

</span><span>connectivity.  This past weekend, we witnessed the arrival of our first flight from Hawaii, signaling 

</span><span>a new chapter in our post-pandemic journey.  And next month, we anticipate the resumption of 

</span><span>direct flights from Sydney.  These connections extend beyond the bounds of our valued partnership 

with  New  Zealand,  injecting  a  much-needed  diversity  into  our  tourism  industry  and  further 

supporting our ongoing recovery.  These connections Mr Speaker widen our outreach, connecting 

us to a broader array of tourism markets, thus paving the way for a more robust and resilient future.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, today's Budget shows that despite the uncertainties ahead, the economic 

forecast of the Cook Islands has signaled that we have emerged from the depths of the pandemic, 

</span><span>setting our course back towards the prosperity we once experienced. 

</span></div><div><span>186 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Our GDP is on the rise again as forecasts have indicated an impressive growth rate, with GDP 

projecting to grow by 12 percent in financial year 2024, and maintaining its upward momentum 

into the financial year 2025, at around 4 percent.  While this rate of growth may appear strong, it 

is indeed a natural rebound, an expected reaction in the wake of a profound economic disruption 

such as the one we have experienced. 

</span></div><div><span>However, we must also acknowledge the surge in price inflation as we have faced the highest in 

our  history.    Factors  beyond  our  control  such  as  the  global  supply  chain  disruptions  and  the 

geopolitical tensions, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have resulted in volatile 

oil prices, and they have contributed to this inflationary increase. 

</span></div><div><span>Over the past year to March 2023, inflation was 12.1 percent, and food prices rose by a staggering 

20.1 percent. I would like to stress that this inflation is something Government cannot control, as 

it is coming from outside of our country.  But it affects our people through rising costs, and while 

we cannot control it, we can help our people respond. 

</span></div><div><span>However, amid this challenging scenario, we discern a ray of hope.  The growth rate of prices has 

shown  signs  of  deceleration  over  the  past  six  months.  Inflation  appears  to  have  peaked  in 

September  2022  and,  mirroring  our  counterparts  in  New  Zealand  and  Australia,  is  moving 

downward in a favourable direction.  While this course correction will require time, we take heart 

in these promising signs. 

</span></div><div><span>This Budget includes measures to provide some immediate relief for the vulnerable in our society, 

while  in  the  longer  term  the  work  that  continues  to  be  done  through  our  Economic  Recovery 

Roadmap will help put some downward pressures on prices. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to say a few words about Resilience. 

</span></div><div><span>Resilience is the ability to keep standing up in the face of adversity.  When Cook Islanders look to 

</span><span>the future of our country, our communities, our businesses, our economy and our environment, 

</span><span>we're increasingly relying on our resilience to carry us through the tough times. 

</span></div><div><span>No doubt, we have encountered some tough times along the way, yet we have emerged from them 

with remarkable fortitude.  However, these challenges serve as a reminder that we must plan to 

ensure our readiness for future shocks that will inevitably come our way.  Sadly, and for politicians 

especially, resilience is rarely visible.  Nonetheless, it is an imperative concept that demands our 

attention.  Resilience  calls  for  a  shift  in  perspective,  Mr  Speaker,  a  perspective  that  transcends 

</span><span>short-lived  victories  in  favour  of  enduring  achievements  spanning  generations.    The  task  of 

</span><span>building and maintaining reserves for the rainy days may not be as exciting or headline-grabbing 

</span></div><div><span>187

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>as some other actions we take in government, but it is only in hindsight that the wisdom of doing 

so becomes apparent. 

</span></div><div><span>As I look back on the decision the decision that this Government took to create the stabilisation 

fund back in 2019 of $56 million that we put aside, that funded so much of our initial response to 

the pandemic, that we see that it was indeed a wise decision we took back then.  And as we look 

forward,  we  must  again  make  a  wise  decision,  and  that  is  to  rebuild  our  financial  reserves  to 

respond to that next big hit, whenever it may come.  But we must also do more than this, because 

resilience is not only about financial reserves. 

Across our physical infrastructure, the social fabric of our communities, and the way we respond 

to and plan for climate change, resilience is the key to a prosperous future.  When thinking about 

recovery and  resilience,  we need to  think about  how we address  the  complexities of the social 

impacts felt by families and communities alongside the physical and economic impacts. 

</span></div><div><span>We must consider how to carry our families and communities through the tough times that are 

causing the stresses today, and also how we nurture and sustain our social resilience in the longer 

term, for Cook Islanders now, and our people into the future. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Prime Minister, I have to interrupt you.  It is time for a break.  You 

can continue when we return.  I will suspend the Sitting until 3.15 p.m. today. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.27 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.15 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Parliament is resumed.  Honourable Members, please be seated.  I would like 

to call on the Honourable Prime Minister to continue with the Financial Statement. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr Speaker.   I will not  delay our  Meeting as  I  am  half  way 

</span><span>through the Financial Statement. 

</span></div><div><span>We were talking about </span><span>Resilience</span><span> Mr Speaker, but I will now talk about </span><span>Diversification</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>We all know that to be truly resilient, we must look beyond tourism to grow our economy over the 

longer term.  Economic diversification has been on our agenda for a long time, and this challenge 

cannot be addressed overnight. 

</span></div><div><span>We are well aware that in order to nurture our private sector’s abil</span><span>ity to invest in new industries 

</span><span>we need to first have the right economic foundations in place.  This means continuing our program 

of providing better internet connectivity to the Pa Enua, taking more business practices online and 

</span></div><div><span>188 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>ensuring our business and investment laws create an enabling environment, free from unnecessary 

and burdensome impediments.  Through the strategic measures outlined in the Economic Recovery 

Roadmap, this Government is providing a solid foundation which will in turn, achieve economic 

diversification. 

</span></div><div><span>Turning  to  fiscal  responsibility  now  </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  this  year’s  Budget  moves  the  Government 

</span><span>towards a more neutral fiscal stance.  This means that we only spend as much as we take in, instead 

of over the last two years of injecting cash into the economy to prop it up. 

</span></div><div><span>We need cash in the Bank, and we can, and we should, only borrow when we need to.  This is 

important  to  ensure  that  the  Government  has  enough  money  available  to  respond  to  another 

economic shock or natural disaster, or that we have the fiscal capacity to take out loans to respond 

if need be, and this we have done. 

</span></div><div><span>The existing increase in debt, and the need to pay it with interest, remains a key challenge for us 

going into 2024 and beyond.  Our debt servicing costs are projected to increase to over $30 million 

per year by the end of this decade, 2029.  This is three times our current servicing cost and three 

times prior to the pandemic, and will demand a significant part of our revenue. 

</span></div><div><span>So, we are talking with our funding partners about ways to manage our debt so we can continue to 

manage  the  economy  while  also  paying  back  our  debt,  but  we  must  also  be  prudent  with  our 

spending. 

</span></div><div><span>I must acknowledge that 2023 Budget is a lean budget when compared to those in recent years and 

the 2024 Budget is projected to be similar.  The recovery of Government revenues will fall behind 

the economic recovery once we consider the tax cycle and the need to allow businesses to recover. 

</span></div><div><span>However, this does not mean that we should not spend money, especially when it can make a more 

</span><span>positive difference for our country’s future.  Government still needs to invest in the economy to 

</span><span>support  our  future  resilience,  and  we  will  continue  to  do  this  through  the  Economic  Recovery 

</span><span>Roadmap, through investment into seabed and marine resources, and through capital investments.  

Now is not the time for austerity, but for wise investments. 

</span></div><div><span>I will turn now, to the </span><span>key budget initiatives</span><span> to Honourable Members.  The first one is the </span><span>Pa Enua 

Income Tax concession.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we know that life in the Pa Enua faces additional challenges to life on Rarotonga, so 

</span><span>we look to address these challenges where we can.  We understand the importance of fostering an 

</span><span>environment that encourages individuals to embrace the Pa Enua, not just as a place to live, but 

also as a place to work and thrive. 

</span></div><div><span>189 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Today, I stand before you to confirm and reaffirm the announcement made during our elections 

last year where we have removed the requirement for individuals earning below $60 thousand in 

the Pa Enua to pay income tax.  While this Tax Concession will reduce governments income, it is 

estimated by around $2.8 million per year, the pay back will result in lowered cost of living in the 

Pa Enua and a greater incentive to maintain the livelihood of those who reside there and call these 

islands home, as well as expand the operation of businesses in the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>We have planned  an increase of $5.3 million  in  the 2004 Budget  and a total increase  of $15.3 

million over the next three years to support contracts with airlines to provide access to markets 

beyond New Zealand.  Economic diversification takes time to develop, and it will take significant 

time before other industries can start to support tourism as our economic life line.  So, these links 

that we have allow for a greater diversity in the market that we source our tourist from, reducing 

the reliance on New Zealand tourist, who will still remain our most important market. 

</span></div><div><span>These arrangements are necessary to support tourism recovery and growth by supporting air routes 

that would not be financially viable for the airlines without support and where the economic benefit 

of the tourism to the Cook Islands outweighs the cost to Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Recognising the importance of both health and education to our future, we have  provided for a 

total of $600 thousand over the next four years to support the third tranch</span><span>e of the teacher’s pay 

</span><span>adjustments  and  an  additional  $1.2  million  over  four  years  to  recruit  and  retain  critical  health 

personnel. 

</span></div><div><span>And lastly, in regard to our government department budgets, increases for some Ministries with 

key  initiatives  upcoming  have  been  provided.    Just  three  examples  of  this  are  the  National 

Environment  Service,  Ministry  of  Marine  Resources  and  the  Cook  Islands  Seabed  Minerals 

Authority. 

</span></div><div><span>In the case of National  Environment  Service, Government  is  supporting  the implementation  of 

</span><span>data collection work associated with the National Environment Policy to help protect our National 

Environment.  One aspect of protecting our environment is waste management, and NES are going 

to undertake projects to deal with accumulated or legacy waste of vehicles and white-ware over 

the  next  two  years.    Government  is  also  providing  some  additional  support  to  the  Ministry  of 

Marine Resources to ensure that our marine environment is managed responsibly. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, our seabed minerals present a substantial opportunity for us to fulfil our country’s 

</span><span>long-term prosperity by being part of the global  supply chain for critical  metals needed for the 

</span><span>transition  to  green  energy.    In  order  to  realise  this,  we  must  continue  with  the  precautionary 

approach we have been taking towards developing our seabed minerals sector.  Our precautionary

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>approach is founded on the protection of our marine environment, science-based decision making, 

robust regulatory frameworks, and most importantly bringing our people along the journey.  To 

support this and to ensure we apply best international practices, the Seabed Mineral Authority has 

been  provided  with  some  additional  funding  to  continue  their  work.    Through  our  Exploration 

Research  Programme,  we  will  continue  to  gain  more  knowledge  and  information  about  our 

minerals  and  the  potential  impacts  of  harvesting  them.    This  is  a  journey  of  discovery  for  our 

country Mr Speaker and I am proud to support this endeavour. 

</span></div><div><span>If I can turn to our </span><span>building up of our cash reserves and our financial</span><span>assets</span><span> Mr Speaker, we remain 

committed to building up our reserves and financial assets for our resilience.  This Budget includes 

a sensible plan for the repayment of our loan principals for the loans taken out by the Government 

during the Pandemic, while also supporting our progress into both operating and fiscal surpluses. 

</span></div><div><span>This also includes ensuring we have balances available in both our stabilisation account and our 

loan repayment fund to ensure we can meet our obligations. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I’ll  turn  to  our  Capital  Investments  now  and  I’ve  spoken  many  times  about  the 

</span><span>importance of capital expenditure, about its ability to employ workers and stimulate our economy, 

particularly while investment from private companies is limited.  Governments all over the world 

</span><span>know this, and the Cook Islands is no different.  That’s why it’s one of the Eco</span><span>nomic Recovery 

Roadmap work streams. 

</span></div><div><span>Capital  Investment  in  this Budget  will continue the Government’s investment themes from  the 

</span><span>previous year. 

</span></div><div><span>In this Budget, Government has focused on projects that are already in progress or in development 

in order to deliver economic stimulus to the Cook Islands.  These are intended to employ local 

contractors and labour, such as, the </span><span>Te Tau Papa o Avarua </span><span>–</span><span> the Avarua Town Plan</span><span> project which 

is  funded  by  the  Infrastructure  Trust  Fund.    This  undertaking  is  set  to  employ  a  number  of 

</span><span>individuals, providing them with opportunities to acquire new skills while contributing to a project 

</span><span>of national significance. 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, we will remain engaged in endeavours aimed at ensuring the safety and security of 

our people in the event of cyclones both in Rarotonga and the Pa Enua.   

</span></div><div><span>Infrastructure  Cook  Islands  will  continue  their  important  work  on  physical  infrastructure  on 

Rarotonga and the Pa Enua, with an ongoing focus on bridges and roads on Rarotonga, and marine 

</span><span>and air infrastructure works in the Pa Enua, including on Nassau and Manihiki.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>The Cook Islands Investment Corporation continues its focus on Government building works.  All 

of these projects employ local businesses and labourers on both Rarotonga and the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>As well as spending through the Budget, the Government is actively discussing additional capital 

investment  proposals  with  our  donor  partners.    We  continue  to  work  with  New  Zealand  on 

proposals to fund projects through the Infrastructure Trust Fund, with a strong emphasis on shovel 

ready projects that will keep our people employed and help to retain our skilled labour. 

</span></div><div><span>And Mr Speaker, turning finally to our social support programmes. 

</span></div><div><span>I commented earlier that inflation has been significant, but out of Governm</span><span>ent’s control.  While 

</span><span>we continue to work on reducing inflation, we must also help our vulnerable populations more 

directly.  Our families, both in Rarotonga and the Pa Enua, are feeling the pinch as the cost of 

bread, fuel and other necessities increase.  Government has provided a total of $3.4million dollars 

over  the  next  4  years  to  cover  increases  in  the  number  of  welfare  beneficiaries  as  well  as  the 

increase in the rates of Caregivers, Destitute and the Power subsidy. 

</span></div><div><span>These  payments  help  some  of  our  most  vulnerable  people  and  those  looking  after  our  most 

vulnerable, increasing these rates helps to bring them along with recovery in our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>Recent research about our Social Assistance packages has indicated that the Cook Islands social 

protection system is achieving impressive reach across the population.  Combined with the Child 

Benefit, the Old-Age Pension and the Power Subsidy Allowances, this has reached the equivalent 

of 91 per cent of the population either directly or indirectly.  If the other benefits (like the Infirm 

Benefit) were included, the coverage would be even higher.  These measure to  assist  our most 

vulnerable will help to continue the strong performance of our social welfare system. 

</span></div><div><span>To assist with the impacts of rising prices, the Government has also confirmed an increase in the 

minimum wage rate from $8.50 to $9.00 per hour.  For a worker on 35 hours per week, that is an 

</span><span>additional $900 per year.  The increase of the minimum wage to $9.00 per hour has required an 

</span><span>additional provision for Government's spending on personnel, mainly in the Pa Enua.  The total 

cost to Government is an additional $1.5 million over four years. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, climate change, COVID-19 and the energy crisis brou</span><span>ght on by Russia’s invasion of 

</span><span>the Ukraine has reminded us of our vulnerability to the flows of international forces. 

</span></div><div><span>However,  at  the  same  time,  our  health  and  economic  response  to  COVID-19  has  affirmed  our 

</span><span>ability  to  ensure  the  security  and  prosperity  of  our  people  through  our  own  actions,  and  by

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>We will advance our interests and drive the following strategic priorities. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, on the bilateral front, we will work closely with New Zealand to bring to fruition our shared 

aspirations as detailed in the 'Vaka Purua/Waka Houroa Partnership'. We will continue to partner 

with  Australia  to  deliver  on  our  commitments  as  detailed  in  the  'Oa  Tumana  Partnership 

Arrangement'. 

We  will  continue  to  work  closely  with  the  People's  Republic  of  China  and  Fiji  to  finalise  our 

bilateral partnership arrangements so that we can further deepen and expand our co-operation in 

trade, investment, tourism, ICT and people to people ties. 

</span></div><div><span>Second, as the current Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, we will work closely with the Forum 

Troika, of Fiji and Tonga to strengthen our regional leadership and amplify our Pacific advocacy 

on  global  issues  like  climate  action  and  finance,  debt  sustainability,  transport,  fisheries,  digital 

transformation and ensuring a nuclear free Pacific. 

</span></div><div><span>For the Cook Islands, this engagement as the Pacific Islands Forum Chair provides two fold gains, 

not only will the Cooks Islands be recognised as a regional leader who will bring about sustainable 

and transformative improvements, it also provides us with the opportunity to continue to project 

our voice in the global arena and place the Cook Islands on the global radar, which I firmly believe 

will bring about an increased interest in the Cooks Islands, which should result in direct benefits 

to our economy and our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Together with all Forum members, our Forum Secretariat and regional partners, we will prioritise 

the completion of the 2050 Strategy Implementation Plan to be launched at the 52</span><span>nd</span><span> Pacific Islands 

Forum Leaders Meeting to be hosted here in Rarotonga and Aitutaki from 6-10 November. 

</span></div><div><span>We will work proactively with the Forum Troika and all Forum members, the Forum Dialogue 

Partners and our regional organisations who are part of the Council for Regional Organisations for 

</span><span>the  Pacific  to  secure  Pacific  Partnerships  for  Prosperity  to  support  delivery  of  our  2050 

</span><span>Implementation Plan. 

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, we will step up engagement and participation in key multilateral organisations to protect 

our interests, cultivate coalitions so we amplify the advocacy of our Pacific priorities as detailed 

in  our  2050  Strategy  for  the  Blue  Pacific  Continent  and  secure  outcomes  that  will  deliver 

transformative benefits to our people. 

</span></div><div><span>We  will  step  up  engagement  with  the  following  multilateral  organisations  -  the  International 

</span><span>Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the International 

Maritime  Organisation  (IMO),  the  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA),  the  United  Nations

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organisation  (UNESCO),  as  well  as  the  World  Trade 

Organisation (WTO) and others. 

</span></div><div><span>Through these multilateral organisations, together with our Pacific community, we will work to 

strengthen, protect and use international rules and institutions to pursue the Cook Islands values 

and interests. 

</span></div><div><span>Discussion around how in the shadow of pandemic recovery the Cook Islands is a leading voice 

for  the  Pacific  on  issues  such  as  debt  management,  the  broad  geopolitical  environment  and 

ensuring that our voice, and those of our friends and neighbours across the region are heard.  In 

other words, Mr Speaker our country as the Chair of the Forum should be leading from the front.  

</span></div><div><span>I look forward to our Ipukarea hosting leaders from the region to our shores in November.  It will 

be an important opportunity for our nation to show our leadership contributions and create benefits 

for our people and our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion Mr Speaker, today's Budget is about nurturing our nation and ensuring we have the 

tools to remain resilient. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, I leave you with a Budget that balances fiscal responsibility but also takes 

into account the needs of our nation as we continue our journey towards our prosperous future.  

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana tatou katoatoa, e Kia Manuia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Minister of Finance, Honourable Mark Brown.  I call for a Seconder 

to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I understand there will be a Motion to refer this Budget to the 

</span><span>PAC and I reserve my rights to speak on the Merits and Principles on this good Budget after the 

PAC Committee has come back to this House with their report.  I think that is probably the same 

thinking of everybody in Parliament.  We reserve the rights of Members to speak to the Merits and 

Principles once the PAC Committee has come back with their Report.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you.  Honourable Prime Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:   </span><span>It was a remiss of me Mr Speaker to request a leave of absence for two 

</span><span>Members of our team, they are not here, they are both away on Official Duties; Minister Rose 

Toki-Brown and also the Member for Manihiki, Akaiti Puna.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Leave granted Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I call the Leader of the House? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TANGATAPOTO:  </span><span>I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 182 be suspended to allow for immediate referral of the 

Appropriation Bill 2023 to the Public Accounts Committee for review 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Leader of the House.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>I would like to reiterate what I said earlier on, the reservation for Members 

of Parliament to speak on the Merits and Principles of the Budget once the PAC Committee comes 

back with their Report. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I now see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  I  stand  for  clarification.    I  think  our  view  is 

consistent  with  what  the  Honourable  Tingika  Elikana  had  said.    I  just  wanted  to  be  clear  Mr 

Speaker,  that  a  Motion,  if  carried  to  suspend  Standing  Order  182,  will  not  do  away  with  our 

entitlement to speak on the Merits and Principles and I will explain why? 

</span></div><div><span>If we go to Standing Order 213, my concern is that when the Bill comes back from PAC we then 

go into consideration of the Bill in detail.  Like the Member of Pukapuka/Nassau, I want to be 

absolutely clear that in suspending the Standing Order 182 that we are not giving up our right to 

</span><span>speak on the Merits and Principles of the Bill.  And one of the reasons during the review of the 

</span><span>Standing  Orders,  Mr  Speaker  was  to  give  Members  of  this  House  plenty  time  to  look  at  the 

Appropriation  Bill  especially,  so  that  when  we  come  to  debate  it,  we  will  debate  it  with  well-

informed background.  We support that the Bill be referred to the Public Accounts Committee, I 

just wanted to ensure that in agreeing to suspend Standing Orders 182, that we are not giving up 

our right to debate on the Principles and Merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Leader of the United Party and you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 24 May 2023 

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I stand to strongly support of what the Leader of the Opposition 

had said, in regards to Standing Order 213, and our rights to speak on the Merits and Principles of 

the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I take your issues very strongly and when we come back, 

we will give you the opportunity to air out your concerns or whatever you have to the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>We will continue with the Motion and the Motion has been seconded. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The  Appropriation  Bill  2023,  now  stands  referred  to  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  for 

consideration and report. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we have ample time and you have the Budget Estimate with you and you 

have plenty of time to study the Bill, go through it and once we come back to Parliament, I will 

expect some constructive debate. 

</span></div><div><span>We have come to the end of our business for today.  Parliament will now adjourn until Monday 

19</span><span>th</span><span> June 2023, at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>May I ask an Honourable Member to say our Closing Prayer, please?
