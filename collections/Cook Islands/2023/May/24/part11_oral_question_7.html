<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NIHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  for  the  good  question.    I  can  see  the 

Minister Maggie is not here so the Member is hurling the questions at me instead.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Just to answer the question Honourable Member, yes there is a tender process within our system 

and within our works program.  This is a process run by MFEM and the Crown Law Office.  I 

believe Mr Speaker, when these main road programs were put up for tender, I believe TRIAD was 

</span><span>the only company that submitted tenders for this particular hot-mixed sealing program.   

</span></div>
<div><span>But for our back roads Mr Speaker and our side roads, that is left totally up to our Civil team at 

ICI.  The roads on our Pa Enua are also under the care of the Civil team at ICI and it is this program 

Mr  Speaker  that  we  draw  the  support  and  resources  from  our  private  sector  such  as  the  T&amp;M 

Heather who are currently been engaged to deliver some of these roading programs.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Other companies such as Mike Rennie Contractors and Koko Ariihee has often been called on this 

</span><span>program Mr Speaker.  We have got four or five roads being repaired currently and these companies 

</span><span>I have mentioned Mr Speaker, are all part of the work program that is currently running as we 

speak.
