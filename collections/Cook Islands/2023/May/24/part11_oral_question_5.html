<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MR T. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question and is directed to the 

Minister Responsible for ICI.  

</span></div>
<div><span>During  the  last  Parliament  Sitting,  I  was  happy  to  know  that  the  road  sealing  project  will 

commence again and not only for Matavera, but all the way to Titikaveka and on the back road as 

well.  The question then Honourable Minister is in reference to all the work done on the road.  We 

know that the main contractor responsible for the hot-mixed sealing is Chris Vaile.  

</span></div>
<div><span>The question is, have you any thoughts in looking at involving other contractors such as the T&amp;M 

</span><span>Heather or Koko Ariiheeâ€™s company because they maintain our roads as well?</span></div>
