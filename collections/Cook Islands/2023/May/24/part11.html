</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Question time is for half an hour and I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is to the Minister of ICI.  I have an easy 

question  for  the  Minister.    Honourable  Minister,  the  road  from  BCI  in  town  to  Avana  is  very 

smooth.    My  questions  is,  do  you  have  any  plans  in  applying  hot-mixed for  the  road  from  the 

bridge  of  Avana  to  Titikaveka?    We  all  know  that  Ngatangiia  is  one  of  the  busiest  village  in 

Rarotonga.    I  would  like  to  help  the  Honourable  Member  of  Ngatangiia  with  his  plea  for  the 

complete repair of the main road of his village, hence my question, if the Minister has any plans 

to complete the roadwork project to Titikaveka with hot-mixed.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  for  your  question.    Before  I  respond  to  the  question,  Mr 

Speaker, Clerk and your staff members, Honourable Members of Parliament, Kia Orana to you all.  

In  response  to  the  question  raised  by  the  Honourable  Member  of  Matavera,  here  is  the  simple 

answer to your simple question, Yes! 

</span></div><div><span>As per the plans in completing the roadwork project that was set last year, from Matavera to Avana, 

however, at that time before this major project started, a change of plan was made to cover the 

main road from Matavera to Tupapa first.  However, we can see today that this work is completed 

and the work will pick up again from Avana and will continue to Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to inform our people that the intention of the Government is to complete the entire 

roadwork projects for Rarotonga.  It is true that some villages have been left out, but to let everyone 

know, the intention of the Government is to complete the whole of Rarotonga with hot-mixed, 

including Puaikura.  

</span></div><div><span>However, this depends on the funding we get; whenever we receive some funds, roadwork will 

</span><span>continue.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, to answer your question, yes!  Today, we have engineers from ICI preparing plans for 

this specific task for Avana to Muri and all the way to Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>Once we get more funding, the project will continue on for the rest of Titikaveka and into Puaikura.  

And then from Puaikura, we will connect  through to  Harley Street,  and that  will complete our 

</span><span>vision that we are aiming for.

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>Furthermore, I wanted to inform everyone of an outstanding project that we have in Nikao.  We 

will come back to that eventually before we continue with the roadwork project around Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>But to answer your question, yes!  We are currently reviewing the roadwork needed for Avana to 

Muri.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I have a Supplementary Question and is directed to the 

Minister Responsible for ICI.  

</span></div><div><span>During  the  last  Parliament  Sitting,  I  was  happy  to  know  that  the  road  sealing  project  will 

commence again and not only for Matavera, but all the way to Titikaveka and on the back road as 

well.  The question then Honourable Minister is in reference to all the work done on the road.  We 

know that the main contractor responsible for the hot-mixed sealing is Chris Vaile.  

</span></div><div><span>The question is, have you any thoughts in looking at involving other contractors such as the T&amp;M 

</span><span>Heather or Koko Ariihee’s company because they maintain our roads as well?</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  A.  NIHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member  for  the  good  question.    I  can  see  the 

Minister Maggie is not here so the Member is hurling the questions at me instead.   

</span></div><div><span>Just to answer the question Honourable Member, yes there is a tender process within our system 

and within our works program.  This is a process run by MFEM and the Crown Law Office.  I 

believe Mr Speaker, when these main road programs were put up for tender, I believe TRIAD was 

</span><span>the only company that submitted tenders for this particular hot-mixed sealing program.   

</span></div><div><span>But for our back roads Mr Speaker and our side roads, that is left totally up to our Civil team at 

ICI.  The roads on our Pa Enua are also under the care of the Civil team at ICI and it is this program 

Mr  Speaker  that  we  draw  the  support  and  resources  from  our  private  sector  such  as  the  T&amp;M 

Heather who are currently been engaged to deliver some of these roading programs.  

</span></div><div><span>Other companies such as Mike Rennie Contractors and Koko Ariihee has often been called on this 

</span><span>program Mr Speaker.  We have got four or five roads being repaired currently and these companies 

</span><span>I have mentioned Mr Speaker, are all part of the work program that is currently running as we 

speak.

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I can see the Honourable Toanui Isamaela; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to all the Honourable Members of this 

House.  To all those in Government and also those in the Opposition side, I greet you.  

</span></div><div><span>My question is also directed to the Minister Responsible for CIIC.  I wanted to talk on our road in 

</span><span>Aitutaki but because a “NO” was given as an answer to the comments by the Honourable Vaitoti 

</span><span>Tupa, I then changed my mind. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I will make a brief explanation before asking my question.  I am talking about  the 

harbour project underway on Aitutaki.  I am not criticizing the Government but I want to talk about 

the problems on the works done on the island.  

</span></div><div><span>We are still having problems on the island and the working spirit is unbecoming of how the work 

is  managed.    We  also  know  that  a  lot  of  funding  has  been  poured  into  this  project.    Ongoing 

discussions  between  the  project  managers  and  Island  Government  are  rarely  being  held  but  if 

problems arise, then they go back to the discussion table.  There are also problems amongst the 

workers working on the project.  The only good thing that has happened is that appointment of the 

new Chairman of the CIIC Board and the question to the Minister is, what are your plans to settle 

these problems between the Island Government and the people of Aitutaki?  How much money is 

required to complete this project?  We know there is a new Chairman, I am asking how best can 

we run this project on Aitutaki? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister Albert Nicholas 

and I am sure he can sort that out. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member for your very good question because it 

</span><span>was the same question that your Mayor and Executive Officer had asked me when they came to 

</span><span>see  me  last  week.    I  am  unsure  of  where  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  stands 

between the Island Council and CIIC for this programme, but I wanted to assure you that one of 

the intentions in electing a new Chairman is to ensure that these groups of peoples to work together. 

</span></div><div><span>I am hoping that the new Chairman will be able to bring this project to fruition.  However, as I 

have told the Mayor and the EO, they have certain responsibilities that they need to do to bring 

everyone together and to ensure that this programme is completed.  The intention of bringing the 

</span><span>three Members of Parliament of Aitutaki together involves the Island Council as well.  If they can 

</span><span>do this, then I can confirm to everyone today that I can do my part in making sure that CIIC and 

the Island Council will work together.  Nevertheless, the funding that has been used so far, I will

</span></div><div><span>Third Meeting 

</span></div><div><span>be coming over next week and I would like to meet with the three Members of Parliament, Island 

Council Members and harbour project management as well.  I am coming over next week on Friday 

and we will discuss further on this.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the 

Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and all the staff of Parliament.  Kia Orana 

to  the  Prime  Minister  and  your  Cabinet  Ministers,  Honourable  Members  of  the  CIP  and 

Independent Members.  Kia Orana also to our side of the House, the United Party and the OCI 

Party and us the Democratic Party Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a question to the Prime Minister.  Last week, a meeting was held in Rakahanga and the 

meeting was livestreamed.  The purpose of the meeting was to inform the people that $37.5 million 

will be used to complete some of the outstanding projects that the Government did not complete.  

This includes the airport, solar system, water supply and everything else which will cost $37.5 

million.  The meeting was okay, however, the announcement that was made was that the Prime 

Minister supported this.  The people that spoke in this meeting Prime Minister were the Mayor, 

EO and Iro Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>I am sorry Honourable Prime Minister because your name has been mentioned in the meeting so, 

I would like to ask you these questions: 

</span></div><div><span>1.</span><span>Did you know about this meeting?  

2.</span><span>Did you know what the meeting was about? 

3.</span><span>Did you support the purpose of this meeting?   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. BROWN:</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Speaker.    I see that our time is  up  and  I  will give  you my 

answers next month. 

</span></div><div><span>However, no, I will give my answer to the Honourable Members’ question.  I would like to confirm 

</span><span>that  I  was  not  aware  of  this  meeting  which  was  done  on  Rakahanga  and  I  never  received  any 

proposals on the discussions made at this meeting.  I am not sure as to how my name was raised 

and used in supporting these proposals. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that my answer to question is clear.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
