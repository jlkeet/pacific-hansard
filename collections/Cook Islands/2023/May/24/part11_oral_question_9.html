<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ISAMAELA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to all the Honourable Members of this 

House.  To all those in Government and also those in the Opposition side, I greet you.  

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is also directed to the Minister Responsible for CIIC.  I wanted to talk on our road in 

</span><span>Aitutaki but because a “NO” was given as an answer to the comments by the Honourable Vaitoti 

</span><span>Tupa, I then changed my mind. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I will make a brief explanation before asking my question.  I am talking about  the 

harbour project underway on Aitutaki.  I am not criticizing the Government but I want to talk about 

the problems on the works done on the island.  

</span></div>
<div><span>We are still having problems on the island and the working spirit is unbecoming of how the work 

is  managed.    We  also  know  that  a  lot  of  funding  has  been  poured  into  this  project.    Ongoing 

discussions  between  the  project  managers  and  Island  Government  are  rarely  being  held  but  if 

problems arise, then they go back to the discussion table.  There are also problems amongst the 

workers working on the project.  The only good thing that has happened is that appointment of the 

new Chairman of the CIIC Board and the question to the Minister is, what are your plans to settle 

these problems between the Island Government and the people of Aitutaki?  How much money is 

required to complete this project?  We know there is a new Chairman, I am asking how best can 

we run this project on Aitutaki?
