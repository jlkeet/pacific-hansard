<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON.  A.  NICHOLAS:</span><span>    Thank  you  for  your  question.    Before  I  respond  to  the  question,  Mr 

Speaker, Clerk and your staff members, Honourable Members of Parliament, Kia Orana to you all.  

In  response  to  the  question  raised  by  the  Honourable  Member  of  Matavera,  here  is  the  simple 

answer to your simple question, Yes! 

</span></div>
<div><span>As per the plans in completing the roadwork project that was set last year, from Matavera to Avana, 

however, at that time before this major project started, a change of plan was made to cover the 

main road from Matavera to Tupapa first.  However, we can see today that this work is completed 

and the work will pick up again from Avana and will continue to Titikaveka. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to inform our people that the intention of the Government is to complete the entire 

roadwork projects for Rarotonga.  It is true that some villages have been left out, but to let everyone 

know, the intention of the Government is to complete the whole of Rarotonga with hot-mixed, 

including Puaikura.  

</span></div>
<div><span>However, this depends on the funding we get; whenever we receive some funds, roadwork will 

</span><span>continue.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, to answer your question, yes!  Today, we have engineers from ICI preparing plans for 

this specific task for Avana to Muri and all the way to Titikaveka. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Once we get more funding, the project will continue on for the rest of Titikaveka and into Puaikura.  

And then from Puaikura, we will connect  through to  Harley Street,  and that  will complete our 

</span><span>vision that we are aiming for.

</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, I wanted to inform everyone of an outstanding project that we have in Nikao.  We 

will come back to that eventually before we continue with the roadwork project around Rarotonga.   

</span></div>
<div><span>But to answer your question, yes!  We are currently reviewing the roadwork needed for Avana to 

Muri.
