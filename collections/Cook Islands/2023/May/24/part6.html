<div><span>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER 

</span></div><div><span>I have a few announcements to make. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, on behalf of our Members of Parliament, Clerk and Staff of Parliament, we would like to 

extend our words of encouragement and well wishes to our hard-working Transcriber, Mrs Tai 

Hosking, who is currently in New Zealand for health treatment.  We send you our positive thoughts 

and love and we look forward to having you back with us very soon. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to welcome two new Staff Members to our Parliamentary family.  Our new Senior 

Finance Officer, Mrs Grace Ioane and Assistant Administration and Finance Officer, Ms Marina 

Harry;  we  greet  and  welcome  you  both  to  our  working  family  and  may  your  journey  with 

Parliament be an enjoyable and successful one. 

</span></div><div><span>The last couple of days have been extremely busy for our Public Accounts Committee.  Later in 

our Sitting today, the Chairman for PAC will be tabling four Committee Reports to the House.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Director of Audit, Mr Desmond Wilden and also 

the Advisor to the Public Accounts Committee for his contribution and unwavering support to the 

</span><span>Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>Last but not least, due to the passing of our former Chaplain Reverend Oirua Rasmussen, I am 

delighted  to  formerly  announce  the  new  Chaplain  for  Parliament,  Reverend  Teava  Nanai.  

Reverend Teava is also the new Minister for the Nikao CICC Church.  We welcome Reverend 

Nanai and we thank you for your continuous service to our Parliament.  May God bless you and 

your wife as you serve our people.
