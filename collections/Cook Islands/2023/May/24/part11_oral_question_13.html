<div><span>I have a question to the Prime Minister.  Last week, a meeting was held in Rakahanga and the 

meeting was livestreamed.  The purpose of the meeting was to inform the people that $37.5 million 

will be used to complete some of the outstanding projects that the Government did not complete.  

This includes the airport, solar system, water supply and everything else which will cost $37.5 

million.  The meeting was okay, however, the announcement that was made was that the Prime 

Minister supported this.  The people that spoke in this meeting Prime Minister were the Mayor, 

EO and Iro Puna.
