<h3>Oral Question 15</h3>
<div><span>MR M. BROWN:</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Speaker.    I see that our time is  up  and  I  will give  you my 

answers next month. 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, no, I will give my answer to the Honourable Membersâ€™ question.  I would like to confirm 

</span><span>that  I  was  not  aware  of  this  meeting  which  was  done  on  Rakahanga  and  I  never  received  any 

proposals on the discussions made at this meeting.  I am not sure as to how my name was raised 

and used in supporting these proposals. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I believe that my answer to question is clear.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
