<h3>Oral Question 19</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the point I raised my concern with him seeking the appealings 

of the public at this stage after four years of them having the opportunity to do it, it is because what 

I might be seeing about development in the Northern Group they might put it into their manifesto 

and tell the public itâ€™s their idea.  That is my concern Mr Speaker.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The question is whether fresh fish and taro can be sent to Rarotonga.  Mr Speaker as I said when I 

spoke on the mertis and principels of the budget, I gave hints what is the opportunities available if 

we open tourism to the Northern Groups.  Unfortunately, I am not prepared to expand on those 

thoughts because the Opposition is going to take it and write it into their manifesto.
