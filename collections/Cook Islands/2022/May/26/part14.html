<div><span>MARINE RESOURCES: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $2 million… 

</span></div><div><span>Sorry, may I call the Leader of the House? 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 307 is suspended to enable Parliament to complete the debate on the 

Appropriation Bill 2022 in all its stages today 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I call a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, we will continue in the Committee of Supply on the Vote Item for Marine 

Resources. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $2,234,000 for Marine Resources stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open.  I see the Honourable Tamaiva Tuavera; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA: </span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I will not be long on this matter because as we 

</span><span>can see from the budget of last year and the budget of this year there is a significant difference to 

the budget.  My only concern is the Marine can perform their duties in safeguarding our fishing 

areas  or  in  our  EEZ.    I  see  they  have  increased  their  personnel  in  both  Outputs  1  and  2.    The 

concern here again is that if that personnel have increased I hope that the job is getting done. 

</span></div><div><span>I just want to talk about an opportunity to expand the contribution of fisheries to our GDP because 

we do have opportunities up north to expand this.  I do see in here that government is looking at 

aquaculture but I want to remind government that our people overseas and our people locally they 

</span><span>do love our seafood.  I must take this back to Penrhyn because I have seen buildings up there that 

</span><span>can be refurbish.  I know they have just finished building their shelters and now the hospital is 

going up, therefore these four buildings are still sitting there.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>To expand the contribution to GDP, we should really look at how we can utilise these buildings 

throughout the northern group.  I have researched the growing of our clams. I have spoken to the 

people in Aitutaki in the agriculture in Aitutaki and I have actually been there to develop or to 

grow these little things into paua.  I know this can happen to the black pearl shells and I believe 

that is where the korori comes from.  Not long ago, we had korori at Minister Tapaitau’s mothers’ 

unveiling and I could not believe how big these kororis were.  So, this is something we can fall 

back on and give our people up north jobs.  I think this is something that they would look forward 

to. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to Output 2. Compared to last year’s Output we are not talking about anything new 

anymore.  I think it is because of COVID and COVID seems to have cut everything out.  I think 

we must get above COVID and try to beat COVID by doing what we should be doing to make 

sure our country moves ahead.  As in Health, we have hit into a wall and forgotten about other 

things like dental and so it is the same as we are in Fisheries we have hit a wall and forgotten about 

other ways  of improvement.    I am  hoping that our  Fishing  Licences will be improved because 

seven  years  is  coming.    Mr  Prime  Minister  is  that  correct  to  renew  the  Fishing  Licences?  

Therefore, I hope that we come above 18 cents a kilo just to expand on the money coming into the 

coffers.    We  on  this  side  agree  half-heartedly  to  the  budget  because  it  had  been  slashed  but  if 

government wishes to talk to Marine maybe you can increase the budget for Marine. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Robert 

Tapaitau; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  This year’s budget I think has been formulated 

to  provide  a  balance  between  people  service  delivery  and  sustainable  marine  resource 

management.  With a new Strategic Plan in place, this budget will support MMRs improvements 

towards  the  long-term  sustainability  of  marine  ecosystems  and  resources  and  livelihood 

opportunities  for  the  benefit  of  the  Cook  Islands  people.    This  includes  supporting  national 

priorities ensuring that policies and planning contributes to our countries economic recovery and 

resilience.  

</span></div><div><span>As  the  regulator  for  Marine  Resources,  management  key  areas  of  focus  for  this  budget  and  a 

medium term include that sufficient resources are provided to fund staff positions and ensure that 

</span><span>key  roles  are  provided  for.    A  strong  Ministry  needs  strong  staff  complement  with  the 

</span><span>compounding  issues  of  physical  restraints  and  competition  across  local  and  international 

employment  markets  for  our  skilled  people.    Investing  in  strengthening  and  supporting  staff 

capabilities is absolutely necessary.   

</span></div><div><span>Improving coastal fisheries management will also be a focus in this year’s budget.  It will facilitate 

access to Marine Resources that supports the livelihood and wellbeing of our people.  This includes 

an  approach  to  develop  conservation  and  management  measures  at  both  the  local  and  national 

level.    This  includes  supporting  government  wide  initiatives  to  improve  lagoon  and  ocean 

</span><span>ecosystem  management,  continue  to  pursue  our  partnerships  with  local  governments  and 

</span><span>communities.    Supporting  our  fisheries  and  black  pearl  sector  but  also  ensuring  that  adequate 

information is collected and reported to clearly identify what activities are working and where the 

Ministry can best focus its resources to support.

</span></div><div><a>Page 46</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>Sustainable  development  opportunities  and  the  continued  pursuit  of  investment  to  create 

diversification  of  fisheries  development  opportunities  and  economic  stimulus.    Re-engaging  in 

front line compliance and enforcement activities to ensure Maritime security and fisheries controls 

and monitoring are bolstered and continue to be effective. 

</span></div><div><span>Continue successful delivery of the fisheries development small grants fund to local fishermen one 

that is welcome by the local fishermen.  International engagement will continue to be an important 

area of MMR’s work to secure our rights and access to fishery resources and advance the Cook 

Island Strategic interests.  This is vital to maintaining sustainable fisheries as well as deriving the 

benefits we gain from fishery resources such as food security employment and economic returns.  

</span></div><div><span>So even though the MMR budget is a lot less than what it was last year the team at MMR are doing 

a fabulous job.   

</span></div><div><span>Before I finish, I would also like to congratulate the HOM for MMR, Pamela Maru for her re-

appointment as the HOM for MMR and also to all the staff that work for Marine Resources in 

Rarotonga and the Outer Islands so for me, I support the Budget.  God Bless us all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.
