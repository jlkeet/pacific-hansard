<div><span>OMBUDSMAN:   

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $301,000 for Ombudsman stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open and I see the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Tina Browne; you have the 

</span><span>Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:   </span><span>Mr Chairman, this Ministry is  not  too different  to  the Audit 

Office.    PERCA  Committee  under  the  Audit  Office  deals  with  complaints  from  everyone 

especially the public.  The Ombudsman deals with complaints from government employees against 

general mis-administration of government Ministries. 

</span></div><div><span>Last  year,  I was very impressed with the Report that was filed by the Ombudsman, the former 

</span><span>Ombudsman and I was sad when I heard the news that he had retired.  I recall that his Report dealt 

</span><span>with firstly the number of complaints that they had received, the reports they had completed and 

the reasons why the other reports were not completed and the reasons why he gave in his report 

was that there was little cooperation from Ministries in the form of responding to queries.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I support the allocation or we on this side of the House support the allocation, it is a small allocation 

because  we  see  the  need  for  an  Ombudsman  Office  who  is  supposed  to  be  independent  and 

impartial and responsible to this Parliament.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister,  Vaine 

Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Chairman and thank you to the words of support from the 

Leader of the Opposition.   

</span></div><div><span>Taking on her concerns, on the 20</span><span>th</span><span> April the current Ombudswoman met with the Commissioner 

of Police and the Deputy Police Commissioner Akatauira Matapo at their Office.  This issue of 

non-response between both offices were discussed at that meeting.  As a result of that, a Letter of 

Intent has been drawn up with a schedule of response times between the communications of a case 

to keep it on track with what is necessary.   

</span></div><div><span>This document has been looked over by the Crown Law Office and will be signed once agreed to 

by the Police Commissioner and the Ombudswoman. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, in the short time that our new Ombudswoman has come on board we have built up 

a good working relationship with the Asia Pacific Forum to deal with human rights.  Human rights 

will now become one of the key responsibilities for the Office of the Ombudsman. 

</span></div><div><span>Next month, the Judge Peter Boshier who is the Ombudsman of New Zealand with a small team 

will visit our Office here in the Cook Islands.  This is part of their capacity and support programme 

to  assist  our  Ministry  and  Peter  will  also  be  overseeing  a  mentoring  role  to  assist  both  our 

Ombudswoman and the staff within the Parliament Office.   

</span></div><div><span>With those few words, I would like to thank all the support from this Honourable House towards 

the Ombudsman Office.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $301,000 for the Ombudsman stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
