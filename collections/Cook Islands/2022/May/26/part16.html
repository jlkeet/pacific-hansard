</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I recognise the Honourable Selina Napa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Greetings  to  you  all.    Just  some  thoughts  on  the  Appropriation  for 

Parliamentary Services.   

</span></div><div><span>I heard the Speaker mention earlier on in the morning that we have to think of what we are going 

to speak in this House and we have to speed up because he sympathise with his staff staying back 

and working into the morning hours.  I would say that this is because we have no sitting calendar 

and this is what happened all our work has been cramped together and so we have to deal from 

morning until night time.  We fail to understand that the services that has been provided by the 

staff throughout the day and when we finish the meeting they will remain and continue preparing 

all their records in preparation for the Sitting in the morning. 

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday morning when I came to town through this way at 5 oâ€™clock in the morning the light in 

this building was still on and the cars outside and I said to myself they must still be working.  When 

I came in yesterday, I asked the staff whether they were still working early hours in the morning 

and they said yes because they needed their work to be completed before the Sitting of yesterday 

morning. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I will ask the government, and if we come into power we need to be reminded that there are 

workers in this House and they have been working from morning till afternoon and sometimes 

during  the  night.    As  it  had  been  mentioned  by  the  Member  for  Matavera,  and  I  reflect  those 

thoughts in saying that maybe there is not enough remuneration to pay for the staff here. 

</span></div><div><span>Some of the staff in this House have been working here for over 20 years in serving our country.  

So, what reward are we going to give them?  I want to thank the present Clerk of Parliament when 

he entered the Parliament, the procedures of our Committee meetings and Sittings of Parliament 

flowed smoothly.  Further, the way he is managing Parliament Services is admirable because my 

observation when we come into the House all the Papers has been prepared and ready for us to 

peruse. 

</span></div><div><span>We ask the question, why is there this kind of service provided to us, I would say it is because 

these staff who are holding top positions in Parliament know their roles and work and that is why 

</span><span>they are providing the Members of Parliament excellent services. 

</span></div><div><span>I  want  to  applause  you  Mr  Speaker  as  you  are  very  fortunate  that  you  have  good  workers  in 

carrying out our duties in providing the services that is needed by the Members that represents our 

people in this House.  When I look at the appropriation that we have allocated for Parliament and 

I have been in this House for many  years and considering the work that they perform, I would 

suggest that this is not enough maybe we need to give them an increase. 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is providing two services that I know and firstly they have a programme for women to 

</span><span>train them and experience as to how Parliament operates and they also have a youth programme 

</span><span>which they have been running for a couple of years.  This is training our young people with the 

expectation they will be interested in standing for Parliament in their own constituency.  In saying

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>this, I notice there are still more men in the House than women but our women representation are 

on the increase. 

</span></div><div><span>They  are  still  organising  training  programmes  for  us  the  Members  of  Parliament.    I  know  that 

Parliament is doing their work very well.  I want to make government aware of their good service 

and I would like to remind government from the Opposition we want to see a Sitting Calendar in 

the very near future. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to assure you when our government comes into power we will at the beginning of the year 

provide  you with a Sitting Calendar so  you can organise  your travelling overseas.  There is  an 

allocation that talks about the deliverable and I would like to ask the Minister in Charge as to the 

meaning of this.  In output 1 it says, a more efficient parliamentary scrutiny exerted by a Parliament 

for some teeth.  Maybe some of the works that we are doing there is not enough teeth in the things 

we are doing. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, we are required to sit in this House to go through the laws and Regulations, Standing 

Orders that we ought to do to perform so that our people will recognise that we are doing the job 

that we are paid to do.  I guess you are the government and you are saying that you are the people 

that are doing most of the work and we in the Opposition is not. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Honourable Member your time is up. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>Oh!  Finally, we in the Opposition give our strong support to this Appropriation.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you very much Honourable Member for your strong support.  I see the 

Honourable Minister, Rose Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  to  all  Members.    I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  the 

Appropriation that is set for the managing of this House where we always have our Sitting.  To 

you Mr Speaker, the Clerk of the House, the Acting Deputy Clerk, the Interpreters, the ladies in 

the kitchen and other staff members doing their work in the House, thank you very much.  To the 

cleaners of the House both inside and outside, greetings and thank you for your service. 

</span></div><div><span>We know that the staff of Parliament are working every day for the work that is assigned to them 

to do specially to service the Members of Parliament.  We have seen some changes in the staff of 

Parliament.  I thank the Clerk of the House for the changes that he has done in regards to the staff 

of Parliament.  I support the submission from the Member of Teimurimotia regarding an increase 

in the remunerations of the staff of Parliament in the near future. 

</span></div><div><span>With regards to the question that you have asked, the Clerk will later explain to us the answer.  I 

would like to mention of a young woman that used to work here in Parliament who passed away, 

</span><span>Kimiora Vogel and it has been a while now.  We pay tribute to her for her service to the House.  

</span><span>As you are aware in the House at this time there are a lot of Atiu on the staffing I am not only 

going to highlight Atiu, I respectfully add Nga-Pu-Toru, adding Mauke and Mitiaro.
