<h3>Oral Question 31</h3>
<div><span>MR N. BAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I will not ask questions to the Member from Pukapuka 

anymore otherwise he will go around the world and come back to our Parliament before he tell us 

the real story. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, my question Mr Speaker this morning to the Honourable Member of RAPPA, the Honourable 

Albert Nicholas.  Mr Speaker I believe the Associate Minister for ICI knows about something that 

happened  in  the  past.    I  was  told  that  our  roads  in  Akaoa  or  Puaikura  was  priority  on  the 

government list to be fixed. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The people of Puaikura was surprised that the whole project was moved to Tupapa.  That is why I 

was surprised to hear that Puaikura’s road was not completed, and I understand it was going to be 

sealed with the hot mix in 2016.  I also believe that there was a machine that was bought and it 

was a chip seal machine.  I want to know why that machine was bought and why it was not used.  

Who owns that machine? 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, that is why I was a bit disappointed when I heard that Puaikura’s road was supposed to be 

completed but the road work was moved to Tupapa.  Thank you.
