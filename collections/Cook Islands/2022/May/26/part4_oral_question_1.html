<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER (T. TURA):  </span><span>Please</span><span>be seated.  I call the House to order.  Greetings to you all on 

this beautiful morning.  We also extend greetings to our people on the island of Rarotonga, to those 

in the North and Southern Groups.  Greetings also to our Chaplain for conducting our service this 

morning.  It was a beautiful message, topped with the wonderful prayers that he delivered. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I will not forget our staff of Parliament, from the Clerk to his Assistant, the Interpreters and other 

staff who work for Parliament.  I want to thank them for their hard work as some of you are not 

aware that they finish work at 4.00 a.m. and start work again at 8.00 a.m. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We will now go to Question Time.  I will ask the Honourable Member Tingika Elikana to take the 

Floor and response to the question that was raised to him yesterday.  Please be patient with me, 

thank you.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Let us start again, there is some change to our programme for today.  I will call the Leader of the 

House, the Honourable Tehani Brown. 

</span></div>
