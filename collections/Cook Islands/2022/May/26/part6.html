<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Honourable Members, yesterday we were interrupted in the Committee of 

Supply by adjournment. We will now go to our next Vote Item, which is on Corrective Services.  

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question:  

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1, 729, 457 for Corrective Services stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Member William Heather; you have 

the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>I was going to give the Floor to the Minister Responsible for Corrective Services, he looks white 

this morning.  

</span></div><div><span>(Laughter) 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, on this Vote Item, we are looking at our inmates in prison. I 

</span><span>would like to dwell on Output 2 regarding the area of retraining our youth in there to reintegrate 

them back into society.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am happy with this.  I really believe it should be increased because I am happy with 

the work they are doing here. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the work scheme where they come out to assist the community with the Wardens, I am 

very pleased with the work they are doing here.  That is why I am suggesting to the Minister to 

</span><span>increase this Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>7 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>Some of the programmes they run and train our inmates are, planting, cleaning, grass cutting and 

others with the hope that these programmes will help them when they are released back into the 

community. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, if people see the good work that these young people do, they will be inspired to 

continue helping them.  I know this because my own son brings an inmate home and I am very 

happy to support him.   

</span></div><div><span>I have also done this during my time.  I have brought an inmate home to teach him to grow pawpaw, 

kumara and bananas and I eventually left him to work unsupervised.  I spent four years with this 

young man before he completed his sentence and then returned to Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>During those times, we eat together during our meals in the morning, lunch and in the evening.  I 

used to teach him the Word of God and his livelihood and not to return to his old way of life.  He 

became a very good friend of mine.  When I travel to Aitutaki and when I return to Rarotonga, he 

would give me some fish and other produce for my family.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Chairman, I support this Vote Item and to also request the Minister to give them an 

increment to support the work they are doing.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I think I will be the last speaker on this Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>I give my support to this Vote Item.  You will recall that those of us who were in this House in 

2016, the allocation  for  this Vote  Item  was $700,000.  There is  a difference if  you  look  at  the 

allocation for the Vote Item today and I believe it is because of the influence of the current Minister 

in Charge of this Ministry.  He has been fighting for an increase in this Vote Item and now we see 

the allocation is over a million.  The type of work they are carrying out at the prison today I would 

say it is moving ahead. 

</span></div><div><span>How did I know about this?  I know because I have a son in jail and he told me about the good 

</span><span>work that the Minister does.  The Minister mentioned in this House in 2019 that he always visit 

</span><span>the prison twice a day, in the morning and in the evening.  My son told me that the Minister for 

this Ministry always visit them daily. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  support  the  views  from  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to  increase  the 

financial  support  in  training  our  children  living  in  this  place.    I  am  supporting  this  Vote  Item 

because my son is now into planting.  During his time living home, he never want to plant but 

today, he is helping me with planting.  That is the reason for my support to this Vote Item because 

of the good work the Minister for this Ministry is doing to train our young people.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member,  Nooroa 

Baker; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. BAKER:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, before I give my thoughts, I rise to give my support to the Vote 

Item for Corrective Services.   

</span></div><div><span>The reason for my support is that I am one of the people that visits this place.  When we pay them 

a visit, we will notice the change in this place.  Some of the children in there comes from New 

Zealand.  They were in trouble the reason they went in and they do not know how to plant.  Today, 

we will notice that they know how to plant, they know how to mow lawns and they know how to 

keep  their  homes  clean.    We  know  for  sure  that an  increase  in  this  Vote Item  will  go  towards 

training our children.  

</span></div><div><span>I took about five children from this place and these five children are no longer in that place and 

their lives have changed.  Why, because they have been trained in this place to do the household 

work and for them not to go and steal but to be strong in doing their work in their homes.  So 

together  with  the  Member  from  Ruaau  and  the  Member  from  Matavera,  I  give  support  to  this 

allocation and if possible, to give an increase.  Therefore, I thank the Minister for the work that 

you are doing for our children and even those who are responsible in looking after our children 

there.  We encourage you, we thank you because these are our children.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  George 

Angene you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman for giving me this time to speak.   

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to you and your staff in this House, greetings to you all.  Greetings to you Honourable 

Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  all  the  government  supporters, 

greetings to you.  Greetings to the Leader of the Opposition, your Deputy and all Members in the 

Opposition side, greetings to you all.  

</span></div><div><span>To those listening by radio and those watching live, greetings to you all.  To my people of Tupapa 

Nui-o-Au from those who are holding positions and to our children, greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, we are now discussing the allocation for the Corrective Services and Probation and 

I believe this allocation is sufficient.  The people who have prepared this Appropriation know why 

</span><span>they  have  allocated  $1.7  million  for  this  Vote  Item.    When  we  look  at  this  Appropriation  in 

</span><span>accordance with our children in prison, it cost us about $50,000 to care for one person, for the bed, 

the food and for the people that keep them there, it is about 50 thousand.  If my officers at the 

Corrective Services are telling me that they don’t like that and they want to change and increase, 

I would have spoken to the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned by the Member Tupa, in 2019 I fought for the Vote Item for Corrective Services to 

be increased because I believe for over thirty years their allocation was never changed.  Therefore, 

the Officers in the Ministry for Corrective Services are happy for this increase in their Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>I call the prison house the centre of the earthquake in our country because when one or two inmates 

escapes there is a commotion in our community because the news broadcast of an escaped prisoner 

always bring fear to our people.

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I became the Minister Responsible for our prison and I believe this is God’s plan for me to go back 

to this place and look after our young people.  During that time, the then Prime Minister, Henry 

Puna confirmed that no other person is the best to look after the portfolio for Corrective Services 

but George Angene.  I have the highest qualifications in the government to do this kind of work 

and I believe that Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>The reason I returned to this place.  There is a song that says, </span><span>“When I look at the things happening, 

I am saddened”</span><span>.  What a pity because during my time, we were not called prisoners but slaves.  

That was my frame of mind during those times because I was there and the challenge for me is to 

go back there and serve our young people.  As mentioned by the Member for Matavera, Vaitoti 

Tupa, it is a weekly routine programme for me to visit the prison twice daily, in the morning and 

in the evening and three times on Sunday. 

</span></div><div><span>The reason I do this is to ensure the young people are trained and have the privilege to be visited 

by their loved ones and spend times together.  We also built a church and a shelter where families 

can come and visit their love ones and sit down comfortably. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Secretary of Justice, Mr Tai Joseph and also the Senior Superintendent 

Mr Purua for theis support in running this service.  There is a scripture that says, who will separate 

us from the love of God, is it prison – no. 

</span></div><div><span>The only issue that the prisoners have is the crime that  they have committed.  There are many 

kinds of crimes committed – small, middle and big ones.  I can tell you that none of the crimes that 

our inmates in prison have committed can compare to the ones that I have done.  That is the big 

reason why I always visit our prison to help our prisoners by sharing my experience.  I don’t call 

them inmates but my children and family. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Members of this House and to all our people on Rarotonga, when you want help around your 

home, you are welcome to take them to your home to work for you, they are available.  To our 

people, when you see them around go and say hello to them.    

</span></div><div><span>There are many good things that this Ministry have completed during my time as their Minister, 

</span><span>especially the maximum lockdown.  I have been in this place for a year and I believe while I was 

</span><span>in there, it drew me to the Lord.  It is in here that made me read and study the Bible, learn to speak 

English and other serious upskilling activities.  

</span></div><div><span>When I was an inmate, the place was like a pigs pen but I have done many improvements such as 

tiling the entire room, proper toilet and bedding for the maximum block.  During the old days I 

used to complain that we did not have a proper dining area to sit and eat our meals but I can confirm 

to this House that I have managed to get tables and seats for a proper dining area for our young 

people to sit and enjoy their meals.  I also thank the Honourable Prime Minister for allowing the 

</span><span>workers from CIIC to do some renovation work on areas of the building requiring renovation and 

</span><span>now it is all done and the prison has a facelift. 

</span></div><div><span>10 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank all the parents of our young people in prison who have taken time to come 

and visit our children and give them good counsels and encouragements.  I have been encouraging 

the young people in this place that when they leave the prison not to return back there because I 

only teach children once.  I do not believe that this is a bad place but in the publics mind it is a bad 

place because of what they are saying about it. 

</span></div><div><span>As stated in the book of Matthew 25:36, </span><span>“…I was in prison and you came to visit me.”  </span><span>Also in 

Matthew 7:1, </span><span>“Do not judge, or you too will be judged.”</span><span>  Why are you looking at the pip in George 

Maggies eyes when there is a log in your eyes.  To my staff working at our prison, offer a word of 

prayer for our children in there.  I can confirm to you that one day there will be no one living there.  

When I became the Minister for Corrective Services, there were 86 inmates in prison and today 

there are only 34 inmates.  So, we can see the difference because of the work that the staff had 

carried in there and the changes on our young men because of the influence of God to bring this 

change around.</span></div><div><span>Some of our  young people have now received  training at the  ICI centre.  Last night, a thought 

came to me as to how we can train our young men.  To those of our people with motorbikes that 

are no longer running, please bring them to the prison services so that it can be a practical training 

for our young men to fix them.  However, when your vehicle is fixed you have to pay the person 

responsible for fixing it.  But if I was to take your bike there then you will be lucky because you 

will not be paying 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, those are my thoughts and thank you Honourable Members for patiently waiting while 

I make my speech today.  You can see me wearing my white suit because I have a place to go at 

12.00 p.m. and I will be away for about five minutes to ordain me on another title.  Please do not 

copy this title.  I will be ordained as a Dur not a Sir, that is the title.  Yes, this is just to entertain 

us and to keep us awake as I can see some of you falling asleep.  

</span></div><div><span>God bless us all to continue serving our people and that we may win in the Elections and be back 

in the House again. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>I now put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum $1, 729, 457 for Corrective Services stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Before we move to the next Vote Item, I was reminded of an agreement made prior to this Sitting 

that only one Member would speak from each side to each Vote Item.  Thank you Honourable 

Members. 

</span></div><div><span>CROWN LAW – debating time is for 1 hour or less.  

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question:

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1, 204,000 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I am also reminded that Members should speak to the Vote Items only and not on the Principles 

again.  

</span></div><div><span>I see the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I rise to offer our thoughts on the 

appropriation for Crown Law.  On top of the greetings, to the Prime Minister and your side, to 

those of us on this side of the House, greetings.  To the staff of the Parliamentary Services in the 

House  working  as  well  as  those  in  the  kitchen  preparing  our  meals,  greetings.    To  our  two 

Interpreters doing a good job, greetings.  Greetings to all of us in the Name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>I support this appropriation for the Crown Law Office however, I want to make a comment on the 

appropriation for Crown Law.  

</span></div><div><span>I do believe this office is one of the most important office in the country.  Sometimes we do forget 

that the responsibility of Crown Law is to draft our legislations.  They also prosecute those taken 

to Court, not just in the Criminal Court but also in the Civil Court.  When I look at this, it shows 

the Crown Law is starting to consolidate our laws and the last time this was done was back in 

1994.  I am very encouraged seeing this because if our laws are not consolidated then it is up to 

you to look where to find the amendments and mark you own Act.  

</span></div><div><span>I  read  in  Book  2,  and  this  is  reminding  us  especially  during  Parliament  Sittings  like  the 

Parliamentary staff they do not get enough sleep.  I do know during the public consultations for 

the Immigration Bill, the lawyer that was assigned by Crown Law to do the work was very busy.  

Therefore, when I look at the Organisational Chart for Crown Law there are three vacant positions 

at Crown.  I know the responsibilities at Crown Law requires these positions to be filled.  I know 

last year they advertised a position and the positioned was filled. 

</span></div><div><span>If the Attorney General can look at the appropriation for Crown Law because not only is that there 

are not enough lawyers, we see that during Parliament Sittings, Crown Law advises Government.  

</span><span>We do know that there are not enough lawyers; Crown Law then advises Government and then 

</span><span>Parliament at the same time.  It has been stated in the past two years that in this situation, Crown 

Law only gives advice to Government and Parliament should secure its own legal advisor.  We 

know this does not happen because there are not enough funds in Parliament to secure their own 

legal advisor.  

</span></div><div><span>One of the things I am happy about the Crown Law Organisational Chart is their relationship with 

the New Zealand Parliamentary drafters.  The idea is ready to initiate a legislation it is referred to 

Crown Law then it is referred to the New Zealand Parliamentary drafters.  I would also like to 

</span><span>request the Attorney General to offer our thanks from the Opposition side to the Crown Law for 

</span><span>the hard work they did in particular during the COVID pandemic for COVID Act and the numerous 

amendments that followed.  On that note…

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I have to interrupt you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE</span><span>:  Mr Chairman that is the end of my speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Oh, thank you Honourable Member.  It is now time for recess and we will 

continue after we return to Parliament.  Committee of Supply is now suspended until 12.00 p.m. 

today. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.28 a.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>I call the meeting to order.  Before we suspended we were on the Crown Law 

Vote Item.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  The appropriation for the Crown Law Office in 

my view needs increasing.  However, at this  stage, this is what we can manage but there is no 

doubt that the staff in this Department put in significant hours in the work that they do. 

</span></div><div><span>Like  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  said,  this  department  is  one  of  the  unsung  Ministries  of 

government  during  the  COVID  period  that  we  have  come  through.    While  Te  Marae  Ora,  the 

Ministry of Finance and others and rightfully so played a major role in helping us through the two 

and a half years of the pandemic, the Crown Law Office also is one that is worthy of mention. 

</span></div><div><span>They  were  also  one  of  the  offices  who  worked  throughout  long  hours  to  try  to  complete 

Regulations and Ministerial Orders in order for us to protect our people at certain times during the 

last two years.  Therefore, I acknowledge that full credit should be given to this Ministry and we 

have developed Mr Chairman a good cohort of young qualified, very clever lawyers within this 

Office but like many careers, we need to make sure that we are competitive in our remuneration 

to these lawyers. 

</span></div><div><span>Like  other  specialised  professional  careers  in  the  Public  Service  such  as  Doctors,  Nurses, 

Engineers, these people can be enticed to much higher paying jobs overseas.  So it is a reality for 

</span><span>us that we must, in order to retain the best minds that we have, look at ourselves as being part of 

</span><span>the Regional or the International work force.  There is no doubt outside Agencies or companies 

would look to hire some of these lawyers if we did not keep up with our remuneration levels.  That 

is why I say I have no doubt that in the future we will need to increase the appropriation to this 

Ministry  because  not  only  do  we  have  openings  to  fill  in  certain  key  parts  but  we  have  to  be 

competitive with the salaries. 

</span></div><div><span>As I have mentioned earlier, what we have is a good cohort of good young qualified lawyers that 

are learning the ropes and coming through very, very well.  This is one office that upholds the 

</span><span>integrity of its work to the highest standards.  So any suggestion that they can be unduly influenced 

</span><span>by political influences not only should it be refuted, it is actually insulting to those lawyers in that 

office.    Therefore,  Mr  Chairman  I  stand  very  strongly  to  support  this  Appropriation  for  this 

Department.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,204,000 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT – debate time is for one hour.   

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>The sum of $1,566,750 for Cultural Development stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is  open  to any  Member.   I see the Honourable Member, Vaitoti Tupa;  you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Chairman.  I stand to support the Appropriation because 

I can see the allocation that has been scheduled for the projects to happen, and I am referring to 

Administrative Payments.  I am happy that the Government have remained with the Appropriation 

in support of this and for the provision that the House of Ariki should come under the Cultural 

Development because this is one of the important areas in regards to the House of Ariki and our 

traditional practice.  When we bring the House of Ariki under this Ministry, we will also recognise 

the improvement that will be given to our traditional doing. 

</span></div><div><span>As we all know, last year the House of Ariki administered by Parliament so I agree with what the 

Government have done to bring the House of Ariki under Cultural and in the things that they will 

do, it will be supported by the Cultural development. 

</span></div><div><span>We know today the Ministry of Culture have facilities where the meetings for the House of Ariki 

can be held and being under the Cultural development they will be supported strongly.   

</span></div><div><span>I also believe that the Archive Division is under the Cultural Development and this will connect 

</span><span>with the functions of the Are Ariki.   It is also fitting with the Museum having our artifacts and 

craft under the same umbrella with the Cultural Development working with the House of Ariki. 

</span></div><div><span>That  is  the  reason  I  stand  to  give  my  support  for  the  appropriation  given  to  the  Cultural 

Development and  to the House of Ariki.  I did not only look to the top I also looked to the side.  

Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question:

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>That completes the Cultural Development Vote Item. 

</span></div><div><span>EDUCATION – debate time of 1 hour. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,175,619 for Education stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Honourabl Members the Floor is open for debate.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  For the Appropriation for the Ministry of Education I 

strongly support it.  I also support for the increments to the wages and salaries of the staff of the 

Ministry.  The Government has allocated $300,000 to support this increment, they also have set 

the minimum wage here.  This is a big support from $8 to $8.50 an hour. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to come back to the issue on supporting our children studying overseas.  Mr Chairman I am 

talking for myself and my daughter who went has gone overseas to study.  She is studying overseas 

for four years.  I want you to calculate how much I have spent on her.  I am satisfied for what I 

have spent on my child because I want to tell you Mr Chairman that my daughter has completed 

her law studies in March this year. 

</span></div><div><span>Even though I have asked her to return back home and work for the Crown Law but she is pursuing 

to complete her studies for a Masters Degree in Law.  My question that I am asking is whether this 

Ministry is able to take a portion of this appropriation to support our children studying overseas.  

This is an example, the accommodation that my daughter is renting I am paying $500 a week.  She 

completed her studies from Waikato University.  Just consider a months rent which is $2,000 and 

for a year it will be $24,000 and for 4 years it is nearly $100,000.  But the comforting part is, she 

has completed her studies.  So, who will not be happy as a parent that their child has completed 

and graduated from her studies. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I am happy and supporting the increments to the salary for teachers and I am hoping that as 

soon as we pass this budget they will receive their pay rise straightaway.  So, I would like to ask 

Government to look at ways where we can support our private students who are going overseas to 

study.  I strongly support this appropriation.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member, I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo; you 

have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman and greetings to all the Honourable Members in 

</span><span>this House.  I stand to give my support to the appropriation for Education.  I first give my sincere 

appreciation and encouragement to all the Prinicipals and Teachers who are doing their task and

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>work very well in our schools, and to all our children who have given the opportunity to all our 

teachers in the schools and our education staff the privilege of work and income. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that our teachers will be very happy for the increments that they will be receiving.  I just 

want  to  make  some  comments  on  the  output  set  out  in  this  budget  allocation,  Output  5, 

infrastructure and support.  I would start from our schools in Mangaia because I hear that there is 

renovation  work  to  start  in  our  schools  in  Mangaia.    I  am  therefore  supporting  this  work  and 

strongly recommend that this work should be carried through until it is completed because if we 

fail to do it now it will become a big issue later. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, for our people to see the plans that will be carried for these renovation because there 

was a project proposed for the schools but it never took place, which was the upgrade of school 

grounds especially to make it safe for handicapped children and our elderly when they enter the 

school grounds.  This is one of the projects that should take place for the safety of our children and 

their parents. 

</span></div><div><span>The schools in Mangaia are still the old buildings with many steps going down and upward.  This 

needs  to  be  made  safe  and  fixed.    However,  I  am  happy  to  read  about  the  plans  that  has  been 

prepared to improve and develop the schools.  This is one of the written letters – quality landing 

and teaching requires quality infrastructure.  The reason why I am commenting on this is because 

when  we  read  it,  it  sounds  good  but  when  we  actually  go  to  the  school  it  is  a  different  story 

altogether. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  refer  to  the  accommodation  for  our  Outer  Islands 

scholarship students.  This has gone to the extent where parents will accompany their children to 

Rarotonga.  I am speaking on behalf of my island Mangaia and this is the case today with this 

matter.  When the parents accompany their scholar child here, there is a breakup with the families 

back home on Mangaia and this will decrease the population on the island. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I also see the assistance that will be provided for the training of teachers.  Following 

up  on  what  I  have  already  said  on  the  first  day,  my  encouragement  is  to  restart  the  Teachers 

Training College to train young teachers to replace the old ones retiring.  Therefore, Mr Chairman 

if we do not train any new teachers then there will be a reliance on expat teachers from abroad. 

</span><span>We all know there is a disparity when expat teachers are paid compared to our local teachers and 

</span><span>at times, this is disheartening on our local teachers.  Therefore, I am standing here to stimulate 

what I have said in getting a training school for our teachers.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I stand to give my thank you to all the teachers and parents who are giving support to 

our schools so our future will be in good hands.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN</span><span>:  Thank you honourable Member. Before I allow the Honourable Selina Napa 

to talk, I would like to welcome the Secretary of Education and Secretary of Culture to Parliament.  

</span><span>Greetings to you both.  Now, the Honourable Selina Napa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greeting to you all.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I have some thoughts on the Vote Item for the Ministry of Education.  When I read in here some 

of  the  intentions  of  the  Ministry  are  for  those  looking  to  better  their  situation  in  education 

particularly in the use and preservation of the Cook Islands Maori language.   

</span></div><div><span>I think when we look at this appropriation, it is good and I support it but I would just like to bring 

my thoughts to Output 2 on Learning and Teaching. Sorry, Output 3 Learning in the Community, 

Te Kakaia: Supporting parents in their roles in their child’s education programme.  It also says 

there are at least four Community Clinics on Rarotonga doing this programme.  

</span></div><div><span>Can the Minister clarify exactly where this community programmes are taking place?  When I look 

at this programme, it does not only involve our students and parents and there is a great progress 

in  Information  Technology  (IT)  today.    For  us  parents  when  we  look  at  the  technology  today 

considering the mobile phones we have limited knowledge and experience but our children are 

very knowledgeable and capable at this and they serve to teach us in some cases.  So, we should 

be identified where we can be involved in this programme to help us because when we look at 

some of the objectives of the Ministry of Education that says Providing education to all learners 

and there is a saying that says, </span><span>‘You are never too old to learn’. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming  back  to  Administered  Payments  for  Education  and  under  the  Government  Funded 

Scholarships.  Whether it is in this appropriation to subsidise our students intending to take courses 

at the USP.  I do want to commend this initiative provided by government to assist our students 

that is to provide subsidy students working in the country and assisting them to study at USP.  I 

believe this subsidy is for this year and next year. 

</span></div><div><span>I also see our youth are taking advantage of this programme so I commend the government for this 

good deed because I know one of the struggles of our children on Rarotonga is taking out loans 

for their USP course fees especially those who have just left school and have joined the workforce.  

This is one of our complaints about the minimum wage, we consider it is not sufficient to assist 

our students going into learning but government should be commended for providing this subsidy 

to support them. 

</span></div><div><span>I also see another private school funding an amount of $2,663,000 because government has set 

aside  funds  to  assist  our  private  schools.    My  only  issue  with  this  is  there  are  some  of  our 

</span><span>government  schools  with  very  good  Principals,  sorry,  all  our  government  schools  have  good 

</span><span>Principals to manage the school.  I see that through this kind of subsidy some private schools have 

drawn out some of the Principals from our government funded schools.  How do we maintain our 

Principals  in  our  government  schools  in  order  to  keep  the  high  standards  in  our  government 

schools?  I know in the Takitumu School when the principal left to teach in a private school, the 

parents took their children to where this teacher is now teaching.  I have no doubt the replacement 

Principal is a very good teacher and manager as well.  

</span></div><div><span>I do say that the students today are very fortunate at the learning situation in our schools especially 

</span><span>at  the  primary  level  as  some  of  them  are  receiving  Red  Cross  Certificates  and  how  to  use  a 

</span><span>Defibrillator Machine.  One my child knows how to use this machine and I am very happy with 

this kind of training because this may serve to help one of us should we collapse.  I also like seeing

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>some of the schools taking their students to the Pa Enua to learn the life in the Pa Enua and I enjoy 

that.</span></div><div><span>The latest one is the Rising Star Competition that have started last week. I am happy to see the 

parents support our children playing sport.  Therefore, I would like to commend the Ministry of 

Education for working together with this Organisation by Teina Rongo.   

</span></div><div><span>I read one of the Reports from previous years regarding the health of our students and one of the 

major issues is the increasing rate of NCDs.  I was very surprised when I attended the event and 

saw the participation by the students of all sizes and all makes, the tall ones, the medium ones, the 

short, the wide ones and the skinny ones taking part in sports. 

</span></div><div><span>For those of us in this House, parents if you haven’t seen your children and grandchildren in the 

sports, if we finish early on Friday take the time to go through Arorangi Sports field and they will 

be so happy to see us there supporting them.  

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, my views on the bus service.  There is a budget administered amount of $26,325.  I do see 

our school buses going around the island and it is full of students.  I would like to commend the 

bus drivers because they are very good at looking after our children.  However, I would like to see 

a bit more commitment from government in giving them a bit more money because the status of 

the bus, when  you are on the bus, we have  an accident with  one child on the bus at  one time.  

Regardless whether this is a private business we should assist to ensure the safety of our children 

travelling on the bus because the situation was one of the school children exiting the bus and he 

was cut with a rusty bit of steel on his feet, a deep cut.  You can imagine how angry the parent was 

but what can you do. 

</span></div><div><span>That is all I can say on this issue but I am looking at this $26,000, is this for Rarotonga only or for 

the rest of the Cook Islands but I do not know what the situation is there. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Secretary of Education, your staff, the Minister of Education and all of you in the Education 

area striving to work hard for our children, may God grant  you the strength and the wisdom to 

carry on the good work that you are doing.   

</span></div><div><span>My comments also go out to all the Principals of our schools on all the islands and your staff, may 

</span><span>God grant you the strength and the devotion to the education of our children.  In addition, I know 

today, the Ministry of Health is working closely with the Ministry of Education to provide our 

children healthy lunch for a healthy life style education programme.  I did see a note that came 

back through the lunch box of my little baby saying do not put this food and that food in but to put 

in coconut and fruits and I was very happy to see this. 

</span></div><div><span>My last challenge to the Ministry of Education in particular when we come to the Parents Day 

where children are adorned with lolly </span><span>eis,</span><span> somewhat like what the CICC does during the Teretere 

</span><span>Programme where visiting church members are full of lollies.  I want us all to work on this and to 

</span><span>see how we can cooperate in changing this lifestyle and our overall aim is to battle NCD so this 

rate will drop right down.  Those are my thoughts, thank you very much.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    You  have  given  me  some  hard  time 

identifying the definition of the words </span><span>Principles</span><span> and M</span><span>erits</span><span>.  I now see the Honourable Minister 

Vaine Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:  </span><span>I enjoyed listening to your thoughts concerning the Appropriation given 

to Education, and I hope the Secretary is taking note of the good comments that have been made 

starting with the access of school students.  I believe these are the programmes that will go together 

with CIIC because that is the Ministry responsible for maintaining all the school buildings in the 

Cook Islands except for Mangaia. 

</span></div><div><span>I am happy to hear the comments from the Member for Titikaveka when she said that we should 

do away with giving our children lolly </span><span>eis</span><span> during the Prize Giving ceremonies.  I really wanted the 

Member  for  Ngatangiia  to  be  present  because  he  is  always  commenting  on  NCD.    I  think  the 

Secretary can give a directive to the Principals not to allow lolly </span><span>eis</span><span> in schools and that will make 

the Member for Ngatangiia happy. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, as mentioned by the Member for Titikaveka, there is a programme that have been 

started in the schools to encourage our children to eat natural food but not food like cooked pork, 

chicken or taro not that kind of food but vegetables and fruits.  Through this programme, this is 

teaching our children to eat the right food to reduce NCD. 

</span></div><div><span>In this year’s Appropriation, government has set aside $20,175,619 for the Ministry of Education.  

When we look at this figure this is the number three priority for government behind MFEM and 

Health.  This shows our Nation the wish of this government to promote and lift the standard of 

health and education in our Nation. 

</span></div><div><span>The Member for Matavera have commended the salary rise for teachers and the government has 

set aside $1.34 million for the next four years to increase the salaries of teachers throughout the 

whole country.  $124,000 have been appropriated to renew the focus of education and this is called 

the Education Strategy.  The $26,000 that the Member for Titikaveka was talking about is for the 

bus for Aitutaki. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to reference made by the Member from Matavera about our children going overseas to 

</span><span>study and then returning home.  You will notice that the Ministry of Education has always been 

</span><span>advertising in our local newspaper to apply for assistance with the paying of their student loans. 

</span></div><div><span>In reference to our children from the Outer Islands on a scholarship, my government has increased 

their allowance from $75 to $150 a week.  This amount of money will be given to the guardian or 

carer where the child is staying.  For each Outer Island scholarsh student, they will be paid $250 

for establishment needs  like uniform and stationeries.  These are the supports that are given to 

these fortunate children by the Ministry of Education. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I would like to say thank  you very much to all our teachers in the Cook Islands 

</span><span>especially during this period of time that we have come through the pandemic.  When we look at 

the  number  of  teachers  who  were  asked  to  isolate  themselves  today,  there  are  40  right  now  in 

comparison there are 74 children from here and also the Southern Group islands ,74 who are being 

</span></div><div><span>19 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>isolated  from  school.    This  number  has  been  greatly  reduced  in  comparison  to  the  numbers  in 

March. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would like to thank all the principals of each school and all the parents because their 

focus is not only for the schools but also the prevention of our children from sickness. 

</span></div><div><span>There  was  mention  about  the  need  for  an  appropriation  for  the  training  of  our  children.    Our 

government  is  always  giving  to  USP  the  sum  of  $205,000  per  annum.    This  is  a  programme 

administered by our Ministry of Education to encourage our people at USP so that they can achieve 

their qualifications through USP.  If they get their qualifications from USP this will be recognised 

around the world.  The highest qualification that they get from USP is an increment by government 

to their salaries. 

</span></div><div><span>That is the reason why we see principals and teachers taken away from their posts because of their 

qualification achievements.   

</span></div><div><span>Finally, Mr Chairman I would like to thank the support from the Opposition to this appropriation 

and  those  of  government  especially  the  principals  and  teachers  in  all  the  schools  for  your 

contribution in supporting our schools.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,175,619 for Education stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>That completes the Education Vote Iem. 

</span></div><div><span>ENVIRONMENT – debate time of 1 hour. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,634,067 for Environment stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is now open for debate.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I maybe the only one speaking for the Opposition on 

this appropriation before the Minister Responsible stands up. 

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give my support to this appropriation especially for Output 3, which is the Puna Orama.  

</span><span>This  is  part  of  the  Environment  which  connects  us  to  outside  partners  around  the  world.    It  is 

</span><span>through this that we have signed agreements with international bodies and their commitments in 

working with our government.  I believe this is one of the important part in our government and 

</span></div><div><span>20 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>country.  We also see other developing countrie who want to establish partnership with us in the 

Pacific. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to give my support to Output 3 and ask, what are these partners going to provide for our 

country.  That is my reason of supporting Output 3.  I want to ask the government to bring climate 

change under the administration of the Environment.  We all know that climate change touches all 

of  us  and  in  particular  our  environment.    In  2012,  the  then  Prime  Minister,  who  was  also  the 

Minister of Environment asked me as Head of Ministry for Environment at the time if its possible 

to bring Climate Change under the Prime Minister’s office. 

</span></div><div><span>He explained to me his reasons for wanting this shift.  Based on his explanation, I agreed with him 

to relocate Climate Change from the Environment Service to the Prime Minister’s office.  The 

main reason that he asked for this shift is because during that time climate change was associated 

to the solar power.  That is the reason I agreed with him in 2012.  So, what we have discovered 

now is that the solar system around our islands are completed. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe it is time for climate change to go back to Environment.  When we look at the programmes 

that  is  carried  out  by  Climate  Change  and  that  by  Environment  Services,  they  are  closely 

associated.  I would say most of the Government Ministries can work together with Environment.  

When  we  consider  this  programme  Ridge  to  Reef  it  is  inclusive  of  all  Government  Ministries 

including our Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>Why  I’m  suggesting  this  is  because  I  started  this  programme.    It  was  myself  and  the  Minister 

Responsible for ICI at the time, Minister Vaine Mokoroa.  At that time, we were responsible to 

find funding to strongly support Environment.  I also thank the Member for Pukapuka, Tingika 

Elikana for supporting the programme at that time because he was the Solicitor General. 

</span></div><div><span>He  also  helped    us  to  prepare  our  policies.    I  would  say  that  the  project  objectives  of  the 

Environment is going well even if we have been through some difficulties in the past but for those 

who  are  involved  with  Environment  they  are  doing  their  work  well.    Even  our  part  with  the 

Agreement that I have discussed with the Prime Minister because the Prime Minister is responsible 

for Foreign Affairs and  under Foreign Affairs they are responsible  for confirming  the terms  of 

Agreements with entities outside of our country.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  in  Output  3  it  will  remind  and  reflect  on  our  relationship  with  these  partners  and 

contribution  in  supporting  our  partners.    We  are  not  in  partnership  with  them  without  any 

contribution  but  we  are  contributing  back  to  this  partnership.    However,  according  to  their 

contribution I would say it triples to what we contribute to them.  These are the benefits that we 

will receive when we enter into the partnership with them. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Chairman, I stand to give my support to the appropriation for Environment Services 

and again enforcing the thought that Climate Change should be returned under the Environment 

</span><span>Services.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  Terepai 

Maoate; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman and greetings to all of us again in the Name of our 

Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>Just a thought on the Environment appropriation.  I give my support to this appropriation.  I will 

comment on our situation in Aitutaki may this will touch on the other islands as well.  

</span></div><div><span>I do believe that some of the other islands do not have an Environment legislation and I want to 

talk about the policies on Environment Impact Assessment (EIA).  In any development, especially 

on Aitutaki, if we want to build a house on the coastal area or on the hill slopes, in past, you do 

not need to get any permit to build as there were no laws on this.  Now, we can see there are side 

effects to the land as a result of the development.  

</span></div><div><span>In our homes, there are discharges of wastewater from our washing machines or pig feeding areas 

running into the lagoon.  We have accepted for this law to be enforced.  I am not objecting to this 

law but I think we did not give enough thought to this Act.  We all know that today, it is a very 

costly exercise to build a house especially for those who are on a low income and that is the reason 

we are recommending for a minimum wage of $12 an hour. 

</span></div><div><span>So, what is happening today is if you want to build a house on a hill, you would need an engineer 

which is an expensive person.  As you may be aware that in Aitutaki, we have bush engineers like 

bush mechanics.  To start building, you have to secure your piece of land, you need a surveyor, a 

lawyer, you have to pay for their airfares, accommodation and transport before even starting to 

build your house.  On top of this is the EIA, which is more cost, and a burden to the individual to 

the point where you cannot build a house.  The main thought here is to look at this department for 

EIA.  Firstly, there is no qualified person out there with the expertise in this area.   

</span></div><div><span>When  I  look  at  the  appropriation  for  the  OPM,  there  is  a  person  responsible  for  transport 

maintenance that travels around the islands and this has been going on for a while.  So, we need 

an EIA engineer to travel around the islands and help our people as this is one of the barriers to 

our business people.  We are blessed in Aitutaki as we have a Surveyor and a Land Agent available 

but not an EIA engineer.  So, to the islands where the Environment Act has not been enforced 

please thread carefully.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you Honourable Terepai  Maoate.    I can see  the Honourable Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN</span><span>:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I am very happy with the appropriation for the 

Environment Services and also in particular with the recent appointment of their new Director.  

</span></div><div><span>The  new  Director  Halatoa  Fua  brings  a  wealth  of  experience  to  an  organisation  that  is  going 

through a  restructure.    We all know the protection of our environment  is  important  for us as a 

</span><span>country to protect the beauty of our environment that is an attraction for visitors and also to protect 

</span><span>our island from any abuse of our environment.  

</span></div><div><span>22 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>There has been a number of functions for Environment Services and one of them being Regulatory 

Function  where  consents  and  approvals  are  required  if  any  work  is  to  be  carried  out  at  certain 

identified areas.  Moreover, areas such as our foreshore, areas around our streams and areas on 

slopes.  On top of that, they have another role, which is the protection of our Biodiversity.  They 

are also responsible for the protection and management of our protected island of Suwarrow.  

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned by the Member for Matavera, the Environment Services is responsible for a number 

of Conventions that as a country we have signed up to.   Of course, this week we tabled in this 

House  the  Regulations  for  the  Montreal  Convention.    So  as  a  country  Mr  Chairman,  we  have 

recognised the importance of protecting our fragile environment which is why if we wanted to do 

any sort of activity on protected areas we need to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment 

or EIA.   

</span></div><div><span>I hear the comments by the Member for Aitutaki because these compliance measures there is cost 

associated with getting engineering profiles for anything to be done on the hills and also engaging 

someone to do an EIA.  Having a number of qualified people to do EIA here on Rarotonga, I think 

the opportunity arises for someone to be able to do EIA in Aitutaki.  I mentioned that with more 

people now building on the hills and up the slopes, certainly there is a need for an engineering 

expertise to make sure that any cutting of the side of our hills and mountains does not cause any 

problems later on with slips and landslides.   

</span></div><div><span>At this stage, I would like to pay tribute to the former Director of National Environment Services, 

Joe  Brider  who  passed  away  tragically  last  month.    One  of  the  foremost  experts  on  our  bio-

diversity, a specialist in plants and botany.  His loss and the loss of his knowledge is considerable.  

So, we can only hope that there is upcoming young scientists who will be able to fill that gap with 

the knowledge that Joe had.   Nevertheless, the new Director of Environment Services at the helm, 

I am very confident that with his very great sense of pragmatism, we will be able to see significant 

movement in the area of our environmental protection, which is coming.  I would not say under 

threat, but to find compromise with the development of our tourism industry. 

</span></div><div><span>If I could just come back to the comments made by the Member for Matavera, himself as a former 

Director of Environment Services, to move climate change related matters under the Environment 

Service and there is certainly merit in looking at this suggestion.  We have to be mindful however, 

</span><span>in climate change there are two main issues.  One is adaptation and building resilience against the 

</span><span>impact of climate change and the other one is mitigation, which is what do you do to reduce carbon 

emissions.  

</span></div><div><span>Of course, in these areas the project work that is involved does not quite fit under the Environment 

Service.  So, if you look at one example of adaptation, protection against more intense cyclones, 

the construction of cyclone shelters is one outcome of adaptation.  Storage of water during times 

of  more  intense  drought  is  another  outcome  of  adaptation.    So  construction  of  water  tanks, 

construction of cyclone shelters is more suited under the Ministry such as ICI or CIIC. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of mitigation and reducing carbon emissions one of the outcomes is increasing the use of 

solar power and so installation and maintenance  of solar panels  and batteries is  not  so much a 

function  of  the  Environment  Service  but  more  aligned  to  a  company  like  Te  Aponga  Uira.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>However,  certainly  it  is  a  policy  development  areas  that  could  be  accommodated  under  the 

Environment Service. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I am sure our debate here is being heard by the Environment Service and I am sure there will 

be  some  discussions  on  how  we  can  improve  the  effectiveness  of  climate  change  and  the 

Environment Service moving forward. 

</span></div><div><span>As one of the very few people, I guess that has had the good fortune to visit the island of Suwarrow.  

One  of  the  things  that  was  mentioned  to  me  by  people  that  were  on  our  trip  to  the  island  of 

Suwarrow is they would love to see an opportunity where our school children would be able to 

take  a  trip  to  Suwarrow  to  camp  on  the  island.    Maybe  as  part  of  a  senior  year  programme  to 

appreciate the beauty of our untouched islands in our country and to get an understanding of why 

we work so hard to protect our islands.  Maybe it would stimulate one of these children to take on 

a  career  in  bio-diversity,  in  environmental  science  and  protection,  a  whole  range  of  areas  and 

because Suwarrow does not have an airport, the only way to get there is by boat.  So I look forward 

to the day when we do get our customised vessel that will be able to take passengers in comfort 

and safety to these islands where we have no airport. 

</span></div><div><span>With those words, Mr Chairman I commend this allocation to the Environment Service. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,634,067 for Environment stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>FINANCE AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT – debate time of one hour.   

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $30,121,577 for Finance and Economic Management  

</span><span>stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I will not say much about this Vote Item but to refer 

you to Book 2, total for the outline for this Appropriation.  There are 23 pages and it is in that 

Schedule it will provide what has increased, what has decreased and what has been set aside.  For 

example, personnel will be moved to other areas and also the sum that is given to POBOC and part 

of the administration we will see that there is an increase and then decrease and also there is an 

</span><span>allocation  for  Regulations  and  about  $5  million  have  been  allocated  to  prepare  us  for  this 

</span><span>pandemic.   

</span></div><div><span>24 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>There  is  also  an  appropriation  to  support  Red  Cross  and  we  will  discover  the  reason  why  this 

appropriation will go to Red Cross.  I do believe these are the reasons why there is an increase for 

this Appropriation because of the other areas that they have covered. 

</span></div><div><span>But  in  regards  to  projects  to  be  paid,  when  you  compare  to  last  year,  that  is  the  administered 

payments, you will notice from last year there was an Appropriation of $45 million.  However, at 

this time, we could see the effect of the pandemic is going down and even the Appropriation for 

this area have decreased and we will see that $22 million have been appropriated.   

</span></div><div><span>Also in this Ministry, we will discover that they are looking at our expenditures.  It is comforting 

to know that it will also look at people who are paid.  From last year’s allocation, $5 million was 

assigned  to  pay  for  personnel,  and  this  year’s  Appropriation,  it  has  increased  to  $6  million.    I 

believe this is inclusion of those who are appointed into new positions and also to increase the 

wages  for  the  present  workers.    That  is  why  I  am  commenting  because  when  we  look  at  the 

appropriation there has been an increase in some areas, a decrease in other areas and to set aside 

in other areas. 

So, I would like to thank Garth Henderson who is responsible for this Ministry and to also thank 

the Budget Team for the advice you gave the PAC Committee.  In this group of people that came 

to advise the PAC committee there were  four ladies and one man.  These four ladies that I am 

talking about they are young girls and they are fully qualified.  That is the most satisfying part that 

these daughters of ours have taken upon themselves with their good qualifications to work for our 

people in  this  Ministry.    I believe that these  foreign qualified men  are training our own  young 

people to have that knowledge in that field. 

</span></div><div><span>The explanations of the budget was delivered to us in a workshop format by these young ladies.  

Even  with  the  questions  that  we  raised  with  them,  the  young  ladies  gave  us  clear  satisfying 

explanations.  The support given by the two foreign men shows us their confidence in the young 

ladies and they are training them well for the future. 

</span></div><div><span>I had us look at Output 3 and I note there are about 7 Outputs in this Ministries appropriation.  I 

would like to make reference to the Minister Responsible to consider for this year and next year.  

These are the purposes under the Output 3 to encourage our economy for the Cook Islands.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Chairman.  I stand to discuss on this part of the 

appropriation  because  this  Ministry  is  known  to  us  as  the  power  house.    When  we  look  at  the 

organisation structure of the Ministry of Finance, I would say that one will be scared to apply for 

this position.  For the reason being it will be a heavy burden to lead this Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>There are two things that I want to raise in my discussions.  One is in regards to Output 3.  I would 

</span><span>say in my understanding, there are some difficulties in it.  I have no problem with the amount of 

funds  allocated  here  but  we  want  some  good  outcomes  from  the  director  of  this  output.    Even 

though we have not discussed the PERCA report on this Output 3, I am concerned here with the 

</span></div><div><span>25 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>many recommendations and complaints in the report.  Maybe it is possible for you the Minister in 

Charge to discuss with the Financial Secretary in regards to the director. 

</span></div><div><span>On my way to the Northern Group, we met on the plane that arrived from Pukapuka and this is a 

team from MFEM who have been in the Northern Group islands to train all the administration staff 

in finance.  We travelled by boat from Rakahanga to Manihiki with the administration staff from 

Rakahanga.  I believe the plane from Pukapuka landed in Manihiki that morning and at 1 o’clock 

that  afternoon,  they  had  their  training.    I  believe  this  training  is  very  appropriate  for  all 

administration workers in the Northern Group because we are receiving complaints that some of 

the reports from these islands are not well done.   

</span></div><div><span>I know that the administration staff from Rakahanga is very happy to take the training and after 

the training in Manihiki then the MFEM staff will go with the Rakahanga admin person to check 

on their accounts.  To the Minister Responsible, can you convery our thank you to the Secretary 

of Finance for having this tranining programme for our people in the Northern Group. 

</span></div><div><span>My second submission is in regards to the Statistic division.  I have no problem with the allocation 

for this output.  We know that when it comes to the Election times, they become electroal officers.  

When  I  look  at  their  allocation  it  is  specifically  for  their  statistics  role.    The  question  to  the 

Honourable Prime Minister is, where is the allocations for the election spending because we are 

coming to that period of time.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Deputy Speaker; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you, I will be very short Mr Chairman.  I stand to answer the question 

raised by the Leader of the Opposition in regards to the allocation for the Electroal Office.   

</span></div><div><span>The short answer is covered within the Electoral Act.  There is the provision within that Act which 

allows for appropriations without coming through Parliament.  That is the short answer because 

we have not called the election yet so we are waiting until that is done but there is no need to come 

through Parliament for the appropriation for the electroal office for the elections.  That is the short 

answer. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member,  I  hope  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is 

satisfied with your answer.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I thought the Associate Finance Minister was 

going to take a little bit longer to talk about this Ministry.  Yes, but quite right the announcement 

of the  general  election triggers a statutory  appropriation to  cover the  cost  of running a  general 

election. 

</span></div><div><span>But  in  terms  of  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management,  I  guess  this  is  one  of  the 

</span><span>Ministries that other Ministries hatev because they tend to blame them that they do not give them 

enough allocation in their appropriation or their budget proposals that are put forward generally 

come back with lots of red lines through it by the Budget Team.  Then, of course, on the RMD 

</span></div><div><span>26 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>side, they are there collecting peoples money.  So people do not find them that friendly I guess 

when they are there to make sure your income tax is paid, make sure your VAT is paid, make sure 

your customs levies are paid. 

</span></div><div><span>But I have been working with the Ministry of Finance for a number of years now Mr Chairman, I 

have to say I find them very very friendly.  Again, this is one of the most important Ministries in 

the governments’ structure and I really have to acknowledge the work of the Budget Team who 

worked alongside the members of our Budget Committee.  Our Committee has been the case for a 

number of years we draw from the senior level of the Public Service, not the HOM, the next level 

down to be part of the group that assess the Budget Proposals that are put through.  The purpose 

of this Mr Chairman is to provide our senior Public Servants with a greater appreciation of the 

wider government budgets rather than just being concern with their own Ministries budget.  

</span></div><div><span>Even though we are debating the Budget now, in June the work of this Committee commences 

back in November and in that timeframe Mr Chairman, they have to perform a minor miracle like 

Jesus feeding the 5,000 people with five fish and three loaves of bread.  I have to say that in the 

most  difficult  circumstances  in  this  year,  the  Budget  that  they  have  prepared  is  really  quite 

remarkable.  So I would like to give my appreciation to my Budget Team for the hard work they 

have done in getting us to where we are today in going through this Appropriations.  

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the work of our RMD (Revenue Management Division) which 

is responsible for the collection of government revenues. Again, during a situation where mainly 

their job is to Process Returns that are provided to them. Over the past two years, they have been 

the agency responsible for processing the payments for Wage Subsidies and also Business Grants. 

Using  the  systems  provided  by  Cook  Islands  National  Superannuation  Fund  which  virtually 

everybody is a member, they were able to use this system to make sure that payments were accurate 

made out to businesses, companies, sole traders so that money was not wasted.  

</span></div><div><span>I acknowledge the remarks by the Leader of the Opposition in terms of some of the PERCA cases 

that have come before us regarding complaints against the Revenue Management Division.  Just 

to  say  that  there  are  two  sides  to  these  stories  but  certainly  the  aspect  of  Public  Service  and 

providing a service to the public in a timely and fair way is very very important as part of the 

principles of Revenue Management and where something has been done wrong then it does need 

</span><span>to be put right.  

</span></div><div><span>In saying that also, if something can be done better then we will certainly look to change the way 

we  do  things  to  make  it  better.    One  of  the  things  that  the  House  can  look  forward  to  is  the 

amendment  to  the  Tax  legislation  which  will  allow  for  the  submission  of  VAT  Returns  on  a 

quarterly  basis  for  certain  businesses  rather  than  on  a  monthly  basis.  This  amendment  Mr 

Chairman has the impact of reducing the number of Returns that are assessed by 60 percent.  So, 

for certain businesses whose turnover is below a certain amount they will have the opportunity to 

submit four Returns a year rather than 12 Returns a year.   We look forward to the amendment 

</span><span>coming before the House.  

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the work of our Treasury Division. The Treasury Division is 

responsible for managing the cash flow of the country, not only managing the cash flow but also 

</span></div><div><span>27 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>managing the currencies that we as country receive.  Some of the work that the Treasury Division 

has done over the past  years has resulted in our country making significant savings in terms of 

currency exchange rates.  Because we have our loans denominated in New Zealand dollars but 

some loans are in US dollars and some loans are in Chinese renminbi so this Division is responsible 

for  making  sure  that  whatever  revenue  is  collected  in  certain  currencies  can  be  put  towards 

expenses in those currencies such as loan repayments without losing any money due to currency 

exchange.  Something that we have been able to do now for a number of years and certainly saved, 

I guess protects us from risks of currency exchange fluctuations.  

</span></div><div><span>Another Division that does a significant amount of work in collecting money to our country is the 

Development  Coordination  Division,  which  is  responsible  for  managing  our  Donor  Aid 

Programme. This is the Division you will be familiar with responsible for the Japan Grassroots 

Programme,  the  India  Grant  Fund  and  numerous  other  funds  where  support  is  provided  to  our 

country.  Of course, not forgetting our Output 6 division, The Major Projects and Procurement 

Division and this is an important Division to streamline and fast track major project work or major 

procurement, the issuing of major contracts, this Division was established as an office to manage 

across government these particular activities of procurement, contracts and projects.    

</span></div><div><span>At a time over a number of years, I guess since going back to the reform was when decentralisation 

was  the  key  theme  each  Ministry  was  responsible  for  its  own  affairs.    This  of  course  led  to 

fragmentation,  it  led  to  inability  to  consolidate  on  procurement  and  purchases  which  cost  the 

country more money.  So this Division was set up to try and address those issues, to ensure that 

projects  were  not  delayed  but  to  make  sure  that  we  get  value  for  money,  the  best  return  for 

procurement and also for contracting.  

</span></div><div><span>One of the things that is currently in place now, right across all government agencies and island 

governments is the implementation of our Financial Management Information System (FMIS).  

This is a project that will have the end of its life this year whereby all Government Agencies will 

be  hooked  on  to  the  new  FMIS  system  to  streamline  and  centralise  accounting  finances  and 

reporting to the Ministry of Finance.  This will remove a huge burden on Ministries and Island 

Administrations in no longer needing to provide monthly reporting. 

</span></div><div><span>Ministries and Agencies will just need to input their data, their information on income or expenses 

</span><span>into the information  system  and it will consolidate and produce  your reports for  you in  a very 

</span><span>timely manner.  What this means Mr Chairman is that delays in producing your financial report 

for auditing will become outdated and I look forward to every government agency being on this 

system very, very soon. 

</span></div><div><span>The other beauty with this system Mr Chairman is that because it centralises and consolidates all 

accounts, government can now if you wanted to find out how much does the government spend, 

for example on fuel. 

</span></div><div><span>Previously Mr Chairman, you would have to get the fuel account of every government agency, 

</span><span>every Island Administration and manually total these up to get an idea of how much is spent on 

fuel.  Once this system is fully implemented, that sort of information is available at a push of a 

</span></div><div><span>28 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>button.  You can find out how much you spend on photo copying paper, virtually every expense 

and this makes planning and it makes reporting much, much more efficient. 

</span></div><div><span>This project did not just start overnight Mr Chairman, the FMIS project started nearly five years 

ago and it has been a long process of installing these systems into every government agency and 

across every Island Government.   

</span></div><div><span>So I would like to acknowledge the team responsible for this who have been doing a great job over 

the years and we look forward to this system being used to its full potential to make our job in 

terms of reporting financial reporting much more timely. 

</span></div><div><span>This brings us to the Statistics Office, Mr Chairman and quite rightly as put by the Leader of the 

Opposition, as soon as an election is triggered the Statistics Office takes on the role of the Electoral 

Office.  But of course, the good news is that the Statistics Office has been doing this for a number 

of  elections  now  and  they  are  very  capable  of  getting  straight  into  the  Electoral  Office 

responsibilities.  It may be something to consider in the future that we may want to establish a 

separate  Electoral  Office  to  manage  By-elections  and  elections  as  they  arise.    There  was  a 

standalone  Electoral  Office  prior  to  1996,  which  was  dis-established,  back  then  as  part  of  the 

structural reform of all government agencies. 

</span></div><div><span>However, right now Mr Speaker, I think the appropriation that we have before us for the Ministry 

of Finance as pointed out is less than last  year because of the reduced amounts that have been 

allocated under Administrative Funding to combat COVID. 

</span></div><div><span>So I would like to congratulate the Financial Secretary, all his Divisional Heads and the staff in 

the Ministry of Finance for the tremendous work that they have done over this financial year and 

also the previous financial year to get our country into a strong financial position as we move into 

the recovery – there’s the recovery landing right now.  Every person that comes into the country, 

Mr Chairman is a consumer, they spend money in our country, and every person that spends money 

there is a tax collection on what they spend on in VAT so this, Mr Chairman is the sound of the 

plane land is the sound of our recovery. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Chairman I commend this allocation for the Ministry of Finance before this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question:
