<h3>Oral Question 35</h3>
<div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and the Honourable Member who have asked the 

question to me.  For this question, I consider that it is directed at a time when I was not Associate 

Minister, and even before the time the present Prime Minister was the Minister Responsible.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I believe this question is refering to the time when the former Member of Parliament for Akaoa, 

Teariki Heather was the Minister Responsible for the Ministry and also the Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker I see the question that has been asked requires two parts of the answer.  Firstly, the 

</span><span>question is why was this project  discontinued when it was supposed to be carried according to 

plan.  Secondly, it relates to a machine that was purchased by the then Deputy Prime Minister for 

the  road  sealing.    I  believe  at  the  time,  there  were  some  issues  about  this  machine  in  terms  of

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div>
<div><span>purchasing the machine.  So, can I request for this part of the question to be deferred until Question 

Time tomorrow. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To answer the first question as to why the road project in 2016 was not completed according to 

plan.  I suggest for  you Honourable Member to get the proper answer from the former Deputy 

Prime Minister at the time.  I am still unsure why this road project discontinued because this man 

was was not only the Minister of ICI at the time, but also the Deputy Prime Minister of our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question this morning was, why were the roads in Puaikura not sealed during his time.  I was 

in Cabinet at the time and it was Teariki Heather who stopped the work from going ahead.  I recall 

that under the leadeship of the former Prime Minister, Henry Puna, he suggested that the first road 

to be sealed would be Harley Street.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The proposal was to start the hot seal tarsealing from Harley Street through to Puaikura.  However, 

due  to  some  issues,  the  then  Deputy  Prime  Minister  did  not  want  the  roads  to  be  sealed.    His 

preference was for the roads to be chipped sealed.  During that time, the then Prime Minister and 

the rest of the Members wanted the roads to be hot mix sealed. For this reason, the road sealing 

went to Tupapa and around Takitumu.   As you may be aware, right now the roadwork is on the 

border leading to Puaikura. Like what the Prime Minister told us in the past days, when the sealing 

of the remaining areas in Takitumu is completed, the work will start in Puaikura.  

</span></div>
<div><span>To conclude my response to the Honourable Member, this question is better directed to the former 

Minister of ICI and Deputy Prime Minister when you see him on the road. 

</span></div>
<div><span>On the second part of your question, I will respond to this question tomorrow when I return to the 

House with facts and background information about the machine. Thank you.
