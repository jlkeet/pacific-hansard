</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Selina Napa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  S. NAPA:</span><span>   Thank  you Mr Chairman.    I have some comments  to  make in  regards to  the 

Ministry of Internal Affairs.  I do not know why we the Opposition side cannot give our support 

because this is one of the Ministries involved in  helping our elderlies and our children.   So on 

behalf of the Opposition we give our support to the appropriation given to the Internal Affairs but 

I just want to raise some points for consideration.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, we look at Output 5.  When I look at the explanation for this appropriation regarding the 

administration of Films and Censorship, to date, I am not sure what is involved with this part of 

this Output but I noticed that there is a figure of up to 50 to 79 films that is needed to be rated per 

year.  Also two, the number of films rated 80 to 95 films per year.  

</span></div><div><span>Looking at the number of inspections held per year is three and yet when you look at their goal it 

says, </span><span>“Good governance and effective public service performance”.</span><span>  I can understand why there 

is this number is low because a lot of people are watching movies on Netflix and other means and 

that is a free service.   

</span></div><div><span>So  I  would  suggest  why  not  use  the  appropriation  for  this  part  into  supporting  the  Youth 

Programmes.  I came to this House to observe the Mock Parliament that was performed by the 

youth last month.  I want to tell you all that our children are really clever when I watched them 

during the mock Parliament.  I can see their Administered fund is $45,000 but I want to know what 

exactly that is involved.  We are always referring to them as the leaders of tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>Under Religious Advisory Council, I can see only $10,000 have been allocated for one year.  I 

think they are doing a lot of work, praying for our Nation to protect us from disasters.  So if we 

are saying that they are not doing anything, I recommend to you to get involved with small Prayer 

groups and you will see that they are doing a lot of work praying for our country.  That is why I 

do not see any reason why we are keeping this allocation of censorship of films when they are 

readily available and free to us so this amount should be given to other areas where it can support 

the Religious or the Youth. 

</span></div><div><span>Those are my thoughts and we all support the Appropriation given to the Internal Affairs because 

</span><span>we know that they will have the effect to our elderly and our children for their benefit.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman,  and  thank  you  to  the  speaker  from  the 

Opposition  for  the  thoughts  that  you  have  contributed  in  support  of  the  allocation  for  Internal 

Affairs.  We would also like to thank the Ministry of Finance for their continuous support to us in 

giving the amount of $20 increase for our elderly, small it may be but it will be a big help for our 

</span><span>people. 

</span></div><div><span>Although we were not able to give an increase for our children but we look forward to the future 

but there are other support that is given to our people, such as mothers giving birth.  In doing so,

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>we hope that it will encourage our young ones to have children to support our country because we 

want to add another six weeks maternity leave on top of the six weeks they are already entitled.  

We are still investigating this matter and I hope that our mothers who are listening will be happy 

to hear this.  The ultimate goal for us is that each mother giving birth will receive at least three 

months leave. 

</span></div><div><span>We  also  gave  support  to  our  disables  people  and  I  believe  that  they  are  thankful  because  their 

entitlement was never reduced but they continued collecting during this time of the pandemic. 

</span></div><div><span>There are other areas where our Ministry is supporting and that includes providing services to our 

elderly living in their own homes.  These are improvements such as their bathrooms and toilet and 

this is not for Rarotonga only but includes the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the minimum wage, we know there is a report on the Website and those of us who want 

to read it because this idea came from the Committee that was formed to look into the minimum 

wage.  They made two recommendations to Cabinet and one was to remain at $8 or to give an 

increase of fifty cents and that is why we accepted the increase to $8.50 in order to help our people.   

</span></div><div><span>The hope is that we can increase the wage next year until we reach a stage when all will be satisfied. 

</span></div><div><span>So with the proposal that the amount of $4,870,000 be appropriated for Internal Affairs, I strongly 

support and to say thank you to the Secretary Ann Herman and all your staff.  May you continue 

to do your work by providing service to our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Just a last thought in regards to the question raised about the censorship.  This has not been taken 

out because it is still under the Act that we are required to censor films that are brought into our 

country.  Our main theatre is still screening movies including small shops who rent DVDs and in 

doing so, we are able to receive some revenue in order to help the Ministry.  I do believe that the 

Head of this Ministry is  listening to  what  has been spoken in  this House that she can use it to 

prepare ourselves for the future. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much for your support in this Appropriation, I strongly support this. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $4,872,593 for Internal Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
