</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Mr  Chairman,  this  is  one  of  the  Ministries  that  have  many 

problems over the years and not just this year.  One Secretary comes in and tries his best and then 

move on.  I can see the Member for Pukapuka is not present and I will talk about him.  He served 

as Secretary of Justice and he obtained nothing. 

</span></div><div><span>I am satisfied that the person holding this Secretary of Justice position has been reappointed and I 

am happy with that.  He is trying his very best to improve the weak areas in this Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>I am looking at the appropriation amount for this Ministry and if we want to increase our support 

so that we will lessen all the issues that they are going through we need to appoint good people to 

the work and I am hoping in the near future we will see an increase in the appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>I recall about last year and previous years, there was a requirement to appoint people specialised 

in certain field.  I do not know if there was an appropriation for this or maybe a support from New 

Zealand.  These people were given a short time to do this work and I do not think it managed well.  

I do not stand to criticise but I notice in Book 2, there is a provision for JPs in the Northern Group 

to be trained by JPs from Rarotonga going up north for this purpose.  I know there are two JPs that 

have gone to do the training but they are still waiting for their warrant from the QR. 

</span></div><div><span>There were two JPs with the Registrar and deputy they went to the Northern Group to carry out a 

training.  They were saying it has been over 10 years for someone from the Ministry of Justice to 

go up to the Northern Group and visit the island people.  So, I would like the Minister Responsible 

for this Ministry and the Secretary for the appointment of two JPs for the island of Rakahanga and 

for making it possible for staff from the Ministry of Justice to go to the Northern Group to train 

JPs in the case there could be a court in Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>Although there are some difficulties in this Ministry, but I want you to know that our Ministry of 

Justice is on the Judiciary that is so outstanding in the Pacific region.  Especially our judiciary on 

the electroal petitions, we are one of the leading countries in the Pacific.  Even the high caliber of 

the justices that we use in dealing with land matters they have the experience in hearing Maori 

</span><span>cases in New Zealand.  I am grateful to hear that our Justices of the Peace are receiving the training 

</span><span>in criminal and land court hearings here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>As a long term, vision must be that one local person be appointed as a Judge.  We hope from these 

local Justices of the Peace receiving these trainings, we are hoping that eventually one of them will 

become  a  Judge  dealing  in  land  matters,  criminal  matters  and  civil  matters.    I  now  there  is  a 

dialogue between the Ministry of Justice and the Law Society because there are recommendations 

and complaints from the Law Society to our Ministry of Justice.  To me this is healthy because it 

can only improve administration of Justice in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask you Mr Chairman for a short time to convey my condolences to Kopu Matua 

for her bereavement in the passing away of her mother.  Kopu Matua is the Registrar of the High 

Court today.  I have been told that her mother has passed away in New Zealand and her body will

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>be returned to Rarotonga on Monday.  I do believe this is a voter for the Prime Minister in his 

Constituency of Takuvaine.  So, from me and all my Members in the Opposition and this House, 

we offer our words of comfort and condolences to the family. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition, and I see the Minister Vaine 

Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman and Kia Orana to all of us this afternoon.  At 

the  outset  let  me  thank  the  Secretary  of  Justice,  Tamatoa  Jonassen  and  all  your  good  staff  for 

putting together a business plan before us.  We look in  Book 2, page 245 and 246, this should 

encourage us to read all the achievements and milestones that has been highlighted by the Leader 

of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, apart from the training that was taken up to the Northern Group to train our Justice 

of the Peace.  The Ministry has enrolled six of its senior core staff into a yearlong Certificate of 

Justice programme, offered through USP.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I have heard the comments and the pleas from the people of Aitutaki for the review 

of  the  court  fees  through  one  of  their  Member  Kitai  Manuela.    The  priorities  around  capacity 

building of COVID has delayed the launching of updated fees. 

</span></div><div><span>However, it is  the intention of the Ministry  of Justice over the next  few months to  launch and 

update review of these fees.   It is my understanding that the land succession fees and photocopying 

fees will be reduced.  The Ministry is looking at doing consultations on land reform over the next 

five years in accordance with its 5 years’ Strategic Plan.  In terms of the survey department in the 

1990’s the survey work was privatized with the survey department acting chiefly in an approval 

role rather than doing field surveys. 

</span></div><div><span>There has been several complaints from the people regarding the work of our private surveyors.  

The Ministry is working on drafting a new legislation to help regulate the survey industry to help 

improve quality and resolve disputes.   

</span></div><div><span>The Ministry is currently in their recruitment phase they would like to add three more positions in 

</span><span>their  criminal  and  civil  division  to  address  the  capacity  constraints  that  existed  whilst  before 

</span><span>COVID.  This must have been caused by the Member of Pukapuka during his days.   

</span></div><div><span>With  those  few  words,  I  commend  and  ask  this  Honourable  House  to  support  this  Budget 

Appropriation for the Ministry of Justice.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister  I  have  a  request  to  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition.  You can vacate that seat and become the first Cook Islands Judge. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $2,861,976 for Justice stands part of the Schedule?
