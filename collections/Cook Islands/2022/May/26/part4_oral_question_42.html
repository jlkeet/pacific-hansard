<h3>Oral Question 42</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Member for his question.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I can update you the PR applications closed on Friday last week.  The Immigration team is going 

through the first part of the process to eliminate those that do not fit the criteria that has been set 

before they start going through the second part of the process.  They will then review the criteria 

for those who have passed stage 1.  

</span></div>
<div><span>We know that this House passed the Immigration Act that limits the number of PR’s to 500. Of 

</span><span>course, these Permanent Residents criteria are PR’s in their own right. Not included in this 500 

</span><span>over  and  above  are  those  PR  applications  from  people  who  are  partners  or  spouses  of  Cook 

Islanders.  Therefore,  there  is  no  limits  applied  to  those  criteria  of  PR.    However,  there  is  still 

qualifying  criteria  for  spouses  of  PR  and  one  of  them  I  am  aware  of  is  that  they  must  be  in  a 

committed relationship for at least 5 years.  The Residency criteria also applies for New Zealanders 

5 years and for those who are non-New Zealanders 10 years. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The other criteria that does not fit in the limit of 500 are those PR applicants who are over the age 

of 70.  Again, there is no limit on granting PR to those who are over the age of 70.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Honourable Prime Minister, I think there is a lot more to say to complete your 

answer. Can you do that tomorrow?
