<div><span>POLICE: 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the question that the sum of $5,666,000 for Police stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tamaiva Tuavera; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA: </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I shall not be too long on this.  

</span></div><div><span>First, I would just want  to look at Output  1, which is Crimes and Prevention because I see the 

personnel for Police have gone up by $2 million.  I think this would bring a smile on all the cops’ 

faces because then they are assured that they would get a pay rise I suppose.  

</span></div><div><span>For the Administered Funding they have gone down by $200,000.  However, my colleague assured 

me on my left here that money would be used once the new Kukupa II arrives because this money 

is put aside for the fuel for Kukupa II.  

</span></div><div><span>If you look at number 2 under Output 2, it says to ensure that the Cook Islands water (EEZ) is free 

of any illegal fishing, boating activities and criminal activities.    I just strengthen this that I am 

happy that the Police is getting a better boat but I still say that they should have a base up north. 

Again,  it  would  not  cost  that  much  because  there  are  three  buildings  sitting  up  there.  These 

</span><span>buildings used to house personnel up there.  It would not cost much to refurbish them.   

</span></div><div><span>I would prefer the patrol boat to be go up north for four weeks and four weeks back in Rarotonga. 

This is the only way that I could see the boat being used for the right reasons which is to police 

our  waters  up  north  because  this  is  where  all  the  illegal  fishing  is  happening.    We  all  know 

prevention is the key to stopping any crime and I believe we have 10 new recruits in the Police 

force right now and from what I hear it is still not enough.  So, we should encourage our young 

people to sign up and join the Police force because we have this thing that is the ones that goes to 

the  Honourable  George  Angene’s  house  and  the  other  ones  are  on  the  other  side.  We  should 

</span><span>encourage our young ones to be on the right path during their lifetime.  

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, this budget I actually like this budget Mr Chairman.  It is giving Police financial support 

as we all see on the road now they have motor bikes.  I was actually quite shocked when I saw

</span></div><div><a>Page 51</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>three of them coming down the road.  To me this is excellent for the Cook Islands, we are starting 

to look after our Police force because they are the frontline for us.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to say hello to the Police Commissioner.  I have only met the Police Commissioner 

once and I will not say where but I have only met him once and I would actually like to meet him 

again in his office.  So, James I will come and see you very soon.  That is all I have to say Mr 

Chairman on the Police Vote Item and I am sure they are in good hands with a budget like this and 

from this side of the House we support the budget for Police.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you the Honourable Tuavera.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; 

you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN: </span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I would just like to acknowledge some of the 

good work that is being done within the Police department.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, of course the appointment of our new Police Commissioner a few months ago to take the 

helm of the Police department.  He has been very well received by the Police force and he has 

really started moving things along in the Police department. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge serving Police officers too who recently celebrated 40 years of service 

in the Police department and these two of course are Solo Tuaati and Aka Matapo who joined the 

Police in 1982.  They were recognised in a special ceremony by the Police a few weeks ago and I 

was fortunate to attend their celebration at that time.  The other acknowledgement of course Mr 

Chairman is the new Te Kukupa II which will be handed over to the government on the 10</span><span>th</span><span> of 

June and will make its way to Rarotonga and expected to be in Rarotonga in July sometime.  

</span></div><div><span>A special thank you to Commander Mark Te Kani for his work in coordinating not only the Kukupa 

II with the Australian Defence who are providing the vessel but also in the upgrade of the building 

down at the wharf which will have an additional floor added onto it as part of the upgrade of our 

Maritime office down at Avatiu wharf.  This is one of the departments Mr Chairman, we will be 

looking to upgrade the salaries and remuneration of the staff to bring it up to more appropriate 

levels.  So, I commend this particular allocation in this Vote Item Mr Chairman to our budget. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $5,666,000 for Police stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
