<div><span>COOK ISLANDS SEABED MINERALS AUTHORITY: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $999,500 for Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Selina Napa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>Greeting to all.  Just a few thoughts that we want to contribute to the Seabed 

Minerals appropriation.  I have heard that there has been a claim that we object to the activities of 

the Seabed Minerals Authority but during this time because we are at the exploration stage and 

firstly we need to do some exploration before we go into the actual mining. 

</span></div><div><span>When I look at their Appropriation under achievements and milestones, they have earned quite a 

bit for this Ministry. 

</span></div><div><span>We have heard the Prime Minister tell us that there are four applications received by the Authority 

and when I look under achievement, I am not sure how many have been granted and how many 

rejected.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I am looking closely at No.8 the achievement, the Advisory Committee is a body established by 

the SBM Act 2019 and comprises of Community Leaders whose role is to represent the views of 

their communities and share that with the Authority.  I want to tell this House that I have never 

seen this Advisory Committee come back to the community to ask for their opinions and take it 

back to their meetings.  Where did they get their information and why are they talking on behalf 

of the community when they did not meet with the people in the first place. 

</span></div><div><span>If  this  is  the  spirit,  this  is  the  request  to  the  Government  that  the  persons  they  appoint  to  this 

Committee should be nominated by the people so these Members can go back to the people to ask 

for their thoughts.  We are not looking down on the Advisory Committee but when I look at the 

persons appointed to this Committee, these are friends of the government.   

</span></div><div><span>From the Opposition we support this Appropriation because this is still at the exploratory stage but 

when the time for mining arrives this is the time that we are required to work together.  Government 

working closely with the Opposition and also it is a time that we need to consult with our people 

and there are many who want to see the mining and reaping the benefit before they die.  From the 

Opposition we support this Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I think this year is a historic year for the Seabed 

Minerals Industries in our country.  It has been a long road process since we established our Seabed 

Minerals Authority office in 2013.  And even longer still since we passed our first Seabed Minerals 

Act in 2009 and then the new one in 2019. 

</span></div><div><span>We spent a number of years in consultations with our people here in Rarotonga and especially in 

the Pa Enua.  So, you can say Mr Chairman that we have taken very careful steps to get to where 

we are this year when we issued our first exploration licenses.  Our Seabed Minerals Authority has 

been instrumental over the years to get us to where we are today. 

</span></div><div><span>When we invited applications for those who wanted to obtain exploration licenses, we received 

</span><span>four applications.  After very careful due diligence on these companies, only three made it passed 

</span><span>to the next stage.  Then after a very careful scrutiny with the licensing panel which is made up of 

international experts from around the world, only then we got to the stage where there were three 

successful applicants who now have received licenses to explorer specific areas under their license 

in our seabed. 

</span></div><div><span>The amount of work involved in just the exploration stage Mr Chairman is quite significant for 

these three companies.  They are required to submit work plans with estimates of their expenditure 

for the exploration work that they will undertake.  Their own budget they will expect to spend 

</span><span>amongst the three companies close to $200 million in exploration costs over the next five years. 

</span></div><div><span>And of course over the next five years, we are hoping that some of that expenditure will spill into 

our economy.  However, the exploration phase includes the mapping of the sea and floor involves

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>obtaining samples of minerals and nodules and it involves biodiversity checks as well.  It requires 

quite a range of scientific and technical work in order for us the Cook Islands to consider the next 

stage which is the harvesting of these nodules. 

</span></div><div><span>Let me just go back to the advisory panel mentioned by the Honourable Member.  The Advisory 

Committee is made up of open minded people from various sectors of our community.   Just to 

casually  disregard  them  as  friends  of  the  government  is  quite  insulting.    The  Chairman  of  the 

Advisory  Committee  is  Bishop  Pere  hardly  someone  that  you  would  call  just  a  mate  of  the 

government.  Other members on this committee include Makiuti Tongia, who I believe was once 

a friend of the Democratic.  A person like George George representing the business sector.  These 

people have been involved in consultations throughout our communities, they have been part of 

our consultations as we have gone to the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>So, if the Honourable Member is upset that she did not know anything about these consultations 

or  was  not  spoken  to  by  these  members  of  the  committee  then  I  suggest  that  you  make  an 

appointment to see the Chairman of the committee, Bishop Pere who will no doubt be all willing 

to talk to her and maybe provide her with some spiritual comfort. 

</span></div><div><span>However, for the next few years it is important for this particular authority because now that the 

work is done in issuing the licenses their work now will be in following up with these companies 

to make sure that they adhere to the programmes that they have committed to in terms of their 

license.  Their work now turns to what literally what regulations are required to be in active and 

passed in order for us to be prepared for the next stage if we decide to move to the next stage of 

harvesting these nodules. 

</span></div><div><span>Let there be no doubt Mr Chairman that in 2015, when we first invited applications for licenses 

and we received none.  2022 is very, very different situation where we know that the global demand 

for the metals that are held in our nodules will exceed current supply.  Which is why a number of 

international  companies  will  look  very,  very  closely  at  the  results  of  the  exploration  of  these 

exploration companies in the next few years. 

</span></div><div><span>If it can be demonstrated that we can successfully harvest these nodules in a way that does not 

damage  our  ocean  and  this  will transform  our  economy  Mr  Chairman  and  provide  us  with  the 

</span><span>means and opportunity to further improve the livelihood of our people and the way that we live. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I would like to acknowledge the work by the Seabeds Minerals Authority, this is a small office 

with a small team.  However, I have no doubt that they will expand as this industry grows and they 

will play a very significant role in the next few years as we look to diversify our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I support this appropriation in the Bill for the Seabeds Minerals Authority.  Thank  you Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $999,500 for Cook Islands Seabeds Minerals Authority  

stands part of the Schedule?
