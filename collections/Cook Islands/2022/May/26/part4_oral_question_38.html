<h3>Oral Question 38</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE: </span><span> Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for the question Honourable Member from Matavera.  The question is whether I have 

considered  constructing  concrete  water  tanks?    Yes,  since  I  have  already  started  constructing 

graves free of charge, tree trimmings for free, cleaning households of the destitute for free then I 

see  no  barrier  for  me  to  construct  concrete  water  tanks  for  free.  There  is  nothing  that  George 

Maggie cannot do, thatâ€™s my game.  

</span></div>
<div><span>(Much laughter)</span></div>
<div><span>So, in response to the question that if it can be done? The response is I can do it, through your 

assistance in your district, Ngatangiia and around the Cook Islands. My service is available and to 

also train someone in the districts to construct water tanks. Thank you.
