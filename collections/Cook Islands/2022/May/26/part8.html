<div><span>FINANCIAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $453,703 for Financial Services Development Authority  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Can I have a Member speak on the Vote Item.  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  This is one of the sectors that was a 

major revenue earning once upon a time for this country.  Then some years ago we ran into some 

difficulties and of course the Trust Companies either shutting down and now we have very little 

income from the revenue from this industry. 

</span></div><div><span>Last year, we past in this House the International Relationship Property Trust Act 2021.   This was 

to accommodate a new plan by the industry to assist with the promotion of our financial sector in 

this country.  The appropriation for this Ministry is quite small, it is about $453,000.  We would 

like to support this and hope that the plan going forward is going to work and that we might see 

some revenue coming from this sector.  Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN</span><span>:  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  Vaine 

Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON  V.  MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    FSDA’s  goal  since  2020  is  by  2025  is  to 

improve employment in the industry by 30 percent and to increase the contribution to our economy 

by 50 percent.  Our people in the industry are great wealth managers and trusted service providers.  

</span></div><div><span>Our industry players are compliant on the world stage and innovative in developing products as 

</span><span>world first.  As mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, in the last two budget, this government 

invested in the development of a new product for the industry.   This is the first new product in 

many years and it is called the International Relationship Property Trust.  This budget tabled and 

debated today is about taking that product to market in an impactual way.   

</span></div><div><span>If you go on Facebook, you will see our papa Reuben Tylor letting the world know that the Cook 

Islands is open for a new business product providing solutions no other country has done today. 

We should be proud.  This government is investing an additional $200,000 into marketing this 

</span><span>product  and  the  industry’s  existing  products  and  the  industry  themselves  have  committed  to 

</span><span>matching  these  marketing  dollars  with  their  own  expense  in  true  partnership.    The  Financial 

Service industry is one part of our economy we expect to sustain our economic base.  Along with

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>tourism,  this  budget  moves  us  further  down  this  pathway  so,  let  us  have  faith  in  our  Offshore 

Banking industry.  

</span></div><div><span>With those few words, I commend the Budget for this House to support.  Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $453,703 for Financial Services Development Authority  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>FOREIGN AFFAIRS – debating time 10 minutes each side. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,011,795 for Foreign Affairs stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open for debate.  I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Chairman I stand to share our thoughts in regards to this 

appropriation.  

</span></div><div><span>The  Foreign  Affairs  is  an  important  Ministry  for  us.    I  agree  with  the  Report  that  one  of  the 

milestones achieved during the last three or four years is the new Immigration Act that was enacted 

last  year.    I  think  that  government  would  have  spent  quite  a  bit  of  money  on  the  consultation 

process of the Immigration Bill, which was widely consulted.   

</span></div><div><span>It is  even more important  because now as the Prime Minister indicated  earlier, the process  for 

Permanent Residence has started and I am aware that many people have been waiting for a long 

time.  Some has to reapply; they have previously applied some years ago.  It is also an opportune 

</span><span>time for Immigration to weed out those Permanent Residence that has left the country and do not 

</span><span>continuously  reside  in  the  Cook  Islands  and  of  course  create  the  vacancies  for  those  that  are 

residing here to fill.  

</span></div><div><span>This is also a Ministry that engages in or establishes diplomatic relations with other countries and 

these  relationships  are  always  good  for  us,  which  will  hopefully  lead  to  bigger  things.    The 

Opposition side has no objection to the appropriation amount. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member. I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you 

</span><span>have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span> Thank  you Mr Chairman.   The  Immigration Division  of the Ministry of 

Foreign  Affair  &amp;  Immigration  as  I  mentioned  earlier  are  now  going  through  the  process  of 

</span></div><div><span>33 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>reviewing  the  PR  applications.    The  Ministry  received  over  300  Expressions  of  Interest  for 

Permanent Residency either in their own right or as a spouse of a Cook Islander.  Once they have 

completed the Expressions of  Interests those who have made it through that  stage will then go 

through and be invited to apply formally for their PR application.  After that Mr Chairman, later 

on this year, we will be reviewing those PRs that no longer qualify have either moved out of the 

country or for whatever reason do not qualify to be PRs and those will be removed and struck off.  

If this provides openings for additional PRs to be considered will certainly look forward to a new 

application process later in the year.  

</span></div><div><span>Prior to COVID Mr Chairman, we opened a High Commission in Suva, Fiji and of course when 

COVID came and the borders were closed now for two and a half years it stranded our warrior in 

Suva who is there to this day as the High Commissioner of the Cook Islands to Fiji.  He is no less 

of course than that famous Mitiaro warrior Jim Armstead.  

</span></div><div><span>With the borders now open Mr Chairman and with a number of meetings due to be held very soon, 

I am looking forward to being able to go to Fiji to officially open our High Commission.  Fiji is a 

central hub in the Pacific for a number of various organisations.  Organisations that do not have a 

place in Wellington.  This include of course the Forum Secretariat Office, the Asian Development 

Bank subregional office and numerous other agencies that are based in Suva.  So having a High 

Commission office in Fiji is the natural progression into expanding our diplomatic representation 

in the region. 

</span></div><div><span>So in addition to our Wellington High Commission and the Consul Office in Auckland, we now 

have the High Commission in Fiji.  I would like to commend the very small team that we have 

working at Foreign Affairs in the various Divisions, the International Division, the Pacific Division 

for a lot of work that they have had to do over the last two years in engaging virtually over zoom 

with our partners.  Although virtual participation is useful, this in a way is as good as actual face 

to face participation. 

</span></div><div><span>So with travel borders now opening up, Mr Chairman we look forward to participating face to face 

at a number of important meetings that are coming up.  Just like my recent visit to French Polynesia 

last week, the face to face meeting with the President of French Polynesia resulted in a number of 

other separate meetings we were able to have with various people to push our programme of air 

</span><span>transport  connectivity  through  French  Polynesia.    I  know  our  team  are  looking  forward  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman to representing our country at various International meetings and forums that we have 

not been able to participate in for the last two years. 

</span></div><div><span>I support this allocation for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,011,795 for Foreign Affairs stands part of the Schedule?
