<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank my friend from Akaoa for the very beautiful question he asked yesterday.  

Fortunately, Mr Speaker I could not answer it yesterday and I was given the opportunity to reflect 

on what my answer will be overnight and this morning. 

You will recall Mr Speaker and Members of this House, that when I referred to opportunities in 

the Northern Group islands it was as a result in the context of the successful trip by our Prime 

Minister  in  his  discussions  with  his  French  Polynesia  counterpart.    I  was  referring  there  Mr 

Speaker, to the potential of greater tourism numbers directly to the Northern Group and the need 

for rebuilding the airport infrastructure both in Manihiki, Penrhyn and also Pukapuka. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Since the question was asked, two very important events intervened in that period until my answer 

now.  As you would appreciate I prepared for these response when the question was raised.  I will 

highlight these two events in the reverse. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This morning we just listened to the Reverend presenting our text this morning.  He referred to 

Revelations and the text is very inspiring in this time and period when John in his vision referred 

to seeing the new Heavens and the new earth.  In our Cook Islands Maori it reads “</span><span>Kite atura au 

ko Ioane i te rangi ou e te enua ou”.</span><span>  In the context of what we are going to go through soon, I 

Member of Parliament for Pukapuka can see the new earth and the new heaven with the advent of 

tourism to  the Northern  Group.   I  am  sure my  friends from  the Northern Group,  including the 

Leader of the Opposition can only see good things for the Northern Group.
