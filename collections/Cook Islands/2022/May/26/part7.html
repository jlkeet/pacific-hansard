<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>I recognise the Leader of the House; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 307 be suspended to enable the House to complete the debate on the 

Appropriation Bill 2022 in all its stages by 5.00 p.m. today 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>Sorry, I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I would like to ask if we are permitted to speak 

to this Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Yes, you may do so. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  On this motion moved in the House.  My understanding is the 

debates on this Appropriation will be shortened.  I am concerned because this morning we had a 

different arrangement where we were asked to give up half an hour of Question Time and then 

when we reach 5.00 p.m. the sitting will be extended for more debate. 

</span></div><div><span>Just now, we are told and of course I had been watching our list and progress has been slow I have 

to say, and we are now told that if we do not finish by 4.00 p.m., there will be a Motion to shortcut 

the whole process so that we can get the Appropriation Bill passed.  I have a problem with that Mr 

Chairman.  

</span></div><div><span>The reason being, this is the most important Bill that any Parliament can pass once a year and we 

have been talking at least, I have been hearing from the other side from my colleague we should 

work together and cooperate.  Well show your cooperation today and let us work together and get 

</span><span>this Bill throught in the way that it should be.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Can the Honourable Prime Minister?

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  As we can see that our time for our sitting is 

limited to today and tomorrow and with the other couple of Bills that we have before us, I would 

be more than happy to consider any suggestions that may come from the Leader of the Opposition 

as to how best we can accommodate the passage of the Budget and also the other Bills to come by 

tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I see the Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Prime Minister, when it was indicated to us that we have not 

much time, we did consider only one speaker and we started off by doing that and then it sort of 

went away.  So that is one way of doing it, one speaker from our side then the Minister Responsible, 

and we are ready to be strict about that. 

</span></div><div><span>My second suggestion is that we extend the time and if we follow one speaker per side and say no 

more than 10 minutes ,we will get it through.  We may have to extend the time but then if we do 

extend the time we will probably get there and everybody is asleep.  That is my suggestion. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I am quite happy to accept that recommendation that we have 

one speaker from each side on the Vote Items and limited to 10 minutes, we will get through.  If 

there is a need to go pass our Sitting time of 5.00 p.m. then I would recommend that we do move 

a motion to extend it to allow us to fully complete the discussions on each Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I think you people should have solved that before we started.  Once again, 

may I remind all Members of Parliament, only one speaker from one side, before we were like 

school children where we all started talking. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, her motion needs to be amended because she cited 307 (2). 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Can I have the Honourable Member for Ngatangiia to repeat. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That we amend the motion to 307 (ii) in the Standing Orders 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Sorry, I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable  Selina Napa 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to?
