<div><span>INFRASTRUCTURE COOK ISLANDS: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $5,374,000 for Infrastructure Cook Islands stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable William Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span> Thank  you Mr Chairman. My thought  will begin on Output 1 Corporate 

Support Services. It is not that I am opposing I do support however, I have a few comments to 

make especially in the building control.   

</span></div><div><span>As we can see, there is an increase in the construction of houses.  When we consider hotels, some 

of them has no parking allocation at all and I can see a problem in the future so if this area can be 

looked into before it becomes a major problem.  

</span></div><div><span>I also give my 100 percent support to Output 2. I want to comment on Output 3 regarding road 

maintenance and drainage upkeep throughout Rarotonga.  We know that during flooding spells, 

</span><span>everything  is  submerged  under  water  in  the  low-lying  areas  as  well  as  to  coordinate  the  civil 

</span><span>emergency response as required in partnership with EMCI.  

</span></div><div><span>Back  in  the  day  Mr  Chairman,  I  was  part  of  conducting  this  type  of  work  and  there  was  no 

remuneration for it.  It was on a voluntary basis.  I do feel it is about time these volunteers are paid 

for this work.   

</span></div><div><span>If we look at Output 4, Waste Management Division, as stated by the Associate Minister they are 

looking into it so I have no problems with that and I support it but quicken the process so that it 

</span><span>does not reach the New Year.  

</span></div><div><span>I give my full 150 percent support to this budget allocation for ICI.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  very  much  for  your  support  Honourable  Member.  I  see  the 

Associate Minister for ICI, Albert Nicholas. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank  you Mr Chairman and also  to the Member from  Ruaau for  your 

thoughts.  We have before us the appropriation for this Ministry and it quotes over $5 million.   

</span></div><div><span>I will not speak much but I will base my comments on the amount of $5 million.  The main focus 

of this is allocation for the payment of personnelâ€™s in this Ministry.   Within this is the contractual 

payment for our new engineer from New Zealand.   This is one area in the Ministry that needs to 

be strengthen and that is those with expert skills.  I want to confirm to our people listening in that 

the Head of the Ministry, Tamarii Tutangata is working very hard to drive this work forward for 

us.  We have all the Outputs in Book 1 and those are laid out clearly.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to highlight to us on Administered Payments of $2 million and part of allocation of 3 

quarter million will be going to our drainages and bridge maintenance.  Another 3 quarter million 

will be allocated on Waste Management and as explained by an elder, before this is one of the 

major issues within ICI.   

</span></div><div><span>Like I have explained to our people listening in, this is one of the areas the Ministry is working 

hard to rectify.   The strategic direction for this area is well established and this is not an easy issue. 

Because this government loves its people, the government is looking at purchasing an equipment 

to help us with waste.  

</span></div><div><span>Also  under  this  Administered  Payment  is  3  quarter  million  dollars  allocated  to  our  Road  and 

Drainage Asset Management.  Further, under this Administered Payment, $200,000 is allocated to 

Emergency Response work that occurs at untimely times.  Since we all have access to the Budget 

Books, I will end my speech here.  If you have any queries, please read it in your own time at home 

to understand it.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman and all of us, this is the appropriation for ICI for the coming year.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Associate Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $5,374,000 for Infrastructure Cook Islands  

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
