<div><span>TRANSPORT:   

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,199,330 for Transport stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speaker?  I see the Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Tina Browne you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, the purpose of the Ministry of Transport as stated 

at Page 360 of Book 2 is to create and maintain a safe projectable and cost effective environment 

for users of aviation, maritime and road transport operators.   

</span></div><div><span>It is not new that as far as the Northern Group is concerned, shipping has always been a problem.  

</span><span>It has been unpredictable and expensive and now of course with the recent mishap of the Greena 

</span><span>and we are left only with the barge and there is unlikely to be a new boat within the next six months 

this problem has been exacerbated.   

</span></div><div><span>I do not see in the Ministry of Transport’s on Page 360 any plans for fixing the problem.  When I 

talk about expensive, even the barge now has gone from 850 I think to travel up North to 1,400 

and the airplane is 1,595.  My friend across the floor is indicating it’s even worse for Pukapuka, 

1,778. 

</span></div><div><span>So when you are travelling to the Northern Group the cost is close to travelling around the world.  

</span><span>Now it’s worse for Rakahanga because it’s 1,595 from here to get to Tukao.  You cross on the boat 

at a cost of 1,500.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  aware  that  there  are  two  charges,  one  is  for  government  officials  and  there  is  a  rate  for 

Rakahangans and the rate for Rakahangans are lower but when you add the cost, it is cheaper to 

go to New Zealand and back than one way between here and Rakahanga.  Of course the additional 

problem with the Greena being landed on the reef is that passengers can only now go on the barge 

because the Lady Moana cannot carry passengers.  Then of course, we hear that the Lady Moana 

has done her last trip and it is going to Fiji to go on dry dock. 

</span></div><div><span>So when I come back to the Budget and one thing I do not see in there and it might be provided 

somewhere else, there is an expectation to pay compensation with regard to a legal Court action 

that  is  pending  in  Court.    I  am  aware  that  government  is  being  sued  for  not  providing  safe 

transportation.    No  doubt  probably  if  the  case  is  successful  the  amount  could  be  paid  out  of 

government’s Contingency Funds.   

</span></div><div><span>My  request  to  the  Minister  of  Transport  is  to  try  and  archive  the  objective  of  creating  and 

maintaining a safe and a predictable transport by way of shipping to the Pa Enua.  On that note, 

we support the Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister,  Robert 

Tapaitau you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I thank the Honourable Member for Rakahanga 

for her good speech.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, Mr Chairman when we look at boat owner’s government is not one of them.  These people 

own their own businesses.  She is commenting on the state of the ships and that our people be 

transported by ship.  We see there is a belief for them on that side they are still under this level 

with regards to shipping.  That is why government want the work to be carried out on the airports 

in the Northern Group so your people the Member for Rakahanga travel on boats.  The boats will 

be used for cargo. 

</span></div><div><span>I heard you say you travel to Manihiki and then travel across by boat.  You are the Member of 

Parliament for Rakahanga and it is your responsibility to develop the airport there so that we can 

fly there.  This is why I have always pushed for us to get our airports done in the North.   

</span></div><div><span>I do not know if you have been by boat.  It is not a comfortable trip.  We talk about travelling by 

boat and it takes four days to get to Penrhyn compared to a two to three hour flight.  Let us not talk 

about the ships.  If people from the Southern Group are flying let us not mention about boats.  Let 

us get the service that we so deserve up North as well. 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to Lady Moana, I think she may have one more trip to the Southern Group islands 

before it goes on dock.   Concerning the conditions of boats, before we went through the pandemic 

period the government was looking at purchasing a boat from Japan and we are still looking at it.   

</span></div><div><span>Let us not just concentrate on shipping, let us look at aviation too because to me, I am also from 

Rakahanga and I would prefer to fly from here to Rakahanga.  To our people who are working in 

the Ministry of Transport I am grateful for the good work that you are doing and for the challenges

Hosking congratulations on your reappointment and to all your staff, we thank you for the good 

work that you are providing. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, I strongly support the appropriation for the Ministry of Transport.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I put the Question:
