</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, this is an important Ministry.  This Ministry is 

responsible for the Public Servants.  I was happy to read their vision and this is what we want, 

excellence in the Public Service.  I would like to give words of encouragement through the Minister 

of Public Service Commission to the Public Service Commissioner who have been in the role of 

Commissioner for about two years I think.  In the short time that he has been in this role, I have 

met with him about three times. 

</span></div><div><span>I am very happy with his vision for the Public Service Commission and also the plan that he has 

to  review  the  salaries  of  public  servants  and  also  to  look  at  reforming  the  whole  entire  Public 

Service to be streamlined. 

</span></div><div><span>This is a big job for any person but during my discussions with the Commissioner, I formed the 

opinion that he is able to perform this job. 

</span></div><div><span>I am looking at the Budget and I do believe this is appropriate and we support this allocation for 

the Public Service Commission. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Tina Browne.  

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $2,449,680 for Public Service Commission stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
