<div><span>OPENING PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER (T. TURA):  </span><span>Please</span><span>be seated.  I call the House to order.  Greetings to you all on 

this beautiful morning.  We also extend greetings to our people on the island of Rarotonga, to those 

in the North and Southern Groups.  Greetings also to our Chaplain for conducting our service this 

morning.  It was a beautiful message, topped with the wonderful prayers that he delivered. 

</span></div><div><span>I will not forget our staff of Parliament, from the Clerk to his Assistant, the Interpreters and other 

staff who work for Parliament.  I want to thank them for their hard work as some of you are not 

aware that they finish work at 4.00 a.m. and start work again at 8.00 a.m. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now go to Question Time.  I will ask the Honourable Member Tingika Elikana to take the 

Floor and response to the question that was raised to him yesterday.  Please be patient with me, 

thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>Let us start again, there is some change to our programme for today.  I will call the Leader of the 

House, the Honourable Tehani Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 66 (b) be suspended and to proceed with Question Time for half an 

hour only to enable the House to deliberate with the Appropriation Bill 2022 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Leader of the House.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable William Heather  

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Question Time will be for thirty minutes instead of one hour.  I now call the 

Honourable Tingika Elikana; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank my friend from Akaoa for the very beautiful question he asked yesterday.  

Fortunately, Mr Speaker I could not answer it yesterday and I was given the opportunity to reflect 

on what my answer will be overnight and this morning. 

You will recall Mr Speaker and Members of this House, that when I referred to opportunities in 

the Northern Group islands it was as a result in the context of the successful trip by our Prime 

Minister  in  his  discussions  with  his  French  Polynesia  counterpart.    I  was  referring  there  Mr 

Speaker, to the potential of greater tourism numbers directly to the Northern Group and the need 

for rebuilding the airport infrastructure both in Manihiki, Penrhyn and also Pukapuka. 

</span></div><div><span>Since the question was asked, two very important events intervened in that period until my answer 

now.  As you would appreciate I prepared for these response when the question was raised.  I will 

highlight these two events in the reverse. 

</span></div><div><span>This morning we just listened to the Reverend presenting our text this morning.  He referred to 

Revelations and the text is very inspiring in this time and period when John in his vision referred 

to seeing the new Heavens and the new earth.  In our Cook Islands Maori it reads “</span><span>Kite atura au 

ko Ioane i te rangi ou e te enua ou”.</span><span>  In the context of what we are going to go through soon, I 

Member of Parliament for Pukapuka can see the new earth and the new heaven with the advent of 

tourism to  the Northern  Group.   I  am  sure my  friends from  the Northern Group,  including the 

Leader of the Opposition can only see good things for the Northern Group. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, is she going to raise a Point of Order or just standing. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>I have asked for a Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>A Point of Order is raised.  What is your Point of Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  S.  NAPA:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  the  Member  for  Pukapuka  is  waffling,  he  needs  to  answer  the 

</span><span>question as this is Question Time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>I think I should waffle a lot because waffle is something I like.  If you want 

some, you can go to the Punanga Nui and buy it from there.   

</span></div><div><span>But that aside I know the second event.  When I went back yesterday and tried to prepare myself 

I thought I would just check my Facebook, because I follow both political parties on Facebook and 

</span><span>I came across the Democratic Party Facebook. Low and behold, they were asking for suggestions 

</span><span>from members of the public in developing their policies.  So, Mr Speaker that concerns me because 

after four years, they are still considering their policies.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  Poin of Order Mr Speaker!  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order Honourable Member?  

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  I see the Honourable Member for Pukapuka is wondering away from answering 

the question because we have a lot of questions that we want to raise.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, can you come back to the question raised. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the question that was asked did not say that I should answer it 

with a yes or no.  That is the difference in the way we ask questions and the way they ask questions.  

My friend who asked that question left the door open.  So, I am trying to fit everything into the 

door. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Get it in one door now. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the point I raised my concern with him seeking the appealings 

of the public at this stage after four years of them having the opportunity to do it, it is because what 

I might be seeing about development in the Northern Group they might put it into their manifesto 

and tell the public it’s their idea.  That is my concern Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>The question is whether fresh fish and taro can be sent to Rarotonga.  Mr Speaker as I said when I 

spoke on the mertis and principels of the budget, I gave hints what is the opportunities available if 

we open tourism to the Northern Groups.  Unfortunately, I am not prepared to expand on those 

thoughts because the Opposition is going to take it and write it into their manifesto. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Speaker! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  A Point of Order has been raised. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  The question was, if he can send taro and fish to Rarotonga?  Not elaborate 

on tourism or other things. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, can you please answer the question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thats the problem Mr Speaker.  The question is open ended.  You listen to 

the Honourable Member for Tupapa, George Angene asked the question yesterday and he said 

answer, yes or no.  They didn’t say that.  So, don’t blame me. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>You are an educated person. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  A Point of Order has been raised. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  Can we please move on with the Question Time here.  We have a lot of questions 

from the Opposition.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Please Honourable Member, answer the question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>I am going to take a little while to answer it because it is open but hey, to be 

fair to my friends over on that side who have asked the question, the short answer is, yes.  It can 

be done but I am not going to give you the reason so you cannot write it in your manifesto.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member Tingika Elikana, I see the Honourable Member 

Nooroa Baker; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. BAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I will not ask questions to the Member from Pukapuka 

anymore otherwise he will go around the world and come back to our Parliament before he tell us 

the real story. 

</span></div><div><span>So, my question Mr Speaker this morning to the Honourable Member of RAPPA, the Honourable 

Albert Nicholas.  Mr Speaker I believe the Associate Minister for ICI knows about something that 

happened  in  the  past.    I  was  told  that  our  roads  in  Akaoa  or  Puaikura  was  priority  on  the 

government list to be fixed. 

</span></div><div><span>The people of Puaikura was surprised that the whole project was moved to Tupapa.  That is why I 

was surprised to hear that Puaikura’s road was not completed, and I understand it was going to be 

sealed with the hot mix in 2016.  I also believe that there was a machine that was bought and it 

was a chip seal machine.  I want to know why that machine was bought and why it was not used.  

Who owns that machine? 

</span></div><div><span>So, that is why I was a bit disappointed when I heard that Puaikura’s road was supposed to be 

completed but the road work was moved to Tupapa.  Thank you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Associate Minister, Albert Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, just for clarification, is this an open ended question or does 

the Honourable Member just require a yes or no? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  It is an open closed question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and the Honourable Member who have asked the 

question to me.  For this question, I consider that it is directed at a time when I was not Associate 

Minister, and even before the time the present Prime Minister was the Minister Responsible.  

</span></div><div><span>I believe this question is refering to the time when the former Member of Parliament for Akaoa, 

Teariki Heather was the Minister Responsible for the Ministry and also the Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker I see the question that has been asked requires two parts of the answer.  Firstly, the 

</span><span>question is why was this project  discontinued when it was supposed to be carried according to 

plan.  Secondly, it relates to a machine that was purchased by the then Deputy Prime Minister for 

the  road  sealing.    I  believe  at  the  time,  there  were  some  issues  about  this  machine  in  terms  of 

</span></div><div><span>4 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>purchasing the machine.  So, can I request for this part of the question to be deferred until Question 

Time tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>To answer the first question as to why the road project in 2016 was not completed according to 

plan.  I suggest for  you Honourable Member to get the proper answer from the former Deputy 

Prime Minister at the time.  I am still unsure why this road project discontinued because this man 

was was not only the Minister of ICI at the time, but also the Deputy Prime Minister of our country. 

</span></div><div><span>My question this morning was, why were the roads in Puaikura not sealed during his time.  I was 

in Cabinet at the time and it was Teariki Heather who stopped the work from going ahead.  I recall 

that under the leadeship of the former Prime Minister, Henry Puna, he suggested that the first road 

to be sealed would be Harley Street.   

</span></div><div><span>The proposal was to start the hot seal tarsealing from Harley Street through to Puaikura.  However, 

due  to  some  issues,  the  then  Deputy  Prime  Minister  did  not  want  the  roads  to  be  sealed.    His 

preference was for the roads to be chipped sealed.  During that time, the then Prime Minister and 

the rest of the Members wanted the roads to be hot mix sealed. For this reason, the road sealing 

went to Tupapa and around Takitumu.   As you may be aware, right now the roadwork is on the 

border leading to Puaikura. Like what the Prime Minister told us in the past days, when the sealing 

of the remaining areas in Takitumu is completed, the work will start in Puaikura.  

</span></div><div><span>To conclude my response to the Honourable Member, this question is better directed to the former 

Minister of ICI and Deputy Prime Minister when you see him on the road. 

</span></div><div><span>On the second part of your question, I will respond to this question tomorrow when I return to the 

House with facts and background information about the machine. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Associate Minister, Albert Nicholas. I see the Honourable Vaitoti 

Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span> Thank you Mrs Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>My  question  is  to  the  Minister  George  Angene  because  when  I  look  at  his  attire,  it  is  like  the 

</span><span>students  of  Takamoa  Theological  College.    I  thought  he  was  going  to  conduct  our  Opening 

</span><span>Devotion in the House this morning.  

</span></div><div><span>However, my question is, we know you are constructing graves for some people around the island 

and you are providing free services.  There are some households in Matavera that wants concrete 

water tanks.  Some households also received sponsored plastic water tanks during the cyclone in 

2015 and they are now damaged.   

</span></div><div><span>The  question  is,  have  you  considered  constructing  concrete  water  tanks  free  of  service  for  our 

</span><span>people starting in the village of Matavera?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> I see the Honourable Minister George Angene; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE: </span><span> Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you for the question Honourable Member from Matavera.  The question is whether I have 

considered  constructing  concrete  water  tanks?    Yes,  since  I  have  already  started  constructing 

graves free of charge, tree trimmings for free, cleaning households of the destitute for free then I 

see  no  barrier  for  me  to  construct  concrete  water  tanks  for  free.  There  is  nothing  that  George 

Maggie cannot do, that’s my game.  

</span></div><div><span>(Much laughter)</span></div><div><span>So, in response to the question that if it can be done? The response is I can do it, through your 

assistance in your district, Ngatangiia and around the Cook Islands. My service is available and to 

also train someone in the districts to construct water tanks. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Terepai Maoate; you 

have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. My question is to seek clarification from the Minister 

for  Foreign  Affairs.  This  is  in  reference  to  the  status  of  PR.    My  question  is  regarding  those 

foreigners who have married locals and have been here 2 to 3 and maybe up to 10 years.  What is 

the situation with their PR application now? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you. I see the Honourable Prime Minister the Minster of Foreign Affairs; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Member for his question.  

</span></div><div><span>I can update you the PR applications closed on Friday last week.  The Immigration team is going 

through the first part of the process to eliminate those that do not fit the criteria that has been set 

before they start going through the second part of the process.  They will then review the criteria 

for those who have passed stage 1.  

</span></div><div><span>We know that this House passed the Immigration Act that limits the number of PR’s to 500. Of 

</span><span>course, these Permanent Residents criteria are PR’s in their own right. Not included in this 500 

</span><span>over  and  above  are  those  PR  applications  from  people  who  are  partners  or  spouses  of  Cook 

Islanders.  Therefore,  there  is  no  limits  applied  to  those  criteria  of  PR.    However,  there  is  still 

qualifying  criteria  for  spouses  of  PR  and  one  of  them  I  am  aware  of  is  that  they  must  be  in  a 

committed relationship for at least 5 years.  The Residency criteria also applies for New Zealanders 

5 years and for those who are non-New Zealanders 10 years. 

</span></div><div><span>The other criteria that does not fit in the limit of 500 are those PR applicants who are over the age 

of 70.  Again, there is no limit on granting PR to those who are over the age of 70.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Honourable Prime Minister, I think there is a lot more to say to complete your 

answer. Can you do that tomorrow?

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span> I can do it now in 30 seconds. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Carry on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span> In the next two weeks, we should have the final assessment from the team 

from Immigration for the consideration of those who have successfully qualified for PR. Thank 

you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  thank  you  Members  for  your 

questions and answers. We have come to the end of Question Time.
