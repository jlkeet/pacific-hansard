</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open. I can see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I want to confirm to us in Parliament that I strongly 

support  this  appropriation  under  the  leadership  of  the  Prime  Minister.    I  also  know  of  the 

appropriation increases and the decreases.  

</span></div><div><span>One part I would like the Prime Minister to have a re-look and I know the Prime Minister will 

understand what I am talking about and that is the (EMCI) Emergency Management Cook Islands.  

So, Prime Minister even though they did not receive any increases just take a look. The part I am 

looking at Mr Chairman is the strengthening of the EMCI Act 2007.  But in hindsight of that Mr 

Chairman, I would like to congratulate the new Head of this Division which is Mr John Strickland. 

We know he came from the Police and now he is heading the EMCI.  I know the Prime Minister 

wanted him to go to EMCI to re-look at the operations of EMCI and I know this new Head was 

able to review their legislation and I am advised this new legislation will be completed in the month 

of September.   

</span></div><div><span>Those are my comments to ask the Prime Minister to re-look and we support this Vote Item for 

EMCI.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you very much Honourable Vaitoti Tupa, you make our meeting lively.  

I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I too would like to acknowledge our new Director 

for Emergency Management Cook  Islands, Mr  John Strickland recently from  the Cook  Islands 

Police Department.  Already on the ball with the distribution of chainsaws and radio equipment to 

all of our Puna and our islands in response and in preparation for any occasion when we do have 

a natural disaster emergency.  The Puna are starting to receive equipment courtesy of support from 

our  development  partners  and  I  support  fully  the  Appropriation  for  the  Office  of  the  Prime 

Minister.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,199,200 for the Prime Minister’s Office stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
