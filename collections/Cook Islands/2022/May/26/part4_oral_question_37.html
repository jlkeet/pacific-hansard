<h3>Oral Question 37</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span> Thank you Mrs Speaker.  

</span></div>
<div><span>My  question  is  to  the  Minister  George  Angene  because  when  I  look  at  his  attire,  it  is  like  the 

</span><span>students  of  Takamoa  Theological  College.    I  thought  he  was  going  to  conduct  our  Opening 

</span><span>Devotion in the House this morning.  

</span></div>
<div><span>However, my question is, we know you are constructing graves for some people around the island 

and you are providing free services.  There are some households in Matavera that wants concrete 

water tanks.  Some households also received sponsored plastic water tanks during the cyclone in 

2015 and they are now damaged.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The  question  is,  have  you  considered  constructing  concrete  water  tanks  free  of  service  for  our 

</span><span>people starting in the village of Matavera?  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> I see the Honourable Minister George Angene; you have the Floor.
