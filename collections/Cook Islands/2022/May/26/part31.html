<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Members, that completes the First, Second and Third Reading of 

the Appropriation Bill 2022/23.  Congratulations everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Like I said, we have come to the end of this Session.  I would like to thank all 

Honourable Members of this House for staying that long in Parliament.  I would also like to thank 

the Clerk and the staff of Parliament for doing a good job.   

</span></div><div><span>I think there is a milestone we reached today.  In previous Sittings, we sit then stop then have a 

break, go home and come back and resume at 5.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. or whatever but today we 

did a marathon.  We started from 10.00 a.m. up to now which is 7.30. p.m.  I think that is continuity 

in the Sitting.  Thank you everyone. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a message for all of you.  I was advised to remind you that tomorrow is Kia Orana day for 

us.  Please bring the Kia Orana flavour tomorrow.  Do not bring any artificial flavour into this 

House.  Thank you very much Honourable Members, I know we need to finish off today. 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is adjourned until 10.00 a.m. tomorrow morning.  Can I ask an Honourable Member to 

close our Sitting with a Closing Prayer?
