<h3>Oral Question 5</h3>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  one  increase  I  want  for  Rakahanga  is  for  the 

airport of Rakahanga.  Maybe the Minister of Finance can allocate or locate a source of funds to 

be  able  to  build  the  airport  for  Rakahanga  so  we  can  fly  direct  to  Rakahanga  instead  of  going 

through Manihiki. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The third I want to ask for an increase is in the wages of the government workers on the island.  

Regarding the matter of minimum wage, I am not sure of the situation with the other islands but 

in Rakahanga, there are two or three people receiving good pay but the rest is still on the minimum 

wage.  With inflation of course, the prices of items in our stores have escalated.  In Rarotonga 

today, the price of butter is $12.50 imagine what the price will be up in our Northern Group islands.  

They will not be able to afford a packet of butter. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We in the Opposition do understand that we do not have sufficient funds.  Maybe the government 

can relook at this and if there are extra funds then consider our people in the North.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the Opposition, I see the Honourable Prime Minister; 

you have the Floor.  

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    I  stand  to  fully  support  the  appropriations 

allocated to each of the Outer Islands.  Just to note the increase of 50 cents on the minimum wage 

for the Pa Enua alone is about a quarter of a million dollars.  So, it is a significant amount that 

even with the slight increase in minimum wage it does add all on to the total budget allocation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>But as the Honourable Minister for Transport was saying, we should be focusing on reducing the 

</span><span>cost of transportation to get to the Outer Islands in order to maximise the opportunity for the Pa 

Enua to be part of our economic regrowth.  So, I am very pleased Mr Chairman that progress on 

our Manihiki airport as a first step is well on the way.  One of the biggest things that we have to

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div>
<div><span>overcome in any major infrastructure project not just for the Pa Enua but also in Rarotonga is not 

the money but it is the land available. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I was very pleased Mr Chairman that the people of Manihiki agreed to the enduring agreement 

for their use of the land for the airport which keeps that land in the hands of the landowners but 

allows the government to come and do the work to seal the runway. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I would like to congratulate the delegation that went to Manihiki recently, led by our Deputy 

Prime Minister and also the Member of Parliament for Manihiki and the team from CIIC to explain 

to our landowners in Manihiki and to get the results that they did which was unanimous approval 

to use this legal framework, the Enduring Agreement to allow the work to get started.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So we will look at this template for Land Acquisition or Land Use where the landowners remain 

as the owners of that land.  While it is us Cook Islanders that will pay for this airport to be sealed 

we are actively engaging without Development Partners to be able to fast track the work in sealing 

our other runways that needs to be sealed.  That will allow the larger SAAB aircraft to land, take 

more passengers and as a result, to be able to reduce the airfare that people are paying particularly 

to fly to the northern group.  

</span></div>
<div><span>As the country recovers Mr Chairman and as we do if we are fortunate to start gathering revenues 

from other streams such as what we are doing with our diversification into our minerals.  We would 

certainly look at putting more funding into our Pa Enua.  Thank you Mr Chairman.
