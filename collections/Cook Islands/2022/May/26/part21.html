<div><span>TOURISM CORPORATION: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $8,172,000 stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tina Browne you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE: </span><span> Mr Chairman the Opposition is happy to support the allocation 

for Tourism.  There are many reasons why we support this allocation.  I will mention a few. 

</span></div><div><span>The first  one is  given that  the fact  that we  are in COVID times and  given the fact  that  we are 

relying heavily on tourism in our recovery plan.  It is the right thing to do to support this allocation.   

</span></div><div><span>When I also look at the write up at page 351 and 352, we can see the efforts of the Private Sector 

in trying to find ways to keep some momentum as far as the Tourism industry is concerned. For 

example, the idea of the Round the Rock travel that is an idea that has come out of maybe Ewan 

Smith that has been quite successful.  

</span></div><div><span>I know of many families that actually took advantage of Round the Rock even though I think it is 

about $3,500 or something like that but even then in the bigger picture it is cheap.  It helps to give 

some revenue for the Pa Enua in the form of accommodation.  I know that we in Rakahanga would 

have welcomed tourist to come on the island and we can share part of that revenue.  Unfortunately, 

the transport between Rakahanga and Tukao is far too expensive and so tourists do not wish to 

travel across.  It is expensive because of the cost of fuel so Rakahanga missed out and we will have 

to find ways to see whether we can be included in the Round the Rock travel. 

</span></div><div><span>The other thing I thought was very good for the Tourism Corporation to take on board is the control 

of dogs.  Naturally, we think that the control of dogs should either be with the Police or some other 

Ministry but Tourism has taken this on board.  I think we all know why because stray dogs are not 

</span><span>only hazardous to us but also to our Tourism industry.  I see there that the Tourism Corporation 

</span><span>established  a  Committee  that  is  made  up  of  people  from  the  Police,  Agriculture  etc.  Yes,  this 

afternoon we heard over board as the plane flew above us and I think all of us are thinking we 

hope that that plane is full of tourist.  Therefore, we have no difficulty in supporting the allocation 

for Tourism. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. I see the Honourable Minister for Tourism; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. ARIOKA:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman. I rise to also support the appropriation for Tourism 

</span><span>and also to thank quite a few people that are way overdue to be thanking them at this moment. I 

think all of us Members had  a  good read in the  Appropriation  Book  and have seen significant 

progress in the work that Cook Islands Tourism has done so far.

</span></div><div><a>Page 57</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>One of the obvious people that I want to thank Mr Chairman is Mr Halato Fua, the former CEO of 

Tourism who has left Tourism in very good hands and has raised the profile of the agency to a 

very good progressive level where it is today.  So, no doubt his tenure with Environment Service 

will  actually  show  some  significant  progress  and  changes  prior  to  his  time  during  this  coming 

months. 

</span></div><div><span>As we all know Mr Chairman, the incoming new CEO, Karla Eggelton has been one of our own 

Cook Islander born and bred here in the Cook Islands.  She has been chosen due to her work history 

as well as her professionalism has been successful to be the new CEO today.  She comes with 

immense of experience and high qualification for the good work that not only she has done within 

tourism but also assisted in the Ministry of Finance programme for regular budgeting on an annual 

basis.  No doubt, her appointment was fully supported by the Board of Directors and also with the 

support of Cabinet that we know that she will do her very best to hold strong the work of Tourism 

into the future. 

</span></div><div><span>I like to also acknowledge the Chairman of the Board, Ewan Smith and his strong Members of the 

Board  for  working  closely  with  the  Tourism  Council  in  all  the  industries  that  we  have  come 

through the COVID-19 problems.  One thing I think Honourable Members we have to thank for is 

the foresight to be able to determine and forecast the impacts that we have been experiencing and 

how quick Tourism has been responded to those in preparation for COVID-19.  So in that period 

the team has worked hard to ensure that our hotels and accommodations are being resourced with 

pre-COVID materials and resources in preparation for COVID.  This is all through the effort of 

the  Board  as  well  as  working  in  close  relationship  with  the  Tourism  Council  of  the  Tourism 

industry.  

</span></div><div><span>So, I can say as the Minister for Tourism that the Tourism Authority has worked way and above 

the call of duty as well as demonstrated strong professionalism in the work that upheld the integrity 

of the organisation thus far.  I as Minister is very proud with every staff who has played an integral 

role as well as been part of bringing us this far and at the same time responding to future forecast 

as we are stepping into the future.  

</span></div><div><span>I say that Mr Chairman is because in Book 1 there are Arrival Forecasts that are going to be a 

</span><span>problem if we do not do anything about it.  So, these Outputs 1 and 2 are actually being set as 

</span><span>important  strategies  to  ensure  that  we  are  able  to  increase  tourism  in  the  coming  months.  

Therefore, it is this government that has made it a priority to make sure that we can increase volume 

of arrivals that would have a quick impact in pulling us out from this recovery.  

</span></div><div><span>Thirdly, Mr Chairman I like to acknowledge the hard work that the Committee who are responsible 

for the Dog Programme on the island.  As you know we are in the period where more dogs needs 

to be neutered and that is happening in this week.  I am also impressed with how much work the 

Police themselves has been encouraging the Committee to work hard together.   

</span></div><div><span>There has been a public outcry on a number of dogs needed to be put down and that was responded 

swiftly  and  in  a  timely  manner.    However,  Mr  Chairman  make  no  mistake  these  are  just  the 

foundational work that needed to be done but the next tranche of work is going to put people to 

</span></div><div><span>57

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>account for owning dogs in their homes.  If your dog is not neutered or registered, you will be 

visited by the Police.  So, use this opportunity to bring  your dogs to be neutered and get them 

registered, so they can be part of the system so we can monitor them more effectively. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I would just like to conclude on one important point which is the Pa Enua tourism 

expansion to the Northern Group islands.  It is this governmentâ€™s intention that that programme 

must work well with the people of the island so there has been some preliminary discussions, there 

will be a continuation of those discussions to ensure that tourism does not have greater influence 

to change the way people live in their homes. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Chairman I commend this Appropriation and has my full support in this House.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $8,172,000 for Tourism Corporation stands part of the Schedule?
