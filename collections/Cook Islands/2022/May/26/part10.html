</span></div><div><span>  I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $20,588,832 for Health stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Selina Napa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  A few thoughts that we want to share on Te Marae 

Ora.  I am reading the background of Te Marae Ora and it says, Te Marae Ora is committed to 

</span><span>ensuring people lead healthy lives and therefore we all should be working closely to ensure that 

</span><span>our people lead a healthy life style.  Unfortunately, we are however, burdened with a high rate of 

obesity, high risk of NCD.

</span></div><div><span>Thursday, 26 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>It  was  great  to  see that last week was hypertension week, in  other words, hypertension is  high 

blood pressure.  I am looking through the five Outputs it is being described in here that Te Marae 

Ora is actually trying to tackle NCD in our Nation.  Hypertension in our country is a major cause 

for our ill health and the problems we get out of hypertension is stroke, heart attack, kidney disease 

and leads to dementia in our nation. 

</span></div><div><span>I am still looking around in the Appropriation  and I do not see any allocation that is  given for 

dementia because dementia is on the rise in our nation as I can see and when I looked at the World 

Health statistics, it is one in four for men and one in five for women.  So, with the Budget allocation 

that has been allocated for the Ministry of Health, maybe the Minister can explain which area in 

the Appropriation that will be given to address this problem of dementia.  I assume it will be under 

Output 3 Primary Care and also I am wondering whether the government have even considered 

looking at a hospice to take care of our people who have come to this end.  We now know that 

there are different kinds of cancers and the number of cases are increasing. 

</span></div><div><span>Output 3, which is the Primary Health care and one area that has been talked about here, is reducing 

waiting  time  for  patients.    I  am  speaking  on  behalf  of  the  women  because  when  we  go  to  the 

hospital to be checked we would not get the result until about a month later.  I think in the Budget 

22/23 it is talking about reducing the waiting time for patients and the women is included in that 

waiting time. 

</span></div><div><span>Also under Budget 22/23 there is an area here where it says, CT scan services established and how 

do you access this service for the CT scan whether we have the resources to work this machine for 

us here. 

</span></div><div><span>There is also mention in the structure here about traditional medicine but I do not see it allocated 

in any of the actual Budget of 2022/23 and whether Te Marae Ora accept traditional medicine to 

help cure our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Otherwise, I would like to take this time to say thank you to the Minister and all the staff of Health 

for their hard work.  There was just one question that I wanted to put to the Minister out of curiosity 

for me, during the period of COVID some of our people when they were admitted to the hospital, 

they caught COVID from the hospital and how was that possible?   

</span></div><div><span>Despite that, I agree that this is one Vote Item in the Budget that we should not be politicising.  

We all need to work together for the wellbeing of our people and whatever illnesses there are in 

our country, we should all be tackling the problems together. 

</span></div><div><span>At this time, I would like to congratulate all the nurses that are going to graduate tomorrow because 

you tried your best to continue studying and that is why you will be graduating.  On behalf of all 

of us Members, we support 150 percent this appropriation for Te Marae Ora. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Rose Browne; you 

</span><span>have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14  

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to all of us in the House and to 

all our people listening in.   I  would like to  thank the comments  from  the Opposition  and their 

support  for  this  appropriation.    We  do  know  this  is  one  of  the  most  important  Ministry  in  our 

country.  We do have our nurses in the Ministry of Health who cared for our new born babies until 

the time we depart this world. 

</span></div><div><span>To the Honourable Member for Titikaveka, you are right we should not treat this Ministry with 

political intensions but to work together for the benefit of our people.  We all know that we were 

not able to increase the remuneration of our workers in this Ministry because they came through 

the exact time of the period of this pandemic.  So, I will work hard to ensure that they are included 

in the increments in next yearâ€™s budget. 

</span></div><div><span>There  were  many  areas  that  were  improved  in  the  Ministry  of  Health  as  we  came  through  the 

pandemic.  So, I would like to thank government and our Leader of the Nation because this is a 

national issue.  So, it is only appropriate that our National Leader fronts for us and assist by those 

of us in the Ministry of Health.  I also thank the appropriation and the financial support given to 

us to improve these areas for the pandemic and for the future. 

</span></div><div><span>We have an increase of $300,000 in the appropriation however, there were other support that came 

outside of this.  From our partners like the government of New Zealand and Australia, WHO, SPC, 

UNISEF, Japan and China.  We extend a big thank you to them for supporting the proposals from 

the Ministry of Health.  But there remains much work for those of us in the Ministry of Health to 

do. 

</span></div><div><span>There are improvements, developments in facilities and we see the new building for our mental 

health illness.  This will be completed shortly and I would like to commend the Minister for CIIC 

as well as the Minister for Corrective Services for their support to this project.  There is also an 

extra allocation for bringing specialist nurses to look after those in this new facility.  There are 

many others like the improvement of the hospital in Mangaia and the building of the new hospital 

on the island of Penrhyn in Tetautua has been overdue. 

</span></div><div><span>We return to this major issue of NCD.  I do accept the comments presented in this House to review 

the status in our nation again.  I am glad to announce that it has been started in the Ministry of 

</span><span>Health.  Added to this the programme through our schools encouraging our children to eat healthy 

</span><span>food.  Working in cooperation the Ministries of Health, Education and Agriculture in starting our 

children while they are still young on the path of good health. 

</span></div><div><span>For the few minutes of my speaking time. I would like to say thank you very much to those in the 

Ministry of Health, from the Secretary to your doctors and to all the nurses.  To all the different 

sections in the Ministry of Health as well as all the different departments that assisted during the 

pandemic and to our people in the Outer Islands for your support, thank you very much.   

</span></div><div><span>In closing, this is what we are doing tomorrow, the initiation of our nurses school.  The starting of 

</span><span>in-country training for our nurses.  Thank you to our government for supporting this and also the 

Whitireia Polytechnic in New Zealand, and WHO because these nurses will not pay any fees from

of their studies and after the three years study, a new lot of 20 intake will take place. 

</span></div><div><span>I do believe our budget is appropriate but we look for improvements in the new year.  I present 

this to the House and thank you for supporting the appropriation for Health.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister, some of the critics want to see you in the 

paper and the TV in the future rather than other Ministers.
