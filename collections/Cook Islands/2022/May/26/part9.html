<div><span>HEAD OF STATE: 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $251,206 for Head of State stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open.  I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, I have a very brief contribution to make.   

</span></div><div><span>In the past, I have always been concerned with the residence of our Head of State.  I am aware that 

any money that would be appropriated for his residence will not appear here, it would probably 

appear in the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Appropriation.   

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps I should draw to the attention of the Minister of the Head of State to ask the Minister of 

the Investment Corporation whether the land issue for the Head of Stateâ€™s land in Titikaveka is 90 

percent completed.  This is probably not the ideal time to push that barrel about a new residence 

because of our financial situation but I would like to ask the Minister to at least give it some priority 

in the future because it is quite embarrassing for a Head of State to have no Official Residence. 

</span></div><div><span>The Appropriation is  quite small  but  when  I look to  the left  on  the blurb, it says no milestone 

achievements.  We support the Appropriation. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $251,206 for Head of State stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to
