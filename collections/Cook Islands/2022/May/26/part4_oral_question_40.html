<h3>Oral Question 40</h3>
<div><span>MR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. My question is to seek clarification from the Minister 

for  Foreign  Affairs.  This  is  in  reference  to  the  status  of  PR.    My  question  is  regarding  those 

foreigners who have married locals and have been here 2 to 3 and maybe up to 10 years.  What is 

the situation with their PR application now?
