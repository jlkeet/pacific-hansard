<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>I think I should waffle a lot because waffle is something I like.  If you want 

some, you can go to the Punanga Nui and buy it from there.   

</span></div>
<div><span>But that aside I know the second event.  When I went back yesterday and tried to prepare myself 

I thought I would just check my Facebook, because I follow both political parties on Facebook and 

</span><span>I came across the Democratic Party Facebook. Low and behold, they were asking for suggestions 

</span><span>from members of the public in developing their policies.  So, Mr Speaker that concerns me because 

after four years, they are still considering their policies.
