</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings to our people listening in to our meeting this morning, the length and the breadth of our 

country, a beautiful morning to all of you as well. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to bring answers of clarifications to the issues raised by the Member of 

Parliament for Akaoa.  I provided clarifications to this colleague outside of the House and he was 

happy with the explanation, and because he was satisfied with the clarifications, I would say this 

matter is now rested before us in the House.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Associate  Minister.    I  see  the  Member  for  Ngatangiia,  Tamaiva 

Tuavera.   

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Good morning to all of you on that side and good 

morning to us on this side.  To the Clerk and your staff, I know you worked hard until this morning 

so a good morning to you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I departed this House last night downhearted and very disappointed because when the 

Leader of the Opposition made her statements last night, the Point of Order by the Minister Robert 

Tapaitau was right  but  the outburst  that came with it is  not  okay.    If only  he responded to  the 

Honourable Leader in her role as Leader of the Opposition, that is okay but when he said you and 

she that is personal.  This is my question, will he rise and apologise to the Leader of the Opposition 

for that outburst?   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Minister Robert Tapaitau; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TAPAITAU:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker.  The Member of Parliament from Ngatangiia, 

thank you for the question.  I do not see what outburst he was talking about, it was a Point of Order 

I raised like everyone else does in this House so that was what I did, Point of Order.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, I see the Minister George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and to all of the Members.  Greetings to all our 

</span><span>people listening in, watching on livestream throughout the world. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I ask my question,  I would like to  clarify my thoughts.   My question is  directed to  the 

Leader of the Opposition.  Yesterday when she made her statement, she referred to the Ministry of 

Justice and the Justices of the Peace. 

</span></div><div><span>This created a thought in my head to ask her this question.  She mentioned that these Justices of 

the  Peace  could  be  Judges  for  our  country.    This  is  then  the  question  to  you  Leader  of  the 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>Why did you consider that these JPs will be suited for the Judge position and yet you are the lawyer 

among these people and this post better suits you?  My question then is this; are you willing to 

</span></div><div><span>2 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>accept to be the first person to be a Judge for our people?  Yes, or No.  That must be the answer, 

you are not to tell another story.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to all of us this morning.  

Kia Orana to our friends in green and yellow; and to all of us on this side in blue.  Kia Orana to 

our neutral Speaker in green and yellow.   

</span></div><div><span>On this question, which follows the directive, the answer must be either yes, or no.  The answer is 

yes, or no.  You see Mr Minister, if I accept this position I doubt if the Prime Minister would accept 

me.  For two reasons, one if he does appoint me then he will have no lawyer in the court.  Secondly, 

if I become the Judge, after the general election and there are many petitions from the CIP camp, 

I will dismiss all of them </span><span>(as a joke)</span><span>. 

</span></div><div><span>So, please Minister accept my answer, yes/no.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Leader of the Opposition and I give 

you the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, in the Cook Islands new on Tuesday, I read an article 

by Petero Okotai.  In that article, he expressed his thoughts on the Members of Parliament.  To me 

this was a very interesting article.  He was identifying the work we do as Members of Parliament, 

especially  our  work  in  this  House  of  Parliament  and  including  the  work  we  do  for  our 

constituencies. 

</span></div><div><span>One of his views is the calling for Parliament sitting.  He says that we do not deserve our salary 

because we are not sitting regularly.  The only disagreement that I have with his writing is because 

he included us the Opposition in that point.  We all know that the Opposition have no say in the 

sitting schedule of Parliament. Performance appraisal 

</span></div><div><span>However,  he  gave  some  recommendation  as  to  maybe  the  Members  of  Parliament  be  paid 

</span><span>according to the number of days that Parliament sits.  Then maybe the number of sitting days will 

increase.  For example, if we sit for 50 days we are entitled to be paid our full salary and if we sit 

for less than 50 days then we should take a cut. 

</span></div><div><span>I had to say that, that idea attracted me, that way maybe there is some control over our sittings.  

</span><span>So, here is the question, what are your thoughts.  If we sit for only 10 days we get a quarter of our 

salary only and when we sit for 50 days and over, we get our full salary.  It is my belief that we 

should be considering that suggestion.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  and  I  see  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Prime Minister; you have the Floor.   

</span></div><div><span>3 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>What a great question to ask because really that question should be directed 

to the Opposition Members because on this side of the Parliament Mr Speaker, more than half of 

our team work in the Executive seven days a week. 

</span></div><div><span>In fact, our Members of Parliament here do more work outside of Parliament than inside where we 

are just sitting and talking and debating.  I think if you look at the Members of the Opposition, 

they should really question about  collecting their Parliamentary salary while they  also  work in 

their main job.  The question should be asked whether their pay should be cut. 

</span></div><div><span>Our  Cabinet  Ministers  here  Mr  Speaker  work  full  time  even  while  we  are  sitting  here  we  are 

working giving time to Members of the Opposition to have their say.  So, I am not sure whether 

the Leader of the Opposition would support that motion that proposal I should say, that if you are 

earning and working in a second job and holding a position as a Member of Parliament whether 

your pay should be cut. 

</span></div><div><span>We are all in favour of enabling more sittings of Parliament and we spent more than a year going 

through the Standing Orders to find out how we can actually make that happen.  We have identified 

that  some  of  the  constraints  had  been  the  requirement  to  maintain  a  quorum  in  Parliament  has 

always been challenged. 

</span></div><div><span>In our Parliament, you must have half of the Members in the House to maintain a quorum.  In the 

New Zealand Parliament, 120 seats there is no minimum number required for a quorum only that 

a minister must be present in Parliament.  So, it is not unusual in the New Zealand Parliament to 

find it in Session with less than 20 people sitting in the whole Parliament and our suggestions to 

enable  that  to  happen  here  were  rejected  by  the  Opposition  when  we  proposed  to  allow  proxy 

attendance  in  Parliament  to  enable  more  Sittings.    This  would  enable  government  Members  in 

particular Ministers who are part of the Executive to be able to do their duties whilst at the same 

time enabling Parliament to sit. 

</span></div><div><span>Even though that proposal was rejected, we are happy Mr Speaker that the attendance by the virtual 

attendance has been supported the Members of the Opposition. This will enable more Sittings of 

Parliament.  I am sure Mr Speaker in the future that if Members who are on travel duty from the 

government side will still be able to attend Parliament virtually.  I see that as removing one of the 

</span><span>barriers to having increased Sittings in the Parliament and we would of course have to increase the 

operating cost for enabling the Sittings of Parliament so that our Pa Enua Members would be able 

to fly more frequently to Rarotonga to attend Parliament.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the 

</span><span>Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I want to make a comment to the reply from the Prime 

Minister because he was talking about the proxy.  We all know that we are elected by our people, 

</span><span>it is not right for me to appoint the Member from RAPPA to talk on my behalf from Matavera or 

</span><span>maybe I will appoint the Minister Mokoroa from Nikao to talk on my behalf for Matavera.  That 

is the main reason we in the Opposition opposed this proxy proposal. 

</span></div><div><span>4 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>However, we do agree with the suggestion proposed by government to go on virtual.  We in the 

Opposition  supported  this  proposal  and  we  know  we  had  discussed  about  virtual  under  our 

Standing Orders.  The reason why we supported this Mr Speaker is because when you are stranded 

on Mauke and there is no flight available, then we support the idea of you going on live stream so 

we can continue with our discussions.  Even if the Prime Minister travels to Fiji, he can live stream 

back from Fiji virtually.  So, Mr Speaker I stand to show our support from the Opposition on the 

virtual discussions. 

</span></div><div><span>While I have the Floor, I have a question Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Leader of 

the Opposition.  I would like to make it known to you Mr Speaker that under our Standing Orders, 

there is no provision that provides you cannot ask questions to Members from your own side.  I 

believe this an important question because the question touches on an article in the Cook Islands 

Newspaper on page 2.  

</span></div><div><span>In  the  article,  we  will  see  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition’s  comments  supporting  </span><span>cannabis  as  a 

medicine.  In this article, the Leader of the Opposition suggested that a Referendum be given to 

our people for their opinions.  Since she agreed to give it to the community, afterwards there was 

a comment by the Prime Minister agreeing to half of the article.  When we look at the cartoon in 

here, we will see that the Leader of the Opposition has the bigger carrot.   

</span></div><div><span>The question is, can you clarify what you meant in the newspaper?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE</span><span>:  Mr Speaker, before I respond to the question, I have forgotten 

one of my thought when I spoke before.  I also forgot to raise this yesterday.  I want to thank the 

Prime Minister for what we have agreed upon yesterday on our request to go through the whole 

debate on the Appropriation Bill. I understood that you did not have to but anyway, thank you very 

much from the Opposition side to you and your Cabinet Ministers and the Members of Parliament 

on the government side.  To me that is the spirit of true unity and it is unfortunate that right towards 

the end of our Sitting we decided to unite. 

</span></div><div><span>To  respond  to  the  question  from  the  Member  for  Matavera.    Yes,  I  did  support  it  when  I  was 

interviewed by CINEWS on my views on a Referendum.  In response to CINEWS, I did say yes I 

will support that but I told them that is my own view and not that of the Democratic Party because 

</span><span>I did not have any discussions with the Party on this.  To be frank, the last say has to come from 

our people.  If our people agrees for cannabis to be legalised, then why not.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see we have come to the end of Question 

Time.
