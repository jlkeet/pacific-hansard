<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker, and Kia Orana to all of us this morning.  

Kia Orana to our friends in green and yellow; and to all of us on this side in blue.  Kia Orana to 

our neutral Speaker in green and yellow.   

</span></div>
<div><span>On this question, which follows the directive, the answer must be either yes, or no.  The answer is 

yes, or no.  You see Mr Minister, if I accept this position I doubt if the Prime Minister would accept 

me.  For two reasons, one if he does appoint me then he will have no lawyer in the court.  Secondly, 

if I become the Judge, after the general election and there are many petitions from the CIP camp, 

I will dismiss all of them </span><span>(as a joke)</span><span>. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, please Minister accept my answer, yes/no.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
