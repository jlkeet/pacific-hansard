<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>What a great question to ask because really that question should be directed 

to the Opposition Members because on this side of the Parliament Mr Speaker, more than half of 

our team work in the Executive seven days a week. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In fact, our Members of Parliament here do more work outside of Parliament than inside where we 

are just sitting and talking and debating.  I think if you look at the Members of the Opposition, 

they should really question about  collecting their Parliamentary salary while they  also  work in 

their main job.  The question should be asked whether their pay should be cut. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Our  Cabinet  Ministers  here  Mr  Speaker  work  full  time  even  while  we  are  sitting  here  we  are 

working giving time to Members of the Opposition to have their say.  So, I am not sure whether 

the Leader of the Opposition would support that motion that proposal I should say, that if you are 

earning and working in a second job and holding a position as a Member of Parliament whether 

your pay should be cut. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We are all in favour of enabling more sittings of Parliament and we spent more than a year going 

through the Standing Orders to find out how we can actually make that happen.  We have identified 

that  some  of  the  constraints  had  been  the  requirement  to  maintain  a  quorum  in  Parliament  has 

always been challenged. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In our Parliament, you must have half of the Members in the House to maintain a quorum.  In the 

New Zealand Parliament, 120 seats there is no minimum number required for a quorum only that 

a minister must be present in Parliament.  So, it is not unusual in the New Zealand Parliament to 

find it in Session with less than 20 people sitting in the whole Parliament and our suggestions to 

enable  that  to  happen  here  were  rejected  by  the  Opposition  when  we  proposed  to  allow  proxy 

attendance  in  Parliament  to  enable  more  Sittings.    This  would  enable  government  Members  in 

particular Ministers who are part of the Executive to be able to do their duties whilst at the same 

time enabling Parliament to sit. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Even though that proposal was rejected, we are happy Mr Speaker that the attendance by the virtual 

attendance has been supported the Members of the Opposition. This will enable more Sittings of 

Parliament.  I am sure Mr Speaker in the future that if Members who are on travel duty from the 

government side will still be able to attend Parliament virtually.  I see that as removing one of the 

</span><span>barriers to having increased Sittings in the Parliament and we would of course have to increase the 

operating cost for enabling the Sittings of Parliament so that our Pa Enua Members would be able 

to fly more frequently to Rarotonga to attend Parliament.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Prime Minister.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the 

</span><span>Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I want to make a comment to the reply from the Prime 

Minister because he was talking about the proxy.  We all know that we are elected by our people, 

</span><span>it is not right for me to appoint the Member from RAPPA to talk on my behalf from Matavera or 

</span><span>maybe I will appoint the Minister Mokoroa from Nikao to talk on my behalf for Matavera.  That 

is the main reason we in the Opposition opposed this proxy proposal.

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>However, we do agree with the suggestion proposed by government to go on virtual.  We in the 

Opposition  supported  this  proposal  and  we  know  we  had  discussed  about  virtual  under  our 

Standing Orders.  The reason why we supported this Mr Speaker is because when you are stranded 

on Mauke and there is no flight available, then we support the idea of you going on live stream so 

we can continue with our discussions.  Even if the Prime Minister travels to Fiji, he can live stream 

back from Fiji virtually.  So, Mr Speaker I stand to show our support from the Opposition on the 

virtual discussions. 

</span></div>
<div><span>While I have the Floor, I have a question Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Leader of 

the Opposition.  I would like to make it known to you Mr Speaker that under our Standing Orders, 

there is no provision that provides you cannot ask questions to Members from your own side.  I 

believe this an important question because the question touches on an article in the Cook Islands 

Newspaper on page 2.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In  the  article,  we  will  see  the  Leader  of  the  Oppositionâ€™s  comments  supporting  </span><span>cannabis  as  a 

medicine.  In this article, the Leader of the Opposition suggested that a Referendum be given to 

our people for their opinions.  Since she agreed to give it to the community, afterwards there was 

a comment by the Prime Minister agreeing to half of the article.  When we look at the cartoon in 

here, we will see that the Leader of the Opposition has the bigger carrot.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The question is, can you clarify what you meant in the newspaper?  Thank you.
