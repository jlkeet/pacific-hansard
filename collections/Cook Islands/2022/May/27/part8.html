<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Members, that completes the First, Second and Third 

Reading of the Ombudsman Amendment Bill 2022. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now move to our next Bill.  Criminal Justice (Validation of Parole Reappointments) Bill 

2022.  I call the Minister in Charge, Honourable George Angene, to move for the Second Reading 

</span><span>of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker. I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Criminal Justice (Validation of Parole Reappointments) Bill 2022  

be read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank Honourable Minister; you may speak if you wish to.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  In regards to this Bill, it is the reappointment of 

some people to these position.  For us in the House to be aware we have had some difficulties the 

reason we are here.  We wanted to bring an amendment to this Act in 2017 but it never happened 

until today. As you may be aware, I was not the Minister Responsible during that time and the 

Corrective Services was not a stand-alone Ministry.  The Correctives Services came under its own 

administration in 2018.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank my Secretary, Teokotai Joseph who reviewed our Act and came across the 

</span><span>difficulties in the Act.  But we know we can’t stop there we need to validate this and to move 

</span><span>forward  because  the  people  who  had  previously  been  on  this  Board  have  now  returned.    For 

example, for Teau-o-tonga, Ngata Urirau is the Member on the Board for this district.  When we 

go  to  Puaikura,  David  Akanoa  is  the  Member  and  for  Takitumu  Willie  Kauvai  is  the  Board 

Member.  They are the Members currently on the Parole Board Committee and reappointed.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker  this  not  an  easy  task  to  carry  because  it  is  this  Board  who  will  consider  whether 

prisoners can be released from prison.  This Board are required to follow certain rules and they 

need to investigate whether these prisoners are fit to be released. Therefore, I am asking my Head 

of this Ministry to look carefully into the system of payment.   

</span></div><div><span>I believe when this Bill is enacted, and maybe during this time I will ask the Secretary, Teokotai 

Joseph  and  the  Members  of  this  Board  for  them  to  accept  my  suggestion  for  a  Parole  Board 

Member to be appointed, one from the Northern Group and one from the Southern Group.  This is 

because  the  inmates  are  not  just  from  Rarotonga  but  when  these  inmates  go  before  the  Parole 

Board, the matter is deliberated and decided by the Board Members from the island of Rarotonga.  

That is the reason why I am making this proposal before this House to appoint a representative 

from the North and one from the Southern Group to be part of this Board in making decisions for 

cases that will appear before them.   

</span></div><div><span>Those are my thoughts and contribution and in support of the Bill before this House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>You, as the Seconder Honourable Member, may speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and greetings to the Secretary of the Ministry of Corrective 

</span><span>Services who is in this House, Tai Joseph.  I believe that he is doing his job well because there is 

</span><span>a  big  change  in  the  Ministry  of  Corrective  Services  today.    He  has  made  new  changes  for  the 

wellbeing of inmates and the staff of the Probation Service.   Mr Speaker, these are the sort of 

employees I want to work in the Ministry, people with new ideas and ready to put it into action.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>In regard to this Bill, this is the type of Bill that I want to be brought to this House.  If this Bill had 

come before the House in 2017, I would have supported it already but I was only elected to be a 

Member of this House in 2018.  I strongly support the recommendations that have been made. 

</span></div><div><span>I enjoyed listening to what the Minister has said because he is not playing political because when 

you  look  at  the  Members  of  this  Board,  I  see  a  supporter  of  the  Democratic  Party  and  I  see  a 

supporter of the Cook Islands Party and I also see a supporter of the United Party.  So I have no 

doubt in supporting this recommendation.  Even if their age is beyond 70, I will support it. 

</span></div><div><span>This is good governance that we see today for bringing this Bill before the House and I also support 

what the Minister Responsible for this Ministry have suggested for a Board Member to be elected 

from the North and one from the Southern Group.  I have observed these Board Members since 

their appointment in 2017 up to today.  That is why I am saying politics has not been involved in 

this.    Even  though  the  appointment  from  the  person  in  Te-Au-o-Tonga,  I  know  he  is  living  in 

Matavera and I know they strongly support me.  The important point is t that I strongly support 

the recommendations given by the Ministry Responsible for this Board. 

</span></div><div><span>I know these people being reappointed to the Board have a wide knowledge and therefore they are 

the right people to consider those who will be released from prison.  I know all these persons have 

been Deacons in the Church and even this son of ours David, he is an Elder in the Latter Day Saints 

Church.  He has the ability to apply his knowledge from the Bible.  To make my contribution short, 

I strongly support this Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I now open the Floor to Honourable Members 

to speak on the principles and merits of the Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I rise to give the comments from the 

Opposition side on this Bill.  Yes, we will support this Bill.  This Bill is to correct the appointment 

of persons to the Parole Board.   

</span></div><div><span>I heard the Minister say that the functions of the Parole Board is to watch over inmates and when 

they are eligible for parole this Board will consider if a person can be released or not.  Those are 

the functions of this Board. 

</span></div><div><span>What  they  will  consider  is  whether  the  inmate  accept  that  he  has  done  wrong  and  when  he  is 

</span><span>released, he will be good and not re-offend.  We are looking at this Bill and it is just to re-appoint 

these Members. 

</span></div><div><span>My only concern is the use of the word </span><span>‘re</span><span>-</span><span>appoint’</span><span> because my interpretation is they have already 

</span><span>been appointed and they are being re-appointed.  My understanding of this Bill is to appoint the 

</span><span>Board Members because they were not appointed in 2017.  Nevertheless, Minister there is nothing 

we can do but to follow the advice of the Crown Law Office so the Opposition support this Bill.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I now see the Honourable 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to everyone in the House.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to thank the Opposition side for supporting this Bill.  I thank your Leader, Honourable Tina 

Browne for your explanations on the name.  That is what happens when you do not listen to your 

parents when they say go to school and that is why I did not u</span><span>nderstand the word ‘re</span><span>-</span><span>appoint’.  My 

</span><span>voice will be heard at the Tauranga Vananga and I could have corrected this in our language. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to thank the Secretary, Tai Joseph for his presence in this House to listen to our debate on 

this Bill.  I believe we will not bring this Bill back to this House as we are making the correction 

now and thank you for your support. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK  AT  THE  TABLE:    </span><span>Long  Title:</span><span>An  Act  to  correct  a  failure  to  reappoint  persons  as 

members of the Parole Board during the period 1 December 2017 to 28 February 2022.
