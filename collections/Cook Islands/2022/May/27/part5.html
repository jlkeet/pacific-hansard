</span></div><div><span>Second Reading of the Ombudsman Amendment Bill 2022.  I call the Honourable Minister Vaine 

</span><span>Mokoroa on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA</span><span>:  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I move:

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>That the Ombudsman Amendment Bill 2022  

be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Minister; you may speak if you wish to. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I will just speak briefly on this Amendment but 

before doing so, I would like to say a very warm good morning to you and the staff of Parliament 

this morning. To our colleagues in blue on the other side, a very good morning to all of you and to 

the men and ladies in green and gold, good morning. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this morning we were at the Auditorium to open and congratulate the first 20 cohort 

of nurses.  I would like to congratulate the Minister of Health as well as the Secretary of Health, 

the staff of Health and all the lecturers and the teachers that will be teaching our next lot of 20 

nurses.  This is a very good indication of the development programme that is working in coincide 

with our USP and the Whitireia Polytechnic of New Zealand.  What is also interesting with this 

programme is that it is an eight year programme and there will be a minimum of about 60 nurses 

that will be developed in the next eight years.  So, congratulations Minister of Health and your 

good staff. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the amendment before us is to remove the age restriction in the existing legislation.  

Last year, we have done the same for the Police Act.  This is to enable our country to employ those 

with the experience and not to allow age as a restriction in our selective process.  So, in this House 

we all know our new Ombudswoman, Niki Rattle has taken office and would like to welcome her 

into her new position.  Mr Speaker, she has already been nominated to take over as the President 

of  the  International  Ambassadors  Federation.  This  a  very  good  indication  about  the  caliber  of 

people that we bring onboard.  

</span></div><div><span>On the same token. I would like to thank Papa Nono Tearea who have taken a quiet retirement 

from this position.  I would like to say thank you Papa Nono for taking the role in the short tenure 

that you had.  Papa Nono has been a public servant within the Ministry of Justice for 42 years and 

the position of Ombudsman will be the pinnacle of his career. 

</span></div><div><span>On those few words, I would like to ask the support of this House in this small amendment that 

</span><span>we are attending to.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown 

</span></div><div><span>You can speak if you wish to. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you, staff of this House, Clerk, 

</span><span>Deputy Clerk, Interpreters and those who provides support in this Sitting.  Greetings to our families 

</span><span>and friends who are listening over the radio or watching the live stream.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>May I have the opportunity Mr Speaker to address my people on Enuamanu.  To the three sectors 

on the island, I give you greetings and Kia Orana to you all.  To the different leaders on our island, 

the Church, the community and to our children, greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>A special greetings to the staff of Te Marae Ora on the island of Atiu, the Island Council and I 

give you my big thank you for supporting us through this time of the pandemic.  As we stand now 

we know that our people who are infected by the virus have decreased and according to our data 

there are 169 people who have had the virus and fortunately, none of our people have passed away. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to again greet and say Kia Orana to our people of Atiu here on Rarotonga, overseas 

in Australia, New Zealand and other countries in the world. 

</span></div><div><span>I come to the matter that is before this House.  I rise to give my support to this amendment.  We 

know this person who is holding this position today has served Te Marae Ora for many years in 

our country and even in this House.   

</span></div><div><span>As mentioned by the Minister for Education, the milestone that have taken place this morning for 

our children in honour of the opening of this School of Nursing that will be starting next Monday.  

Mama Niki was there to witness this milestone.  I would like to say a very big thank you to all the 

Ministers and to those who came to witness this event this morning. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to say thank the Secretary of the Ministry of Health for your hard work to make this 

possible because we have been through some difficult times during the pandemic and today we 

have seen the fruit of your hard work.  Therefore, I give my support to this Amendment before the 

House because it will allow our people not to be limited by age to serve our people.  We know her 

health, she is strong and she is able from her wisdom, intelligence, and understanding, she is able 

to provide that for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to say thank you to the Minister of Culture, to you and your daughter for making these 

garland of leis that we are wearing.  God Bless you all, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I now open the Floor to Honourable Members 

to speak on the principles and merits of this Bill.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the 

</span><span>Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and to the two Ministers who have given their support and 

for us for our consideration.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we have looked at the amendment that was brought by the Police because during that 

time we know that when you reach the age of 60, you cannot apply for a position at the Police.   

However, during that time we the Opposition agreed to make an amendment concerning the age 

of a person.  Today, we see that this is another request. 

</span></div><div><span>I have a friend Tearoa Tini, he retired because he followed the law.  We know that he has been 

holding this position in the past.  So what I will propose to the government today is that if there 

</span></div><div><span>7 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>are other laws restricting the age of our people to work, look into that and discuss it before you 

bring it to Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>We all know about the present Ombudsman, she was a Speaker of this House.  I did enjoy the way 

she controlled the Sittings in the House.  During our past Sittings, she was able to express there 

were some difficult areas for her.  We all know that one of those areas that she had problems with 

was about our Standing Orders.  As we are aware that we did not deliberate on our Standing Orders 

before but when the new Members of Parliament came into this House, we discovered some issues. 

</span></div><div><span>I  know  one  of  the  Members  of  Parliament  who  discovered  these  issues  was  the  Member  for 

Pukapuka.  We know that he is a former Solicitor General for this country so I know that he is 

fully  aware  about  the  administration  of  this.    It  has  been  proposed  to  this  House  to  make  the 

amendment to increase the age over 72.  I have no issue when we reach the age of 72 and our mind 

is still intact.  However, I do know for sure that there are some of us when we reach this age, it is 

more appropriate to retire. 

</span></div><div><span>In  2019,  we  discussed  this  issue  about  people  working  after  the  age  of  65  especially  public 

servants.  It was part of our consideration for people when they reach the age of 65 then we need 

to  investigate  whether  they  still  have  the  mental  capacity  to  continue.    This  is  one  of  the 

considerations but it was given to all of us to think about.  I know people who have come to the 

age  of  65  but  their  minds  are  still  intact  and  alert.    That  included  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; I know his mind is still active until today.  So, it is a challenge for the Member for 

Pukapuka to reach the age of 60. 

</span></div><div><span>I sympathies Mr Speaker for this request but to me we should consider this properly.  That is the 

reason  I  am  standing  we  need  to  look  at  other  regulations  and  other  areas  where  there  is  a 

requirement such as this.  That is the reason why I am standing to give my support and to share 

my thoughts to this House.   

</span></div><div><span>Even if we the Opposition are going to oppose, the government will stand to vote on it and it will 

become  law.    We  are  not  relying  on  the  requirement  for  the  two  third  majority.    So,  if  the 

government is strong in their vote then it will be passed.  Those are my thoughts and I stand to 

give my support and I really sympathize with this woman because I believe her mind is still strong 

</span><span>and intact.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker with regards to this Amendment Bill, it is right that 

last year, the Minister for Police introduced an Amendment Bill to amend the Police Act to enable 

the Minister to appoint the applicant Mr James Keenan on to the position of the Commissioner of 

Police.  At the time, we in the Opposition reviewed the application for candidates and looked at 

</span><span>the qualification for James and the fact that he is a Cook Islander.  In our consideration of that 

</span><span>Amendment Bill, we decided it is only proper for us to support the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>8 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Even though in  our policy  and the same with  everyone’s policy,  we should  support our  young 

</span><span>applicants  to  advance  into  these  higher  position  because  if  we  the  older  folks  remain  in  these 

positions, then our young people do not get the opportunity for them to advance to these higher 

positions.    If  we  consider  amendments  to  legislation  such  as  this  one,  this  is  what  is  called, 

</span><span>‘exceptions to the rule’.  All of us that have been in these higher positi</span><span>ons and those who have 

managed these positions properly, they would train and mentored younger staff to assume these 

positions when they retire.   

</span></div><div><span>When I look at this amendment Bill I am disturbed because we are looking at an age of 72 years 

and we are amending the law because as it is, when you reach the age of 72 you have to resign.  I 

do  not  support  this  Amendment  Bill.    I  do  not  support  this  Bill  because  this  is  denying  the 

opportunity for a younger person to advance. 

</span></div><div><span>If we continue this practice of amending legislations to suit certain people, then there is something 

wrong with the system.  So, my apologies Minister we do not support this Bill because we see this 

as preventing a younger person to assume and advance to these higher positions.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Tingika Elikana; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to all of us in the Name of our Lord.  To 

the Leader of the Nation, your Cabinet and all of us Members on this side of the House, greetings 

to  you  all.    To  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  all  the  Members  on  your  side  of  the  House, 

greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise Mr Speaker to give my support to the Bill because Mr Speaker we are aligning this legislation 

with the Constitution of the country.  In Clause 64 of the Constitution, we should not prevent the 

opportunity if they are of age.  The current legislation as it is states, if you reach the age of 72 

years then you are finished.  It does not specify as to the reason why when you reach the age of 

72, it just states reach the age of 72 you must retire.  I do not believe that this aligns well with the 

Constitution of the nation where it states in article 60 to the fact, let not age be an impediment to 

somebody advancing in life. 

</span></div><div><span>That is why I rise to support this Amendment Bill because some of our elders even though they 

have reached this age of 72 years, their mind is still intact and active and their performance is still 

good.  I do believe that it is really up to their performance to confirm whether they should carry 

on or whether they should retire.  This also brings it in align with the Public Service Act where 

there is no limit on age, it all depends on your performance whether you remain working or you 

</span><span>retire. 

</span></div><div><span>The main issue here Mr Speaker is to align this legislation with the Constitution of the country.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member, I see the Honourable Selina Napa; you have 

the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA: </span><span>  First, to you Mr Speaker, the Clerk, Parliament staff and all of us Honourable 

Members in this House, greeting to you all in the mighty Name of our Lord and Saviour. To our 

people listening in  by radio  and those of our people watching on live stream  from  all over the 

world, greetings to you.  This being our Kia Orana Day, the House is looking beautiful with all 

our uniforms. 

</span></div><div><span>I hear the Member for Pukapuka and Nassau giving his thoughts and those are just his thoughts.  

For me, when I read the Bill I was very discouraged like our Leader and the Member Toti.  We 

see  this  as  a  barrier  for  our  young  upcoming  qualified  Cook  Islanders  from  assuming  high 

positions.  

</span></div><div><span>When  the  Member  from  Pukapuka  mentioned  the  issue  of  Fundamental  Human  Rights  in  our 

Constitution is not to be biased against people because of their age.  I had a look in the Constitution 

and age limitation was not mentioned under Article 64.  I will read Fundamental Human Rights 

and Freedom  Article 64(1) and it says,  </span><span>“</span><span>It is  hereby recognised and declared that in  the Cook 

Islands there exist and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national 

origin,  colour,  religion,  opinion,  belief  or  sex.</span><span>”</span><span>    There  is  no  mention  of  age  and  also  the 

government side had forgotten that they introduced a Bill into the House regarding the retirement 

age of Justices of Peace to be at 70 years.  So, what is the difference that our Justices of the Peace 

retires at 70 years and the Ombudsman continue working till death.  

</span></div><div><span>Another Bill that came into the House was to inc</span><span>rease the Ombudsman’s salary from $75,000 to 

</span><span>$90,000 and as well as the increment to other areas like allowance, perks, transportation and yet 

at that age she is collecting a pension of $700 a month.  I want to know whether she is paying her 

pension taxes on top of her salary. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Personal  attacks  on  members  of  the  public.    Querying  whether  they  are 

paying their rightful tax is totally inappropriate and the Member should be ashamed of herself for 

her conduct in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you Honourable Prime Minister.   I  would like  to  ask the Member to 

refrain from those personal attacks. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Now coming back to the Bill and not forgetting previous 

</span><span>Bills  passed in  the House involving this individual  now holding the Office of the Ombudsman 

</span><span>position.  For this position, we have so many qualified upcoming Cook Islanders so why don’t we 

</span><span>return them back to assume this position.  I join with my colleagues in not supporting this Bill and 

it should be reconsidered.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member. I see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; 

you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR  W.  HEATHER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  present  my  thoughts  on  our 

discussions  in  the  House.    My  comment  is  to  question  whether  a  younger  able  qualified  Cook 

Islander from within the Cook Islands or a Cook Islander from abroad has been considered for this 

position.  The spirit here is if this has been done and someone was identified, then why not give 

them the first opportunity as our Leader previously mentioned.  

</span></div><div><span>My  comment  is  not  against  this  mama,  we  all  know  how  capable  she  is  but  the  spirit  here  is 

replacing the aged.  Mr Prime Minister, there are young and upcoming qualified Cook Islander to 

assume this position. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN</span><span>:  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I see we are nearly coming to the break if I can do 

my speech after the break because I do not want my speech to be interrupted.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Honourable Members, it is now time for our break.  Parliament will suspend 

until 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.26 a.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 12.02 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Before we suspended Parliament, the Honourable Prime Minister had the Floor 

and now you can continue Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:   </span><span>Thank  you Mr Speaker.   I rise simply to  suggest  that  you  call the other 

Members so that I could speak afterwards but I will take my time to speak on this Bill after the 

other Members have spoken. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I see the Honourable Associate Minister, Albert Nicholas you have the Floor.   

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I will keep my comments very brief so the others 

</span><span>may  have  an  opportunity  to  speak.    My  views  Mr  Speaker,  the  original  Act  seems  to  be 

discriminatory.  The original Act seems to discriminate against an individual simply because of 

</span><span>one’s age.  The fact that the Honourable Minister has brought t</span><span>his to the House in my view is 

probably the best thing to do. 

</span></div><div><span>I simply believe Mr Speaker that one should not be judged by one’s age but rather by one’s ability, 

wisdom  and  experience  and  I  don’t  think  anyone  can  dispute  the  fact  that  the  current 

</span><span>Ombudswoman fit the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>So  to  hear  the  views  of  the  Opposition  in  my  view  was  discriminating  against  this  individual 

</span><span>particularly because of her age.  As I alluded to earlier, Mr Speaker one should not be deprived of 

</span><span>any opportunity simply because of one’s age but rather on one’s ability, one’s experience and one’s 

</span></div><div><span>11 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>wisdom.  So the fact that we are removing this Clause from the Act, it is in my view the right thing 

to do.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Minister Patrick Arioka; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. ARIOKA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to everyone in this House.  The Leader 

of  the  Opposition  and  your  team,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all,  we  on  the  government  side,  Cabinet 

Ministers and all Members, Kia Orana in the Name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to  you Mr Speaker and the staff of Parliament under your management for the hard 

work that you are doing through the days that we have come through.  Kia Orana to our people 

who are listening in from the Pa Enua, in New Zealand and Australia as well as here on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>I think it is a good thing that they are listening to our debate on this particular Bill because I think 

just listening to the comments raised by our Opposition, it concerns me in a very, very big way.  

Maybe  the  spirit  is  </span><span>in  the  right  place  but  I  don’t  think  the  heart  is  in  the  right  place  because 

</span><span>sometimes we continue to talk about draconian laws that needs to be reformed and this Amendment 

Bill, Mr Speaker allows us to give opportunities for our people to continue on in that service.  I 

think if they were in Government this Bill would have been brought to this House, and if they say 

no, that is because they do not know exactly what is happening in our labour force today. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  wholeheartedly  agree  with  the  point  that  was  raised  by  the  Honourable  Albert 

Nicholas.  I think they are confusing themselves with the position or the person who is holding it.  

It is not about the person who is holding the position but the integrity of the position that needs to 

be held.  Regardless of what it is, Mr Speaker our policy is always clear, we are for our young 

people growing up into the ranks but we need to make sure that those people who climbs up those 

ranks increases experience and credibility to their career. 

</span></div><div><span>I think Mr Speaker our people are feeling sad out there hearing from the Opposition discriminating 

by age.  The point Mr Speaker is, this kind of position need people that have good standing and 

capability to uphold the integrity of the Organisation and I think if this is not in our Constitution 

then it needs to be. 

</span></div><div><span>The current Ombudswoman has a very strong standing in our community and our civil society and 

I have to say in this Honourable House when that position was made vacant we had a list of people 

who wanted to take up that responsibility.  I can confirm that I had other preferred person that I 

wanted to take that position.  So the merits and the quality of the person was debated quite strongly 

</span><span>in Cabinet to see who has the strongest integrity to hold this Office. 

</span></div><div><span>So I ask the Opposition please don’t attack the person but focus our issues and concerns on how 

</span><span>this Office needs to uphold the integrity of its operations in the work it does.  I think maybe we 

</span><span>should restrict the age for Members of Parliament in this House and if we are going to apply this 

</span><span>then let us apply it here first.  Again, the point Mr Speaker is we are discriminating age as if it is a 

barrier, it is a disease that we are going to be caught in. 

</span></div><div><span>12 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>I can hear the comments and grandstanding but let me make the point very clear.  Mr Speaker, 

recently we have a young expert that left us at a very young age.  He was one of the most inspiring 

expert of our biodiversity here in the Cook Islands that has a long future ahead of him to hold the 

good work of Natural Heritage Biodiversity Cook Islands.  So immediately, Mr Speaker he was to 

become the future of the Cook Islands in terms of knowing our natural fauna and flora of the Cook 

Islands.  So he had years ahead of himself and he was absorbed in all the knowledge and experience 

from our good expert botanist, Gerald McCormick and it is those kind of people Mr Speaker that 

we cannot disregard but to have value to continue contributing to our economy and our country.  

</span></div><div><span>You know my good friend Dr. Matairangi Purea is also part of this group, he has been called the 

encyclopedia of food crops and production here in the Cook Islands and the Pacific and around the 

world.  Again, these are people who has immense knowledge and experience of agriculture and 

horticulture science here in the Cook Islands.  I think it is the duty of this Honourable House to 

ensure the continuation of that knowledge and experience has blended well with the young ones 

coming up into their generation. 

</span></div><div><span>It’s not about qualification and experien</span><span>ce but more the ability to uphold the integrity of the office 

that they hold.  That is the great responsibility and sacrifice that they have to continue before they 

retire gracefully into our society. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker I stand to support this Bill, the Honourable Members of this House would also 

support this great  Bill that allows our people to reach beyond their time before they gracefully 

retire into society.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister, I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  This morning I was grateful listening to the Leader 

of the Opposition commending the unity that we showed in our work yesterday.  On top of that I 

was even more encouraged when I read in the Cook Islands newspaper her thoughts on the issue 

of referendum for cannabis in the Cook Islands.  However, this morning when we debated this Bill 

my heart was very disappointed listening to their comments of this Amendment Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, if we look  at  this, this is  an anachronism in  all legislation  where we discriminate 

against the person.  Our Public Service removed these discriminatory clauses within the public 

service in terms of employing people and removed any reference to compulsory retirement when 

you reach 60 years old. 

</span></div><div><span>These were words that were passed last century at a time when greater awareness of removing 

discrimination  within  our  society  was  not  really  apparent.    It  was  not  that  many  years  ago  Mr 

Speaker that the average life expectancy of Cook Islanders were less than 50 years old.  Of course, 

today the life expectancy of people has increased significantly with men I believe at 70 years of 

</span><span>age and women at 74 years of age, which means we are living longer, and more productive lives.   

</span></div><div><span>I  find  it  curious  Mr  Speaker  that  last  year  the  Opposition  supported  the  removal  of  the  age 

restriction from the Police Act but this year they do not support the removal from the Ombudsman

</span></div><div><span>Act.  I can only surmise Mr Speaker that from what I hear from comments of certain Members of 

the Opposition this seems to be more of a personal issue rather that a policy issue.  Disagreeing 

with the salary that the Ombudsman is paid, querying whether they are being taxed properly.  These 

are personal issues. 

</span></div><div><span>To me Mr Speaker we are so good being bias against our own people.  It was not that long ago Mr 

Speaker  all  senior  positions  in  the  public  service  were  held  by  expatriates  and  we  spent 

considerable efforts over the years Mr Speaker to localise as many of our positions as we can.  This 

</span><span>position  of  Ombudsman  Mr  Speaker  has  always  been  filled  by  a  local  and  the  Ombudsman’s 

</span><span>position is a very important one as part of our governance. 

</span></div><div><span>It requires a person to exercise a level of judgment because they are almost acting like a Judge.  

Judgment and ability to provide good care for judgment Mr Speaker comes with experience.  So, 

while the Opposition wants to impose an age restriction on anybody who holds the Ombudsman 

position at the other end of the spectrum they want to put a young person in the job. 

</span></div><div><span>It sounds like the qualifying criteria for this job if the Opposition was to appoint is, you have to be 

</span><span>young.  Fortunately, the governments’ application of the qualifications for a person for this job is 

</span><span>you  have  to  be  able,  we  have  demonstrated  that  in  the  appointment  of  senior  public  service 

positions within the government, and these people are not only able, some of them are young and 

some of them are mature. 

</span></div><div><span>So, it will be the job of this Parliament and certainly it will be part of the work of this government 

that if we do find clauses within existing legislation that apply discrimination on the basis of age 

they  will  be  removed.    I  do  not  believe  there  is  an  age  restriction  on  High  Court  Judges,  for 

example, but I believe there is one age restriction on Justices of the Peace.  This Mr Speaker I 

would find to be a piece of legislation that offends our policy of non-discrimination against age.  

</span><span>So, nobody should be discriminated now because of their age, if anything a person’s abi</span><span>lity to be 

able to do the job should be the main overriding consideration. 

</span></div><div><span>There is no doubt our current Ombudsman is doing a fantastic job in just a short time she has been 

</span><span>in the office.  The Cook Islands is a member of the International Ombudsman’s Ins</span><span>titute; this is an 

international organization of Ombudsman from around the world.  Just last week, I signed off a 

</span><span>letter for our Ombudsman to support an application by the International Ombudsman’s Institute to 

</span><span>be granted observers status at the United Nation. 

</span></div><div><span>Already, our current Ombudsman has reached out to establish this strong network required to build 

our Ombudsman Office with the likes of the New Zealand Ombudsman. However, lending our 

</span><span>voice  to  the  International  Ombudsman  Institute  Mr  Speaker  in  this  application  for  Permanent 

Observers status of the UN just further adds status to our own Ombudsman Office. 

</span></div><div><span>This current Ombudsman Act was enacted in 1984 Mr Speaker.  Nearly 40 years ago, and I know 

</span><span>the current Ombudsman is now actively looking to review this dated to modernize our Ombudsman 

</span><span>Office. So I stand before the House Mr Speaker to commend this Amendment to the Ombudsman 

Act to remove this offending discriminatory clause.  It is disappointing that the Members of the 

Opposition supports the discrimination of people being employed based on their age.  We are not

</span></div><div><span>a big country Mr Speaker with millions of people that we can choose from to do certain work.  We 

must  look  to  what  we  have  and  removing  these  barriers  to  entry  Mr  Speaker  is  a  big  part  of 

expanding our pool of available qualified Cook Islanders to hold senior posts.   

</span></div><div><span>With those words Mr Speaker, I commend the Bill before the House.
