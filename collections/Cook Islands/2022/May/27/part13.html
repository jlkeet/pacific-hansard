</span></div><div><span>I recognise the Leader of the House on the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Orders 65 (3) (c) be suspended to allow the House  

to proceed with Consideration of Papers 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Leader of the House.  I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is:

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members we will now go to Consideration of Papers.  I will call the number of each 

Paper  and  the  title  and  any  Member  who  wishes  to  debate  any  Paper  move  that  the  Paper  be 

received and speak to the Paper.  If no motion with respect to any Paper is called on, it shall be 

dropped from the Order Paper.   

</span></div><div><span>We will now start. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 115: 

</span></div><div><span>Ministerial Statement by the Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 111: 

</span></div><div><span>Report on a review of the Standing Orders. 

</span></div><div><span>I  recognise  the  Honourable  Tingika  Elikana,  Deputy  Chairman  of  the  Standing  Orders  Select 

Committee; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No. 111 be received 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may speak Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  We in this House know that this Paper is the Report of the Standing Orders 

Committee elected by this Honourable House to review the Standing Orders, the rules of running 

Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  go  through  the  statements  in  this  Report,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Members  of  this 

Standing Orders Committee.  It is appropriate for me to remind us all who are the hard working 

Members of this Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>The Chairman of this Committee is the current Speaker of Parliament and assisting him as Deputy 

</span><span>Chairman is the Member for Pukapuka/Nassau.  On this Committee also is the Prime Minister, 

Mark Brown, the Leader of the Opposition, Tina Browne, Minister Vainetutai Rose Toki-Brown 

and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, William Heather. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like Mr Speaker to offer my thanks to those who were involved in the review of the 

</span><span>Standing Orders of this time however, they are no longer here.   My thanks to Nikki Rattle, our 

former Speaker of Parliament and our former Prime Minister, the Honourable Henry Puna as well 

as the Deputy Prime Minister, Honourable Robert Tapaitau and also the Member of Parliament 

from Aitutaki, Honourable Terepai Maoate.  

</span></div><div><span>It is only appropriate for me to offer words of thanks to all the staff of Parliament Services because 

it was them that provided the support to this Committee to carry out its task.   From the Clerk, 

Tangata  Vainerere,  Deputy  Clerk,  Tai  Manavaroa,  Secretary  of  the  Committee,  Margaret 

</span></div><div><span>23 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Numanga, Technical Operations, Unuia Unuia and the Executive Assistance to the Speaker, Janet 

Browne.  

</span></div><div><span>On top of that Mr Speaker a big thank you to those from outside of our country that assisted this 

project, the adviser to this Committee, Mrs Debra Angus from New Zealand. We all know the 

significant amount of input to carry out the progress of this big work.  Together with this is the 

funding support from the ADB through Mr Jean-Raphael.  That Mr Speaker are the people fitting 

to be thanked for the work and the production of this Report to be placed before Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>Before I go further into the Report, it is also appropriate for me to offer my thanks to the staff in 

the Hansard unit for recording all the terminologies that ended up in this Report.  To our friend 

Papaterai  Williams  and  your  colleagues,  I  cannot  understand  how  you  are  able  to  capture  our 

discussions and produce it in this Report.  I would also like to correct a statement I made before, 

sorry, the assistance for funding the project was not by the ADB but it was provided by UNDP.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in the Report there are so many areas that were looked at by the Committee. Some 

sections were deleted that we were used to and sections were amended to be appropriated to today.  

I will not elaborate on the whole of the Report maybe some colleagues will rise and offer some 

comments on the Report.  I would just like to focus on three main important parts.  

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, the inclusion and participation through virtual discussions. We see this as being included 

in number 53 and towards the end. This is a new stepping-stone within Parliament Mr Speaker, 

and through this stepping-stone as mentioned by others before, we will then be able to increase the 

Sittings of Parliament.  Although a Member is stranded on your own island or you have travelled 

overseas to represent the Nation, in this new rules and the running of our Parliament, you are able 

to participate through virtual discussions to be in line with the new rules of Parliament to state that 

your presence is here in Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>Like what I have said before, we will be able to increase our Sittings of Parliament into the future 

because we all know one of the difficulties for us to participate in Parliament is making quorum in 

Parliament.  What we then have created is the opportunity to still participate so there are no excuses 

that we are not able to participate in Parliament.  This fits with the comments made by the Member 

of  Parliament  for  Titikaveka  yesterday  that  the  time  has  come  we  will  be  able  to  establish  a 

</span><span>calendar of Sittings for our Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>The second part I would like to elaborate on Mr Speaker, and we will see this in number 28 on the 

Report regarding the Code of Conduct.  We can see this is a new addition to our Standing Orders 

because the previous Standing Orders did not have this provision. Therefore, through the inclusion 

</span><span>of this Code of Conduct, we are on par with the expectations of our people in knowing that conduct 

in this House will be respectable. A request to all of us to please take the time to read the Code of 

Conduct so it will not affect you negatively. 

</span></div><div><span>The third part I would like to talk upon regarding the Report Mr Speaker is the submissions to 

</span><span>Parliament or Petitions to Parliament.  As we have known that we have received some Petitions 

from the public to Parliament and in particular the case to do with water.  We saw the difficulties 

in the deliberations in this House regarding what is actually the procedures for this. As we know, 

</span></div><div><span>24 

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>the process was through the debating of the Members of Parliament and regardless of your Petition, 

if government does not accept it, it would not proceed further.   

</span></div><div><span>We will see the new rules that this area has been changed. If a Petition is lodged in Parliament, it 

will not go through voting and if the Clerk reviews that it is appropriate then this Petition will go 

straight to the Committee and the Committee will review the Petition.   

</span></div><div><span>As we have seen in one of the last Petitions, it will require voting and support by government to 

proceed  but  this  new  arrangement  it  will  not  go  through  this  channel.    It  depends  on  the 

consideration of the Clerk and then it may go to a Committee.   

</span></div><div><span>Those are the three main points I would like to discuss.  There are others and we all know and 

these will come to light.   

</span></div><div><span>I place the Report of the Committee before Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>I now open the Floor to speakers.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I rise in support of the Report that is tabled before 

the House.   

</span></div><div><span>The Standing Orders of Parliament have not been reviewed for a number of years and in fact, the 

review  of  the  Report  commenced  before  COVID  hit  our  country  and  the  Standing  Orders  are 

essentially the rules of how Parliament conducts its business. 

</span></div><div><span>As I mentioned earlier, Mr Speaker one of the major areas that we wanted to improve was to enable 

more sittings of Parliament but the rules around maintaining a quorum within Parliament, coupled 

with a fact that we have a small Parliament in comparison to many other countries, meant that 

regular Sittings of Parliament were difficult to achieve. 

</span></div><div><span>One only need to go back to 1965 when this Parliament was first conceived and to see that the 

number of Parliamentary Sittings over the last 55 years, Mr Speaker were very modest every year.  

During the Democratic time, it was the same thing so it is very timely that we took time out to 

review the Standing Orders to come up with something that would suit our unique Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>By the very nature of the number of seats, 24 with 12 being the split or 13 being a clear majority.  

On our side of the House, more than half our Members are engaged in the Executive running of 

our government as Ministers or Associate Ministers.  Alternatively, in your case Mr Speaker, as a 

</span></div><div><span>25 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Speaker within Parliament,  your number is  not  even counted in  our quorum  which adds to  the 

difficulty of one of the aspects of the rules of Parliament which is maintaining a quorum. 

</span></div><div><span>So right now, Mr Speaker with you sitting in the Speaker’s Chair t</span><span>he numbers of the government 

side here are twelve.  Certainly, still a majority over the eleven on the Opposition side but more 

importantly the minimum quorum required for Parliament.  So when a Minister or an Associate 

Minister is called to duty and is not here in the country, it can at times be very difficult to convene 

a Parliament Sitting with confidence knowing that you have sufficient numbers for a quorum or 

for a majority.   

</span></div><div><span>We know that the nature of our Parliaments, not just today but going back in the past years, our 

Parliaments  are  very  competitive  and  can  be  very  combative.    It  is  not  unknown  to  us  for  the 

Members of the Opposition to vacate their seats and leave Parliament and if our numbers are below 

the quorum, it renders the Parliament then invalid. 

</span></div><div><span>Our suggestion to introduce proxies into the Standing Orders is to allow us to meet the quorum 

numbers  and  allow  Parliament  to  conduct  its  business  was  one  proposal  that  we  put  through.  

However, to have that in place, Mr Speaker would have required a Constitutional amendment in 

recognising or amending what would be regarded as a presence of a Member in Parliament but of 

course without the support of our cross bench Members, that proposal would never move ahead. 

</span></div><div><span>With the advent of COVID, Mr Speaker everybody suddenly became an expert on zoom meetings 

and attendance through virtual means and we have seen Parliaments now throughout the Pacific 

and  also  New  Zealand  allow  the  use  of  virtual  participation  in  Official  Parliament  Sittings. 

Therefore, I am very happy that we have reached agreement that virtual Sittings will be recognised 

by this Parliament in the new rules of the Standing Orders that we will look to adopt today.   I 

would say, Mr Speaker that this will go a long way to allow Parliament to enable more sittings of 

the House.  So when any Member of Parliament or Cabinet Ministers in particular maybe off the 

islands they would still be able to attend Parliament through a virtual Sitting.   

</span></div><div><span>Of course there are technical issues that need to be addressed in making this happen but I have no 

doubt Mr Speaker that those can be overcome and we would expect to see some of our Members 

with a screen showing their presence where they may be on the other side of the world. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, this is certainly a step in the right direction and one that I know the Members of the 

government side certainly welcome. 

</span></div><div><span>The  establishment  of  a  Business  Committee  to  determine  the  business  of  Parliament  also,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker is a move to modernise the operations of Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>With those words, Mr Speaker I stand in support of this Report. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>26 

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Sorry, my apologies, I see the Honourable Tina Browne; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  I  must  say  that  I  am  very  pleased  with  the  result  or  the  outcome  of  the  review  of  the 

Standing Orders.  For new Members like us, coming into Parliament and trying to navigate the old 

Standing Orders, which was a real challenge.  One of the driving forces behind the review was to 

try to have them in particular categories so that it makes it easier for Members of Parliament to 

navigate. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  the  language  that  was  used  was  made  simpler  so  that  Members  of  Parliament  could 

understand what the Standing Orders are all about.   

</span></div><div><span>Third, it was to reduce unnecessary detail that was in the old Standing Orders.  It was also to re-

organise the Committees so that everything, the establishment and what the Committees do are 

placed in one chapter.  It was quite interesting being a Member of the Select Committee with the 

assistance of the consultant Debra Angus.  I came to realise that some of the process that we were 

adopting  in  Parliament  were  actually  not  correct  and  maybe  some  of  our  interpretation  of  the 

Standing Orders were also not correct.   

</span></div><div><span>For example, every Bill that came into the House and we wanted to refer it to a Select Committee, 

immediately the House appointments a Select Committee for that Bill.  Under the new rules they 

all go to a Bills Committee and the Bills Committee decides whether a Select Committee should 

be appointed or not. 

</span></div><div><span>And of course, we did not know any better, we just move a motion and everybody supported it and 

the Committee is selected and off we go.  Both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Chairman of 

the Select Committee have covered some areas in the new Standing Orders.  I too want to deal 

only with some aspects.   

</span></div><div><span>Many of the suggestions by the consultant I think we all agreed.  There were however a few areas 

</span><span>that  there  was  much  debate  about.    One  of  the  areas  there  was  much  discussion  on  was  the 

suspension of the Standing Order and we know that almost every Parliament there is a motion to 

suspend the Standing Orders but really because Bills are tabled late. 

</span></div><div><span>So, in the discussions we had in the Select Committee, we found the answer in the actual calling 

</span><span>of Parliament and when Bills should be tabled.  The agreement was that the Bills should be tabled 

much earlier so that there is no need to suspend the Standing Orders.  There was much discussion 

on that because that also was linked with trying to get a calendar for Parliament Sitting. 

</span></div><div><span>In the new Standing Orders, we see that as Standing Order 38, and this is another area where it 

</span><span>was agreed that a Business Committee must be established made up of Members of both sides 

whose role is to discuss and agree on a calendar.  We see in Standing Orders 38, and of course, the 

Sitting Calendar will sling to the virtual sitting and the suggestion by government for proxy votes 

</span></div><div><span>27 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Now, the Opposition had no problem with virtual sittings that was agreed right at the start.  We 

did however have a problem with proxy votes and our concern was adequately explained by the 

Member of Parliament from Matavera earlier on this morning. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, we were of the view that appointment of proxies was unconstitutional.  We had also 

indicated that early in the piece in our deliberations in the Select Committee. 

</span></div><div><span>Eventually, Crown Law was asked for an opinion as to whether or not it was Constitutional or not.  

They gave two opinions, one, on proxies and also on virtual sittings.  The legal opinion said, yes 

being  present  in  Parliament  virtually  is  Constitutional.    However,  they  also  opined  that  being 

present in Parliament by proxy was unconstitutional and that is why appointments of proxies is not 

in the Standing Orders, the new ones. 

</span></div><div><span>As the Member for Matavera has mentioned, our voters could have anticipated that they vote for 

you and then you go and appoint someone else to speak for them.  However, I think I should also 

mention that the opinion from the Crown Law office with regard to virtual participation, I think 

the Crown Law also sent out a little wording signal that maybe in their opinion could be wrong.  

If tested in court that court may put a different interpretation on it. 

</span></div><div><span>It maybe something that government would consider because the Opposition had indicated also at 

our  Select  Committee  meetings  that  a  Constitutional  change  put  it  beyond  doubt  would  be 

supported by the Opposition.  I also want to make a very brief comment on the Code of Conduct.  

I just wanted to let people know that the Standing Orders Committee worked really hard.  I think 

we only had three meetings and it was all done. 

</span></div><div><span>I think you heard our Chairman report on the Code of Conduct last year.  Therefore, the Opposition 

supports the new Standing Orders and given that it will be much, much easier to navigate.  It will 

be very helpful for all the new Members in the new Parliament.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I see the Honourable Tingika 

Elikana. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  ELIKANA:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  stand  to  correct  an  error  I  made  on  the 

commencement of the new Standing Order.  They will come into force on the 1</span><span>st</span><span> of July 2022.  

Meaning  the  next  Parliament  or  whenever  that  might  be,  will  be  governed  by  these  Standing 

Orders.  So I urged the Members to familiarise yourselves with the new Standing Orders. Thank 

you.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Report of the Public Accounts Committee Report on the 

Review of the Appropriation 2022/23, be adopted 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, you may continue with your speech if you want to. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Before I give my comments, I would like to thank this Committee for their 

hard  work  in  preparing  this  Report.    Thank  you  to  the  Committee  Secretariat,  Mrs  Margret 

Numanga, Clerk Tangata Vainerere and staff of Parliament for their contribution. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we might question my Motion for moving this Report, but it was because that we had 

just completed the enactment of the Appropriation Act 2022/23.  Mr Speaker, those thoughts are 

okay, however, there are parts in this Report that we, the Committee, felt that we need to elaborate 

to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>We will see when we read the Report, the Committee had no issues with our Appropriation.  On 

the allocations, the Committee have no issues as it is appropriate under the law.  However, there 

are  areas  the  Committee  were  a  little  bit  concerned  which  they  asked  me  to  present  this  to 

Parliament.  The Committee would like to offer some recommendations for the future.  This is 

regarding the presentation of the Bill to the House as well as the other information, the Regulations 

and the Schedules. 

</span></div><div><span>We will see this in Part 8 of the Report.  We see there when we read the little bit of concern by the 

Committee, the concern was that in past years, the complete Appropriation for the Ministries were 

not presented to the Committee pursuant to 8.4 of the Public Service Manual as well as according 

to the Sections 26 and 28 of the Public Expenditure Act of 95/96. 

</span></div><div><span>Another concern of the Committee is about the reporting by the State Owned Enterprises.  The 

Committee would like to highlight to the SOEs to follow Section 16 of the Cook Islands Investment 

Corporation Act 1998 because according to the Committee through this they will work very hard 

into the future to ensure that the total expenditure by the Agencies of government will be made 

known to the public.   

</span></div><div><span>That is all I have to say but I am sure other Members will speak to this Report. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open for you but I have to interrupt you as it is now time for afternoon break and once 

we come back, we will let you to continue.   

</span></div><div><span>Sorry Honourable Members, there is a slight change to our programme for this time.   

</span></div><div><span>I will call the Honourable Leader of the House.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament is extended until all business of the House is disposed of 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I am sorry, Honourable Members there’s no break for us.  I call </span><span>the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for granting me the time to speak.   

</span></div><div><span>First, I would like to give my appreciation to the Chairman of this Committee because he worked 

hard to go through the proposals and the recommendations for this.  He was fortunate he had very 

good support.  We helped him, supported him to move this work forward. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  talk  about  the  difficulties  he  mentioned  in  this  process.    I  do  believe,  Mr 

Speaker that this can be rectified.  He mentioned the difficulty of the Reports reaching Parliament 

because Mr Speaker before me is the Annual Report for the Public Service Commission from the 

year 2020. 

</span></div><div><span>Within this Report is the Summary for all the Ministries.  It did not detail what is happening in the 

Ministries.  That is why I support the notion that if all these agencies of government submit their 

report to the Public Service, they should also submit it to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>As  mentioned,  I  would  like  to  elaborate  also  that  this  should  include  also  our  Island 

Administrations.  A significant amount of funds has been placed in their controls in the EOs on all 

</span><span>the Islands.  I do know they are submitting their Report to the Division of the Outer Islands at the 

Office of the Prime Minister.   If they  submit  their Report  </span><span>to  the Prime  Minister’s Office, they 

</span><span>should also submit Reports to Parliament to give us an idea what is happening in the Outer Islands.  

We also know over the last four years we have come, there were some difficulties relating to the 

financial management of the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The problem with us is that it is only afterwards that we learnt about these difficulties.  If only 

their Report that is submitted to the Division of the Outer Islands at the Prime Ministe</span><span>r’s Office is 

</span><span>also copied to us, then we will have ample notice of all the problems in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>To the same extent, Mr Speaker for us to receive Reports from the State Owned Enterprises.  As 

explained  by  the  Chairman  and  Member  of  Parliament  for  Pukapuka  especially  regarding  our 

</span></div><div><span>33 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Appropriation managed by the Ministry of Finance and this will serve to give us more in-depth 

knowledge into the financial management of these State Owned Enterprises. 

</span></div><div><span>The Chairman also commented on the operation of Cook Islands Investment Corporation. Under 

their  Legislation,  they  are  obliged  to  produce  a  Report  to  Parliament.    So  this  is  a  word  of 

encouragement to the Ministers, those who are looking after the management of these departments.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  when  you  look  at  this  Public  Service  Report  from  2020,  you  just  look  at  the 

introduction of the Report and you will find a </span><span>“yes”.</span><span>  There is no </span><span>“no”</span><span> or </span><span>“if”</span><span>.  When we receive 

the Reports from the various departments, we will be able to determine if there is a </span><span>“no”</span><span> or maybe 

an </span><span>“if”</span><span> and so forth. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I lend my full support to this Report.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 140:  

</span></div><div><span>Financial Statement Appropriation Bill 2022/23.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of Papers for Consideration.  We have now come 

to the end of our business for today and I call upon the Leader of the House, to move a Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament do now adjourn </span><span>Sine Die</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the House.  I will call for a Seconder to the 

Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is now adjourned </span><span>Sine Die</span><span>.  May I ask the last Honourable Member into the House to 

</span><span>say our Closing Prayer?
