<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE</span><span>:  Mr Speaker, before I respond to the question, I have forgotten 

one of my thought when I spoke before.  I also forgot to raise this yesterday.  I want to thank the 

Prime Minister for what we have agreed upon yesterday on our request to go through the whole 

debate on the Appropriation Bill. I understood that you did not have to but anyway, thank you very 

much from the Opposition side to you and your Cabinet Ministers and the Members of Parliament 

on the government side.  To me that is the spirit of true unity and it is unfortunate that right towards 

the end of our Sitting we decided to unite. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To  respond  to  the  question  from  the  Member  for  Matavera.    Yes,  I  did  support  it  when  I  was 

interviewed by CINEWS on my views on a Referendum.  In response to CINEWS, I did say yes I 

will support that but I told them that is my own view and not that of the Democratic Party because 

</span><span>I did not have any discussions with the Party on this.  To be frank, the last say has to come from 

our people.  If our people agrees for cannabis to be legalised, then why not.  Thank you.
