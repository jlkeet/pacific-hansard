<h3>Oral Question 10</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWN:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, in the Cook Islands new on Tuesday, I read an article 

by Petero Okotai.  In that article, he expressed his thoughts on the Members of Parliament.  To me 

this was a very interesting article.  He was identifying the work we do as Members of Parliament, 

especially  our  work  in  this  House  of  Parliament  and  including  the  work  we  do  for  our 

constituencies. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One of his views is the calling for Parliament sitting.  He says that we do not deserve our salary 

because we are not sitting regularly.  The only disagreement that I have with his writing is because 

he included us the Opposition in that point.  We all know that the Opposition have no say in the 

sitting schedule of Parliament. Performance appraisal 

</span></div>
<div><span>However,  he  gave  some  recommendation  as  to  maybe  the  Members  of  Parliament  be  paid 

</span><span>according to the number of days that Parliament sits.  Then maybe the number of sitting days will 

increase.  For example, if we sit for 50 days we are entitled to be paid our full salary and if we sit 

for less than 50 days then we should take a cut. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I had to say that, that idea attracted me, that way maybe there is some control over our sittings.  

</span><span>So, here is the question, what are your thoughts.  If we sit for only 10 days we get a quarter of our 

salary only and when we sit for 50 days and over, we get our full salary.  It is my belief that we 

should be considering that suggestion.  

</span></div>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  and  I  see  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Prime Minister; you have the Floor.
