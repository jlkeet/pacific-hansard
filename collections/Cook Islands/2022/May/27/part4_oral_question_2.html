<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Good morning to all of you on that side and good 

morning to us on this side.  To the Clerk and your staff, I know you worked hard until this morning 

so a good morning to you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I departed this House last night downhearted and very disappointed because when the 

Leader of the Opposition made her statements last night, the Point of Order by the Minister Robert 

Tapaitau was right  but  the outburst  that came with it is  not  okay.    If only  he responded to  the 

Honourable Leader in her role as Leader of the Opposition, that is okay but when he said you and 

she that is personal.  This is my question, will he rise and apologise to the Leader of the Opposition 

for that outburst?
