<h3>Oral Question 22</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN</span><span>:  Thank you to the Honourable Member from Matavera for the question. </span><span>I 

think it is appropriate for me to go and do some investigation of this area as you have mentioned, 

the removal of these trees have caused the walls to crumble down.  So, it is appropriate I look into 

this  and  have  our  government  workers  look  at  areas  in  beautifying  this  place.    I  want  you 

Honourable  Member  to  know  that  while  doing  these  things  I  do  not  want  any  negative 

repercussions especially during these times. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, I will be seeking advice from engineers and also the lawyer for advice so as not to break any 

rules. 

</span></div>
