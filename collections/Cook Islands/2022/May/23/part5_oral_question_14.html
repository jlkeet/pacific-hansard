<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thanky you to the Honourable Member.  Yes, I 

can indicate that we are looking to sit for the whole of this week, Monday to Friday and I have 

also indicated to the Opposition that we will be looking for extended sittings of Parliament so that 

we can start at 10.00 a.m. and finish at 5.00 p.m.  This is to enable us to have sufficient time Mr 

Speaker, to thoroughly debate the budget and the Appropriation which we will look to pass in all 

its Stages by Friday.  Thank you Mr Speaker.
