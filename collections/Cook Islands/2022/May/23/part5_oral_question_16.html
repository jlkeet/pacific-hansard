<h3>Oral Question 16</h3>
<div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to direct my question to the Honourable Prime 

Minister.  But before I ask my question, I would like to state that in the past, I have been asking 

the Government to build a home for our mentally ill people.  Last week on Friday, I went to the 

hospital.  When I arrived at the hospital, I saw a house being built to accommodate this purpose.  

Therefore, I would like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister for doing this. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now, my question is in regards to the bridge in Avatiu and it is about the stones that are being 

placed in the gabion that is set next to the stream.  There are contractors still working in the area. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The question is, was the contract tendered and has it been tabled in this Honourable House? 

</span></div>
