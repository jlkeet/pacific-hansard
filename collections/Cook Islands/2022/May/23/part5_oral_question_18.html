<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    The  Honourable  Member  was  referring  to  the 

Avatiu stream?  I believe this work that has been awarded to Mike Rennie construction builders to 

extend the gabion walls from the bridge to the back road of the Avatiu stream.  We saw the recent 

heavy downpour and flooding where the Avatiu stream broke itâ€™s banks towards the back road and 

couched the way a large portion of the enbankment which required some repair. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Fortunately, the Avatiu bridge work had been completed and despite that heavy downpour and 

</span><span>flooding, that bridge was not breached by the flood waters.  So, I believe the work was part of the 

</span><span>ICI work program to do the enbankment and the contract was awarded to this successful company. 

</span></div>
