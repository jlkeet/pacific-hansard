<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I want to direct my question to the Honourable 

Prime Minister Mark Brown.  Before I ask the question to the Honourable Minister George Angene 

please do not die early we would like you to dig and prepare all our graves. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mister Prime Minister, for a healthy informed budget debate we need both books, One and Two.  

We  are  in  this  Honourable  House  to  debate  the  budget  and  the  budget  comes  with  two  books.  

Thank you.
