<h3>Oral Question 24</h3>
<div><span>MR N. BAKER:</span><span>  My question is directed to the Prime Minister as he is the Minister Responsible 

for Finance.  Before I do so, I would like to express a short story because it has been about five to 

six years that I have received a Bill from the Tax Department advising me to pay $84 thousand 

that I owe them and yet, I heard afterwards that taxes for some companies have been abolished. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question then is, I heard that T&amp;M is one of the companies in which their taxes has been cut.  

Is this true? 

</span></div>
