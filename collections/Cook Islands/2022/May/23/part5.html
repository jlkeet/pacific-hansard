<div><span>QUESTION TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Kia Orana to all of us in the Mighty Name of our Saviour, here in Parliament.  To 

you Mr Speaker, it has been some time since we have met in this Honourable House.  My question 

is posed to the Honourable Minister, George Angene.  I have heard and I have been told that you 

have conducted a new funeral services business.  This has been broadcasted over the radio and you 

have taken control of this new funeral services business.  Maybe it is true as I am unaware, I was 

informed about  it and that  is  my question to  you Honourable Minister, is  it true that  you have 

started a new funeral services business in hope to help those bury their loved ones? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker in granting me the time to answer the question from 

the  Honourable  Member.    Greetings  to  my  Honourable  Member  friend  and  also  to  our  people 

listening in so that you actually hear the answer to this question if I am conducting this as a means 

of business for me and the answer is no.  When I started this work, it was because I felt for the 

people due to the high cost of burial services and that is why I entered this area to reduce the cost 

to the people.  On top of this Mr Speaker, and to all our people listening in, this area of burial 

should not be for businesses. 

</span></div><div><span>If you feel like conducting the burial service yourself with your family, it is your rights and it is 

not the rights of the Honourable Member George Angene or anyone else.  The reason people are 

coming to me is because I do not charge them and the quality of my work is very good.  I also do 

not look to make money from dead people, we should leave their money for their services.  Thank 

you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister and I see the Honourable Member, Tamaiva 

Tuavera. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and greetings to you this afternoon.  Greetings to the 

Government side and also the Opposition side.  I have a Supplementary Question. 

</span></div><div><span>I have also heard the same person on the radio instructing all Members of Parliament to pay $5 

</span><span>thousand to him for trimming the trees.  I would then like to ask the Honourable Minister, George 

Angene, if he had paid his share of $5 thousand.  Maybe then, we will pay our shares.  If not, then 

we will not. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I thought you are making a booking to me so that 

I can prepare your grave but you are talking about something else.  Thank you to the Member of 

</span><span>Parliament for Ngatangiia for your question.  Whether I have paid my $5 thousand but I want to 

</span><span>correct you that it is not $5 thousand, it was mentioned $15 thousand.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Who gave them the authority to go and cut trees because they have started in my constiuency of 

Tupapa and I would like to remind this House that I started the cutting of trees in the community 

without any payment.  So, why would I seek for a payment of $15 thousand when they needed to 

do the cutting of these trees around Rarotonga and I do not. 

</span></div><div><span>And the question that you are asking me is, whether I have paid and contributed this amount of 

money.  When he was in this House, I have asked the House if there is an allocation or portion of 

money to help with this kind of work and also to purchase some of the machines to support us in 

this type of work of trimming trees.  He told me that I am the boss. 

</span></div><div><span>I know there is a talk around the island of this project but I want you to know that my work is not 

along that line and we know for sure that this is what they are doing.  I want to assure the Members 

in this House that we need to believe in God and follow Him. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Tuavera, you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I want to direct my question to the Honourable 

Prime Minister Mark Brown.  Before I ask the question to the Honourable Minister George Angene 

please do not die early we would like you to dig and prepare all our graves. 

</span></div><div><span>Mister Prime Minister, for a healthy informed budget debate we need both books, One and Two.  

We  are  in  this  Honourable  House  to  debate  the  budget  and  the  budget  comes  with  two  books.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister and you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  The Bill is yet to be presented to the House and I 

am sure it will be done straight after the Question Time.  Then I expect any further documentations 

will be made available to our Members.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  I  see  the  Honourable  Member, 

</span><span>Selina Napa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker, to all Honourable Members and to all the staff of 

Parliament.  I would like to direct my question to the Honourable Prime Minister.  I stand to ask 

the question on the shortness of time that was given to us as we were only given Book No. 1 and 

I have heard of some news circulating that we will debate on the Appropriation Bill today!  There 

is also another news spreading around that Parliament will finish on Friday! 

</span></div><div><span>Can the Honourable Prime Minister indicate to us as to how long this Parliament Sitting will be? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister.

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thanky you to the Honourable Member.  Yes, I 

can indicate that we are looking to sit for the whole of this week, Monday to Friday and I have 

also indicated to the Opposition that we will be looking for extended sittings of Parliament so that 

we can start at 10.00 a.m. and finish at 5.00 p.m.  This is to enable us to have sufficient time Mr 

Speaker, to thoroughly debate the budget and the Appropriation which we will look to pass in all 

its Stages by Friday.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  think  the  message  is  clear  for  all 

Members of Parliament of our Sitting this week. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I would like to direct my question to the Honourable Prime 

Minister.  But before I ask my question, I would like to state that in the past, I have been asking 

the Government to build a home for our mentally ill people.  Last week on Friday, I went to the 

hospital.  When I arrived at the hospital, I saw a house being built to accommodate this purpose.  

Therefore, I would like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister for doing this. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, my question is in regards to the bridge in Avatiu and it is about the stones that are being 

placed in the gabion that is set next to the stream.  There are contractors still working in the area. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is, was the contract tendered and has it been tabled in this Honourable House? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister;  you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    The  Honourable  Member  was  referring  to  the 

Avatiu stream?  I believe this work that has been awarded to Mike Rennie construction builders to 

extend the gabion walls from the bridge to the back road of the Avatiu stream.  We saw the recent 

heavy downpour and flooding where the Avatiu stream broke itâ€™s banks towards the back road and 

couched the way a large portion of the enbankment which required some repair. 

</span></div><div><span>Fortunately, the Avatiu bridge work had been completed and despite that heavy downpour and 

</span><span>flooding, that bridge was not breached by the flood waters.  So, I believe the work was part of the 

</span><span>ICI work program to do the enbankment and the contract was awarded to this successful company. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    My  question  is  directed  to  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister.  I have read in the newspaper that there is a tendering in regards to the Takitumu School.  

I do believe that the government is looking for a business that will do the decoration along the road 

for the planting of trees and also the footpath. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I pose my question, I can see one of the Interpreters who was one of those involved with 

this  development  project.    I  recall  there  were  trees  in  relation  to  the  CICC  Church  that  was 

</span></div><div><span>4 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>removed.  I know the area where the two trees had been removed, the concrete walls are broken 

and smashed. 

</span></div><div><span>My question to you Honourable Prime Minister is, when will this work commence and will there 

be work in the area where ICI had worked in removing the trees and maybe they could tar seal the 

area and the cracked footpath? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, I see the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN</span><span>:  Thank you to the Honourable Member from Matavera for the question. </span><span>I 

think it is appropriate for me to go and do some investigation of this area as you have mentioned, 

the removal of these trees have caused the walls to crumble down.  So, it is appropriate I look into 

this  and  have  our  government  workers  look  at  areas  in  beautifying  this  place.    I  want  you 

Honourable  Member  to  know  that  while  doing  these  things  I  do  not  want  any  negative 

repercussions especially during these times. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I will be seeking advice from engineers and also the lawyer for advice so as not to break any 

rules. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>   Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   I now see the Honourable Member 

Nooroa Baker; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. BAKER:</span><span>  My question is directed to the Prime Minister as he is the Minister Responsible 

for Finance.  Before I do so, I would like to express a short story because it has been about five to 

six years that I have received a Bill from the Tax Department advising me to pay $84 thousand 

that I owe them and yet, I heard afterwards that taxes for some companies have been abolished. 

</span></div><div><span>My question then is, I heard that T&amp;M is one of the companies in which their taxes has been cut.  

Is this true? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for his question.  I 

</span><span>think we have to be very mindful here as there are two issues.  The first is the Tax Amnesty that 

</span><span>was provided in the year 2015, our 50</span><span>th</span><span> year of Self Governance and I am sure those Members 

who  were  in  the  House  at  the  time  will  recall  that  we  passed  special  legislation  to  allow  the 

forgiveness  of  old  and  tax  that  was  deemed  to  be  unrecoverable.  We  provided  a  window  for 

individuals,  companies  to  come  forward  and  declare  their  taxes  without  penalty  to  bring  their 

arrears up to date and for them to be part of the new tax system moving forward. There was a 

feeling that government or the country would be losing revenue by putting in place this amnesty. 

But as we all know Mr Speaker, the reality was the country gained more revenue by providing the 

Tax Amnesty because more people came onboard to take advantage of the amnesty to get their 

</span><span>affairs in order and make sure that they did not fall back into arrears. 

</span></div><div><span>Back to the question by the Honourable Member whether the company T&amp;M Heather benefitted 

in any way from the Tax Amnesty that was provided?  Mr Speaker, we should all know that the 

</span></div><div><span>5 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>tax affairs of every person and every company in this country is a private and confidential matter 

between the Tax Department and themselves.  As Minister of Finance, I cannot know and I do not 

know what the tax affairs are of individuals or of companies with the Tax Department. That would 

be a question, Mr Speaker, better directed by the Member to the owners and directors of T&amp;M 

Heather themselves.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  see  the  Deputy  Leader  of  the 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  W.  HEATHER:    </span><span>Maybe  I  might  take  some  time  in  explaining  my  question  to  the  Prime 

Minister because I have raised this question at the last Sitting in the House because the land owners 

of Puaikura were concern for what is happening today.  This is regarding the incinerator of waste 

that we have discussed in this House.  The question here is, what is happening to this project, the 

procurement of the incinerator?  Whether this is going ahead or not because when I look in the 

Budget Book, there is no mention of this.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Deputy Leader.  I see the Associate Minister; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and all of us in this House and to the question from 

the Member.  Maybe he is wondering why I have stood up to answer instead of the Prime Minister.  

It is because the Prime Minister have allocated this responsibility to me in recent times in looking 

at the progress of the project as mentioned by the Member. 

</span></div><div><span>In  response  to  the  query  from  the  Member,  yes  just  the  other  week  we  along  with  the  Waste 

Management team met with two consultants from New Zealand.  These two gentlemen have been 

working in the incinerator industry.  These two presented their recommendations to us the team 

from  Infrastructure  Cook  Islands  and  Waste  Management.    In  this  recommendation  they  put 

forward some thoughts on the incinerator as you have mentioned.  The comments were accepted 

by the Waste Management and they were requested to return in August this year. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I have to interrupt you.  Our time is up and you can finish 

that tomorrow so that the Honourable Member on the Opposition side who raised the question will 

</span><span>be looking forward to your response tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Member.
