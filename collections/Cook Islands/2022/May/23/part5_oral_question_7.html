<h3>Oral Question 7</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I thought you are making a booking to me so that 

I can prepare your grave but you are talking about something else.  Thank you to the Member of 

</span><span>Parliament for Ngatangiia for your question.  Whether I have paid my $5 thousand but I want to 

</span><span>correct you that it is not $5 thousand, it was mentioned $15 thousand.

<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>Who gave them the authority to go and cut trees because they have started in my constiuency of 

Tupapa and I would like to remind this House that I started the cutting of trees in the community 

without any payment.  So, why would I seek for a payment of $15 thousand when they needed to 

do the cutting of these trees around Rarotonga and I do not. 

</span></div>
<div><span>And the question that you are asking me is, whether I have paid and contributed this amount of 

money.  When he was in this House, I have asked the House if there is an allocation or portion of 

money to help with this kind of work and also to purchase some of the machines to support us in 

this type of work of trimming trees.  He told me that I am the boss. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I know there is a talk around the island of this project but I want you to know that my work is not 

along that line and we know for sure that this is what they are doing.  I want to assure the Members 

in this House that we need to believe in God and follow Him.
