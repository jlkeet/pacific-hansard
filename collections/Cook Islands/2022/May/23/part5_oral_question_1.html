<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Kia Orana to all of us in the Mighty Name of our Saviour, here in Parliament.  To 

you Mr Speaker, it has been some time since we have met in this Honourable House.  My question 

is posed to the Honourable Minister, George Angene.  I have heard and I have been told that you 

have conducted a new funeral services business.  This has been broadcasted over the radio and you 

have taken control of this new funeral services business.  Maybe it is true as I am unaware, I was 

informed about  it and that  is  my question to  you Honourable Minister, is  it true that  you have 

started a new funeral services business in hope to help those bury their loved ones?
