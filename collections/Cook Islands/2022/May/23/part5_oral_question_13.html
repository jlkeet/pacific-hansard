<h3>Oral Question 13</h3>
<div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker, to all Honourable Members and to all the staff of 

Parliament.  I would like to direct my question to the Honourable Prime Minister.  I stand to ask 

the question on the shortness of time that was given to us as we were only given Book No. 1 and 

I have heard of some news circulating that we will debate on the Appropriation Bill today!  There 

is also another news spreading around that Parliament will finish on Friday! 

</span></div>
<div><span>Can the Honourable Prime Minister indicate to us as to how long this Parliament Sitting will be? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister.
