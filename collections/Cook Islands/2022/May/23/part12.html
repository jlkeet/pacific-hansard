</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you to the Speaker of the House as well as to all Honourable Members 

and to the Queen’s Representative, Sir Tom and Lady Marsters and your family.  All our traditional 

leaders of the land, Kaumaiti Nui, the President of the House of Ariki as well as all the Aronga 

Mana.  Throughout all the Churches in our nation, the different Denominations and your leaders, 

greetings to you all.  To our island governments and your leaders out there, greetings to you today. 

</span></div><div><span>To my Cabinets and Members of Government as well as the Honourable Members of the House, 

greetings to all of us this afternoon.  To all our people listening by radio and watching on livestream 

here on Rarotonga, the Pa Enua and all those who live a far in New Zealand, Australia and the rest 

of the world, to you all, greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the last two years have been tough and as a country, we have faced many challenges 

with our borders closed for many months.  We have experienced the largest economic recession 

in Cook Islands history and one of the largest economic impacts in the world. 

</span></div><div><span>We have seen many of our people both Cook Islanders and migrant workers leave the country for 

opportunities elsewhere and this year after two years of keeping the virus out, we have accepted 

the inevitability of COVID-19 to enter our community but only on our terms.  But Mr Speaker, as 

a country, our people have risen to face these enormous challenges together and we are prevailing. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to say again how proud I am of the way our country and our people have come together in 

our battle  against this  COVID Pandemic.  We,  your Government,  have  not  underestimated the 

struggle that many, just like us, have faced.  But we have not been alone in this struggle, we have 

faced them together as a nation, a nation I am very proud to lead. 

</span></div><div><span>This is our third Budget since the start of the Pandemic.  In the last two Budgets, we showed strong 

decisive leadership and made bold decisions to show that by working together we would keep our 

people safe and we would support our people through these tough times.  Today, I am asking you 

to keep that faith. 

</span></div><div><span>Budget 2020 was the Budget of Blessings.  While our economy was hit hard, we were blessed in 

</span><span>that we were in a position of financial strength and moved quickly to ensure that worst of the storm 

had missed our little paradise.  The 2020 Budget also set the foundation for our response to the 

pandemic supporting our economy through a stimulus and support package, valued at around 20 

percent of our GDP.  Since then, we have supported hundreds of our Cook Islands businesses both 

large and small since the start of the pandemic, paying over $104 million dollars in wage subsidies, 

business and sole trader grants as well as trading grants. 

</span></div><div><span>Budget 2021 was the Revival Budget.  The Revival Budget focused on critical measures to protect 

</span><span>our people and stimulate the economy as we moved from response to recovery.  We can see that 

</span><span>our health response and economic stimulus measures have been working even with our borders 

closed for six months last year and omicron entering our community in February. 

</span></div><div><span>13

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>This year, our economy has grown by 11.5 percent, the first step in our recovery.  So, our economic 

heart is still beating and it is starting to beat stronger and faster.  Much of this growth Mr Speaker, 

is due to our borders reopening in January and visitors returning to our country.  At the end of last 

year in December, we had to make a critical decision.  Do we listen to the fearmongering of the 

Democratic Party and the United Party to keep our border closed or do we follow the science and 

the best medical advice? 

</span></div><div><span>It was a difficult decision Mr Speaker, but I am confident that we made the right one because this 

was a decision which affected everyone in the Cook Islands to open our borders again, knowing 

that doing so would increase the chances of COVID entering the country but that not doing so 

would be an even worse outcome for all our people and our country. 

</span></div><div><span>We needed to allow time for all of our key government agencies to be ready and over the past two 

years, they have prepared knowing that the day would come that we would have to face this virus 

and they did and our people prepared well.  Our vaccination rate is amongst the best in the world 

and we have upgraded our health systems and testing capacity.  When we reopened our borders, 

all of our preparations paid off, COVID came to our country but it came in on our terms. 

</span></div><div><span>Since we detected our first omicron infection on the 15</span><span>th</span><span> February, we have recorded over 5, 300 

cases and just one death and while that one death still hurts, and while isolation and quarantine 

measures  had  led  to  destructions  to  many  businesses,  we  are  incredibly  fortunate  to  be  in  the 

position we are today with no serious cases due to COVID. 

</span></div><div><span>It is not luck that has seen us reach this point Mr Speaker, but diligence, hard work and careful 

management and our faith, our high vaccination rates and our preparations and our prayers have 

kept us safe and we thank God for His continuous protection of our Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>From an economic perspective, we see that over 50,000 tourists by the end of June will arrive. 

Those tourists are bringing in vital dollars to our economy, supporting and creating new jobs and 

businesses and so far, we have successfully balanced the risk of opening our borders and we will 

continue working hard to do so. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before I introduce this year’s budget, there are government and community groups 

</span><span>who have and continue to work incredibly hard in responding to the pandemic in particular Te 

</span><span>Marae Ora and our Community Puna Organisations.  I would like to take a moment to acknowledge 

them, I and our community do see your efforts and we say thank you.  We would also not be in 

the position we are today Mr Speaker, without the generosity of our development partners who 

have collectively provided $103 million over the last three years to support our response to the 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

</span></div><div><span>In particular, I would like to make special mention of the New Zealand Government who provided 

$50 million in budgetary support this year as well as almost $700,000 for vaccinations and RAT 

</span><span>test kits.  This has been a significant help  in our response to the pandemic and New Zealand’s 

</span><span>additional commitment of $40 million in capital investment will be critical in aiding our economic 

recovery as we move forward.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>   Honourable Prime Minister, I will have to interrupt  you.    It is now time for 

recess and you may continue when we resume after lunch. 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is now suspended and will resume at 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.28 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 3.02 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  All be seated please.  May I remind all Honourable Members, when we have a 

break, please look at your time!  We need to complete our Sitting properly rather than sitting in 

the mess.  Thank you Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>Before we suspended, the Honourable Prime Minister had the Floor and I would like to ask our 

Translator to carry on with the Speech from the Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Other key development partners, Mr Speaker that have helped us during this 

time have been the Australian Government, the People’s Republic of China, Japan and the Asian 

Development  Bank  and  the  Cook  Islands  Government  offers  to  these  countries  and  these 

Organizations our sincere thanks. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today’s Budget shows the policies of the last two years have worked.  We have held 

the faith in the measures introduced for our Health response and our economic response and we 

are now in a stronger position than we thought even in December, today’s Budget shows that we 

are on the right path to recovery. 

</span></div><div><span>While no one will know when we will be done with COVID, as we look around at all that we have 

accomplished and the progress we have made, we can see that our journey has been and continues 

to be a successful one against the enormous challenges that were before us. 

</span></div><div><span>We can be cautiously optimistic that now we have passed the peak of infections on Rarotonga and 

Aitutaki and we are managing it in the Pa Enua and as travel continues to resume and there will be 

better days ahead. 

</span></div><div><span>Last year we saw the light at the end of the tunnel.  Now we are emerging out of the tunnel and 

into the brightness of a new day and if we keep the momentum of the last two years, not only will 

we make it through but we will climb higher than we have ever been as a country and that is why, 

Mr Speaker the theme of this year’s Budget is, ‘Keeping the Faith’. 

</span></div><div><span>Keeping the faith, Mr Speaker and by that I mean keeping the faith in ourselves as a sovereign 

nation, in our ability to overcome adversity and in our support for one another as people, keeping 

the faith in the course that we are taking to regrow our economy and Mr Speaker, keeping the faith 

</span><span>in  our  government  and  that  we  will  continue  to  guide  our  Nation  for  the  betterment  of  all  our 

</span><span>people. 

</span></div><div><span>15 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, today’s Budget shows that despite the uncertainties ahead, the Cook Islands economic 

outlook is showing early positive signs of moving out of the depths of the pandemic and moving 

back towards the prosperity we experienced prior to the pandemic, back to our graduated status as 

a high income country. 

</span></div><div><span>Following a decrease of 23.4 percent over the 2020 and 2021 years, our gross domestic product or 

GDP is on the rise again and we expect GDP to grow by 11.5 percent in 2022 and again by around 

14 percent in 2023.  This is a very strong growth rate but is not at all unusual when recovering 

from the economic shock that we have just had.  However, we expect to see higher inflation over 

the next couple of years mostly due to the global supply issues and the Russian war with Ukraine.  

On the short term, we expect prices to increase by 4.3 percent in 2022 and 3.9 percent in 2023. 

</span></div><div><span>This  inflation,  Mr  Speaker  is  not  something  that  government  can  control  as  it  is  coming  from 

outside our country and it will affect government as it will affect our people through rising costs 

and despite, Mr Speaker a significant reduction in national income and having to climb out of our 

deepest recession in history, this Budget, Mr Speaker will still manage to give some increases to 

our  vulnerable.    This  Budget  includes  measures  to  provide  some  immediate  relief  for  the 

vulnerable in our society while in the longer term the work done through our economic recovery 

roadmap will help reduce the impact of inflation. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, earlier this year I promised to increase pensions in response to rising inflation.   Today 

I am fulfilling that promise.  Our Mamas and Papas on fixed retirement incomes both on Rarotonga 

and the Pa Enua will feel the pinch as the cost of bread, fuel and other necessities increase. 

</span></div><div><span>From the 1</span><span>st</span><span> July Mr Sepeaker, the Old Age Pension will increase by $20 per month.  This means 

that people aged in the 60 to 69 will now recieve $520 a month, and people over 70+ will now 

receive $720 a month.  It is remarkable Mr Speaker that even in this tight fiscal environment that 

we are still able to provide an increase immediately. 

</span></div><div><span>I can see the Members of the Opposition are very happy of this announcement.  Furthermore Mr 

Speaker, to assist with the impacts of rising prices, the government has also decided to increase 

the Minimum Wage from $8 to $8.50 an hour.  For a worker on 35 hours per week, that is an 

additional $900 a year and increase of 6 and quarter percent. 

</span></div><div><span>There is a simple rule that I keep in mind as your Minister of Finance, over the last 12 years that 

has kept our country’s finances stable and growing over the last 12 years and that is, you can only 

spend what you earn. 

</span></div><div><span>As a country, our earnings had been growing at a high rate until COVID devastated the world.  We 

were  fortunate that  we put  aside money over the  years of prosperity to  allow us to  protect  our 

economy during the times of turmoil.  We know that we will recover, Mr Speaker, our Economic 

Response over the last two  years has bought  us time, time to  get  back on our feet  and time to 

</span><span>regrow our economy.  That is why, even though we have not got back to pre-COVID financial 

</span><span>levels, I am confident that increasing the support for our Pensioners and low income earners will 

be affordable as our economy gathers steam.  That first step will be determined by how quickly 

we see tourists return to our islands.

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>The influs of tourism represents a welcome boost to the local economy.  Tourist numbers have 

increased from $7,500 in 2020/21 to $50,300 in 2021/22 and we expect to see this trend continue, 

with $121 thousand for 2022/23 and $165 thousand 2023/24 as we continue to rebuild our tourist 

markets. 

</span></div><div><span>But  we  know  that  we  must  look  beyong  tourism  to  grow  our  econnomy,  Mr  Speaker  over  the 

longer term.  I have said before that economic diversification has always been on our agenda and 

this challenge cannot be addressed overnight. 

</span></div><div><span>We know that to support our private sector to invest in new industries, we need to first have the 

right economic foundations in place.  This means, providing better internet connectivity in the Pa 

Enua,  taking  more  business  practices  online  and  ensuring  our  business  and  investment  laws 

provided an enabling environment for all types of businesses. 

</span></div><div><span>Be assured Mr Speaker, that through the Economic Recovery Roadmap measures this Government 

is  providing  a  solid  economic  foundation  for  diversification.    One  only  needs  to  look  at  our 

emerging Seabed Minerals program to see that significant millions will be spent on exploring and 

gaining knowledge of our deep ocean.  We expect some of that investment to spill over to domestic 

economy as it has already started. 

</span></div><div><span>Turning towards fiscal responsibility now Mr Speaker, this year’s Budget moves us towards more 

neutral fiscal stance, as we begin to unwind the short-term stimulus measures in favour of longer-

term reforms and investment in infrastructure. 

</span></div><div><span>By this, I mean as we move from the Response to Recovery phase of the Pandemic, Governments 

spending  shifts  more  towards  ‘business-as-usual’.    We  still  need  to  spend  to  stimulate  our 

economy, but we will move our focus from measures such as the Wage Subsid and Business Grants 

to infrastructure investment that keeps our people employed. 

</span></div><div><span>In 2021, the Government agreed to revise our fiscal rules.  The whole world has changed and what 

worked before does not work now.  We need to change the fiscal rules to be able to compete in 

this new world.  These are the rules that guide how much we can spend each year.  The scale of 

</span><span>the economic shock and the debt. 

</span></div><div><span>The scale of the economic shock and the debt that Government has taken on to support our private 

sector over the past years meant that the rules we had before were not right for where we are today. 

</span></div><div><span>There are two important changes, the first is that Government needs to hold minimum cash reserves 

and the second is that we have increased our net debt ratio, that is the percent of GDP that we can 

borrow.  We have increased this ration, Mr Speaker to a maximum of 65 percent of GDP, and this 

sounds like a very high amount but it is in fact now quite a normal level by international standards 

</span><span>and our team at the Ministry of Finance have assured me that this is a sustainable level.  I must 

</span><span>also assure you, Mr Speaker that we have not borrowed to this level, it is simply what the rule 

allows us to do. 

</span></div><div><span>17 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>These two rules together Mr Speaker means that we need to keep some cash in the bank and that 

we can only borrow so much to do that.  This is important to ensure that government has enough 

money available to respond in the event of an economic shock or a natural disaster.  For example, 

if a large cyclone were to impact one or more of our lands and cause a halt to our revenues, the 

Government would need enough cash to respond and to cover our operations. 

</span></div><div><span>In this coming years Budget we have again has to depart from our fiscal rules to help manage the 

recovery.  This gives us a little more flexibilty to respond to the needs of the economy as it gets 

back on its feet again, allowing us to invest extra funds into the Economic Recovery Roadmap and 

our ongoing response to COVID-19 whilst we protect our people in the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>Our cash position has improved by over $35 million since 2021/22 Budget, helping us to support 

the economy in recovery. 

</span></div><div><span>While it is early to say, if the economy recovers as we expect it to, we will be able to meet all the 

rules for the 2023 Budget.  Our economist and budget team at MFEM as they rightly should, take 

a very conservative approach to forecasting, but as  we all know by now I am an optismistic man, 

and history tells me the we will do better. 

</span></div><div><span>For  example,  visitor  arrivals  in  April  were  already  almost  2,000  more  than  we  assumed  when 

preparing this Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>This shows the potential for even better outcomes than we planned for. Funding our response to 

the pandemic has  come  at  a steep cost  and  we borrowed  $130 million  to  fund our response to 

COVID.  This is a large increase in debt but it is an increase without an alternative.  If we did not 

do  what  was  needed  to  keep  our  businesses  afloat  and  our  people  alive,  then  the  consequence 

would  have  been  much  worse,  businesses  would  have  gone  bankrupt,  loans  would  have  been 

foreclosed and homes lost or sold off.  We would have lost a lot more of our people to New Zealand 

and Australia, people’s savings would have been lost and we would have regressed to  a Third 

World  Country  living  standards.    Even  worse  Mr  Speaker,  we  would  have  the  impact  of  what 

economists call Economic Scaring where our economy would have been reduced to such a poor 

state as to never being able to recover on its own. 

</span></div><div><span>Your Government saw of this consequence and made the borrowing decision to ensure this did not 

</span><span>happen. We knew what we needed to do as a country to respond and to keep our economy alive.  

The increase in debt and the need to repay it with interest will be a key challenge for us. Our debt 

servicing costs are forecast to increase to over $30 million per year by the end of this decade.  This 

three times our current servicing costs and will demand a significant part of our revenue. 

</span></div><div><span>That is why Mr Speaker, along with our fellow Pacific Island countries, we are talking with our 

funding partners about our loan contracts so that debt servicing can be maintained at sustainable 

levels.  Capping our debt repayments over the short term is necessary so we can continue to focus 

</span><span>investment on growing the economy and lifting standards, increasing productivity quickly is the 

</span><span>key  to  avoiding  debt  distress.    Despite  Mr  Speaker  the  Opposition  calling  for  cuts  to  public 

spending, now is not the time for austerity.  Government still needs to stimulate the economy and 

</span></div><div><span>18 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Monday, 23 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>provide fiscal interventions to help us get back on track and we will continue to do this through 

the Economic Recovery Roadmap and the Capital Investment Program. 

</span></div><div><span>This time last year Mr Speaker, I announced the Economic Recovery Roadmap or the ERR as our 

guide out of the biggest recession our country has ever seen. The ERR prioritizes elements of the 

Economic Development Strategy that we announced in 2019, just as COVID-19 was emerging.  

Unfortunately, the extended border closure from August 2021 also meant that we have to shift 

back to the continuation of the economic response and the measures such as the wage subsidy and 

the business grants.  We have spent the vast majority of our ERR funds more than $42 million this 

year on financially supporting our people. It has been a large but necessary cost. 

</span></div><div><span>But with things starting to look up now our focus is again turned to the policies and reforms that 

will help guide our recovery.  This year’s budget includes a further $5.2 million for the ERR and 

a total of $8 million over the next four years.  These a broad ranging initiatives that are intended 

to address economic growth by reducing barriers to competition, growing our labour force, making 

government more efficient and by focusing our Capital Investment Plans on projects that can offer 

a greater level of economic stimulus straight away. 

</span></div><div><span>You have heard me talk about the ERR work streams before so I won’t go into detail here other 

than to highlight the work that is being done right now to support our private sector businesses 

with streamlined Immigration and reduced fees so that we can get our labour force back to where 

it needs to be to support our tourism industry.  To our businesses, we have heard you and we have 

responded. 

</span></div><div><span>The COVID-19 Medical Response Fund is a further important expenditure item in this Budget.  

These funds have been allocated to continue our response to COVID-19, strengthening our medical 

services, particularly in the Pa Enua and being ready to respond as the pandemic makes its way 

through our Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>While we pray to God for His mercies to our small nation, we also know that God helps those who 

help themselves and to this end, we have allocated $5 million to this important work.  We also 

pray that we will not need to spend any of it but we are ready if we need to. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I have spoken many times about the importance of Capital Expenditure in responding 

</span><span>to  the  economic  shock  and  about  its  ability  to  engage  local  companies,  employ  workers  and 

stimulate  our  economy  especially  when  investment  from  the  Private  Sector  is  limited.  

Governments the world over know this and we in the Cook Islands are no different.  That is why 

it is one of the economic recovery roadmap work streams. 

</span></div><div><span>Capital Expenditure in this Budget will continue the government’s three investment themes from 

last year.  In this Budget, government has focused on projects that are either already in progress or 

development in order to deliver economic stimulus to the Cook Islands.  These are intended to 

</span><span>more quickly employ local contractors and labour like our airport slab replacement programme at 

</span><span>the Rarotonga Airport, employing dozens of people, using new skills that we have learnt to deliver 

a project of national importance.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Infrastructure  Cook  Islands  will  continue  their  important  work  on  physical  infrastructure  on 

Rarotonga and the Pa Enua with continuing focus on bridges and roads on Rarotonga and marine 

and air infrastructure works in the Pa Enua including the Nassau wharf and the Manihiki airport 

sealing project. 

</span></div><div><span>The Cook Islands Investment Corporation continues its focus on government building works on 

Rarotonga  and  the  Pa  Enua.    All  of  these  projects,  Mr  Speaker  employ  local  businesses  and 

labourers on both Rarotonga and the outer islands. 

</span></div><div><span>The Budget also provides funding to continue the upgrades to the Government IT Network both 

on Rarotonga and the Pa Enua with hardware on Rarotonga to make the Government Network 

more reliable and to improve inactivity and facilities in the Pa Enua. 

</span></div><div><span>We  are  working  to  implement  a  total  technology  refresh,  upgrading  the  mobile  network  and 

migrating satellite services to the latest generation of the O3B Empower Satellite Constellation 

and on Aitutaki we are taking advantage of the Manatua Cable connectivity. 

</span></div><div><span>This  upgrade  underpins  the  universal  access  programme  which  is  intended  to  deliver  better 

telecommunications connectivity to the Pa Enua communities.  These investments will benefit not 

just our  Island Administrations and Government  Agencies in  the Pa Enua but  they also  enable 

connectivity improvements that will benefit all of our population in the islands with faster, more 

reliable internet. 

</span></div><div><span>Better internet connectivity to the Pa Enua is important for many reasons.  It improves the ability 

for Government Agencies on Rarotonga to work with the Island Administrations.  It means we can 

offer improved medical services to the Outer Islands through online consultations and it makes it 

easier for our retired people to move back to these islands if they can be sure they will be able to 

continue their business affairs and keep up with their families and have access to medical care. 

</span></div><div><span>A better connected Pa Enua benefits all of the Cook Islands.  These capital investments would not 

be possible without the support of our development partners and collectively they provided $65 

million in the 2021/22 financial year and another $20 million that is planned in this coming Budget.  

This has enabled us to continue working on these important projects and keep our local people 

</span><span>employed. 

</span></div><div><span>As well as spending through the Budget, the government is actively discussing additional capital 

investment proposals with various partners.  We continue to work with New Zealand on proposals 

to  fund  projects  through  the  Infrastructure  Trust  Fund  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  shovel  ready 

projects that will keep our people in employment and support more economic stimulus. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, along with the increase in pension and our support for the minimum wage, this Budget 

includes funding for two other important groups, for our Healthcare workers and for our teachers.  

</span><span>This  pandemic  has  highlighted  the  importance  of  having  enough  healthcare  workers  and  in 

</span><span>particular, Public Health staff.  This Budget includes additional funding of $324 thousand annually 

from  2022/23  and  a  total  of  $1.37  million  over  the  next  four  years  for  additional  healthcare 

workers.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>This  funding  maintains  the  momentum  of  the  last  two  years  by  supporting  a  Public  Health 

Coordinator, Health Intelligent Unit and additional Registered Nurses as well as an ICT systems 

analyst and this government is not only enhancing medical services, we are also making strong 

moves to address NCDs through the NCD Strategic Action Plan release last year.  We have known 

for a long time that NCDs are harming too many of our people and Te Marae Ora are working to 

prevent, control and mitigate these terrible diseases rather than just being the ambulance at the 

bottom of a cliff or at the bottom of a chocolate cake. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the government also recognizes the role of our teachers and the part they play in the 

lives of our children.  This Budget provides for the second tranche of Teachers salary increases 

building on the changes rolled out in September last year and this funding amounts to a total of 

$1.34 million over the next four years. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I leave you with a Budget that balances fiscal responsibility 

and  the  needs  of  our  Nation  as  we  maintain  the  momentum  of  the  past  two  years  to  lay  the 

economic foundations for a speedy recovery and for our future growth. 

</span></div><div><span>Today’s Budget Mr Speaker, is about keeping the faith.  Earlier on, our Chaplain mentioned the 

Verse for today and I had a look for myself at today’s daily Verse and can only say how appropriate 

it is for the theme of today’s Budget, for it comes from the Book of Revelation, Chapter 19, Verses 

11 to 12, </span><span>“Then I saw the Heavens opened and behold a white horse, the one sitting on it is called 

Faithful and true and in righteousness he judges and makes war”.</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I lay this Budget before you and the House, thank you everybody. 

</span></div><div><span>(Applause) 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.  Despite your lengthy Budget Statement, 

I see that the four lively Honourable Members on the far corner on my left were excited with the 

increase of the Old Age Pension as they are Old Age Pensioners themselves. 

</span></div><div><span>There is a saying from a Wisdom, I quote, </span><span>“it says it is not what you earn, it is what you say”. 

</span></div><div><span>I now call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tamaiva Tuavera 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>I  now  open  the  Floor  to  Honourable  Members  to  debate  on  the  Principles  and  Merits  of  the 

</span><span>Appropriation Bill 2022.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister.
