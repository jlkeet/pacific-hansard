<h3>Oral Question 30</h3>
<div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and all of us in this House and to the question from 

the Member.  Maybe he is wondering why I have stood up to answer instead of the Prime Minister.  

It is because the Prime Minister have allocated this responsibility to me in recent times in looking 

at the progress of the project as mentioned by the Member. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In  response  to  the  query  from  the  Member,  yes  just  the  other  week  we  along  with  the  Waste 

Management team met with two consultants from New Zealand.  These two gentlemen have been 

working in the incinerator industry.  These two presented their recommendations to us the team 

from  Infrastructure  Cook  Islands  and  Waste  Management.    In  this  recommendation  they  put 

forward some thoughts on the incinerator as you have mentioned.  The comments were accepted 

by the Waste Management and they were requested to return in August this year.
