<h3>Oral Question 28</h3>
<div><span>MR  W.  HEATHER:    </span><span>Maybe  I  might  take  some  time  in  explaining  my  question  to  the  Prime 

Minister because I have raised this question at the last Sitting in the House because the land owners 

of Puaikura were concern for what is happening today.  This is regarding the incinerator of waste 

that we have discussed in this House.  The question here is, what is happening to this project, the 

procurement of the incinerator?  Whether this is going ahead or not because when I look in the 

Budget Book, there is no mention of this.  Thank you.
