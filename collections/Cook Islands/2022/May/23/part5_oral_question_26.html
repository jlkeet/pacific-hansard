<h3>Oral Question 26</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Member for his question.  I 

</span><span>think we have to be very mindful here as there are two issues.  The first is the Tax Amnesty that 

</span><span>was provided in the year 2015, our 50</span><span>th</span><span> year of Self Governance and I am sure those Members 

who  were  in  the  House  at  the  time  will  recall  that  we  passed  special  legislation  to  allow  the 

forgiveness  of  old  and  tax  that  was  deemed  to  be  unrecoverable.  We  provided  a  window  for 

individuals,  companies  to  come  forward  and  declare  their  taxes  without  penalty  to  bring  their 

arrears up to date and for them to be part of the new tax system moving forward. There was a 

feeling that government or the country would be losing revenue by putting in place this amnesty. 

But as we all know Mr Speaker, the reality was the country gained more revenue by providing the 

Tax Amnesty because more people came onboard to take advantage of the amnesty to get their

<div><span>tax affairs of every person and every company in this country is a private and confidential matter 

between the Tax Department and themselves.  As Minister of Finance, I cannot know and I do not 

know what the tax affairs are of individuals or of companies with the Tax Department. That would 

be a question, Mr Speaker, better directed by the Member to the owners and directors of T&amp;M 

Heather themselves.  Thank you.
