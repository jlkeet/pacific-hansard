<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker in granting me the time to answer the question from 

the  Honourable  Member.    Greetings  to  my  Honourable  Member  friend  and  also  to  our  people 

listening in so that you actually hear the answer to this question if I am conducting this as a means 

of business for me and the answer is no.  When I started this work, it was because I felt for the 

people due to the high cost of burial services and that is why I entered this area to reduce the cost 

to the people.  On top of this Mr Speaker, and to all our people listening in, this area of burial 

should not be for businesses. 

</span></div>
<div><span>If you feel like conducting the burial service yourself with your family, it is your rights and it is 

not the rights of the Honourable Member George Angene or anyone else.  The reason people are 

coming to me is because I do not charge them and the quality of my work is very good.  I also do 

not look to make money from dead people, we should leave their money for their services.  Thank 

you very much.
