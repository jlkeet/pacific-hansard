</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,455,081 for Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,455,081 for Agricultre stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>My apology, I am too fast.  Members may speak on the Vote Item only and not the Principles and 

Merits until there are no futher speakers or the time limit is reached. 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open and if I do not see any Member standing then I move.  I see the Honourable 

Member Vaitoti Tupa. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman and thank you for giving me the opportunity to debate 

on the appropriation for Agriculture.  Mr Chairman I will not go through the appropriation itself.  

When you look at the two books that we have in our hands in my book I have made some outlines 

and pagination for my interest.  That means I have read from the beginning to the end and from 

</span><span>the end back to the front. 

</span></div><div><span>This is what I want to discuss on the Agriculture Appropriation.  I want to assure you Mr Chairman 

that I agree with what has been set out because when we look at the Minimum Wage, we will know

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>that  $10  thousand  has  been  taken  out  of  it.    It  did  not  go  to  any  other  areas,  it  went  back  to 

Agriculture to their Leader.  We know that paying the Managers in this areas, it is the responsibility 

of  the  Public  Service.    It  was  not  taken  out  of  the  Agriculture  Budget  and  given  to  the  Public 

Service Commission but remained within the Ministry so that it can be given to the staff there even 

though  we  noticed  the  allocation  for  payment  has  decreased.    That  amount  of  $10  thousand 

remained with the Ministry of Agriculture.  I want to look at their program Mr Speaker because 

when  we  look  at  the  program  in  comparison  to  last  year,  we  have  enacted  the  Agriculture 

legislation.  Under Section 8 of that Act, I believe there are projects that needs to be strengthen.  

This is to pay for the Agriculture Officers to carry out their inspections.  So, Mr Speaker I give my 

support to this because in this way we can get a breakdown on the work carried out by the Ministry 

of Agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  I  am  looking  at  the  Appropriation  for  Biodiversity  under  Output  2  for  Agriculture.  

Under that Output, we want to support their work.  I am happy for what the Minister of Agriculture 

has  done  by  increasing  the  allocation  for  this  area.    I  do  not  want  to  talk  about  the  tractor  for 

Matavera.  It has been confirmed to me that the tractor for Matavera has arrived.  When we look 

at Output 3, these are one of the areas that we need to support for our people.  What I am happy 

about is at least there has been some increase and to me, it is not enough.  If they had put Output 

3 to $500 thousand, then I will be very happy.  Mr Speaker, when we look at these Outputs, these 

appropriations  are  intended  to  support  the  agriculture  section  and  not  only  on  Rarotonga  but 

extending to the outer islands.  When we look at these Outputs and when we compare them for the 

years to come, we will know exactly where we can contribute to make it better.  That is why the 

Leader of the Opposition has been emphasising on our part to the agriculture because our intention 

is not just to emphasise into one basket but to diversify, and part of that is agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>I have looked into all the Outputs and into both Books and the sections that contributes towards 

helping  agriculture.    I  can  see  that  we  are  required  to  support  this.    I  noticed  that  in  the 

Appropriation, about  $1.3 million  has been allocated.  To me,  if only  the  Government  and the 

Opposition levels it to $2 million.  I tell you Mr Speaker, if only that mark can be set, we will not 

complain in the House.  I am sure that the Government has thoroughly studied the Budget and 

Agriculture is one area that we in the Opposition greatly supports.  

</span></div><div><span>Coming back at their plans where people will be appointed to do the investigations and inspections.  

Because we need to establish them now so that for the future we will see areas that we need to 

improve.  I will like to emphasise again the need to improve and strengthen Biodiversity.  The 

reason why I am emphasising on this area is because of the type of food we have been exporting 

in the past.  I know we do not export our pawpaws anymore and I am fully aware we are not the 

only court exporting our pawpaws to New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may carry on Honourable Member.  You can take the whole hour.</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA: </span><span> Thank you to the Clerk for giving me an extra 10 minute to speak.  I really want 

</span><span>to speak for an hour on this Appropriation in allude of what I was saying earlier about the products 

</span><span>that we export.  Today, I know that I have mentioned this before about our fumigation machine 

for the fruits that we export.  I have had a discussion with the Minister of Agriculture in regards to 

this machine that is sitting at the airport.  I know that we have lost the area designated at the airport 

</span></div><div><span>20 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>for Agriculture and I believe Air New Zealand has taken over.  This machine that I am referring 

to is still located at the Airport and under this Appropriation Bill, I believe that there is an intention 

for a building to be built to accommodate this machine.  This machine is still in a good condition 

and we need to maintain it properly to export other products as well to New Zealand.  The intention 

of this project is not for Rarotonga only but to extend and to include the Southern Group islands, 

Aitutaki, Nga-Pu-Toru and Mangaia.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, as you are aware, the soil on your island and on the other Southern Group islands 

are very rich which is good for agricultural purposes.  I know for sure because I was one of those 

who went to undertake surveys and investigation on those islands in 1977.  This is how I know 

about this information because I was involved in the research of the soil on these islands and I 

know for sure the soil are fertile.  That Report is still at the Ministry of Agriculture.  That is why I 

do  not  want  to  comment  on  the  Appropriation,  I  wanted  to  focus  more  on  Agriculture  itself 

according  to  the  allocations  appropriated.    We  will  not  stop  here  but  we  need  to  support  the 

branches in Agriculture so that it can generate capitals.  There is a Mangaian saying that says, </span><span>“We 

got to justify the program so that the money can be put where the programs are”.</span></div><div><span>I have noticed that I have gone beyond my allowable time but I stand to support the Appropriation 

for Agriculture and thank you for the tractor for Matavera.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Before I give the Floor to the Honourable 

Terepai Maoate, may I remind all the Members of this House that you may have three ten minutes 

of speaking time if you want to speak.  I see the Honourable Terepai Maoate; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to all of us in this House and to our 

people  listening.    I  am  a  bit  confused  with  this  Appropriation  especially  the  time  that  we  are 

currently in with COVID and especially with the emphasis of reviving our economy. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to give my support for the Appropriation Bill and the things that have been shown in 

the Appropriation for the Agriculture especially to help our people.  Our difficulty here is that we 

haven’t received our tractor the Constituency for Amuri/Ureia and Vaipae/Vaipeka/Tautu except 

for the Constituency of Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara.  The support came to the island of Aitutaki 

during the period of the celebration through this Ministry from Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>I know that under the ERR there is an appropriation for some money and I am hoping that it will 

go towards agriculture.  We have a problem in Aitutaki because there are not enough tractors. 

</span></div><div><span>I noticed that there is an appropriation for a million dollars each year for the next four years.  I do 

believe that for each Personnel in your Ministry, they are getting about $70 thousand and if that is 

the case I would like to apologize for what I have said yesterday.  I apologize if I have made a 

mistake especially to reduce the wages of those collecting over $70 thousand a year.  I know for 

the island of Aitutaki our CEO collects over $60 thousand a year.  I have high regard for the person 

</span><span>holding this position and his supporters in the Agriculture Department they are doing their work 

</span><span>well. 

</span></div><div><span>21 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>What I have said in this House have been recorded in the Hansard.  So I would like to see that our 

government employees that their wages be increased and for those who are collecting over seventy 

thousand a year to help those below so that they can get more and that is including us Members of 

Parliament and also including our Prime Minister who made this statement before.  I just want to 

make comments on this because of the spirit that I shared when I made my statement. 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to our tractor on the island of Aitutaki, there are private individuals who own their 

tractors.  It is not enough and that is why we are seeking for more tractors for our island and we 

will  also  notice  that  Aitutaki  is  the  second  island  supporting  our  economy.    Even  though  that 

Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara  Constituency have their tractor, when the  Democratic  Government 

comes, in we will give you another tractor.  We are trying our best in the Outer Islands especially 

in Aitutaki because we are all doing our best and it is costly today. Yes, we need to work together 

for  the  improvement  of  our  economy  and  the  improvement  of  our  country  in  case  there  is 

something that will happen we will be ready. 

</span></div><div><span>Like  what  our  Leader  have  mentioned  before,  we  look  and  we  support  our  people  and  our 

businesses, not for their party affiliation.  Maybe the government can be part of making partnership 

with some individuals or business people they can run their machines like tractors. 

</span></div><div><span>The stimulus package that was provided by the government, some individuals were unable to apply 

for this package for some reason.  These people wanted to buy their own machines but they know 

there are only two others who have their own machines. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Member for Arenikau for hiring his tractor to the island, even though his 

rates has increased but still, the service is still not enough for the island.  One of the difficulties 

that we have in the Outer Islands, when a Puna is given their own tractor, when it comes to election 

time and that person is not re-elected, that tractor remains with him.  I know that has been the case 

for the island of Aitutaki but I do not know of the other islands.  So I challenge the Member of 

Arenikau not to do that. 

</span></div><div><span>I believe that the best practice for each island is when this happens, for the management of these 

machines to go under the Island Council.  Secondly, it will be up to the Island Council to monitor 

and to be very cautious when hiring or operating these machines.  That is the reason why I stand 

to  give  my  support  and  if  the  government  can  give  some  allocations  to  support  some  of  the 

individuals to purchase some of the machines for agriculture. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and again, before the Honourable Nooroa 

Baker talk on the Vote Item, can I repeat again that when your first ten minutes is gone, you just 

sit down and stand up again.  Thank you Honourable Nooroa Baker; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. BAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  First of all, when I look at the Budget Book under 

the Agriculture Vote Item, under Net Operating Appropriation of $357,460,  I have no cause to 

</span><span>doubt this appropriation as we can see and understand the current situation of agriculture in our 

</span><span>country.  Most the food that is supporting our people is being grown in Rarotonga.  My request to 

the Ministry of Agriculture for them to develop a program to enable the Outer Islands to serve and 

to be able support our economic development. 

</span></div><div><span>22 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Sometimes, we see on Rarotonga there is not enough produce, bananas, taro, kumara and so forth 

and we see the increasing number of tourists and we see the increase in expenditure for imported 

food from New Zealand.  I believe if we develop a program to increase the growing of produce on 

the islands of Mangaia, Mauke, Atiu, Mitiaro and Aitutaki, we will not spend so much in importing 

food from New Zealand and that money can then be recycled back into the pockets of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>The problem that I see in the Outer Islands is that there is not enough labour hence why we do not 

see  an  increase  of  produces  at  the  market  in  Rarotonga.    Another  alternative,  maybe  the 

government can purchase the produces from these growers from the outer islands, give them the 

money and at that point in time, they will be encouraged to continue and then the government sells 

those produces in the shops.  We will then see the benefits on both sides, the government and the 

growers.  Maybe government can place an extra fifty cents on the produce they purchase from the 

growers. 

</span></div><div><span>This is what I can see because I spend quite a bit of time looking into this because I believe when 

money is placed directly into the hands of the growers, they get motivated.  We will then be able 

to  supply  our  local  markets  with  our  local  produces,  just  like  what  the  Member  for 

Pukapuka/Nassau have said about the taro from Pukapuka.  This would enable our people from 

Pukapuka/Nassau to export their taro to Rarotonga to sell.  The Prime Minister also mentioned 

about a new market that has been initiated, we could then be able to supply and support this new 

market. 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at forestry, I know that the Government have programs in place for about 30 years 

where the Government had planted trees in Mangaia, Mauke and Atiu.  We also see these trees in 

the  hills  at  Nikao,  Ngatangiia  and  Matavera.    I  have  visited  the  islands  of  Atiu,  Mauke  and 

Mangaia.    This  visit  was  to  inspect  these  forestry  areas  which  took  place  about  18  years  ago.  

Recently,  I  went  back  to  inspect  these  trees  and  I  can  confirm  that  these  trees  are  ready  for 

harvesting.  We know the price of timber today and to purchase timbers from New Zealand can be 

quite expensive because globally, there is a shortage for timber.  Therefore, I have looked at our 

forestry here in the Cook Islands.  I believe our forestry here is able to sustain our market and to 

help our local people in building their homes at an affordable price. 

</span></div><div><span>Today we see there is a new organisation that has entered the area of forestry, and this is Carbon 

Print.  They are saying that they will purchase the carbon from these trees that are seen in our 

country.  When you consider these offers and demands, you have to weigh it carefully.  We see 

the problem with our water.  I am talking on this forestry subject because I am a qualified expert 

on growing timber and cutting it as I was trained in New Zealand. 

</span></div><div><span>So, this is what I said, if we sell the carbon, where will we get the water from?  We see the big 

problem with water on Mangaia, Atiu and Mauke.  We know about their taro growing problems 

today, it has dried up because the pine trees that are growing in these areas have tap roots.  When 

</span><span>these pine tree grows, the tap roots grows and will seek for the water table.  So when you see a 

</span><span>fully grown tree, it is consuming 20 litres of water a day.  That is why we see the taro  patches 

getting dry. 

</span></div><div><span>23 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>That is why I am recommending for the Government to start harvesting these trees and then to 

replant more trees that are indigenous to our lands like mahogany, nono, coconut tree and so forth.  

In  terms  of  Agriculture,  we  should  really  be  cautious  about  this  Carbon  Print  because  I  have 

worked for a long time in the forestry industry in New Zealand.  Ninety percent of the timber is 

exported to China.  When it gets to China, it is soaked and submerged into  sea water and then 

when the time is right to retrieve these timber logs out of the sea, they resell them back to us.  This 

is why we see the increase of prices in timber. 

</span></div><div><span>That is why I am recommending for our timber forestry to be harvested as this is the appropriate 

time for harvesting our trees for the benefit of our people.  But it all depends on Mangaia, Atiu and 

Mauke.  They have to consider this matter further.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Nooroa Baker.  I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you for the opportunity for me to comment 

on this Appropriation for Agriculture.  For all the views given before on this Vote Item, I support 

all of them.  Firstly I would like to thank the Minister of Agriculture in regards to the Mangaia 

excavator.  The Members for Aitutaki and Matavera requested for tractors but we in Mangaia have 

asked for an excavator and for that, I thank him machine. 

</span></div><div><span>The issue we have Mr Chairman is in regards to agriculture is terms of the labour force.  I speak 

in regards to my village of Tamarua and most of the people that plants on a part time  basis are 

Public Servants and those that plants on a full time bases are our elderly people.  Providing this 

excavator will support our people with their planting efforts.   

</span></div><div><span>In the Budget book, under the goals for agriculture, I support all of these because these are all 

appropriated  for our  agriculture endeavours.   Goal  10,  to  increase  import  substitution,  increase 

food  production  as  well  as  retaining  arable  land,  these  are  the  things  we  need  to  improve.  

Agriculture firstly, to improve water, the road and availability of machinery.  We have noticed in 

the past of the rain that we have had where our taro patches are flooded.  So, it is rightful for me 

to  say  that  our  food  security  has  been  affected.    Today,  we  do  not  have  any  taro  ready  to  be 

harvested and our people are replanting taro.  This could be caused by COVID but I want to raise 

this because my people are patient people.  I am looking at the provision for Training especially 

training our children in agriculture.  The query here is, should an agriculture training be held on 

Rarotonga to include our children from the outer islands?  If not, on the individual islands?  I am 

happy to see this included in the Appropriation.  Also, the food and the ways of planting during 

this time because on my island, you can plant on your own land unlike on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>We would like to thank those who gave support from Climate Change to enable us to fence our 

plantations.  I stand to encourage that we maintain this kind of support so it will not disappear.  

One of the important things I have already mentioned is water because to those who have been to 

</span><span>Mangaia, you would have noticed a lot of unused lands.  Some people planting are still in the past 

</span><span>where  water  needs  to  be  carted  to  the  plantations.    But  for  those  people  who  are  near  the 

infrastructure where water is supplied is a fortunate.

</span></div><div><a>Page 25</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>As for the animals, we cannot just shoot any animals as they are vital food for our people.  Maybe 

this is the best time for me to make an introductory thought from our Island Council to government 

on the unavailability of ammunitions from the Police to control our animal population.  May the 

Minister of Police look into this as this has now been over a year?  The purpose of applying for 

these  ammunitions  is  to  help  our  planters  protect  their  crops  against  wild  pigs  and  wandering 

animals ploughing in the plantations.  Mr Chairman, those are my thoughts. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you.  I would recommend for Mangaia some bows and arrows.  You 

do  not  have  to  expend  anything  to  buy  bullets  and  all  that.    Sorry  for  Tamarua.    I  can  see  the 

Honourable Agnes Armstrong from Ivirua; you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG: </span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Just to reply to your bow and arrow, no, our 

animals are thick skin so the arrows will bounce off.  Thank you, just coming back for the Budget 

for  Agriculture  I  will  not  talk  on  the  figures  I  just  wanted  have  an  input  and  add  to  what  my 

colleague  from  Tamarua  has  just  applied.    Just  on  the  Agriculture  Outputs  1  to  3  and  their 

directions where they are going with planting, technical advice et cetera.  Just want to say thank 

you  very  much  for  all  the  advice  and  their  workshops  that  they  have  come  and  if  we  need  it 

specifically we just ask and when they can we get the technical advice and the technicians to come 

out  to  help  us.  I am  sure our workers in  the agriculture area on Mangaia, very  grateful  for the 

incitement to know how to prune tree, marcotting et cetera…we are very grateful for that advice. 

</span></div><div><span>But  I just wanted to explore one area which we can all look at hopefully. And which also was 

mentioned by the Honourable Member from Matavera. It with regards to our treatment plant. In 

order for us to expand in the Agriculture sector we need to introduce new plants, fruit trees and 

other  vegetables  that  we  can  try  and  see  if  we  can  make  a  living  out  of  it.  We  have  our  basic 

vegetables which everybody is into so we need to look further afield so we all get into planting a 

variety of crops. We need to look at the treatment plant for us here to safeguard the importation of 

any new species or new trees that we bring in and we need to work together with our partners 

overseas  like  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  New  Zealand,  the  Bio  Security  division  for  the 

assistance in helping us import or export from New Zealand into Rarotonga. So, by partnership 

each side does their bit in helping protect our island so we can like I said expand our horizons in 

the agriculture sector.  

</span></div><div><span>One other thing that I it is not only in agriculture but one thing that has been brought to my attention 

is  that  we  have  the  Private  Sector  that  have  a  business  and  then  we  have  government  who  at 

sometimes try to take over that business or to maybe assist but in a way it hurts the person that’s 

got a private business.  Maybe the department was not aware but I did have a discussion and I was 

told they were not aware of it but I just thought I would mention that, that we have to be mindful 

of where we help because it would affect somebody else. 

</span></div><div><span>But in all I support the Budget allocated.  I would like a bit more but time will tell if we put in the 

work we might get a bigger increase next time.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I now see the Honourable Minister; you 

have one minute.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman and all those from the Opposition side who 

have  raised  their  concerns.    I  would  like  to  give  my  regards  to  the  Head  of  the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture, the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture here in Rarotonga and the Outer Islands, even 

to our people that plants here in Rarotonga and in the Outer Islands, Kia Orana to you all.  I support 

the Appropriation Bill 2022.  I know that you are doing your best and especially with the Outer 

Islands, with the part of agriculture that you are carrying for the country.  We all know that the 

administration of the Outer Islands is under the Island Council and that our main office here in 

Rarotonga working closely together with our Agriculture Officers in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to touch on what the Member for Ruaau has said that the Ministry of Agriculture has or has 

died.  I am sad to hear this because his hair is white and he has been serving in the House for quite 

some time and this is what he is saying?  I really sympathize with the  staff of this Ministry.  I 

would have preferred if you have directed that statement to me in this House and that will be fine 

but instead you are directing it to our workers. 

</span></div><div><span>So I strongly support the Appropriation for the Ministry of Agriculture and I would like to ask 

Members of this House not to run down our staff in this Ministry but to uplift them and for us to 

work together.  God bless and thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,455,081 for Agriculture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, it is now time for our afternoon break and when we return, we will continue 

with the Audit debate.  Parliament is now suspended and will resume at 3.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.22 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 2.58 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I bring the House to order.  We are still in the Committee of Supply.  Now 

we come to Audit (PERCA).
