<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition, you may continue. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWN:</span><span>  As I was saying the Budget speech states that the increase of the 

Minimum Wage is something that does not happen overnight.  Twemty one years can hardly be 

described as overnight.  It is such a long time to wait for our low paid public servants to receive 

an increase. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Currently, we are short of labour force by 700 workers.  Many have left because of  better pay 

overseas.  And there are two groups of workers our locals and also the foreign workers.  And this 

is the funny thing the Recovery Roadmap invested money in upskilling our labour force.  This is 

to prepare us for the return of the tourist.  So, what has happened?  These workers many of whom 

are foreign workers have moved to New Zealand and taking with them the skills that we paid for. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now, the new plan is that we will subsidies the cost of bringing in replacement workers.  Who will 

doubtlessly because they will get better pay in New Zealand anyway.  If government is serious in 

maintaining  our  workforce.    We  will  do  two  things.    One  we  priorities  our  spending  not  new 

money,  we priorities our spending  and increase the wages for public servants  to  $12 per hour.  

Effective from 21 July 2022. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Increase of old age pension.  The twenty dollars increase is another desperate attempt to buy votes.  

Let me remind this house that these are people whose accounts this government raided.  Whose 

savings continued to be taxed and who were evicted from the Are Pa Metua last year.  Fifty dollars 

is peddely, hardly enough to ward off inflation.  Let alone to compensate them for the way they 

had been treated in the last four years.  This government should do the right thing.  We prioritise 

spending and give our elderly an increase of $300 a month and do not tax them.  That is what a 

Democratic government will do.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In his Budget speech the Prime Minister states and I am quoting from the Budget speech, having 

referred to  the tourism industry as  an interium fix.  He states, but  we know that we must look 

beyond  tourism  to  grow  our  economy  over  the  longer  term,  I’ve  said  before  that  economic 

diversification has always been on our agenda and this challenge cannot be addressed overnight.  

This is the second time the word overnight is used in the Budget speech.   

</span></div>
<div><span>And on this second occassion 12 years is a long time for the diversification agenda in the plan to 

be implemented.  It is unfortunate that this government has over the last 12 years put all our eggs 

in the one basket.  Government has relied on tourism to grow their economy driven by the Private 

Sector. One only needs to look  at  Governments  National  Sustainable Development  Plan to  see 

other  industries  mentioned  but  to  this  day  government  has  not  seriously  invested  in  any  other 

industry  except  tourism.  A  Democratic  Government  will  increase  the  private  sector  through 

entrepreneuring programs in agriculture, fisheries, education, forestry and new internet economy 

for example. Let me give you some examples, we are short of technical experts a good size of our 

Budget is spent on hiring overseas consultants to provide the technical expertise that we lacked. 

</span><span>Today and for the last twelve years our students at university have had to take student loans to 

</span><span>assist with their cost at university. Naturally they remain in New Zealand to pay off their loans. A 

Democratic Government economic foundation will be built by investing heavily in our children. 

This is all possible, first, you re-divert the funds that are budgeted for expense of consultants and

</span></div>
<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>instead, subsidize the cost of educating our children by up to 50 percent of the cost. That systems 

should also extend to those that have finished university working in New Zealand but paying off 

student loans. Mr Speaker, all of this can be done in this Financial Year. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I want to talk about Development Partners because when I go through the Estimate Book 1 there 

are graphs there that indicate the contribution that we are receiving from Country Development 

Partners. My understanding is that we have diplomatic relations with 56 countries altogether and 

these countries Mr Speaker could very well be Development Partners with us.  However, when we 

look in the Budget Book we only have 4 Country Development Partners, we have New Zealand, 

Japan, Australia and the European Union.  I have to say Prime Minister that the tables provided in 

the Estimate at Page 194 and what is provided at 193, needs explaining because 17.17 of Schedule 

10, it does not have a page number, when you look at that chart for the year 2021, 2022, 2023 you 

have only New Zealand at the top that appears to have make a contribution.  

</span></div>
<div><span>So, my four Country Development Partners may not be accurate it is based on the information in 

Book 1 which is in respect confusing.  But assuming that we have only four partners of the 56, we 

need to ask why we have not aggressively pursed partnership relations with other countries.  The 

reason why I am asking this question is to help with our borrowing and secondly to try and bring 

skills into the country without government having to pay heaps.   I will give an example; Pearl 

Farming in Manihiki and Rakahanga I recall that a few years back we tried to have a government 

to  government  relationship  with  the  Kiribati  Government  and  for  reasons  unknown  to  me  that 

arrangement collapsed.  The arrangement was to see whether we could get workers from Kiribati 

to work on farms in Manihiki.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The second problem that pearl farmers faced is the lack of technicians and why can we not have a 

government to government relationship with Japan to see whether we can make arrangements with 

regard to the provision of technicians.  I accept that currently another major problem in Manihiki 

is the lack of shells and also the condition of the lagoon. However, the lagoon has been curing 

itself  and  in  due  time  the  condition  in  the  lagoon  will  no  doubt  improve.    My  point  here,  Mr 

Speaker, is that having partnership with other countries who have the know-how can only assist.  

There are many other examples why simple relationships like that should not be encouraged.  We 

use to have a Hospitality School in Ngatangiia that is no longer the case. We know that Fiji has a 

Hospitability School for training, why do we not have a relationship with Fiji.  We know that the 

Republic of Germany is one of the leaders on waste management why do we not have a relationship 

with them.   

</span></div>
<div><span>We know that South Korea is way up the top with ICT why aren’t we talking with them and caging 

a partnership with them. And we can do this with every other aspect of our industry in our efforts 

to recover. Before I sit down and perhaps in response to my colleague the Member of Parliament 

for Pukapuka. I want to make it clear that my suggestions that I am making to government is not 

additional expense, not additional borrowing it is reprioritizing our spending.  Re-prioritizing the 

spend in this Budget and applying it to where it is needed most and I firmly believe that focussing 

</span><span>on prioritizing spending and investing in diversifying our economy will go a long way in assisting 

</span><span>our country.  Thank you.

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I now call the Honourable Prime Minister, 

Minister Responsible to conclude the debates on the Principles and Merits of the Bill. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Welcome back into the House the Leader of the 

Opposition.  I have received a report that you had a good trip up North and welcome back into the 

House.   

</span></div>
<div><span>We have spent the last day and a half, Mr Speaker listening to the Honourable Members comments 

on the Budget and I have to say there have been some very good comments that have come from 

both sides of the House on what is inside the Budget and some I guess same old talk that we hear 

particularly from our Members in the Opposition. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We hear commentary from some of them saying of we spend too much time on tourism, too much 

tourism,  too  much  tourism.    We  need  to  do  something  new  and  then  we  start  talking  about 

something old like export, export, we should export again.   

</span></div>
<div><span>The reality, Mr Speaker is that in the export industry the biggest earner is the airline when they 

charge you the freight.  The airline earns more than the final seller, then the transporter, all the 

way back to the final grower.  When you distribute the income that’s received the grower is left 

with what’s left over and much of the time there’s nothing left over and the grower is left with a 

debt. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Like the Honourable Member for Ruaau said, he used to export pawpaws, same as me.  I used to 

export pawpaw as well and I think the Pawpaw Industry in the mid-90s was earning about $1.5 

million a year for our country.  Exports in agriculture, they do not make you rich.  But they do 

provide you with an income. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture plays its role today and its increasing role on the back of tourism.  When we were 

exporting pawpaw we will be lucky if we got a dollar a kilo.  Moist of the time it was down to 

eighty cents or less for a kilo.  But today our growers are selling their pawpaw a dollar, two dollars 

each straight into their hands and we are not paying for bio-security.  Today our growers are selling 

their product to the re-emerging tourism market, to the hotels to the restaurants.  

</span></div>
<div><span>We just need to go down to the market, to the side of the road there’s our Mamas, Papas selling 

their produce, their food on the side of the road to the market here on Rarotonga. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We know the difficulties of trying to get into the export industry.  We just have to look to the taro 

exporters over the last few months, Mr Speaker and see the difficulties that they face in getting a 

good price for their product in New Zealand that matches what they can sell a sack of taro for here 

in Rarotonga.  But we have a company that is willing to give them a try, willing to buy their taro 

and we shall see how successful that export venture will be. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The same thing that we have heard many times before from the Opposition side is we spend too 

</span><span>much money for the Outer Islands.  So I was surprised to read in the Cook Islands News today the 

Deputy Leader of the Opposition from Ruaau saying we need to spend more money in the Outer 

Islands.  Your tune has changed, you are singing our song.

</span></div>
<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>Then again, Mr Speaker I hear another comment from the Opposition, we should be cutting the 

pay of our government workers especially the middle income and the high income public servants 

cut their pay.  I hope our public servants are listening to this commentary from Parliament today.  

This government’s policy has been to try and increase the income of our workers rightly so, so we 

can try and keep them here. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The people’s wages that are being proposed to be cut the middle and high income earners, these 

are the leaders within our public service departments.  The very people, Mr Speaker that we need 

to make sure that our Public Service  is running properly.  I think some of the Members of the 

Opposition have very short memory.  When we look back to 1996 the time of transition when we 

did  exactly  that,  cut  the  wages,  cut  the  Public  Service,  everyone  took  off  to  New  Zealand  and 

Australia.  So, Mr Speaker I haven’t heard anything new from the Opposition in terms of what 

they would do. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We have just heard the Leader of the Opposition say that they will lift the Minimum Wage to 12 

dollars  an  hour.    Minimum  Wage  usually  goes  to  those  beginning  in  the  work  force  or  those 

working jobs that do not require much qualification. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In the Private Sector, Mr Speaker I do not know of anyone who is paying Minimum Wage for any 

of their workers.  Right now the private sector is paying more than the Minimum Wage just to get 

workers and keep their workers. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I know of a couple of school boys, 17 years old working for one of the companies at night earning 

11 dollars an hour, Mr Speaker.  So this call, Mr Speaker was backed by a statement just now made 

by the Leader of the Opposition that 21 years ago the Minimum Wage was $7.50.  Now I know 

this is incorrect but is the Leader of the Opposition misleading Parliament?  I have been called a 

liar, Mr Speaker for my statement that I put out regarding legal advice that I sought.  I am sure the 

Leader of the Opposition doesn’t want to join me in that description with her statement she just 

made just a little while ago.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt and suggest that she received 

incorrect information because I have the wage review here from 2000, Mr Speaker.  The Minimum 

Wage in 2000, 22 years ago was $2.53.  It was increased at that time to $4 an hour with the Cabinet 

at that time suggesting that the Minimum Wage be increased incrementally until it reached the 

target of seven dollars an hour over the following years to 2003.   

</span></div>
<div><span>This is the time of the Democratic government Mr Speaker.  It was until 2006 when the Minimum 

Wage was increased to $5 an hour.  Not until this government came in Mr Speaker that we increase 

it from $5 to $7, to $7.50, to $8 and now in this Budget to $8.50.  But it is not the Minimum Wage 

Mr Speaker that we need to just look at, we need to look at the overall income earning capabilities 

of our people. 

</span></div>
<div><span>It is through the initiatives in the Budget Mr Speaker that we will do just that.  Not by following 

</span><span>the Democratic Party suggestion to cut the wages of the middle to high income earners.  Just so 

</span><span>you can increase the Minimum Wages.

<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>I can only say, thank goodness they are not in charge of the Budget.  In terms of the reference to 

our development partners Mr Speaker.  Quite rightly we have 56 countries that we have diplomatic 

formal relations with.  But many of those countries Mr Speaker are poorer than us and the intension 

of diplomatic relations  with  these countries Mr  Speaker is  to  increase our  global profile in  the 

world. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In the pacific, Mr Speaker we have diplomatic relations with all of our pacific island neighbours.  

We  are  one  of  the  wealthest  compared  to  them.    The  reference  to  the  development  partners  in 

Budget speech Mr Speaker was in reference to those development partners who have contributed 

to  our  COVID  response.    And  the  countries  I  referred  to  Mr  Speaker  are  those  countries  that 

provided the more significant amounts towards our response.   

</span></div>
<div><span>For a full list of the countries that contributed, countries and organisations that contributed to our 

COVID response; there is a chart of page 11 of our Budget book 1 which lists all of the countries 

and how much they provided.  And in the list Mr Speaker there are cash contributions and there 

are contribution in kind with materials, PPE gear and so forth. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Over the three years to date since the COVID started Mr Speaker contributions to our country have 

amounted  to  $103  million  in  terms  of  grants,  materials  and  equipments.    By  far  most  of  it  Mr 

Speaker was from the government of New Zealand close to $93 million over that three year finance 

period  that  was  given  to  support  our  response  to  COVID.    We  have  been  talking  to  our 

development partners in various sectors and areas that they can help us with. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The centre of excellence at the USP funded by the government of India specialising in IT.  In India 

of course in one of their city is one of the most advance in terms of IT development in the world.  

More recently Mr Speaker my recent discussion with President Fritck of French Polynesia who 

expressed a keeness and willigness to engage in hospitality tranining exchange between our people 

here and their people in French Polynesia. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Not only in terms of upgrading and skilling up for the hospitality industry but also as a means for 

their workers to improve their English language skills and for our workers to improve their french 

and tahitian language skills.  But more than anything Mr Speaker this Budget provides opportunity 

for those who can see the opportunity and be able to take advantage of that opportunity. 

</span></div>
<div><span>This Budget follows on from the previous two years, Mr Speaker from the work that government 

has done to protect our country and to reshape it and rebuild it so that our recovery in the new 

world we will be best prepared for.  And those opportunities are already starting Mr Speaker we 

can see with the increase numbers of people coming to our country with the vibrancy at the market 

where people are selling their products and their produce.  We are well and truly on the way to 

recovery. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We’ve heard what the Opposition will do in the new year if they become government.  They will 

</span><span>cut the wages of workers and they make things more expensive for the private sector.  Therefore 

</span><span>Mr  Speaker  this  Budget  that  we  have  presented  before  this  House  we  know  that  the  people 

welcome this Budget and look forward to making the best of the opportunities that now we have 

moving into the new year I commend this Budget before the House, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana.
