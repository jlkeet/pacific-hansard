<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity and to the Member 

of Parliament for Matavera, thank you for allowing some time for me to speak. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I begin with my question or speech, the Scripture says, </span><span>“Teach us to number our days, that 

we may gain a heart of wisdom”.  “Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path”. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question Mr Speaker and those listening in from the Cook  Islands and from outside of the 

Cook Islands, is directed to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Honourable Leader, I was 

very disappointed with an article that was published in the Cook Islands Newspaper last week that 

was written by the CEO of the Opposition on 18 May 2022.  The article stated that this person will 

sue the Government.  Mr Speaker, I am going to be tough on this topic because this man will not 

be suing the Government only, he will also be suing the people of the Cook Islands.  Who is the 

Government of the Cook Islands?  It is the people of the Cook Islands.  Who gave the authority to 

such person to sue the Government?  We will not be the only Government in power, there will be 

another Government who will take over.
