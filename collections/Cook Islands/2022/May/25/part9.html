</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker,  I will only speak for about 10 minutes.  

Regarding the Vote Item for Audit Office, I support it.  One of the reason I support it is the fee 

they  pay  because  the  fees  that  is  paid  towards  Training  Revenue  has  increased.    It  has  been 

allocated for $95 thousand.  As well as the allocation under POBOC, this has also been increased. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  now  to  speak  on  their  operation.    Under  Operations  Output  2,  we  are  looking  at 

expenditures throughout Ministries.  Under Output 3 is the conducting special investigations into 

ministries  that  maybe  had  discrepacies  in  their  operations.    I  am  grateful  as  we  look  at  this 

allocation because it has been explained to us. 

</span></div><div><span>When look for the allocation for last year in Book 2 and this is where you will find the allocation 

for Audit.   There was  no provision  then like this  Budget  for this  year.   That  is  why  I stood to 

support the allocation under training revenue.  And regarding reporting by Ministries I also support 

the work they do in providing reports to this House.   

</span></div><div><span>During my time in government only the Audit Report comes to parliament.  When you read their 

report  for  the  year  2019  with  in  this  report  it  will  stipulate  the  audit  reports  of  the  Ministries 

whether it is qualified or unqualified.  Then that provides you confidence for the appropriation for 

this year.  This will present to us the performance of government departments for the previous 

years.  I recommend to the Members of Parliament to go back and read the report for 2019. 

</span></div><div><span>I know most of you do not want to look back.  You all want us to move forward.  This is the only 

way for us to ensure how things are progressing whether it is for the good until then and now.  I 

have come to the end Mr Chairman and I support it.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Vaitoti Tupa and I see the Honourable Selina Napa 

and you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Chairman for giving this opportunity to speak on this 

Vote  Item.    I  want  to  touch  on  Output  3,  Special  Reviews  for  Investigations  and  Performance 

Audit.  Their goals in this output is to strengthen the accountability, transparency and integrity of 

government and the public sector entities.  And to ensure that the elective officials acts in the best 

interest of the citizens they represent. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to talk about the young people working in the Audit Office.  I would like to commend 

them  knowing  that  it  is  a  difficult  task  in  preparing  the  reports  but  these  are  still  getting  to 

Parliament  on  schedule.    I  am  looking  at  Output  3  on  Personnel,  it  is  $140  thousand  and  the 

Operation is $29 thousand.  So I am wondering if this alloction for Operation is sufficient to assist 

them to carry out their duties. 

</span></div><div><span>My concern here is there are other sectors that I am concerned with in book 1 for Audit.  I am not 

</span><span>certain the reason they are not entered in Book 2.  Especially under the items listed in book 1 from 

</span><span>Budget administration, Personnel, operation and all these allocation.  But when I look at book 2 

under output 3 for Operations, this is a very crucial part in the work of our officials in the Audit 

</span></div><div><span>27 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>office.  Specially in conducting investigations into the operations whether we are carrying out our 

Businessess Properly. 

</span></div><div><span>My thoughts of considerations is the time that they are preparing the reports to come to this House 

and yet they spend so much time in preparing these reports and we limit the time of debate on 

these.  However I would like to encourage our officials in this ministry to carry on the good work 

and I know this is one of the difficult parts in our work in government.  So, I do support this Vote 

Item for Audit however when I look at the allocation under operation I do believe that this is not 

sufficient but overall I give my full support to this Vote Item.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>   Kia Orana Mr Chairman.  I rise to share my thoughts on this 

allocation of the Budget.  First of all, I am sure that we understand the importance of the Audit 

Office.    This  Office  is  responsible  for  auditing  the  accounts  for  the  different  Government 

Ministries,  Ministers’  offices  and  Leader  of  the  Opposition’s  office.    We  understand  that  this 

Office is a separate Office where the Government cannot tell them how to write their Report. 

</span></div><div><span>As part of this Office is the PERCA.  We know that their responsibility is to handle the complaints 

received from our people and/or from Public Servants.  Under the PERCA Act, they have the legal 

rights to summon anyone or to get anyone to provide information.  I want us to look at Page 19 of 

Book 2.  When we look at the Reports submitted by PERCA, they are listed on the Parliament 

Papers listing for presenting to Parliament for discussion. 

</span></div><div><span>We know that all the six bullet point Reports have been tabled.  However, I understand that during 

the consultation of these Reports, it seemed that the Opposition side were the only ones who had 

contributed towards these Reports during discussion, I believe that the Government should also 

contribute as well because they are the ones that are being accused.  The Government should also 

be giving us updates on what the Report entails and those being accused and guidelines on what 

can be done for this person to be disciplined. 

</span></div><div><span>We have not heard anything like that at all.  So the question is, what is the importance for PERCA 

in investigating these accusations because PERCA is directly responsible to Parliament?  When 

PERCA presents their Reports, we tend not to discuss it.  Sometimes, we get frustrated with them 

for mentioning us in their Reports, there is nothing we can do because that is what they do.  So, 

we will then question whether the appropriation for PERCA is a waste of time because when their 

Report is tabled, it just disappeared.  

</span></div><div><span>From the Opposition side’s perspective,  I believe PERCA is a good initiative.  It is because of 

PERCA, we were able to see the different problems there are in the different Ministries.  I could 

see that there is one report from PERCA in this Parliament Sitting and that is to with a business.  I 

</span><span>also know that when this Parliament Sitting is over, unless there is something to be said on that 

</span><span>Report that Report will just disappear once Parliament adjourns.  Mr Speaker, in case I forget, if 

you could please remind us today or the following day, when this Report is presented, maybe you 

could remind us by moving a Motion for this Report to be adjourned to the next Parliament.  To 

</span></div><div><span>28 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>me, it is important that the allocation for this Ministry, PERCA, is worth paying for even though 

their responsibility is to audit the different Ministries and State Owned Enterprises.  But in addition 

to that, there is a PERCA that has been approved by the Minister in charge of PERCA whose role 

is to investigate complaints from members of the public.  Where it fails, it fails when it comes to 

Parliament where we do not give the attention that it deserves.  

</span></div><div><span>Also on Page 19, we look at the Table there that has been provided on the Audit Reports of the 

Financial Year.  I am sad because when we look at 2016, there were 41 entities that did not provide 

their Audit Financial Accounts.  When we look at the number of entities altogether, there are 41.  

When we look at 2017, there are 36 entities and then when we move up, there are 10 entities.  The 

question is, where are the Ministers Responsible for these entities and why are they not following 

up with the Head of Ministries to be up to date with their Audit Reports?  When we look at 2021, 

it is just a modern day from last year, there were 21 entities that did not provide their Accounts 

and that is more than half.  So, what exactly are we, the governing body, those in this Parliament 

are doing to assist the Audit Office to do their job?  We know not so long ago, there was a little 

bit  of  a  tug  war  between  MFEM  and  the  Audit  Office  because  of  the  lack  of  provision  of 

information.   

</span></div><div><span>My belief is, your role as Ministers, it is your job to say to your HOM do this, do that, do this, do 

that because at the end of the day it will affect the auditing of the country accounts.  Of course 

under the Constitution, our country accounts must be audited annually and we know that we have 

not been able to comply and it maybe it is because the Ministry’s account has not been audited.  

So, I believe, with the appropriation that is allocated for the Audit Office, we should support that 

as they are doing their job where this whole system fails is here in Parliament, we do not discuss 

the Reports and the Ministries and you Ministers who do not follow up your Heads of Departments 

to  provide  their  accounts  to  Audit  for  auditing.    Before  I  sit  down  and  when  the  Minister 

Responsible responses, if you may as I am looking at the chart on Page 28 of Book 2, I cannot see 

where PERCA connects on that chart.  Can you please clarify because I would think that PERCA 

is being paid out of the Audit Budget if not then perhaps you can direct us to where we should be 

looking at.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I can see the Honourable Member Vaine 

Mokoroa. 

</span></div><div><span>HON V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to us all today.  I would like to thank 

all the Members who have supported the Audit Office.  Before I proceed, I would like to thank 

Allen,  Director  for  Audit  and  his  staff  for  providing  their  Appropriation  to  this  House.    Mr 

Chairman, there are two Reports that were tabled by by the Audit Office by PERCA on Monday 

and that is Paper 137 and Paper 138.  These PAC Reports were also highlighted on the importance 

of the Audit Office in chasing after the Departments or Ministries who fails to file in their Annual 

Report.  In Papers 137 and 138 that PERCA had tabled, they also highlighted recommendations 

for the two concerned Ministries to consider and improve upon.  

</span></div><div><span>In  response  to  what  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  was  saying  as  to  why  21  Reports  were  not 

submitted in 2021 and eight in 2020.  In 2022, seven Ministries did not submit their Reports.  The 

reason to this, as alluded to by the Opposition, one of the issues between MFEM and the Audit 

</span></div><div><span>29 

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Office is the confidentiality of some information  with MFEM.  This RMD Ministry is the Tax 

Office.    RMD  legislations  forbids  the  release  of  these  information  to  the  public.    Due  to  the 

restrictions  in  this  legislation,  this  is  the  reason  why  these  information  are  not  presented  to 

Parliament.  That is why the number of entities have reached 21.  But through their settlement in 

rectifying these issues so they would not breach any legislations, they were able to negotiate hence 

their number for 2022 is seven.   

</span></div><div><span>On the second question posed by the Opposition of the position of PERCA on the Organizational 

Charts,  my  own  understanding,  the  Audit  Office  pays  for  the  expenditure  for  the  PERCA 

Committee.    Why  this  was  not  included  in  our  Organizational  Chart,  I  will  report  back  to 

Parliament on that tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, in regards to the Appropriation for this Ministry, consequently, there is a problem 

being placed on them.  Last year, their revenue that is being appropriated to them is $60,700.  In 

this Appropriation Bill 2022, their allocation of revenue almost doubled to $156,300 and this is to 

help renovate their Ministry.  I feel sorry for this Ministry but then again, we understand the reason 

why.  Last year, we were affected by COVID in which it impacted this Office including all the 

different Ministries of this country.  This is the reason why their revenue had dropped when they 

requested for it last year.  This year, there is an increase to their revenue because our intention is 

to improve our current situation and our work and for this Office to be able to achieve their goals.  

Mr Chairman that is all I have to say.  I believe that we will all support this Ministry for the work 

they will do for this year until next year.  God bless and thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $1,132,654 for Audit (PERCA) stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Business Trade and Investment Board, debate time is for 30 minutes.   

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $611,266 for Business, Trade and Investment Board stands part of the 

Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>The Floor is open for Members.  I can see the energetic Honourable Member 

Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman  for  this  allocation  for  BTIB.    When  I  look  at  their 

</span><span>allocation  for  Trading  Revenue,  it  has  been  reduced.    But  I  do  believe  it  is  appropriate  to  be 

</span><span>reduced.    We  know  in  the  past  couple  of  years  and  last  year,  this  Ministry  went  through  an 

investigation.    I  do  believe  though  that  this  special  investigation  is  completed  and  maybe  the 

</span></div><div><span>30 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Minister himself will explain the situation with this special investigation.  I have no problems with 

this Vote Item, I support it. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to the administration programme under Output 3, Foreign Investment because in this 

programme, a review is being carried out in proposing a Bill to help strengthen the responsibilities 

of this Department.  The name of this Bill is called, the Draft Foreign Investment Framework.  I 

do believe that under this Output, this will help improve their performance.  When I was examining 

this Department,  there  seemed to be  some discrepancies since 2019.   But  I do believe  that the 

Minister of today has managed to address these issues.  Therefore Mr Chairman, I support this 

Appropriation.    This  is  all  I  wanted  to  share,  Output  3  programme,  strengthening  Foreign 

Investment here in the Cook Islands and overseas.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition, Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I just want to present my thoughts on 

this part of our Budget.  We can see all the Outputs and we can see all the work being done since 

last year and the year before for ‘Go Local’ in an effort to improve the situation for our people 

here in the Cook Islands.  We know that a Website has been developed to help sell products such 

as  handicrafts  from  the  Outer  Islands.    I  will  not  talk  much  on  that  area  because  I  can  see  the 

progress of this initiative. 

</span></div><div><span>The area that I would like to focus on, because during COVID, we should be mindful in reviewing 

the Government’s Policies because we want to encourage Foreign Investment.  Why?  Because 

foreign  investment  bring  foreign  money  into  the  country,  create  jobs.    I  know  there  are  some 

restrictions around that which is good and on the Website of BTIB, if you want to invest in the 

Cook Islands, when you go on their Website, it provides information that helps people see what it 

is that they need to do to qualify.   

</span></div><div><span>We know that foreign investment can come to the island in many forms either totally foreign or 

some sort of joint venture with Cook Islanders.  The part that I struggle to understand is that it does 

not  look  to  me  like  there  is  enough  being  done  to  promote  us  as  a  country  that  is  worthwhile 

investing in. 

</span></div><div><span>We know that for example, when tourists are on the island, tourism goes out with all the private 

people, owners of accommodation and they do their promotion aggressively so visitors will come 

into our country.  I am saying this because I know that most of the time, it is difficult for some of 

the  applications  to  be  approved  or  be  reviewed  by  the  BTIB  Board.    Quite  often,  when  such 

application is deferred or when the application is sent back by the Board, this is due to the lack of 

information  being  provided.    Maybe  the  Minister  Responsible  for  BTIB  should  encourage  the 

process to be looked at because the process is, when the applications from foreigners are received, 

you will see which boxes are not ticked and you will know whether the application is ready before 

</span><span>it gets submitted to the Board.  I am aware that there has been many people who have wanted to 

</span><span>invest but have gone away because serious investors do not want to hang around.  They want to 

put their money there and if we do not want their money they go somewhere else and the difficulty 

I have is that we do need their money, it is just that our process is taking long. 

</span></div><div><span>31 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>So to the Minister in Charge, maybe this is an area that we should look at.  It used to be an area 

that was handled very well in the past in my experience.  I just want to add that sometimes the 

advise from BTIB, you need to have a local partner and then we will approve it.  Maybe we should 

encourage  the  people  that  are  handling  the  applications  not  to  assume  a  role  that  is  not  theirs 

because we know as lawyers, if you have two partners that are just made up for the sake of putting 

them together it is doomed to collapse from Day 1. 

</span></div><div><span>Instead,  those  that  process  the  application  should  say,  well  I  think  you  should  go  and  take  the 

advise of your lawyer.  So, that Mr Chairman is my contribution and I hope that we will find that 

helpful but I support the Budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister Responsible; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. ARIOKA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I stand to also thank all the Members that have 

given  good  contributions  to  the  Budget  allocation  that  has  been  set  for  BTIB.    No  doubt  the 

Honourable Tina Pupuke  Browne, those comments are pretty much truly the key concerns and 

issues to date that BTIB is to be working hard to improve on in the coming months ahead. 

</span></div><div><span>Like all other agencies Mr Chairman, the BTIB allocations is a slight reduction and that is because 

we are at the time where BTIB is now working hard to restrageties its position for the years to 

come.  Therefore Mr Chairman, it is fair for me to say thank you to the CEO of BTIB Repeta Puna 

and also her hard working staff and those who have also moved on from BTIB. 

</span></div><div><span>But the most important people that I need to acknowledge Mr Chairman is the former Chairman 

George Pitt  as  well as his  team  the  Board of Directors of BTIB who worked hard for the past 

couple of years.  Since the commencement of the functional review Mr Chairman the Board had 

been working tirelessly to ensure that every aspects of BTIB follow a roles and responsibilities 

and core functions are being reviewed thoroughly. 

</span></div><div><span>With those recommendations that has been peer reviewed by independent consultants and these 

are consultants of our own people.  The key recommendations that I think the Honourable House 

would be happy is that BTIB needs to refocus its core responsibilities as stipulated in the Act.  And 

I am to announce that today Mr Chairman is the fact that, that recommendations has oversighted 

by Cabinet and it has been approved for implementation. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I would like to acknowledge a number of agencies who have been involved in that functional 

review because BTIB is an agency that does not work on its own but it works in tandem with all 

stakeholders  critical  to  the  success  of  business  development  in  our  country.    Most  critical  Mr 

Chairman is the Ministry of Agriculture who has played an integral role for farmers and growers 

in small enterprises. 

</span></div><div><span>The Ministry of Marine and Resources whose been part of our fisheries industry, the Chamber of 

Commerce who is the major drive for our private sector.  As well as the Cook Islands Tourism 

Authority  who  has  been  a  main  driver  for  our  tourism  industry.    Immediately  I  think  we  can 

</span></div><div><span>32 

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>understand the broadness in depth and breath of how much BTIBs core responsibility has to take 

on and ensure that their program is consistent with these agencies. 

</span></div><div><span>Although it is a small agency of 12 staff I still believe that it is still too small and that has not been 

taken into consideration in this financial year.  And therefore, the BTIB has a lot of work ahead of 

itself and I believe as a Minister for BTIB there will be new policies and guidelines that will be 

instituted by BTIB to improve their processes, systems to help our small enterprises in the country. 

</span></div><div><span>Many of those are being clearly identified by our Members of the Opposition and I thank them 

very much for those key matters that have been raised that are already been taken into account and 

will be part of the improvement of BTIB moving forward.  So, in that light Mr Chairman I would 

like to thank all Members for their support through this part of the Appropriation and thank you 

all for your kind support in areas that I think are critical to BTIB and our business enterprise in the 

country.  Thank you very much.    

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $611,266 for Business Trade and Investment Board stands part of the 

Schedule?
