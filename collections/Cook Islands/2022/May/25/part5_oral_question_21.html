<h3>Oral Question 21</h3>
<div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  Firstly, Kia Orana to you all on that side of the House and Kia Orana to us 

all on this side of the House.  I am shocked at this question but I am also happy that he had asked 

me this question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I want the people of my Constituency of Ngatangiia to hear the generosity given by the Prime 

Minister, the Government and ICI because as we know, the funding for this project has already 

been allocated in the Appropriation last year.  I am very happy because I know this road will go 

inland to Turangi because if it had gone up to Avatiu valley, then it should go to Turangi valley as 

well. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Not  forgetting  the  biggest  water  catchment  on  the  island  in  Avana,  so,  to  ICI  and  the  Prime 

Minister, the people of Ngatangiia would like to acknowledge your generosity because we know 

that  this  project  is  about  to  begin  within  two  weeksâ€™  time.    I  would  also  like  to  thank  TRIAD 

Pacific  Petroleum  Limited  because  they  are  the  contractors  for  this  project.    To  our  people  in 

Ngatangiia,  let us  clap in joy because this  blessing will  soon begin  in our village.    I thank my 

colleague from Matavera for raising this question. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.   This tells you to never trust your friends.  I 

</span><span>see the Honourable Member Nooroa Baker; you have the Floor.
