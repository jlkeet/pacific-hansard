<h3>Oral Question 22</h3>
<div><span>MR N. BAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Member of Parliament 

for Pukapuka/Nassau, the Honourable Tingika Elikana.  I was listening to his speech yesterday, it 

was just beautiful.  I heard him say that tourism will start in the North and fish and taro will be 

exported to the Northern Group Islands.  So, my question to him is, why not import it to Rarotonga 

instead, we are waiting for the fish and taro from that side?  Can it be shipped to Rarotonga?  We 

may be able to pay your money back?
