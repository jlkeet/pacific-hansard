<h3>Oral Question 9</h3>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable 

Members of this House, the Government side and the Opposition side, Kia Orana in the Name of 

the Father.  To those listening in and watching us on livestream, Kia Orana.  The answer to this 

question is not a simple yes or no.   

</span></div>
<div><span>First of all, the CEO for the Office of the Opposition is also the President of the Organisation called 

Friends of Fiji.  The article he wrote with Cook Islands News, he wrote that article as President of 

that Organisation.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I looked at the depth of this writing and just like the Prime Minister, I consulted with some of the 

senior-level lawyers on the island.  This is an issue that none of us on the Immigration Select Panel 

was aware of.  During the consultation process, nobody brought this to our attention.  Honourable 

Minister, under our Constitution, it says that we cannot be biased with people.  Just like in the 

United States of America, if you have dark coloured skin, there is a separate law that applies to 

you.  If you have white coloured skin, there is also a separate law that applies to you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Under our Constitution, colours white, yellow and black are the same, even brown for the Northern 

and  Southern  Group  Islands.    If  we  look  at  this  issue  very  closely,  there  is  an  issue  in  our 

Immigration Act that talks about the era of the whites and era of the blacks.  To me, as I am his 

boss in the Office of the Opposition, it made sense because I have read the Constitution.  If they 

feel that they want to take an issue to court, they have the rights to do so and we should not obstruct 

their rights.  Therefore, Honourable Minister, if you really look deep in your heart, our laws says 

that we should not be biased with white coloured people and dark coloured people.  

</span></div>
<div><span>That is my answer Honourable Minister, unless you have another Supplementary Question?  

</span></div>
