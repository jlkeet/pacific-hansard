<h3>Oral Question 3</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Earlier in question times I extended my 

greetings  to  those  of  us  in  the  House.    I  now  wish  to  extend  these  greetings  to  the  Queens 

Representative and Lady Marsters, to our Ui Ariki and Aronga Mana, to the Religious Advisory 

Council and our various denominations and in particular to the people of Rakahanga, to our three 

denominations in Rakahanga the CICC, the Catholic and the SDA, to the Mayor of the island and 

the Island Council and the Public servant, to the EO, to all our elderly people and our children and 

those who hold positions in the various organisations on the island.  If I have missed out anyone 

my  apologies  and  to  all  those  who  are  watching  live  stream  and  those  listening  on  the  radio 

greetings to you all in the name of our Heavenly Father.  

</span></div>
<div><span>In the Prime Ministers  Budget  speech, he seems  to  take all the  credit  for how our  country has 

</span><span>handled the pandemic.  I noticed that he grouped the Democratic Party together with the United 

</span><span>Party and accused us of fearmongering meaning that we were putting fear into our people about 

COVID-19 and secondly we the Democratic Party was against lifting the border.  That is so far 

from  the truth.  First,  let me remind the Prime Minister and this House that it was us, me that

<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>suggested right at the start when we were alerted to the pandemic that we close the border. And 

this was so immediately after we had consultation at the Auditorium with TMO and the Crown 

Law Office. Members will recall that the issue at the time was would it be unconstitutional if Cook 

Islanders were denied entry into the Cook Islands. Should the border be closed? The advice we got 

from the Crown Law at the time was that closing the border will not be unconstitutional. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Honourable Member I have to disrupt you please. It is now time for recess. You 

can continue when we come back. Sitting will be resumed at 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.29 a.m. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Sitting resumed at 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>All be seated.  Before we suspended, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition 

Tina Pupuke Browne was on the Floor.  You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  before  we  adjourned,  I  was  talking  about  the 

meeting that we had at the Auditorium with the TMO Officials and Crown Law Office.  One of 

the issues that was being discussed was if we were to close the border what would be the effect as 

far as Cook Islanders are concerned. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The advice from the Crown Law was that closing the border will not be unconstitutional because 

we will not be denying entry but simply delaying it.  I was therefore surprised when I suggested 

for the border to be closed the former Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister now the Prime 

Minister  and  our  colleagues  across  the  Floor  laughed  at  the  suggestion  claiming  it  would  be 

unconstitutional.  This was so notwithstanding the advice given at the auditorium. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Not  long  after  that  maybe  two  or  three  weeks,  New  Zealand  closed  its  border.    Government 

panicked.  The former Prime Minister called us back into the House to pass our first COVID-19 

legislation to allow for the border to be closed and we supported that legislation.  All of this will 

be check on the Hansard. 

</span></div>
<div><span>At the early stages of the pandemic we approached government on a number of occasions offering 

our help if needed, indicating that we should work together in the best interest of our country.  That 

offer was not welcomed.  And then I heard, yesterday I think it might have been, yes yesterday 

from two of my colleagues from the North namely the Member of Parliament for Wales and the 

Member of Parliament for Tongareva suggesting that we have not been working together or co-

operating with government. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I looked up the definition of co-operation.  I went to Mr Google and asked him what it means.  The 

meaning is quite clear, co-operation means the action or process of working together to the same 

end.  So it is not making decisions on your own and without us having an input and then expecting 

</span><span>us to agree, that is not co-operation or working together. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Over the last two years, we have seen how the pandemic affected our economy.  We understood 

the need to protect our people by keeping the border closed but we were also very much aware of 

</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>the impact this would have on our economy.  We were therefore very supportive of the border 

being lifted once a good majority of our people were vaccinated.  Now the only difference between 

government and us the Democratic Party is that we would have lifted the border earlier so we could 

start the recovery earlier. 

</span></div>
<div><span>We understood at an early stage that there will come a day when we will have to learn to live with 

this virus.  That day has come.  So Prime Minister it was very misleading to say that the Democratic 

were fearmongering.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I should perhaps add at this point that going through the Budget Speech and given that Members 

have only a limited time to speak on the merits and principles I have chosen some only of the areas 

that is covered in the Budget Speech.  These are the areas I consider are priority. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The PM claims that notwithstanding uncertainties the economic outlook is showing early positive 

signs.  I say that this is because his forecast is overly optimistic.  One of the uncertainties he refers 

to  is  the  expectation  of  higher  inflation  over  the  next  two  years.    I  agree  we  have  no  control 

whatsoever over inflation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The Prime Minister refers to  global issues and the Russian war against Ukraine and it will get 

worse not better, worse.  Our country, Mr Speaker has already felt inflation.  Simple things like 

butter that used to be seven dollars is now 12.50, corned beef used to be 7.50 now 10 dollars and 

this is in Rarotonga.  Imagine how much these items will cost in the Northern Group and any of 

the other Pa Enua.  So the outlook in the Budget Speech is based on very optimistic forecast. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In revenue from tourism, tax, et cetera and in my view downplays the very real uncertainties that 

we face. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Minimum Wage increase.  Mr Speaker, an increase of fifty cents on the Minimum Wage will have 

no effect on the workers and what they take home.  It is a desperate attempt to buy votes but no 

effect on the worker’s pay.  For a worker in Rakahanga an extra $17 a week will not even get him 

two kilos of frozen chicken. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The reality is that we are competing with New Zealand for the same pool of workers.  The question 

we should ask ourselves is how much a fifty cents increase we will have when New Zealand is 

paying $21?  The answer is zero.   

</span></div>
<div><span>A Democrtic government will do the right thing.  We will pay $12 per hour.  Why?  Twenty one 

years  ago,  the  wage  was  $7.50  and  that  was  21  years  ago.    The  Prime  Minister  states  that  the 

increase does not happen overnight. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>   Mr Speaker, I stand to move a Motion:

<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>That speaking time for the Leader of the Opposition is extended to enable her to continue 

with her response to the Ministerial Statement by the Prime Minister 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, the extension of speaking time, I am seeking the support of all the Members so that 

our Leader of the Opposition can continue until she finishes her response to the speech of the Prime 

Minister; rather than the allocation of 10 minutes.  I am seeking the support of every Member of 

this Parliament so that the Leader of the Opposition can continue and finish her response to the 

Prime Minister’s Ministerial Statement.
