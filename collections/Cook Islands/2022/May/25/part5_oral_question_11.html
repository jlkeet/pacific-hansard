<h3>Oral Question 11</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition, the 

Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne.   I heard you talking about the two colours, black and white.  

These colours are inside of me and I have been using them from the beginning as Tupapa is on the 

ball.  However, I have no grudges again colours anymore.  My favourite colours are green and 

yellow and that is it. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  a  Supplementary  Question  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    She  never 

answered my question with a  yes or no.  She exaggerated, hence my Supplementary Question.  

Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the question is, do you support changes to be done to the 

Permanent Residency process as you are a Member of the Immigration Select Panel?
