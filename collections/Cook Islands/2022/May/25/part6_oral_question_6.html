<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the normal course would be to move a Motion to suspend the 

Standing Orders first, but I think you have made it clear that you are inclined to it.  I am rising to 

support the leader of the government, the Prime Minister and also in support of the Motion put 

forward by the Honourable Member for Matavera.   

</span></div>
<div><span>As I can hear those with big businesses in the Private Sector starting to enjoy the speech in terms 

of affordability for their  new  employees  with  a new rate of Minimum Wage.   Thank  you very 

much. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana
