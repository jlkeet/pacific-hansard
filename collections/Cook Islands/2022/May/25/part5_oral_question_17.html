<h3>Oral Question 17</h3>
<div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Honourable Minister of Sports.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I really enjoyed our dinner with the President of the Olympic Committee.  That was the first dinner 

I went to where all the invitees that attended were actual sports people like myself, I won gold 

medal  from  the  last  game  and  the  Prime  Minister  won  his  gold  medal  from  Boxing,  even  the 

Minister of Sports won his gold medal from touch rugby.  That night was beautiful.  It was great 

listening to the President of Sports Association acknowledging the Government for the funding 

they gave for Sports.  

</span></div>
<div><span>Sports is  not  new to  me,  I support Sports.  What  you are hearing,  I  am  sure  you have hearing 

problems.   We have no  intention of cancelling  the Cook  Islands  Games.  What  for?  Sports is 

beneficial not only for our health, but to help those with health problems like NCDs.  Looking 

around in this Honourable House, I can see that the majority of us are close to reaching NCD or is 

in the state of NCD.  We need to encourage Sports, in fact, when we become the Government, we 

will  increase  the  funds  allocated  for  Sports.    A  classic  example  Honourable  Minister,  our 

Rakahanga team have been fundraising since last year.  We have recruited the best sports players 

from around the world.  We also looked at the type of sports with the most gold medals such as 

weight lifting, boxing and those individual sports, those are the sports that we aim to go for so we 

may  score  more  gold  medals.    Regardless  of  the  small  number  of  participants  we  had  in  our 

Rakahanga team compared to the other teams from the North like Penrhyn and Manihiki, we scored 

the most gold medals in the Cook Islands Games from the Northern Group.  Our team had the 

highest number of participants when we marched onto the fields that had more people Rarotonga 

than Rakahanga.  I know that the Rakahanga team is preparing themselves and quite in fact, they 

are looking forward to the Cook Islands Games to be held in September.
