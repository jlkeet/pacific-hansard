<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Member,  are  you  asking  for  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition to end her speech in 10 minutes? 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>   Mr Speaker, if her speech  exceeds  10 minutes, then  I  seek the support of the 

Speaker and all the Members of Parliament so that the Leader of the Opposition can finish her 

speech.  I believe that there is only one more page but if it extends over the10 minutes, then I seek 

for the support of the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank  you Mr Speaker.   I would be quite happy to support a Motion to 

increase the Honourable Leader of the Opposition speaking time to double the normal extension 

from  10  minutes  to  20  minutes  because  I  am  enjoying  listening  to  her  right  now  Mr  Speaker.  

Thank you.
