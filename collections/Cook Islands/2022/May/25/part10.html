<div><span>COOK ISLANDS INVESTMENT CORPORATION: 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Debate time is for about 1 hour. 

</span></div><div><span>I propose the Question:  

</span></div><div><span>That the sum $3,527,000 for the Cook Islands Investment Corporation stands part of the 

Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Floor is open for Honourable Members. 

</span></div><div><span>I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the appropriation for 

CIIC.  Mr Chairman, I have no problem with this allocation and I give my support.  But I want to 

talk  about  the  amount  that  is  appropriated  because  when  we  look  at  it  Mr  Speaker,  last  year’s 

salaries were a bit high.  But in this year’s budget, it has decreased to about $9,000.  But when you 

combine the total income that were taken off from employees, it will total up to $50 thousand.  In 

</span><span>regards to the administration work in the Office, last year, we know that it was about $1 million.  

</span><span>Today, this came to $800 thousand.  When we look at the Administered Payments last year, it was 

about $4 million and this year it has decreased to $1.2 million.  The reason for the reduction Mr 

Chairman is, the focus was targeted for ICI and their Committee.  The focus was also targeted on 

</span></div><div><span>33 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>some of the islands that requires attention and Schools that are being monitored.  Another targeted 

area are areas that needed to be worked on.  When you look into this, there are other areas that 

needs to be renovated such as Government houses and working in close with an Agency called 

Seabed Mining.  Therefore Mr Chairman, you will notice of a reduction from last year from $4 

million to $1.2 million. 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at Payment On Behalf Of the Crown (POBOC), last year we know that $2 million 

was appropriated. However, this year it has increased to over $5 million.  We know the plans for 

POBOC and that has gone to the Airport subsidy, the Bank of the Cook Islands, Ports Authority 

and one area that needs to be worked on is To Tatou Vai.  That is the reason why the amount has 

reached over $5 million and we in the Opposition supports this under POBOC.  Mr Chairman, this 

budget is being allocated to help our people.  In the past, in regards to our water, we have decided 

that we will not pay for our water.  We need to set a solution for our people not to pay for their 

water.  This budget for POBOC will cover our water.  Mr Chairman, the budget for To Tatou Vai 

is $3 million.  I would like to thank this Committee for setting the budget for To Tatou Vai at $3 

million.  But then Mr Chairman, even though $3 million has been allocated, it is not enough.  But 

if we add another $1 million on top, it will be much better.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I was just commenting on the appropriation for this department because this is one 

of the most important department in our country.  Why is it important?  Because all government 

assets are administrated and controlled by this department and that includes all the buildings at all 

the schools.   So I am  pretty sure  that the Minister for Education  will support this  budget  CIIC 

because they closely work in partnership with CIIC.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, even though I strongly support this budget, but I have other thoughts to raise to the 

Government today.  I want to discuss the Committee Members on the Board.  In regards to a Board 

Member, the process that has been administered under the CIIC Policy, the Committee Boards that 

collaborate with CIIC Boards are chaired by CIIC.  

I know that the Chairmen of these Committee Boards have had problems with the Chairman of the 

CIIC Board, who is the Chairman for all Boards.  However, I know that the Government can sort 

these problems because there are issues in some areas.  For example Mr Chairman, let us say, the 

Chairman for the Board of Te Aponga Uira, I know that the Chairman of all the Committee Boards 

is the Chairman for CIIC.  But I know that the Prime Minister is aware of this and I also believe 

that the Prime Minister can also look at rectifying these issues. 

</span></div><div><span>Another problem I am seeing, the revenue generated by Te Aponga Uira, I believe that the surplus 

generated should also be allocated to help support CIIC as there is nothing allocated for TAU to 

conjoint with CIIC, except the assets.  The Assets that belongs to TAU are administered by CIIC.  

That is one area that I have no problems with, but with the budget that is not under CIIC, that is 

where my frustration lies.  I believe that this budget for TAU should be administered by TAU. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  have  the  same  judgement  for  Committee  Boards  administered  by  Ports  and  Airport 

</span><span>Authority.    I  also  believe  that  the  administration  under  these  Boards,  the  Prime  Ministers 

</span><span>understands how it works.  When you refer to the budget for CIIC, these are areas that we need to 

focus  on.    However,  I  am  delighted  to  know  that  some  of  the  funds  were  taken  off  from  the 

Personnel and the Administration.  I know that an article was published in the Cook Islands News, 

</span></div><div><span>34

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>but I will not emphasise on what was written in the article, I will concentrate more on the benefits 

that this will generate for our people.    

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, when you look at Book 2, you will find eight pages of programs which entails the 

work of this department, advising us their responsibilities.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I rise to give my support to the Appropriation for CIIC.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Selina Napa; 

you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Greetings to all of us.  I would like to give my thoughts 

on the Appropriation for CIIC.  When I look at some of the assets under the overview of CIIC, the 

investment intercalated water and sanitation, because when you look at the budget for CIIC, their 

responsibilities are stipulated but nothing has been appropriated for Water and Sanitation, unless 

I have missed it somewhere.   I recall a program held in Takitumu that is to do with Water and 

Sanitation in upgrading septic tanks, with these septic tanks, $1,000 of subsidy was received from 

Households and the rest  came from  the Government.   Maybe it is  appropriate that these septic 

tanks are administered by the Government because the majority of the septic tanks in Takitumu do 

not function.  It is difficult to figure out which Ministry to contact for their help and support, but 

it has been confirmed that the administration for Water and Sanitation falls with CIIC.   

</span></div><div><span>When I look at Output 5, Effective Hazard Development, the High Level Program Deliverables 

states that the sign off for Avarua Town plan, Nikao Social Centre, Aitutaki Planned Projects, one 

of the goals says to complete a new mental health facility, I am quite excited to see this because 

we have questioned this so many times in the past about those who suffered from mental illness 

not to be imprisoned.  I look forward for this project to be implemented as soon as possible.  My 

request to the Minister George Angene to not paint this facility in green and yellow but to paint in 

blue and white. 

</span></div><div><span>Further to that, the residential house for our Queen’s Representative, in which our Leader have 

always questioned in the past on the situation of it.  I can see the Government today, they have 

been in power for over 10 years and it was only at this time that this plan is included in our Budget 

Book.  When I look at the expenditure spent on the rentals for the residential house in Titikaveka, 

can someone please explain why we could not pay some landowners for a section to build a new 

house for the Queen’s Representative and his wife? 

</span></div><div><span>I  can  also  see  below  the  completed  projects  in  the  Outer  Islands,  Arutanga  Harbour,  Manihiki 

Building projects, Rakahanga Building projects and I can also see a project for Mangaia as well.  

I am also looking at the Budget, when you look at the Administered Funding for this Output, $520 

thousand has been allocated.  I am not sure about this Administered Funding because I did not see 

it in Book 1 if this amount will cover all these projects as outlined under Output 5.  Maybe the 

</span><span>Minister  can  clarify  if  the  amount  on  Page  85  from  Book  1,  Special  Projects  Units  of  $420 

</span><span>thousand, whether it meant to be this $520 thousand.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>However, there are two items that I am excited to see in this Book is the Mental Health facility 

and the Residential House for our Queen’s Representative. 

</span></div><div><span>I give my full support to this Vote Item for CIIC.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:   </span><span>Thank  you Honourable Member.   I see the  Leader  of the Opposition,  the 

Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I rise to present my thoughts on this 

part of the Budget.  I want to share the establishment of this budget as I believe that this can be re-

prioritized in spending.  Last year, I touched on the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act.  I 

was  involved  in  the  discussions  earlier  in  the  year  regarding  the  Road  Map  for  a  Sustainable 

Economy. 

</span></div><div><span>I  asked the  Investment  Corporation if they  could provide some information  of all the different 

Boards and the Members on these Boards that are under the Investment Corporation.  The reason 

for this, according to the workshops held at the Auditorium, it was noted that there were too many 

Boards and that it can be streamlined.  So, I would like to thank the Investment Corporation for 

providing the requested information back in November  or December last  year, that showed the 

setup of the Board for the Investment Corporation and those administered by them. 

</span></div><div><span>This information allowed me to clarify what I thought because under the Cook Islands Investment 

Corporation Act, if you are the Chairman for the Investment Corporation, you are not allowed to 

be  Chairman  of  any  subsidiary  Boards.    The  Minister  Responsible  for  Investment  Corporation 

should know this because the Chairman for Investment Corporation, he is also the Chairman for 

five or six other Boards.  It is not right that we are the ones that makes laws and then we just look 

at laws being breached. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  if  they  had  not  provided  the  information  on  the  remuneration  paid  but  if  you  are  a 

Member or Chairman of every Board, each Board is allocated with a sitting fee.  When I calculate 

it properly, it seemed that the remuneration that is paid for these Members are higher than what 

you Members of Parliament gets.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I request that we monitor our laws carefully for us Members of Parliament to be careful 

not to breach the laws.  Secondly,  I would like to ask for these Boards to be reviewed to see if 

there is a need for these Boards, I forgot how many of them but there were quite a few Boards 

under the  administration of  Investment  Corporation.   I believe that if we  do that, there will be 

savings there. 

</span></div><div><span>Earlier I mentioned some issues between the Audit Office, MFEM and the Investment Corporation, 

we have been told that CIIC does not have a proper list of its assets.  If we put a value on these 

assets and if you do not know what  your assets are it will be worse, mine is a guess work and 

</span><span>maybe this would become a dream because the value of an asset will be listed on the value of the 

</span><span>whole country.  So, I am quite concerned that a State Owned Enterprise like this where I do not 

understand of what the actual assets are for this country. 

</span></div><div><span>36 

</span></div><div><a>Page 37</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  touch  upon  Output  4  regarding  Governance,  I  am  quite  surprised  Honourable 

Minister  of  the  percentage  that  is  stated  being  achieved.    First  point,  it  states  that  “90%  of 

Rarotonga Land Tenure Matters with Landowners are current and Up to Date”.  Second point is 

that “80% of Pa Enua Land Tenure Matters with landowners are current and Up to Date”.  Third 

point, “99% of Land Tenure Matters with Crown as lessor are Current and Up to Date”.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I do not believe these figures because the Land Court is a playing ground for me.  I 

see all the transactions and I am very surprised at these percentages.  If this is true, well that is 

good but I do believe that this is not correct.  Therefore, to the Minister Responsible, maybe you 

could  explain  how  this  came  about  and  yet  we  have  seen  all  the  issues  with  lands  which  still 

remains which has not been started otherwise, the negotiations has not started or a resolution has 

not been met. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to touch on Output 5.  I am beginning to enjoy the Investment Corporation.  When 

you  look  at  the  Projects  for  the  Outer  Islands,  I  saw  that  the  Rakahanga  Building  project  is 

completed,  not  started,  but  completed.    Our  Cyclone  Shelter,  I  have  looked  in  Book  1,  it  was 

proposed for the Rakahanga Cyclone Shelter to be completed by 2023.  So I am actually happy 

about Investment Corporation for a change, for reporting that our Rakahanga Cyclone Shelter will 

be completed in this financial year.  I am certain that when the people of Rakahanga hears that our 

Rakahanga Cyclone Shelter will be completed in this financial year.   

</span></div><div><span>I am not quite certain where this Rakahanga Building Project is, if the plan is not completed as we 

the Island Council have discussed the renovation for the Office of the Island Council.  Honourable 

Members, in the Outer Islands, when we talk about new buildings or renovations, we will think 

that this building will look nice.   I want to inform  you all that in Rakahanga, the Office of the 

Island Council, the hinges are rusted and is falling apart, impossible to close them.  It will only 

take  a  few  thousands  of  dollars  to  upgrade  this  building  until  our  new  building  is  built.    So, 

Honourable Minister, these are my contributions, maybe you could explain the two questions that 

I have raised.  But in regards to the proposal that the new Cyclone Centre will be completed, I am 

very happy with the Investment Corporation.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and I see the Honourable Prime Minister; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  M.  BROWN:    </span><span>Thank  you  very  much  Mr  Chairman.    We  all  know  the  Cook  Islands 

Investment Corporation has two jobs.  The first one is to manage the governance of all of our State 

Owned Enterprises of which there are I believe eight active and operating plus two or three that 

are holding companies and not to be confused with the joint venture companies of which we also 

are part of which includes currently the Vodafone Company and the GSR Company which is the 

minerals exploration joint venture. 

</span></div><div><span>As I have mentioned holding companies, Mr Chairman which are part of the company structures 

</span><span>associated with Telecoms Holdings Limited which is the conduit towards Vodafone Cook Islands.  

</span><span>I think one part of these companies that the Leader of the Opposition was referring to where the 

current Chair of Investment Corporation is also appointed as a Board Member of these companies 

and to confirm with the Members of the House that the Chairman does not collect additional Board 

</span></div><div><span>37 

</span></div><div><a>Page 38</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>fees  by  virtue  of  his  Membership  on  these  Boards.    He  only  collects  his  Chairman  fee  for  the 

Investment Corporation. 

</span></div><div><span>The second part of the Investment Corporation job is to manage assets of the government and these 

assets are all government buildings, properties, certain equipment and also leases on land.  I am 

sure the Members have heard me say in previous Budget previous  years that we inherited land 

issues under Investment Corporation that have been left idle in some case for more than 30, 40 

years and it has taken many years to get to the stage where we are now where land leases have 

now been updated, overdue rentals have been paid and negotiations with landowners have reached 

a good compromise. 

</span></div><div><span>So I was very pleasantly surprised to have a look actually at how far we have progressed to see 

with  the  amount  of  completed  historical  land  tenure  matters  as  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition pointed out 90 percent on Rarotonga, 80 percent in the Pa Enua, 99 percent matters 

with the Crown, it’s a very good result.  I think, Mr Chairman that 10 percent I think she is the 

legal adviser for this and that is why it hasn’t been completed.  Because she did mention this is her 

playground and she knows all these issues and maybe this is the land that she is talking about that 

ten and 20 percent has not been completed.  So the progress is working well, Mr Chairman and I 

think that’s all I have to say on this Appropriation as well, Mr Chairman.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Prime Minister.   

</span></div><div><span>I put the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $3,527,000 for Cook Islands Investment Corporation stands part of the 

Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Honourable Members, we will report back to Parliament to report the progress 

of the Bill before we adjourn.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the progress of the Bill be reported to Parliament? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament is resumed. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:    </span><span>I  call on the Minister of Finance the Honourable Mark Brown to  report the 

progress of the Bill to the House. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I am happy to report that the Bill is progressing 

through Committee Stage very well.
