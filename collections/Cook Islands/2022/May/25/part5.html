<div><span>QUESTION TIME 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to call upon the Honourable Minister, Rose Toki-Brown, to please take the Floor and 

to respond to a question that was asked of yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  everybody,  Mr  Speaker,  Clerk,  staff  of  Parliament, 

Members of Parliament on the Government side and the Opposition side, our people listening in 

to our Sitting this morning, Kia Orana in the Name of our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>In response to the question raised yesterday by the Honourable Member Tetangi Matapo regarding 

dental services on the island of Mangaia, here are my findings.  It is true that our Dentist from 

Mangaia have arrived and she is here because of her father.  About two months ago, an Electrician 

installed a dental equipment and our Dentist from Mangaia confirmed that she is waiting for the 

</span></div><div><span>1

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>return of the Electrician who had installed this equipment that is found to be faulty.  However, 

there  is  a  process  in  dealing  with  these  matters  that  is  managed  by  Officials  at  an  Operational 

Level.  But I would like to thank the Honourable Member for bringing this to our attention so that 

we may be able to do something about it.  I would also like to thank our Dentist from Mangaia for 

the good work she does regardless of the equipment she has.  I believe that when you go back to 

Mangaia, this problem will be sorted.  Thank you very much.   

</span></div><div><span>I was under the influence that the Member of Parliament will rise to acknowledge all the equipment 

that was presented to Mangaia, including an ambulance.  Never mind, work is being done and the 

ambulance has been delivered, we believe that this will be an asset for the people of Mangaia.  

Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  Now I see the Honourable Minister George 

Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity and to the Member 

of Parliament for Matavera, thank you for allowing some time for me to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I begin with my question or speech, the Scripture says, </span><span>“Teach us to number our days, that 

we may gain a heart of wisdom”.  “Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path”. 

</span></div><div><span>My question Mr Speaker and those listening in from the Cook  Islands and from outside of the 

Cook Islands, is directed to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Honourable Leader, I was 

very disappointed with an article that was published in the Cook Islands Newspaper last week that 

was written by the CEO of the Opposition on 18 May 2022.  The article stated that this person will 

sue the Government.  Mr Speaker, I am going to be tough on this topic because this man will not 

be suing the Government only, he will also be suing the people of the Cook Islands.  Who is the 

Government of the Cook Islands?  It is the people of the Cook Islands.  Who gave the authority to 

such person to sue the Government?  We will not be the only Government in power, there will be 

another Government who will take over. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Point of Order Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Minister, please.  I see the Leader of the Opposition.  Kia Orana 

and welcome back to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:  </span><span>Thank you.  Could I please ask the Minister to ask his question? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I was going to do that.  Honourable Minister, can you ask your question please? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  

My question is, do you support the CEO of the Opposition for suing the Government?  Yes or no?  

</span><span>Simple answer! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I can see the Hon Leader of the Opposition, 

the Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Kia  Orana  Mr  Speaker  and  Kia  Orana  to  all  Honourable 

Members of this House, the Government side and the Opposition side, Kia Orana in the Name of 

the Father.  To those listening in and watching us on livestream, Kia Orana.  The answer to this 

question is not a simple yes or no.   

</span></div><div><span>First of all, the CEO for the Office of the Opposition is also the President of the Organisation called 

Friends of Fiji.  The article he wrote with Cook Islands News, he wrote that article as President of 

that Organisation.   

</span></div><div><span>I looked at the depth of this writing and just like the Prime Minister, I consulted with some of the 

senior-level lawyers on the island.  This is an issue that none of us on the Immigration Select Panel 

was aware of.  During the consultation process, nobody brought this to our attention.  Honourable 

Minister, under our Constitution, it says that we cannot be biased with people.  Just like in the 

United States of America, if you have dark coloured skin, there is a separate law that applies to 

you.  If you have white coloured skin, there is also a separate law that applies to you. 

</span></div><div><span>Under our Constitution, colours white, yellow and black are the same, even brown for the Northern 

and  Southern  Group  Islands.    If  we  look  at  this  issue  very  closely,  there  is  an  issue  in  our 

Immigration Act that talks about the era of the whites and era of the blacks.  To me, as I am his 

boss in the Office of the Opposition, it made sense because I have read the Constitution.  If they 

feel that they want to take an issue to court, they have the rights to do so and we should not obstruct 

their rights.  Therefore, Honourable Minister, if you really look deep in your heart, our laws says 

that we should not be biased with white coloured people and dark coloured people.  

</span></div><div><span>That is my answer Honourable Minister, unless you have another Supplementary Question?  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    I  see  the  Honourable 

Minister, George Angene. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to the Leader of the Opposition, the 

Honourable Tina Pupuke Browne.   I heard you talking about the two colours, black and white.  

These colours are inside of me and I have been using them from the beginning as Tupapa is on the 

ball.  However, I have no grudges again colours anymore.  My favourite colours are green and 

yellow and that is it. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  a  Supplementary  Question  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    She  never 

answered my question with a  yes or no.  She exaggerated, hence my Supplementary Question.  

Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the question is, do you support changes to be done to the 

Permanent Residency process as you are a Member of the Immigration Select Panel? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

</span><span>Opposition; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Honourable Minister, the answer to your question is yes, I do 

support the idea of reviewing such proposal because we, the Immigration Select Panel Committee, 

</span></div><div><span>3 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>no one has ever raised this problem with us.  If only we were given the opportunity to address this 

issue by raising it with us, then we will be able to look into it.  This article was published after we 

submitted our report to Parliament.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Order! Order! Thank you Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  Now, I see the 

Honourable Vaine Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  MOKOROA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Speaker  and  good  morning  to  all  of  us.    My 

question  is  directed  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    My  question  has  nothing  to  do  with 

Immigration, it is for Sports.   

</span></div><div><span>Listening to the different views of the Opposition about cutting appropriation allocations et cetera, 

my question as Minister of Sports, if you do succeed with the upcoming General Election, are you 

going to cancel the Cook Islands Games?  Yes or No? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you Honourable Minister of Sports.   

</span></div><div><span>I really enjoyed our dinner with the President of the Olympic Committee.  That was the first dinner 

I went to where all the invitees that attended were actual sports people like myself, I won gold 

medal  from  the  last  game  and  the  Prime  Minister  won  his  gold  medal  from  Boxing,  even  the 

Minister of Sports won his gold medal from touch rugby.  That night was beautiful.  It was great 

listening to the President of Sports Association acknowledging the Government for the funding 

they gave for Sports.  

</span></div><div><span>Sports is  not  new to  me,  I support Sports.  What  you are hearing,  I  am  sure  you have hearing 

problems.   We have no  intention of cancelling  the Cook  Islands  Games.  What  for?  Sports is 

beneficial not only for our health, but to help those with health problems like NCDs.  Looking 

around in this Honourable House, I can see that the majority of us are close to reaching NCD or is 

in the state of NCD.  We need to encourage Sports, in fact, when we become the Government, we 

will  increase  the  funds  allocated  for  Sports.    A  classic  example  Honourable  Minister,  our 

Rakahanga team have been fundraising since last year.  We have recruited the best sports players 

from around the world.  We also looked at the type of sports with the most gold medals such as 

weight lifting, boxing and those individual sports, those are the sports that we aim to go for so we 

may  score  more  gold  medals.    Regardless  of  the  small  number  of  participants  we  had  in  our 

Rakahanga team compared to the other teams from the North like Penrhyn and Manihiki, we scored 

the most gold medals in the Cook Islands Games from the Northern Group.  Our team had the 

highest number of participants when we marched onto the fields that had more people Rarotonga 

than Rakahanga.  I know that the Rakahanga team is preparing themselves and quite in fact, they 

are looking forward to the Cook Islands Games to be held in September.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you Honourable Member.  Honourable Members on the  Government 

side, please refrain from asking the Leader of the Opposition questions as you are putting pressure 

and more stress on her.  Now, I recognise the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank  you for  giving me the  opportunity to  ask my 

question.    Before  I  do  so,  may  I  be  allowed  with  five  seconds  to  greet  our  former  Queens 

Representative,  Sir  Fred  Goodwin  and  his  wife  Mrs  Ina  Goodwin,  they  are  currently  here  in 

Rarotonga on holiday and will return to New Zealand in the weekend.  Papa Fred and Mama Ina, 

on behalf of Members of Parliament of the Cook Islands and staff of Parliament, we extend our 

love to the both of you in this short visit of yours to our country and wishes you all the best when 

you go back.   

</span></div><div><span>Back to Question Time, my question Mr Speaker is supposed to be directed to the Government, 

but then I said to myself because the Prime Minister mentioned about road projects, especially in 

Avatiu and yet, the allocations had already been allocated last year.  It was also confirmed that 

once  the  roads  are  completed  in  Avatiu,  it  will  move  to  Turangi.    Nevertheless,  I  will  include 

Matavera in that line of projects.   

</span></div><div><span>My question is, as I could see the Government addressing their questions to the Opposition side, 

therefore, I would like to change the direction of my question.  My question is therefore directed 

to the Honourable Member of Ngatangiia.  Yesterday, he heard the Prime Minister saying that the 

roads in Turangi will be tar-sealed after Avatiu.  The question is, with regards to what the Prime 

Minister said yesterday about tar-sealing the roads in Turangi and around Ngatangiia, what do you 

think of that? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member Tama Tuavera; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  Firstly, Kia Orana to you all on that side of the House and Kia Orana to us 

all on this side of the House.  I am shocked at this question but I am also happy that he had asked 

me this question. 

</span></div><div><span>I want the people of my Constituency of Ngatangiia to hear the generosity given by the Prime 

Minister, the Government and ICI because as we know, the funding for this project has already 

been allocated in the Appropriation last year.  I am very happy because I know this road will go 

inland to Turangi because if it had gone up to Avatiu valley, then it should go to Turangi valley as 

well. 

</span></div><div><span>Not  forgetting  the  biggest  water  catchment  on  the  island  in  Avana,  so,  to  ICI  and  the  Prime 

Minister, the people of Ngatangiia would like to acknowledge your generosity because we know 

that  this  project  is  about  to  begin  within  two  weeks’  time.    I  would  also  like  to  thank  TRIAD 

Pacific  Petroleum  Limited  because  they  are  the  contractors  for  this  project.    To  our  people  in 

Ngatangiia,  let us  clap in joy because this  blessing will  soon begin  in our village.    I thank my 

colleague from Matavera for raising this question. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.   This tells you to never trust your friends.  I 

</span><span>see the Honourable Member Nooroa Baker; you have the Floor.

</span></div><div><span>MR N. BAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is directed to the Member of Parliament 

for Pukapuka/Nassau, the Honourable Tingika Elikana.  I was listening to his speech yesterday, it 

was just beautiful.  I heard him say that tourism will start in the North and fish and taro will be 

exported to the Northern Group Islands.  So, my question to him is, why not import it to Rarotonga 

instead, we are waiting for the fish and taro from that side?  Can it be shipped to Rarotonga?  We 

may be able to pay your money back?  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Member, I will have to interrupt you.  You may answer the question 

tomorrow.   

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, before we go onto the Orders of the Day, I had an announcement that I have 

missed at the start of our Sitting.  Please bear with me I have an announcement to deliver this 

morning. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to welcome to our Honourable House, a new staff member to the Parliament of the 

Cook Islands family, Mr Tere Patia who is a former Police Officer Inspector.  Mr Patia, who will 

be working alongside with Mr Nana Taruia, has been appointed as one of our Sergeant of Arms in 

our Honourable House.  Welcome to Parliament Mr Patia.  I would also like to bid farewell to Mr 

Junior  Takai,  who  was  previously  in  this  role.    Thanks  you  very  much  for  your  service  to 

Parliament Mr Takai, I wish you well as you embark on your new career.
