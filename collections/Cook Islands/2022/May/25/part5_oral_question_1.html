there  is  a  process  in  dealing  with  these  matters  that  is  managed  by  Officials  at  an  Operational 

Level.  But I would like to thank the Honourable Member for bringing this to our attention so that 

we may be able to do something about it.  I would also like to thank our Dentist from Mangaia for 

the good work she does regardless of the equipment she has.  I believe that when you go back to 

Mangaia, this problem will be sorted.  Thank you very much.   

</span></div>
<div><span>I was under the influence that the Member of Parliament will rise to acknowledge all the equipment 

that was presented to Mangaia, including an ambulance.  Never mind, work is being done and the 

ambulance has been delivered, we believe that this will be an asset for the people of Mangaia.  

Thank you.</span></div>
