<h3>Oral Question 1</h3>
<div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Greetings to all of us in this House. 

Yesterday, I was talking about the reduction in exportation of our agricultural products to New 

Zealand.  We all know the consequences when an insect called </span><span>fruit flies</span><span> arrived into our country.  

When our mangoes and pawpaws are ready, we would only cultivate 30 percent of the harvests 

because of the effect of the fruit fly.  That was the problem that we were experiencing in those 

times as I was a planter back then.  Having considered all the things that has been discussed, one 

of the main issues that we discovered here in Rarotonga is that the planting sections had reduced 

in terms of land masses.  There are more people building houses nowadays Mr Speaker and we are 

hoping to bring incentives to our people to plant.  This morning, I am going to propose for this 

service to be provided so we may improve our agriculture in our country.  

</span></div>
<div><span>I also want the Ministry of Health to be considered which I will say that it had failed and the reason 

being is because people with NCD are being overlooked and are dying.  This is the reason why 

there is an increase with NCD, it is because we have over-emphasized on vaccinating our people 

</span><span>rather than looking at other areas in terms of their health.  So, I would like to ask the Minister of 

</span><span>Health if she can investigate to see the numbers of people who have died with NCD during COVID.

<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>Can you also retrieve some data on patients being referred from the Outer Islands to Rarotonga 

because we, the Opposition, have discussed in sending Medical Officers to the Outer Islands. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would also want to touch on the Ministry of Internal Affairs in regards to the grants that is given 

to our youth, our youth of the future.  Let us consider it Members of this House, some of our young 

people in this group will be standing as Members of Parliament in the future, in this House.  There 

is no doubt about this because I noticed that $45,000 has been appropriated, but I suggest $100 

thousand would be more sufficient. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There are also other developments that we see on our island and that is in regards to churches and 

also their cemeteries and also the Ariki Palaces.  This is part of the considerations that we need to 

look at in regard to the 200 years celebration of the arrival of the Gospel.  So I am highlighting 

these areas for you, Honourable Prime Minister and all those people who have been assisting you 

in putting up the appropriation for this year to consider these things. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now, I would like to talk about the Ministry of Transport.  There have been an increase of traffic 

here  on  Rarotonga  and  I  recommend  that  we  give  support  for  our  public  transport  so  that  the 

services for our people can be improved.   We can also see that vehicles on our main roads are 

being over-loaded and we see them operating on our roads today.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member for Oneroa; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR W. KAREROA:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker.  To the Government side, Kia Orana and to the 

Opposition side, Kia Orana.  To our Leader who have just returned and is in our midst today, Kia 

Orana.  Kia Orana to the staff of Parliament and to the Interpreters. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, can I have a short moment to give greetings to my Constituency?  It will not be long.  

I want to say greetings to the Traditional Leaders on Mangaia and Numangatini Ariki whom I met 

yesterday and greetings to you all.  To my Constituency of Oneroa and to all the people in this 

village, Kia Orana.  To my Committee Members in this village, a special greetings to you and also 

Teariki Heather’s who have come to visit Mangaia.  I believe you have gone into my Constituency 

of Oneroa and I know that you are raising some campaign awareness in my village.  Thank you to 

you and I would encourage you to continue.  Those are my people and they are hard to convince.  

It is up to you what sweets you are going to give but you waited until I come to Rarotonga then 

you went over.  It is alright as that is one of the things that we can do. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Now we come back to the Appropriation Bill that is called the ‘Budget of Faith’.  I have a Book 

and mine is the James Version, which is where my faith is.  It is not in the two Books that we are 

looking at today.  However, we have been hearing often especially from your side of the House of 

a light at the end of the tunnel.  It appears to me though that this light at the end of the tunnel is 

getting dim.  Maybe that is the reason why this Appropriation Bill is called the ‘Budget of Faith’.  

</span><span>Maybe we do not know, maybe these Books contains secrets. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the PAC Committee, even though I was not able to attend, please be patient 

with me.  When we look at this Appropriation and when you read the Report from the PAC, there 

</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><a>Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>49th Session 

</span></div>
<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>is a lot of important things for consideration.  Only the important parts has been included in that 

Report. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I am looking at this Report and there is limited in the Opposition and it seems there is some secrecy 

in  this  Report.    You  can  easily  see  from  the  Book  of  the  Faith  but  when  I  look  at  our 

Recommendations, they are very minimal.  So I would say these recommendations is better than 

from the Book of faith. 

</span></div>
<div><span>There are a lot of mention by Members of this House about the Minimum Wage  of $8.50.  If I 

were present in that meeting I would have recommended $12 and let the people responsible find 

how they can get to this.  Even the pensioners, there is an increase of $20.  If I were present in that 

PAC meeting, I would have recommended for $50. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So when we return to the Book of Faith, especially the Net take Rule, when we look at this very 

closely, it is comprehensively written.  It shows that the Net take Rule is 30 percent, dictating a 

healthy Government.  So when it falls below 35 percent, it dictates how unhealthy the GDP is.  So, 

there is a need to continue with this until we reach the 65 percent mark but we have to be careful 

not to exceed. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, what are our recovery options?  There are many options of how we can achieve our recovery 

options.  We have the nodules available in our ocean.  Please try to get that going so that we can 

reap the benefits.  Even though I had been strong in objecting to the development of nodules, but 

I am now seeing the benefits of this to our country. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In regards to water rates and for people to pay, I object to this proposal.  I am one of the landowners 

of the water catchment in Avatiu and a decision is already in place that were made by Landowners 

for the Government not to be generating any income out of this catchment from people.  As soon 

as the Government starts charging water rates, Landowners will charge the Government for our 

water catchments.  But this is an agreement that was made between us the Landowners and the 

Government, for water not to be charged. 

</span></div>
<div><span>In this Book, I see a $0.5 million for Mangaia and Mauke.  This appropriation has been set aside 

for the renovation of Government buildings on these islands.  I would like to thank the Government 

for providing this support because the project had started.  At present, there is a shelter being built 

for COVID and is located behind the hospital, which is near completion but they are waiting for 

the arrival of the building materials on the cargo boats so they may complete these Government 

buildings. 

</span></div>
<div><span>One important area that requires recognition is our Island Council Members in Mangaia, especially 

during COVID.  They were very strong in maintaining border restrictions, restricting flights to 

Mangaia to protect us from COVID.  This has been one of the major issues that have we discussed 

in one of our meetings.  We were supposed to open our border on the 18</span><span>th</span><span> April, but our Council 

</span><span>Members protested to leave it closed until 01</span><span>st</span><span> of this month. 

</span></div>
<div><span>So, as of today, there has been no cases on Mangaia and our border is open.  I would like to thank 

the Honourable Minister Rose Toki Brown for supporting our Council in keeping our border closed 

</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>until 01</span><span>st</span><span> of May.  I enjoyed my time when the border was closed because I had a long break, I 

was able to do my taro patches,  I had time to go fishing and so on.  But I noticed that with us 

Members of Parliament especially, this is an Election year, I extend my encouragement to one and 

all.  Be strong and good luck in finding ways to get support from your Constituency. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the people of my Constituency.  I know that there is a 

shortage of fuel on our island and I could not do much because because of shipping services.  Many 

of our shops are low in stock as well with many products unavailable including the favourite green 

bottles.  Please be patient and do not blame me.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Wesley Kareroa.  Now, I see the Member for Mitiaro, 

Tuakeu Tangatapoto; you have the Floor. 

</span></div>
<div><span>MR T. TANGATAPOTO:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and all our staff.  Mr Prime Minister, your 

Cabinet Ministers and Members of the Government.  To the Leader of the Opposition and your 

Members  of  Parliament  on  your  side,  Kia  Orana.    To  our  people  listening  into  Parliament  this 

morning, greetings. 

</span></div>
<div><span>To  our  people  on  the  island  of  Mitiaro,  our  traditional  chiefs  and  all  the  Denomination 

Churches and your Leaders, the Island Government and all the people on Mitiaro, young and old, 

greetings.  A special greetings to my very hard working Committee for entrusting me your faith to 

be the voice of Mitiaro for the last 4 years, thank you. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, I was not really going to speak because I support what the Minister of Health was 

saying  that  Members  who  do  not  speak  much  does  a  lot  of  work.    However,  because  of  the 

comments  by  the  Members  of  the  Opposition  in  supporting  the  Budget  and  thanking  the 

Government for the many things that they have requested and are now taking place on our island, 

this indicate that we think alike.  So, how can I sit down and not say anything. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I present my full support to the Budget, I would like to illustrate some of the things that 

have happened to me in this last four years in parliament escpecially the request that I put forward 

to government throughout this time.  I do understand that this is not only in my case this is also a 

case in  the other islands that have not  doctor residing on the island.  We do have health cases 

referred to Rarotonga but many times they end up in worst situation. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Maybe we can say that this is because the nurses assigned to the Outer Islands do not have the 

same medical knowledge and skills of the doctors in Rarotonga.  You might recall back in 2020 I 

had a situation on my island of Mitiaro with two ladies passing away within a space of one week 

and I really mourned for them.  I brought a notion into this House that we should stop talking about 

being too late. So today I would like to give my thanks to government and the Minister of Health 

and her workers for the facility that has been built in Mitiaro maybe two or three weeks ago. I want 

announce in this House that this facility will put us in a situation that we are no different on Mitiaro 

</span><span>to those of you here on Rarotonga. Since then I do believe this issue has been addressed and I 

</span><span>thank the Minister and our government and the workers for ensuring we do not go through this 

situation again.

</span></div>
<div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div>
<div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div>
<div><span>Before I entered into this House one of the major issues on the island was regarding water.  Like 

one of my colleague was saying before was that our drinking water is not from underground but 

from the sky. What this means is that when the island is dry and no rainfall for a month there is no 

water.  However, there is a location where old people advised we could get clean water but the 

problems is there is only a limited storage of 6 thousand litres sometime the water won’t reach the 

tank.  Today, on behalf of all the people of Mitiaro I would like to express our full thanks to the 

Prime Minister, the government especially the Minister of ICI for providing this facility on the 

island to address this major problem. 

</span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to offer my thanks to the Minister of Health for the ambulance that has been given 

to us.  This is history in the making as this is the first time in our history that the island had received 

an ambulance.  Mr Speaker, like I said before my focus is based upon the phrase to let your actions 

speak for itself. That means, I will not reach 20 minutes and my speech will be finished.  

</span></div>
<div><span>When we came through the pandemic this was a great concern to me because I thought maybe the 

government workers will be laid off and during my time in government.  Like it was mentioned 

yesterday we do not want a repetition of 1996-97 in our country. I was so happy in my heart we 

have been able through the last two years to steer our canoe through these problems without any 

real issues. I have been following our scripture readings throughout these days and I can confirm 

that the COVID is mentioned in the Bible as the beast that has stood before us to stop our progress 

however through our working together with the three pillars on the island we have been able to 

defeat this beast. We have two more days in our scripture readings and it will confirm by the end 

that our Lord Jesus has defeated this beast under his feet and preventing us from getting into so 

much serious trouble.   

</span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the traditional leaders and the people of the island of Mitiaro through me I would like 

to say we support this Appropriation Bill.  Thank you.
