<h3>Oral Question 19</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Thank  you for  giving me the  opportunity to  ask my 

question.    Before  I  do  so,  may  I  be  allowed  with  five  seconds  to  greet  our  former  Queens 

Representative,  Sir  Fred  Goodwin  and  his  wife  Mrs  Ina  Goodwin,  they  are  currently  here  in 

Rarotonga on holiday and will return to New Zealand in the weekend.  Papa Fred and Mama Ina, 

on behalf of Members of Parliament of the Cook Islands and staff of Parliament, we extend our 

love to the both of you in this short visit of yours to our country and wishes you all the best when 

you go back.   

</span></div>
<div><span>Back to Question Time, my question Mr Speaker is supposed to be directed to the Government, 

but then I said to myself because the Prime Minister mentioned about road projects, especially in 

Avatiu and yet, the allocations had already been allocated last year.  It was also confirmed that 

once  the  roads  are  completed  in  Avatiu,  it  will  move  to  Turangi.    Nevertheless,  I  will  include 

Matavera in that line of projects.   

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is, as I could see the Government addressing their questions to the Opposition side, 

therefore, I would like to change the direction of my question.  My question is therefore directed 

to the Honourable Member of Ngatangiia.  Yesterday, he heard the Prime Minister saying that the 

roads in Turangi will be tar-sealed after Avatiu.  The question is, with regards to what the Prime 

Minister said yesterday about tar-sealing the roads in Turangi and around Ngatangiia, what do you 

think of that?
