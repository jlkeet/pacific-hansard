<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Our last speaker on the Floor yesterday was the Honourable William Heather.  You have nine more 

minutes speaking time Honourable Member and you may continue with your debate. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  Greetings to all of us in this House. 

Yesterday, I was talking about the reduction in exportation of our agricultural products to New 

Zealand.  We all know the consequences when an insect called </span><span>fruit flies</span><span> arrived into our country.  

When our mangoes and pawpaws are ready, we would only cultivate 30 percent of the harvests 

because of the effect of the fruit fly.  That was the problem that we were experiencing in those 

times as I was a planter back then.  Having considered all the things that has been discussed, one 

of the main issues that we discovered here in Rarotonga is that the planting sections had reduced 

in terms of land masses.  There are more people building houses nowadays Mr Speaker and we are 

hoping to bring incentives to our people to plant.  This morning, I am going to propose for this 

service to be provided so we may improve our agriculture in our country.  

</span></div><div><span>I also want the Ministry of Health to be considered which I will say that it had failed and the reason 

being is because people with NCD are being overlooked and are dying.  This is the reason why 

there is an increase with NCD, it is because we have over-emphasized on vaccinating our people 

</span><span>rather than looking at other areas in terms of their health.  So, I would like to ask the Minister of 

</span><span>Health if she can investigate to see the numbers of people who have died with NCD during COVID. 

</span></div><div><span>6 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Can you also retrieve some data on patients being referred from the Outer Islands to Rarotonga 

because we, the Opposition, have discussed in sending Medical Officers to the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also want to touch on the Ministry of Internal Affairs in regards to the grants that is given 

to our youth, our youth of the future.  Let us consider it Members of this House, some of our young 

people in this group will be standing as Members of Parliament in the future, in this House.  There 

is no doubt about this because I noticed that $45,000 has been appropriated, but I suggest $100 

thousand would be more sufficient. 

</span></div><div><span>There are also other developments that we see on our island and that is in regards to churches and 

also their cemeteries and also the Ariki Palaces.  This is part of the considerations that we need to 

look at in regard to the 200 years celebration of the arrival of the Gospel.  So I am highlighting 

these areas for you, Honourable Prime Minister and all those people who have been assisting you 

in putting up the appropriation for this year to consider these things. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I would like to talk about the Ministry of Transport.  There have been an increase of traffic 

here  on  Rarotonga  and  I  recommend  that  we  give  support  for  our  public  transport  so  that  the 

services for our people can be improved.   We can also see that vehicles on our main roads are 

being over-loaded and we see them operating on our roads today.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Member for Oneroa; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. KAREROA:  </span><span>Kia Orana Mr Speaker.  To the Government side, Kia Orana and to the 

Opposition side, Kia Orana.  To our Leader who have just returned and is in our midst today, Kia 

Orana.  Kia Orana to the staff of Parliament and to the Interpreters. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, can I have a short moment to give greetings to my Constituency?  It will not be long.  

I want to say greetings to the Traditional Leaders on Mangaia and Numangatini Ariki whom I met 

yesterday and greetings to you all.  To my Constituency of Oneroa and to all the people in this 

village, Kia Orana.  To my Committee Members in this village, a special greetings to you and also 

Teariki Heather’s who have come to visit Mangaia.  I believe you have gone into my Constituency 

of Oneroa and I know that you are raising some campaign awareness in my village.  Thank you to 

you and I would encourage you to continue.  Those are my people and they are hard to convince.  

It is up to you what sweets you are going to give but you waited until I come to Rarotonga then 

you went over.  It is alright as that is one of the things that we can do. 

</span></div><div><span>Now we come back to the Appropriation Bill that is called the ‘Budget of Faith’.  I have a Book 

and mine is the James Version, which is where my faith is.  It is not in the two Books that we are 

looking at today.  However, we have been hearing often especially from your side of the House of 

a light at the end of the tunnel.  It appears to me though that this light at the end of the tunnel is 

getting dim.  Maybe that is the reason why this Appropriation Bill is called the ‘Budget of Faith’.  

</span><span>Maybe we do not know, maybe these Books contains secrets. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the PAC Committee, even though I was not able to attend, please be patient 

with me.  When we look at this Appropriation and when you read the Report from the PAC, there 

</span></div><div><span>7 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>is a lot of important things for consideration.  Only the important parts has been included in that 

Report. 

</span></div><div><span>I am looking at this Report and there is limited in the Opposition and it seems there is some secrecy 

in  this  Report.    You  can  easily  see  from  the  Book  of  the  Faith  but  when  I  look  at  our 

Recommendations, they are very minimal.  So I would say these recommendations is better than 

from the Book of faith. 

</span></div><div><span>There are a lot of mention by Members of this House about the Minimum Wage  of $8.50.  If I 

were present in that meeting I would have recommended $12 and let the people responsible find 

how they can get to this.  Even the pensioners, there is an increase of $20.  If I were present in that 

PAC meeting, I would have recommended for $50. 

</span></div><div><span>So when we return to the Book of Faith, especially the Net take Rule, when we look at this very 

closely, it is comprehensively written.  It shows that the Net take Rule is 30 percent, dictating a 

healthy Government.  So when it falls below 35 percent, it dictates how unhealthy the GDP is.  So, 

there is a need to continue with this until we reach the 65 percent mark but we have to be careful 

not to exceed. 

</span></div><div><span>So, what are our recovery options?  There are many options of how we can achieve our recovery 

options.  We have the nodules available in our ocean.  Please try to get that going so that we can 

reap the benefits.  Even though I had been strong in objecting to the development of nodules, but 

I am now seeing the benefits of this to our country. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to water rates and for people to pay, I object to this proposal.  I am one of the landowners 

of the water catchment in Avatiu and a decision is already in place that were made by Landowners 

for the Government not to be generating any income out of this catchment from people.  As soon 

as the Government starts charging water rates, Landowners will charge the Government for our 

water catchments.  But this is an agreement that was made between us the Landowners and the 

Government, for water not to be charged. 

</span></div><div><span>In this Book, I see a $0.5 million for Mangaia and Mauke.  This appropriation has been set aside 

for the renovation of Government buildings on these islands.  I would like to thank the Government 

for providing this support because the project had started.  At present, there is a shelter being built 

for COVID and is located behind the hospital, which is near completion but they are waiting for 

the arrival of the building materials on the cargo boats so they may complete these Government 

buildings. 

</span></div><div><span>One important area that requires recognition is our Island Council Members in Mangaia, especially 

during COVID.  They were very strong in maintaining border restrictions, restricting flights to 

Mangaia to protect us from COVID.  This has been one of the major issues that have we discussed 

in one of our meetings.  We were supposed to open our border on the 18</span><span>th</span><span> April, but our Council 

</span><span>Members protested to leave it closed until 01</span><span>st</span><span> of this month. 

</span></div><div><span>So, as of today, there has been no cases on Mangaia and our border is open.  I would like to thank 

the Honourable Minister Rose Toki Brown for supporting our Council in keeping our border closed 

</span></div><div><span>8 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>until 01</span><span>st</span><span> of May.  I enjoyed my time when the border was closed because I had a long break, I 

was able to do my taro patches,  I had time to go fishing and so on.  But I noticed that with us 

Members of Parliament especially, this is an Election year, I extend my encouragement to one and 

all.  Be strong and good luck in finding ways to get support from your Constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the people of my Constituency.  I know that there is a 

shortage of fuel on our island and I could not do much because because of shipping services.  Many 

of our shops are low in stock as well with many products unavailable including the favourite green 

bottles.  Please be patient and do not blame me.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Wesley Kareroa.  Now, I see the Member for Mitiaro, 

Tuakeu Tangatapoto; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TANGATAPOTO:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker and all our staff.  Mr Prime Minister, your 

Cabinet Ministers and Members of the Government.  To the Leader of the Opposition and your 

Members  of  Parliament  on  your  side,  Kia  Orana.    To  our  people  listening  into  Parliament  this 

morning, greetings. 

</span></div><div><span>To  our  people  on  the  island  of  Mitiaro,  our  traditional  chiefs  and  all  the  Denomination 

Churches and your Leaders, the Island Government and all the people on Mitiaro, young and old, 

greetings.  A special greetings to my very hard working Committee for entrusting me your faith to 

be the voice of Mitiaro for the last 4 years, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I was not really going to speak because I support what the Minister of Health was 

saying  that  Members  who  do  not  speak  much  does  a  lot  of  work.    However,  because  of  the 

comments  by  the  Members  of  the  Opposition  in  supporting  the  Budget  and  thanking  the 

Government for the many things that they have requested and are now taking place on our island, 

this indicate that we think alike.  So, how can I sit down and not say anything. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I present my full support to the Budget, I would like to illustrate some of the things that 

have happened to me in this last four years in parliament escpecially the request that I put forward 

to government throughout this time.  I do understand that this is not only in my case this is also a 

case in  the other islands that have not  doctor residing on the island.  We do have health cases 

referred to Rarotonga but many times they end up in worst situation. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe we can say that this is because the nurses assigned to the Outer Islands do not have the 

same medical knowledge and skills of the doctors in Rarotonga.  You might recall back in 2020 I 

had a situation on my island of Mitiaro with two ladies passing away within a space of one week 

and I really mourned for them.  I brought a notion into this House that we should stop talking about 

being too late. So today I would like to give my thanks to government and the Minister of Health 

and her workers for the facility that has been built in Mitiaro maybe two or three weeks ago. I want 

announce in this House that this facility will put us in a situation that we are no different on Mitiaro 

</span><span>to those of you here on Rarotonga. Since then I do believe this issue has been addressed and I 

</span><span>thank the Minister and our government and the workers for ensuring we do not go through this 

situation again.  

</span></div><div><span>9 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Before I entered into this House one of the major issues on the island was regarding water.  Like 

one of my colleague was saying before was that our drinking water is not from underground but 

from the sky. What this means is that when the island is dry and no rainfall for a month there is no 

water.  However, there is a location where old people advised we could get clean water but the 

problems is there is only a limited storage of 6 thousand litres sometime the water won’t reach the 

tank.  Today, on behalf of all the people of Mitiaro I would like to express our full thanks to the 

Prime Minister, the government especially the Minister of ICI for providing this facility on the 

island to address this major problem. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to offer my thanks to the Minister of Health for the ambulance that has been given 

to us.  This is history in the making as this is the first time in our history that the island had received 

an ambulance.  Mr Speaker, like I said before my focus is based upon the phrase to let your actions 

speak for itself. That means, I will not reach 20 minutes and my speech will be finished.  

</span></div><div><span>When we came through the pandemic this was a great concern to me because I thought maybe the 

government workers will be laid off and during my time in government.  Like it was mentioned 

yesterday we do not want a repetition of 1996-97 in our country. I was so happy in my heart we 

have been able through the last two years to steer our canoe through these problems without any 

real issues. I have been following our scripture readings throughout these days and I can confirm 

that the COVID is mentioned in the Bible as the beast that has stood before us to stop our progress 

however through our working together with the three pillars on the island we have been able to 

defeat this beast. We have two more days in our scripture readings and it will confirm by the end 

that our Lord Jesus has defeated this beast under his feet and preventing us from getting into so 

much serious trouble.   

</span></div><div><span>On behalf of the traditional leaders and the people of the island of Mitiaro through me I would like 

to say we support this Appropriation Bill.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable for Nukuroa.  I see the Leader of the Opposition the 

Honourable Member for Rakahanga, you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWNE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Earlier in question times I extended my 

greetings  to  those  of  us  in  the  House.    I  now  wish  to  extend  these  greetings  to  the  Queens 

Representative and Lady Marsters, to our Ui Ariki and Aronga Mana, to the Religious Advisory 

Council and our various denominations and in particular to the people of Rakahanga, to our three 

denominations in Rakahanga the CICC, the Catholic and the SDA, to the Mayor of the island and 

the Island Council and the Public servant, to the EO, to all our elderly people and our children and 

those who hold positions in the various organisations on the island.  If I have missed out anyone 

my  apologies  and  to  all  those  who  are  watching  live  stream  and  those  listening  on  the  radio 

greetings to you all in the name of our Heavenly Father.  

</span></div><div><span>In the Prime Ministers  Budget  speech, he seems  to  take all the  credit  for how our  country has 

</span><span>handled the pandemic.  I noticed that he grouped the Democratic Party together with the United 

</span><span>Party and accused us of fearmongering meaning that we were putting fear into our people about 

COVID-19 and secondly we the Democratic Party was against lifting the border.  That is so far 

from  the truth.  First,  let me remind the Prime Minister and this House that it was us, me that 

</span></div><div><span>10 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>suggested right at the start when we were alerted to the pandemic that we close the border. And 

this was so immediately after we had consultation at the Auditorium with TMO and the Crown 

Law Office. Members will recall that the issue at the time was would it be unconstitutional if Cook 

Islanders were denied entry into the Cook Islands. Should the border be closed? The advice we got 

from the Crown Law at the time was that closing the border will not be unconstitutional. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Honourable Member I have to disrupt you please. It is now time for recess. You 

can continue when we come back. Sitting will be resumed at 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.29 a.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>All be seated.  Before we suspended, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition 

Tina Pupuke Browne was on the Floor.  You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  PUPUKE  BROWNE:    </span><span>Mr  Speaker,  before  we  adjourned,  I  was  talking  about  the 

meeting that we had at the Auditorium with the TMO Officials and Crown Law Office.  One of 

the issues that was being discussed was if we were to close the border what would be the effect as 

far as Cook Islanders are concerned. 

</span></div><div><span>The advice from the Crown Law was that closing the border will not be unconstitutional because 

we will not be denying entry but simply delaying it.  I was therefore surprised when I suggested 

for the border to be closed the former Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister now the Prime 

Minister  and  our  colleagues  across  the  Floor  laughed  at  the  suggestion  claiming  it  would  be 

unconstitutional.  This was so notwithstanding the advice given at the auditorium. 

</span></div><div><span>Not  long  after  that  maybe  two  or  three  weeks,  New  Zealand  closed  its  border.    Government 

panicked.  The former Prime Minister called us back into the House to pass our first COVID-19 

legislation to allow for the border to be closed and we supported that legislation.  All of this will 

be check on the Hansard. 

</span></div><div><span>At the early stages of the pandemic we approached government on a number of occasions offering 

our help if needed, indicating that we should work together in the best interest of our country.  That 

offer was not welcomed.  And then I heard, yesterday I think it might have been, yes yesterday 

from two of my colleagues from the North namely the Member of Parliament for Wales and the 

Member of Parliament for Tongareva suggesting that we have not been working together or co-

operating with government. 

</span></div><div><span>I looked up the definition of co-operation.  I went to Mr Google and asked him what it means.  The 

meaning is quite clear, co-operation means the action or process of working together to the same 

end.  So it is not making decisions on your own and without us having an input and then expecting 

</span><span>us to agree, that is not co-operation or working together. 

</span></div><div><span>Over the last two years, we have seen how the pandemic affected our economy.  We understood 

the need to protect our people by keeping the border closed but we were also very much aware of 

</span></div><div><span>11 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>the impact this would have on our economy.  We were therefore very supportive of the border 

being lifted once a good majority of our people were vaccinated.  Now the only difference between 

government and us the Democratic Party is that we would have lifted the border earlier so we could 

start the recovery earlier. 

</span></div><div><span>We understood at an early stage that there will come a day when we will have to learn to live with 

this virus.  That day has come.  So Prime Minister it was very misleading to say that the Democratic 

were fearmongering.   

</span></div><div><span>I should perhaps add at this point that going through the Budget Speech and given that Members 

have only a limited time to speak on the merits and principles I have chosen some only of the areas 

that is covered in the Budget Speech.  These are the areas I consider are priority. 

</span></div><div><span>The PM claims that notwithstanding uncertainties the economic outlook is showing early positive 

signs.  I say that this is because his forecast is overly optimistic.  One of the uncertainties he refers 

to  is  the  expectation  of  higher  inflation  over  the  next  two  years.    I  agree  we  have  no  control 

whatsoever over inflation. 

</span></div><div><span>The Prime Minister refers to  global issues and the Russian war against Ukraine and it will get 

worse not better, worse.  Our country, Mr Speaker has already felt inflation.  Simple things like 

butter that used to be seven dollars is now 12.50, corned beef used to be 7.50 now 10 dollars and 

this is in Rarotonga.  Imagine how much these items will cost in the Northern Group and any of 

the other Pa Enua.  So the outlook in the Budget Speech is based on very optimistic forecast. 

</span></div><div><span>In revenue from tourism, tax, et cetera and in my view downplays the very real uncertainties that 

we face. 

</span></div><div><span>Minimum Wage increase.  Mr Speaker, an increase of fifty cents on the Minimum Wage will have 

no effect on the workers and what they take home.  It is a desperate attempt to buy votes but no 

effect on the worker’s pay.  For a worker in Rakahanga an extra $17 a week will not even get him 

two kilos of frozen chicken. 

</span></div><div><span>The reality is that we are competing with New Zealand for the same pool of workers.  The question 

we should ask ourselves is how much a fifty cents increase we will have when New Zealand is 

paying $21?  The answer is zero.   

</span></div><div><span>A Democrtic government will do the right thing.  We will pay $12 per hour.  Why?  Twenty one 

years  ago,  the  wage  was  $7.50  and  that  was  21  years  ago.    The  Prime  Minister  states  that  the 

increase does not happen overnight. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>   Mr Speaker, I stand to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>12 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>That speaking time for the Leader of the Opposition is extended to enable her to continue 

with her response to the Ministerial Statement by the Prime Minister 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the extension of speaking time, I am seeking the support of all the Members so that 

our Leader of the Opposition can continue until she finishes her response to the speech of the Prime 

Minister; rather than the allocation of 10 minutes.  I am seeking the support of every Member of 

this Parliament so that the Leader of the Opposition can continue and finish her response to the 

Prime Minister’s Ministerial Statement. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Honourable  Member,  are  you  asking  for  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

Opposition to end her speech in 10 minutes? 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:</span><span>   Mr Speaker, if her speech  exceeds  10 minutes, then  I  seek the support of the 

Speaker and all the Members of Parliament so that the Leader of the Opposition can finish her 

speech.  I believe that there is only one more page but if it extends over the10 minutes, then I seek 

for the support of the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I see the Prime Minister; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:</span><span>  Thank  you Mr Speaker.   I would be quite happy to support a Motion to 

increase the Honourable Leader of the Opposition speaking time to double the normal extension 

from  10  minutes  to  20  minutes  because  I  am  enjoying  listening  to  her  right  now  Mr  Speaker.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I have a Standing Orders to abide to but with the request 

on the Floor, I will allow it.  So, can I have a Seconder to the motion please? 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, the normal course would be to move a Motion to suspend the 

Standing Orders first, but I think you have made it clear that you are inclined to it.  I am rising to 

support the leader of the government, the Prime Minister and also in support of the Motion put 

forward by the Honourable Member for Matavera.   

</span></div><div><span>As I can hear those with big businesses in the Private Sector starting to enjoy the speech in terms 

of affordability for their  new  employees  with  a new rate of Minimum Wage.   Thank  you very 

much. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I will put the Question.   

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>13 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>49th Session 

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. PUPUKE BROWN:</span><span>  As I was saying the Budget speech states that the increase of the 

Minimum Wage is something that does not happen overnight.  Twemty one years can hardly be 

described as overnight.  It is such a long time to wait for our low paid public servants to receive 

an increase. 

</span></div><div><span>Currently, we are short of labour force by 700 workers.  Many have left because of  better pay 

overseas.  And there are two groups of workers our locals and also the foreign workers.  And this 

is the funny thing the Recovery Roadmap invested money in upskilling our labour force.  This is 

to prepare us for the return of the tourist.  So, what has happened?  These workers many of whom 

are foreign workers have moved to New Zealand and taking with them the skills that we paid for. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, the new plan is that we will subsidies the cost of bringing in replacement workers.  Who will 

doubtlessly because they will get better pay in New Zealand anyway.  If government is serious in 

maintaining  our  workforce.    We  will  do  two  things.    One  we  priorities  our  spending  not  new 

money,  we priorities our spending  and increase the wages for public servants  to  $12 per hour.  

Effective from 21 July 2022. 

</span></div><div><span>Increase of old age pension.  The twenty dollars increase is another desperate attempt to buy votes.  

Let me remind this house that these are people whose accounts this government raided.  Whose 

savings continued to be taxed and who were evicted from the Are Pa Metua last year.  Fifty dollars 

is peddely, hardly enough to ward off inflation.  Let alone to compensate them for the way they 

had been treated in the last four years.  This government should do the right thing.  We prioritise 

spending and give our elderly an increase of $300 a month and do not tax them.  That is what a 

Democratic government will do.  

</span></div><div><span>In his Budget speech the Prime Minister states and I am quoting from the Budget speech, having 

referred to  the tourism industry as  an interium fix.  He states, but  we know that we must look 

beyond  tourism  to  grow  our  economy  over  the  longer  term,  I’ve  said  before  that  economic 

diversification has always been on our agenda and this challenge cannot be addressed overnight.  

This is the second time the word overnight is used in the Budget speech.   

</span></div><div><span>And on this second occassion 12 years is a long time for the diversification agenda in the plan to 

be implemented.  It is unfortunate that this government has over the last 12 years put all our eggs 

in the one basket.  Government has relied on tourism to grow their economy driven by the Private 

Sector. One only needs to look  at  Governments  National  Sustainable Development  Plan to  see 

other  industries  mentioned  but  to  this  day  government  has  not  seriously  invested  in  any  other 

industry  except  tourism.  A  Democratic  Government  will  increase  the  private  sector  through 

entrepreneuring programs in agriculture, fisheries, education, forestry and new internet economy 

for example. Let me give you some examples, we are short of technical experts a good size of our 

Budget is spent on hiring overseas consultants to provide the technical expertise that we lacked. 

</span><span>Today and for the last twelve years our students at university have had to take student loans to 

</span><span>assist with their cost at university. Naturally they remain in New Zealand to pay off their loans. A 

Democratic Government economic foundation will be built by investing heavily in our children. 

This is all possible, first, you re-divert the funds that are budgeted for expense of consultants and

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>instead, subsidize the cost of educating our children by up to 50 percent of the cost. That systems 

should also extend to those that have finished university working in New Zealand but paying off 

student loans. Mr Speaker, all of this can be done in this Financial Year. 

</span></div><div><span>I want to talk about Development Partners because when I go through the Estimate Book 1 there 

are graphs there that indicate the contribution that we are receiving from Country Development 

Partners. My understanding is that we have diplomatic relations with 56 countries altogether and 

these countries Mr Speaker could very well be Development Partners with us.  However, when we 

look in the Budget Book we only have 4 Country Development Partners, we have New Zealand, 

Japan, Australia and the European Union.  I have to say Prime Minister that the tables provided in 

the Estimate at Page 194 and what is provided at 193, needs explaining because 17.17 of Schedule 

10, it does not have a page number, when you look at that chart for the year 2021, 2022, 2023 you 

have only New Zealand at the top that appears to have make a contribution.  

</span></div><div><span>So, my four Country Development Partners may not be accurate it is based on the information in 

Book 1 which is in respect confusing.  But assuming that we have only four partners of the 56, we 

need to ask why we have not aggressively pursed partnership relations with other countries.  The 

reason why I am asking this question is to help with our borrowing and secondly to try and bring 

skills into the country without government having to pay heaps.   I will give an example; Pearl 

Farming in Manihiki and Rakahanga I recall that a few years back we tried to have a government 

to  government  relationship  with  the  Kiribati  Government  and  for  reasons  unknown  to  me  that 

arrangement collapsed.  The arrangement was to see whether we could get workers from Kiribati 

to work on farms in Manihiki.   

</span></div><div><span>The second problem that pearl farmers faced is the lack of technicians and why can we not have a 

government to government relationship with Japan to see whether we can make arrangements with 

regard to the provision of technicians.  I accept that currently another major problem in Manihiki 

is the lack of shells and also the condition of the lagoon. However, the lagoon has been curing 

itself  and  in  due  time  the  condition  in  the  lagoon  will  no  doubt  improve.    My  point  here,  Mr 

Speaker, is that having partnership with other countries who have the know-how can only assist.  

There are many other examples why simple relationships like that should not be encouraged.  We 

use to have a Hospitality School in Ngatangiia that is no longer the case. We know that Fiji has a 

Hospitability School for training, why do we not have a relationship with Fiji.  We know that the 

Republic of Germany is one of the leaders on waste management why do we not have a relationship 

with them.   

</span></div><div><span>We know that South Korea is way up the top with ICT why aren’t we talking with them and caging 

a partnership with them. And we can do this with every other aspect of our industry in our efforts 

to recover. Before I sit down and perhaps in response to my colleague the Member of Parliament 

for Pukapuka. I want to make it clear that my suggestions that I am making to government is not 

additional expense, not additional borrowing it is reprioritizing our spending.  Re-prioritizing the 

spend in this Budget and applying it to where it is needed most and I firmly believe that focussing 

</span><span>on prioritizing spending and investing in diversifying our economy will go a long way in assisting 

</span><span>our country.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  I now call the Honourable Prime Minister, 

Minister Responsible to conclude the debates on the Principles and Merits of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Welcome back into the House the Leader of the 

Opposition.  I have received a report that you had a good trip up North and welcome back into the 

House.   

</span></div><div><span>We have spent the last day and a half, Mr Speaker listening to the Honourable Members comments 

on the Budget and I have to say there have been some very good comments that have come from 

both sides of the House on what is inside the Budget and some I guess same old talk that we hear 

particularly from our Members in the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>We hear commentary from some of them saying of we spend too much time on tourism, too much 

tourism,  too  much  tourism.    We  need  to  do  something  new  and  then  we  start  talking  about 

something old like export, export, we should export again.   

</span></div><div><span>The reality, Mr Speaker is that in the export industry the biggest earner is the airline when they 

charge you the freight.  The airline earns more than the final seller, then the transporter, all the 

way back to the final grower.  When you distribute the income that’s received the grower is left 

with what’s left over and much of the time there’s nothing left over and the grower is left with a 

debt. 

</span></div><div><span>Like the Honourable Member for Ruaau said, he used to export pawpaws, same as me.  I used to 

export pawpaw as well and I think the Pawpaw Industry in the mid-90s was earning about $1.5 

million a year for our country.  Exports in agriculture, they do not make you rich.  But they do 

provide you with an income. 

</span></div><div><span>Agriculture plays its role today and its increasing role on the back of tourism.  When we were 

exporting pawpaw we will be lucky if we got a dollar a kilo.  Moist of the time it was down to 

eighty cents or less for a kilo.  But today our growers are selling their pawpaw a dollar, two dollars 

each straight into their hands and we are not paying for bio-security.  Today our growers are selling 

their product to the re-emerging tourism market, to the hotels to the restaurants.  

</span></div><div><span>We just need to go down to the market, to the side of the road there’s our Mamas, Papas selling 

their produce, their food on the side of the road to the market here on Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>We know the difficulties of trying to get into the export industry.  We just have to look to the taro 

exporters over the last few months, Mr Speaker and see the difficulties that they face in getting a 

good price for their product in New Zealand that matches what they can sell a sack of taro for here 

in Rarotonga.  But we have a company that is willing to give them a try, willing to buy their taro 

and we shall see how successful that export venture will be. 

</span></div><div><span>The same thing that we have heard many times before from the Opposition side is we spend too 

</span><span>much money for the Outer Islands.  So I was surprised to read in the Cook Islands News today the 

Deputy Leader of the Opposition from Ruaau saying we need to spend more money in the Outer 

Islands.  Your tune has changed, you are singing our song.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Then again, Mr Speaker I hear another comment from the Opposition, we should be cutting the 

pay of our government workers especially the middle income and the high income public servants 

cut their pay.  I hope our public servants are listening to this commentary from Parliament today.  

This government’s policy has been to try and increase the income of our workers rightly so, so we 

can try and keep them here. 

</span></div><div><span>The people’s wages that are being proposed to be cut the middle and high income earners, these 

are the leaders within our public service departments.  The very people, Mr Speaker that we need 

to make sure that our Public Service  is running properly.  I think some of the Members of the 

Opposition have very short memory.  When we look back to 1996 the time of transition when we 

did  exactly  that,  cut  the  wages,  cut  the  Public  Service,  everyone  took  off  to  New  Zealand  and 

Australia.  So, Mr Speaker I haven’t heard anything new from the Opposition in terms of what 

they would do. 

</span></div><div><span>We have just heard the Leader of the Opposition say that they will lift the Minimum Wage to 12 

dollars  an  hour.    Minimum  Wage  usually  goes  to  those  beginning  in  the  work  force  or  those 

working jobs that do not require much qualification. 

</span></div><div><span>In the Private Sector, Mr Speaker I do not know of anyone who is paying Minimum Wage for any 

of their workers.  Right now the private sector is paying more than the Minimum Wage just to get 

workers and keep their workers. 

</span></div><div><span>I know of a couple of school boys, 17 years old working for one of the companies at night earning 

11 dollars an hour, Mr Speaker.  So this call, Mr Speaker was backed by a statement just now made 

by the Leader of the Opposition that 21 years ago the Minimum Wage was $7.50.  Now I know 

this is incorrect but is the Leader of the Opposition misleading Parliament?  I have been called a 

liar, Mr Speaker for my statement that I put out regarding legal advice that I sought.  I am sure the 

Leader of the Opposition doesn’t want to join me in that description with her statement she just 

made just a little while ago.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt and suggest that she received 

incorrect information because I have the wage review here from 2000, Mr Speaker.  The Minimum 

Wage in 2000, 22 years ago was $2.53.  It was increased at that time to $4 an hour with the Cabinet 

at that time suggesting that the Minimum Wage be increased incrementally until it reached the 

target of seven dollars an hour over the following years to 2003.   

</span></div><div><span>This is the time of the Democratic government Mr Speaker.  It was until 2006 when the Minimum 

Wage was increased to $5 an hour.  Not until this government came in Mr Speaker that we increase 

it from $5 to $7, to $7.50, to $8 and now in this Budget to $8.50.  But it is not the Minimum Wage 

Mr Speaker that we need to just look at, we need to look at the overall income earning capabilities 

of our people. 

</span></div><div><span>It is through the initiatives in the Budget Mr Speaker that we will do just that.  Not by following 

</span><span>the Democratic Party suggestion to cut the wages of the middle to high income earners.  Just so 

</span><span>you can increase the Minimum Wages.

</span></div><div><span>Wednesday, 25 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>I can only say, thank goodness they are not in charge of the Budget.  In terms of the reference to 

our development partners Mr Speaker.  Quite rightly we have 56 countries that we have diplomatic 

formal relations with.  But many of those countries Mr Speaker are poorer than us and the intension 

of diplomatic relations  with  these countries Mr  Speaker is  to  increase our  global profile in  the 

world. 

</span></div><div><span>In the pacific, Mr Speaker we have diplomatic relations with all of our pacific island neighbours.  

We  are  one  of  the  wealthest  compared  to  them.    The  reference  to  the  development  partners  in 

Budget speech Mr Speaker was in reference to those development partners who have contributed 

to  our  COVID  response.    And  the  countries  I  referred  to  Mr  Speaker  are  those  countries  that 

provided the more significant amounts towards our response.   

</span></div><div><span>For a full list of the countries that contributed, countries and organisations that contributed to our 

COVID response; there is a chart of page 11 of our Budget book 1 which lists all of the countries 

and how much they provided.  And in the list Mr Speaker there are cash contributions and there 

are contribution in kind with materials, PPE gear and so forth. 

</span></div><div><span>Over the three years to date since the COVID started Mr Speaker contributions to our country have 

amounted  to  $103  million  in  terms  of  grants,  materials  and  equipments.    By  far  most  of  it  Mr 

Speaker was from the government of New Zealand close to $93 million over that three year finance 

period  that  was  given  to  support  our  response  to  COVID.    We  have  been  talking  to  our 

development partners in various sectors and areas that they can help us with. 

</span></div><div><span>The centre of excellence at the USP funded by the government of India specialising in IT.  In India 

of course in one of their city is one of the most advance in terms of IT development in the world.  

More recently Mr Speaker my recent discussion with President Fritck of French Polynesia who 

expressed a keeness and willigness to engage in hospitality tranining exchange between our people 

here and their people in French Polynesia. 

</span></div><div><span>Not only in terms of upgrading and skilling up for the hospitality industry but also as a means for 

their workers to improve their English language skills and for our workers to improve their french 

and tahitian language skills.  But more than anything Mr Speaker this Budget provides opportunity 

for those who can see the opportunity and be able to take advantage of that opportunity. 

</span></div><div><span>This Budget follows on from the previous two years, Mr Speaker from the work that government 

has done to protect our country and to reshape it and rebuild it so that our recovery in the new 

world we will be best prepared for.  And those opportunities are already starting Mr Speaker we 

can see with the increase numbers of people coming to our country with the vibrancy at the market 

where people are selling their products and their produce.  We are well and truly on the way to 

recovery. 

</span></div><div><span>We’ve heard what the Opposition will do in the new year if they become government.  They will 

</span><span>cut the wages of workers and they make things more expensive for the private sector.  Therefore 

</span><span>Mr  Speaker  this  Budget  that  we  have  presented  before  this  House  we  know  that  the  people 

welcome this Budget and look forward to making the best of the opportunities that now we have 

moving into the new year I commend this Budget before the House, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana.
