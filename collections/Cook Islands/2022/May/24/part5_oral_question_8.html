<h3>Oral Question 8</h3>
<div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker, I pity this request from Puaikura.  I think when we 

look at the Appropriation for this year, there is an allocation for our road development, nearly $7 

million.  At the moment, there is work on the road leading to the Avatiu valley.  This is one of the 

worst roads on our islands and it needs to be improved.   

</span></div>
<div><span>When that is finished, we will begin from Turangi to the Church in Aroko.  This project will finish 

in Titikaveka, an area where this project has not started yet and we will work our way towards 

Vaimaanga.    After  Titikaveka,  we  will  make  our  way  into  Arorangi.    The  aim  here  is,  the 

companies that are conducting this work, they want the job done and they do not want to sit around, 

in fact, they want push this work forward. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  this  is  a  priority  for  the  Government.    When  the  work  on  one  side  of  the  road  is 

completed, we will begin straight away with Puaikura.  We know that Puaikura is a place where 

eggs are hatched for the country.   Sometimes, there are bad eggs but sometimes, you good get 

good eggs.  So, that is my reply to your question Honourable Member.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div>
