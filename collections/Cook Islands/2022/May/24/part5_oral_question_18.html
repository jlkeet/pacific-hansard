<h3>Oral Question 18</h3>
<div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Good morning to everyone.  I appreciate the answers from the Ministers.  I 

rise on behalf of Outer Islands, especially the island of Mangaia.  When I heard the discussion 

about the dental equipment in Titikaveka, it is a bit different for Mangaia because we have nothing.  

Honourable Minister, you were saying that you will carry out an investigation in this area, I just 

wanted to let you know that our dentist followed us to Rarotonga and if you can have the dental 

equipment checked.  Last week, I went to the dental clinic and the machine they were using was 

leaking.  As the Minister have mentioned about hygienic, this is different.  The dental equipment 

works but is leaking onto patients.
