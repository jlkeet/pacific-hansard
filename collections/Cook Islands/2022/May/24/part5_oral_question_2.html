<h3>Oral Question 2</h3>
<div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is more of a request because I am not the 

type of person who is shy to ask for help.  When I saw the Honourable Minister George Angene 

in his uniform, therefore my question will be directed to him.  I can see he is wearing a green and 

gold uniform.  My question to you Honourable Minister is, I heard that you will be putting up a 

dome  and  you  have  received  a  dome.    I  heard  that  this  dome  will  be  established  in 

Tupapa/Maraerenga.    Therefore,  my  question  is,  is  it  possible  to  get  one  for  Matavera?    Mr 

Speaker, if you look at Matavera, it is just a small village.  But the thing I like about this village is 

the six different Denominations in it.  This is what I wanted to ask, if a dome can be established in 

the village of Matavera.  Thank you very much.
