<h3>Oral Question 6</h3>
<div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Good morning to  you and all Members of this 

House and the staff of Parliament, including all of our people listening in on our radio.  I want to 

direct my question to the Prime Minister because he is the leader of our country and he is also the 

Minister Responsible for Finace. 

</span></div>
<div><span>My question is, in the past few days, we all know that there are eggs hatching in Arorangi from 

around  Edgewater  and  from  Blackrock  to  the  school  in  Arorangi  with  eggs  along  the  beaches.  

With eggs hatching in this area, even around restaurants and on the side of the main road, what 

can be done to sort this problem out because Ruaau have raised some concerns about this problem?  

That is my question Honourable Prime Minister, I will await for your favorable response.  Thank 

you.  

</span></div>
