<h3>Oral Question 4</h3>
<div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  The question posed is if it is possible!  This is not 

a question, it is a request.  The request is, to build a dome for Matavera.  Your request Honourable 

Member Vaitoti Tupa, it will be granted.  It is now my turn to ask you for a favour.  I ask that you 

</span><span>move over to this side of the House, I will guarantee you that you will get your dome next week.  

</span><span>In regards to this request, I did thought about it for all Members of Parliament.  In 2012, I requested 

a bobcat, a digger and a weight lifting truck.  Instead, my request was denied.  However, I believe 

that what the Member of Parliament have requested, because we have a strong relationship with 

the people of China.  I believe, I can get one for each one of us.  We need to work together and be 

surrounded with the unity of our Lord. 

</span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, we will have a chat about your request, not just for you, but for all of us.  

Amen.
