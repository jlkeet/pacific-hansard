<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>The  Motion  for  the  Second  Reading  of  the  Appropriation  Bill  2022  was  Seconded  by  the 

Honourable Tamaiva Tuavera  yesterday.  I now open the Floor to the Honourable Members to 

debate on the Principles and Merits of the Bill.  You have 20 minutes of speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>I recognize the Honourable Vaitoti Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR. V. TUPA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  I ask if my time can be stopped because I 

want to express a few words of condolences to a family in Matavera.  These are words of comfort 

to  the  passing  of  a  Mama  Sally  Tukurangi  Hosking  who  have  passed  away  last  week  in  New 

Zealand.  Her body will be returned to Rarotonga on Monday 30</span><span>th</span><span> May at 2.00 p.m.  Therefore, on 

behalf of this Honourable House, I would like to pass on our condolences to her family. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to share my thoughts on the Appropriation Bill that was presented by the Minister of 

</span><span>Finance.    The  Minister  of  Finance  stated  that  this  Appropriation  Bill  has  being  named  as  the 

Appropriation  of  Faith.    Mr  Speaker,  this  could  be  true.    My  own  interpretation  of  this 

Appropriation Bill is the Appropriation for Development.  Nevertheless, if we refer back to the 

revenue that we have generated because our revenue for last  year is $300 million.  Within this 

Appropriation Mr Speaker, we were given $320 million.  To me, this extra $20 million is for the 

increase in our Old Age Pension, including the increase of 50c for the Minimum Wage.   

</span></div><div><span>In his presentation, he also outlined the work that we will be doing for this year.  He also looked 

</span><span>at the situation of our country.  We all know that during the COVID pandemic period, our living 

</span><span>cost have deteriorated.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>From 2019 to 2020, there was a decrease of 7.9 percent.  From 2020 – 2021, there was a further 

decrease of minus 14.5 percent.  But from 2021 – 2022, we can see that there is an increase of up 

to 12 percent.  So from the lending that we have carried through it has increased to 12 percent. 

</span></div><div><span>Our Prime Minister also mentioned about tourism in our country and the situation we were in back 

in 2019.  In his Ministerial Statement, he stated that we have looked at the month of April and 

according to their Budget preparation, there has been an increase. 

</span></div><div><span>The Prime Minister also mentioned about inflation including suggestions or plans on how we can 

address this.  We know that there will be an increase in inflation starting this year and for the next 

six years.  Even the expenditure of government spending. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister also stated in his Statement of some funding such as, cash reserves, 

net debt and investment rules.  According to the Prime Minister, there is nothing much we can do 

and it looks like that we will meet the maximum target of 65 percent on our GDP.     

</span></div><div><span>When we look at the plans that has been arranged, we have reached 50 percent in process of our 

GDP.  The plan is, what can we do for us not to reach the 65 percent point? 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I can also see what the Prime Minister have stated about the expenditure we have 

because starting this year, it has been outlined how the spending process will be.  Mr Speaker, the 

important part of this is for our people to understand how our money are being spent.  This is why 

I said that the name of this Budget should be named the Appropriation for Development. 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at our cash reserve, we know that our cash reserve was around about $50 to $55 

million.  We know that for this year 2022/23, the proposal is that we will have a cash reserve of 

about $20 million.  When we think about the proposals, I believe with what the Government have 

proposed, I know that the Government have met what they have proposed.  The reason why I said 

that it has been met because it has from 2019.  When we look at the remaining proposals, how can 

we implement this?  According to a Mangaian saying, the expenditure in terms of growth, we will 

see from last year that we have reached $133.  In this years’ appropriation, we may be able to get 

$154 million. This is what I see in this Appropriation and proposals for expenditure. 

</span></div><div><span>I do commend the Government, the Prime Minister and the staff of MFEM for guiding us through 

</span><span>the Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to bring everybody’s attention to our Revenue.  Last year, we noticed how there was 

an increase but a minimal increase.  However, when we look at this year’s Budget, there has been 

increase in Revenue.  I am not saying that there is a massive increase, I am saying that there is a 

slight increase.  Mr Speaker, it could be the $20 that is in discussion, I am not sure and also, the 

50 cent increase in the Minimum Wage.  These are my thoughts on the Appropriation Bill that is 

being presented. 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at fundings from overseas, this is one thing I would like to bring to the attention of 

the Government of today, our connection to OECD.  We have considered this when our Select 

Committee meet when we discuss the Appropriation.  I believe that we can put a request through 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>for our placing to be reinstated and once our financial situation stabilizes, we can consider moving 

back to our original placing.  I do know that the Prime Minister has considered this.  So for me, 

we should all work together for this progress through. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to talk about Capital Investments.  I believe that our situation with Capital 

Investment is steady.  When we look at fundings from overseas, we can find from last year that 

Budget from last year was presented close to $40 million.  However, the proposals we see in the 

Appropriation for this year, we may reach $80 to $100 million.  Mr Speaker, this is a funding that 

we have received from our overseas donors and I want our people to know and to understand the 

importance of this funding. 

</span></div><div><span>From our side of the Opposition, we want to know the effective of this for our people, therefore, 

we will support this.  When we talk about the Departments that are benefiting these funds, I see 

that some of these major departments are using these funds to help our people.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, please bear with me as my time is nearly up, I have a lot to say. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, another item I would like to touch base on is what the Mangaian people would say, 

the Projects of the Cook Islands.  According to our procedures that is being stated in the Ministerial 

Statement presented by the Prime Minister, it is what is being presented in the Appropriation.  I 

am pleased to see how successfully this is for you Rarotonga.  As we have heard the Prime Minister 

stating  that  this  will  help  some  parts  here  on  Rarotonga.    He  stated  that  the  road  projects  will 

continue from Avatiu to Turangi.  But I would like to suggest for you not to start in Turangi, until 

Takitumu School and the CICC Church area is completely tar-sealed before moving to Turangi.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you.  I see the Honourable Member, Tama Tuavera. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I stand to seek an extension of speaking time for the Honourable 

Member, as I am enjoying listening to his speech.  Therefore, I move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>That the speaking time for the Honourable Member Vaitoti tupa,  

be extended 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tingika Elikana</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>I will ask the Honourable Member to speak for only 10 minutes. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR  V.  TUPA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  thank  my  colleague  the  Member  of 

Parliament for Ngatangiia for moving a Motion in granting me an extension time of 10 minutes.  I 

would also like to thank the Member of Parliament for Pukapuka for supporting this the Motion. 

</span></div><div><span>Continuing on about the Projects of the Cook Islands because I wanted to inform the Member for 

Pukapuka/Nassau that one of the project in this list of projects, is the Harbour Project for Nassau.  

This is why he supported the Motion that was placed before the House because he knows that I 

will be talking about the project for Nassau.  Even with the Member of Parliament for Manihiki, 

there is also a project for Manihiki, the Airport Project.  One other item I would like to bring to 

your attention is IT.  This is another item that the Prime Minister had stated, the upgrade of the IT 

system in the Outer Islands, from Tongareva all the way down to Mangaia.  This is important to 

our  nation  because  our  people  from  the  Outer  Islands  are  finding  it  difficult  to  listen  to  our 

Parliament Sitting, with the exemption of some islands. 

</span></div><div><span>This includes the funding support that is provided to help support these projects.  The Honourable 

Member for RAPPA have touched base on Waste Management.  We are well aware that this is 

one  of  the  biggest  issue  here  in  Rarotonga.    As  we  have  heard,  he  has  confirmed  that  there  is 

funding available to help mitigate our waste management problem.  I know that in the near future, 

this  problem  will  develop  in  the  Outer  Islands,  especially  in  the  Southern  Group  Islands.  

Therefore, this would be a great step for us to take in preparing ourselves in case it develops in the 

Southern Group Islands, we will be ready to tackle the issue when it arises.  This is the purpose of 

these fundings from overseas, to help us.  There are other areas as well that requires attention in 

terms of advancements.   

</span></div><div><span>I  have also reviewed our processes  about  the installation of our Solar panels,  which the Prime 

Minister did not mention.  Today, the solar stations in the Outer Islands have been completely 

installed.  The problem is, where is the allocation for the maintenance of these solar stations?  I 

believe though that whoever stands in Government after the General Election, we will find out.  

Maybe we the Opposition will become Government, but we do not know.  We need some funding 

to maintain these solar stations.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like to move another part of the Budget, ERR, the Economic Recovery Roadmap.  In the 

ERR, the Prime Minister stated that there is an allocation of funds that will help support our Private 

</span><span>sector.  This fund is huge Mr Speaker, and it is enough to help our Private sectors.  I would say Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, that there is about $40 that can be used to help the Private sectors.  The Private sectors 

would be relieved to know that there is an allocation with the Government that can help support 

them.    But  I  would  like  to  request  the  Private  sectors,  with  business  owners,  to  also  put  some 

funding aside as a backup plan to help support your businesses because we do not know how this 

pandemic maneuvers.  I believe the Prime Minister will be pleased if he discovers that the Private 

sectors will start on this initiative of putting aside savings for the future support of their businesses.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to talk about the completed projects and the outstanding projects.  I will 

</span><span>not  cover  every  individual  project,  I  just  wanted  to  share  that  some  of  the  projects  have  been 

</span><span>completed that were sourced from the past Budget to today’s Budget.  We need to finish the rest 

of the outstanding projects.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>In relations to ERR, one of the requirements for this year’s Budget is to determine how we can 

reduce our debt and if we could review the different allocations that is being appropriated to the 

different departments.  We need to have a look at the appropriation for Infrastructure.  We also 

need to find a way how to address the problem of migration because we discussed about this issue 

since 2020 till now.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I believe that this is an important issue that needs to be looked at for the beneficial of 

our country.  Mr Speaker, I know that a number of people have left the islands of Atiu, Mauke and 

Mitiaro and we should at how we can help these people migrating overseas to remain here in the 

Cook Islands.  But we cannot do anything for they have left to seek support from overseas.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I can see that my time is up.  I would like to thank the Prime Minister for what he had 

reported to this Honourable House about the pros and cons.  We need to work together how to 

strengthen the cons side.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Seeing that there are no Members who would 

like to speak, I will call upon the Minister Responsible. 

</span></div><div><span>Anyways I can see the Honourable Member Tamaiva Tuavera, I have to deduct a couple of your 

minutes because the other Member has used it.  You may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I rise to speak on the Merits of the Budget, also 

known as, the Budget of Keeping the Faith.  When I look at this Budget, it is almost identical to 

last year’s Budget.  I think there is a different of about $42 million less.  I have not much to say 

on this appropriation from the Prime Minister because when I look at the allocations I think it is 

fair. However, I do believe when we return later to look at the details of the Budget then maybe I 

will have some more to say on this. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I would like to talk on Fiscal Outlook because I do not like this increase on the Debt Ratio 

because that is the percent of the GDP that we can borrow.  Mr Speaker, it is a huge amount if 65 

percent is the limit that we aim for because that gives us a buffer of $147 million and if we were 

to go over that, we will be on the road of no return.  We need to be careful on how we go from 

here if we are to commit to the 65 percent GDP.  The Prime Minister has alluded earlier to being 

</span><span>the Minister of Finance for the last 12 years, but has the Prime Minister learnt a lesson because 

</span><span>what we have all learned here is for us not to put all your eggs into one basket.  I have not seen 

anything in here that says we are going to diversify.  All I see in here is tourism, tourism and more 

tourism, unless we are going to be talking about the deep sea mining because that is probably the 

only way that he is hoping to get money to bring us out of this big hole that we are about to dig.   

</span></div><div><span>By my calculation Mr Speaker, each one of us from old to young babies will owe $22 thousand 

each to repay the debt.  That is each person in the Cook Islands and that is a big fix and a huge 

request. 

</span></div><div><span>I move on to the Digital Infrastructure of the Cook Islands.  I think in the Appropriation, $300 

thousand was allocated to improve and to upgrade our IT network here in Rarotonga and in the 

Outer Islands.  This is to make it reliable and to improve the connectivity and the facilities in the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Outer Islands.  If I can turn the clock back to 2018 back at Crown Beach because at that time, 

communications in the Outer Islands was very poor and bad.  We even had an expert that virtually 

linked with us through Zoom from the UK who gave us a quick lesson on how to improve our 

communications  to  the  Outer  Islands.    Then  the  DPM,  Mr  Mark  Brown  at  the  time  made  a 

comment  that  he  will  put  $500  thousand  aside  for  improving  the  communication  line  with  the 

Outer Islands.  Fast forward to today, I have not seen any improvement.  If anyone have, please 

tell me because when you go to the Outer Islands, you will have to find a spot and once your phone 

connects, you stop there and then use your phone.  That, Mr Speaker is what was given to us by 

the then, DPM. 

</span></div><div><span>We will now move on to the Physical Infrastructure of Water and Sanitation.  I must say that there 

has been a big improvement in the water being supplied to our houses and also our water stations.  

Some of these stations were put up by some of our individual MPs from each villages and I was 

hoping that the Government would reimburse all these MPs for the amount of money they have 

spent to put these water stations up for them to talk about when they are present. I will not go back 

Mr Speaker... 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Point of Order! 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order, Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  On the comment from the Honourable Member of Ngatangiia, to reimburse 

the funds to the Members of Parliament for installing these water stations.  I believe the work you 

do for your Constituency should be done out of love.  I have built water stations in my Constituency 

and I have never asked for reimbursement. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Members, I have to interrupt you.  It is now time for recess and 

Honourable Member Tamaiva Tuavera, you may continue when Parliament resumes. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 11.28 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 12.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>All  be  seated.    Before  we  suspended  Parliament,  the  Honourable  Member 

</span><span>Tamaiva Tuavera was on the Floor; you may continue Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I was talking about the water stations around the 

island.  I would like to point out to the Minister for the Point of Order, thank you to Honourable 

Minister, but it was a comment that was made.  I was praising the water supplier, To Tatou Vai 

because of the report that we receive on a monthly basis about how they always praise these water 

stations.  It does provide clean drinking water for our people though. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to come back to NCD.  As mentioned in the Statement, there was an NCD Strategic 

</span><span>Action Plan released last year and I have a little problem about that.  I think, the Ministry of Health 

would need to strengthen this area with our health care because since then, we have encountered 

an in increase in over-weight rising up to 89.5 percent and with obesity with a rise of up to 69.8 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>percent.  This is not a very statistic record for our small nation.  We can talk about what we eat 

and the diets we are on till the horses come home and I can guarantee you today that this is not 

working.  I think the Minister of Health can nail this one with her team. 

</span></div><div><span>With the Ministry of Health, since I spoke about the dental clinic issue with their equipment, I am 

sure that the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown will task some of her staff to look into it, 

especially after seeing some of the photos from the Clinic itself. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to share my experience when I was hospitalised due to COVID.  There is a room up 

at the Hospital and it is called the Isolation Room and is quite identical to a prison cell.  There is a 

big window and there is also a door.  Once you enter the room, the doors will be locked from the 

outside.  It was unfortunate that after two hours of being tested positive to COVID, I had a kidney 

stone.  I had to isolate myself at home and I had to call the ambulance who came to pick me up.  I 

went up the Hospital four times and was discharged once the pain dissipated.  This occurred over 

a three day period and on the third day, I was placed under quarantine in this Isolation Room. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when you are in pain and I mean in pain and there is a machine next to you that sounds 

like a generator, it is very unhealthy because for 24 hours, that is all you hear, this machine.  I was 

told the machine was to purify the air before the air is released out.  The noises that the machine 

was making, it was very unhealthy and I actually thought that I was losing my mind.  I ended up 

threatening the nurses in forcing the door down with the bed from inside the room if he did not 

unlock the door.  In doing so, the nurse obeyed my threat and unlocked the door.  By unlocking 

the door, I stuck my head out and immediately, I was at peace.  I would not know the outcome to 

someone who is smaller than I.  I tried to locate my happy place but I could not find it. 

</span></div><div><span>With that room, Honourable Minister, I think you should all go in there and spend at least one 

night and see how you would feel being locked away in that room.  Do not take any morphine, 

painkiller, just go and spend 24 hours in there.  I urge that you look into this, it is very unhealthy. 

</span></div><div><span>On that note, Mr Speaker, I will speak on the Financial Statement and also the link to our Budget.  

As mentioned before, I could pick up Book 2 from last year and it is exactly the same as the current 

one.  We have talked about this Budget last year and today’s book, I do not know why it took so 

long to be printed.  I am happy though that all the bases are covered in the Budget this year, be it 

</span><span>$42 million short or thereabouts and the Minister of Finance have explained the reason why the 

</span><span>Budget is different by that number.  With that, I will support the Budget that is presented to us and 

will wait until we debate on the Bill.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Seeing that you are a former Army personnel, 

I am sure you have overcome the uncomfortable in an Isolation Room quite similar to this one.  

Now, I see the Honourable Minister Rose Toki-Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  From last Sunday, the Bible said from Psalms 

</span><span>47:1, </span><span>“Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy”.</span><span>  The Chaplain on that 

</span><span>day also mentioned that it is right that we the people of the Cook Islands should celebrate and clap 

our hands.  What else can we do but clap our hands and give thanks to our God, for He has granted 

us  the  strength,  knowledge  and  the  understanding  to  us  the  people  of  the  Cook  Islands,  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>government, the Prime Minister of the country, Cabinet Ministers, the three Pillars of our country, 

the Churches and all the different Denominations.   

</span></div><div><span>Our traditional leaders from the president, Kaumaiti and all the traditional leaders.  All the different 

sectors of our country and all our workers in particular the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance.  

These are important sectors that played an important role throughout the pandemic. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to offer my acknowledgement and thanks to all of us and all of our families.  As 

the Prime Minister mentioned in his Statement for our Budget this was not possible by one person 

or individually however, it is through cooperation, working together that we are able to open our 

borders and see the recovery that we see today. 

</span></div><div><span>I  also  believe  Mr  Speaker  there  remains  our  Outer  Islands  who  are  now  going  through  the 

pandemic.  However, we still see today the high level of our country through out the pacific in fact 

indeed this whole world.  Therefore, I don’t think it is appropriate for us to look at the little points 

to nick-pick the sections in this appropriation.  Becasue we did not see any reductions in the funds 

for our old age pensioners and child welfare and also the workers of government.  As well as the 

support to our private sectors for their businessess.   

</span></div><div><span>I do not complain about the comments offered by our Opposition side but I am surprised at our 

Member from Ngatangiia because this Member everytime he has issues with the health services.  

So,  I  was  really  surprise  when  he  raised  this  because  he  did  not  call  me.    However,  he  has 

mentioned this throughout the media.  Nevermind, I shall look deeper into this issue raised by our 

Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>And there we are Mr Speaker our Budget appropriation and I give thanks for this Budget.  To the 

officials of the Ministry of Finance because they are the ones that worked very hard alongside their 

Minister in looking at our situation this coming year and how are we going to come out of this 

situation.    Today  we  see  this  and  we  praise  God  for  this  as  our  country  is  again  moving  and 

progressing forward.  There is no impact on the supporting funds to our workers and departments 

so they continue to carry out their responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>I come back to our Health Services.  I will focus on giving thanks, I think we should always give 

</span><span>thanks for the hard work they do so when they hear this they are encouraged to carry on their good 

</span><span>works.  I always say this to my Ministry and staff who work hard.  You are the ones carring out 

the hard work everyday in supporting the livelihood of our people.  I would like to give special 

thanks to the Secretary of the Ministry of Health as I am proud of the good work that he carried 

out to bring us to this status today. 

</span></div><div><span>Regardless of all the blames and the complaints placed upon him but we see the good situation we 

are in today.  And to all the supporting staff, the managers below his leadership, all the doctors 

and nurses and all the workers in the Ministry of Health.  All the supporting staff and volunteers.  

</span><span>It is their hard work to achieve the success we see today. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to refer back to the Outer Islands and the three pillars of our community in the 

Outer Islands.  Mr Speaker I would like to start first with our island of Atiu in giving thanks to the

</span></div><div><span>three sectors of the island.  Especially the spirit of cooperation through out this time because Atiu 

is one of the first island following Aitutaki to put their hand up to opening their borders. 

</span></div><div><span>So, today the rate of infection of covid has fallen on the island of Atiu.  Nobody has been admitted 

to hospital.  The people are happy they are nearing the time where the restrictions will be removed 

on the island.  Also this is the case for the remaining islands of Nga-Pu-Toru as well as the island 

of Mangaia.  As well as our people on the islands of the North. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker and our people listening in this is the appropriation, for the past year and 

this new appropriation.  That will serve to carry us for one year.  To help improve and strengthen 

all the work in all the different sectors in our country.  Because all of us on this side of the House 

we do not boast and talk too much or talk before the bread is baked.  So, I will not go through all 

the little details of this Budget but however, we should look and see in the future all the works that 

will take place. 

</span></div><div><span>It is true as the Members has talked about the NCD situation.  I assure you that his work is being 

carried with the Ministry of Health today.  To al of our people if we really consider the situation 

that we have come through in the last year.  I do not think we should create any ideas, consider the 

Scripture which says, </span><span>“Clap your hands all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy”</span><span>.  What 

else do we want because we see all the help, support and blessings on Rarotonga as well as the 

Outer Islands.  This is often something that we talk about, not only Rarotonga but the whole islands 

of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>So, I am very happy to give my full support to this appropriation before us.  Because we are all 

working together to support and assist all the differect sector that needs support.  Even though 

maybe it will not be achieved quickly but however, it will be through the work of next year that 

we will achieve. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, my thanks to the Prime Minister of this country, his deputy, and all the ministers and 

all of us.  To all the Members of Parliament as well as those in the Opposition and all our families.  

I would like join to the ranks our families and people.  That we all held hands together in unity 

throughout this period that we have come through.  My request today is that we all continue to 

hold hands throughout the rest of this year that we will be going through. 

</span></div><div><span>As this is a very important period for us especially in Atiu, Nga-Pu-Toru and Rarotonga.  When 

we celebrate the 200 years of the arrival of the Gospel to these islands.  The Government has not 

ignored this very important part of our lives.  </span></div><div><span>As we all embrace this opportunity just like Aitutaki did in accepting the Gospel to our country.  I 

would also like to acknowledge those responsible in keeping our town area clean, especially the 

Member  of  Parliament  for  Tupapa/Maraerenga  because  they  are  always  out  every  morning 

cleaning our town while we are still in bed sleeping.  Thank  you to  you all and  your Director, 

</span><span>Henry Tupa and the Ministry of Internal Affairs for your good work.  I am also pleased to inform 

</span><span>you all today, the Ministry of Internal Affairs have asked to have their truck replaced, therefore, 

let me inform you that your wish has been granted and a truck will be on its way.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this is enough.  However, I would like to mention the good work being carried out on 

Mauke and throughout the Cook Islands for the benefit of our people.  God bless and I have a 

supporting Verse on the theme for the Budget by the Prime Minister.  It says </span><span>“I cast my eyes upon 

the hills, and I receive the help then, I receive help from my God for he created the heavens and 

the earth”.</span><span>  God bless. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  Now I see the Honourable Member Nooroa 

Baker; you have the Floor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. BAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, if I can be given the opportunity to greet my 

constituency.    I  give  my  greetings  and  my  regards  to  the  people  of  Akaoa.    To  the  three 

Denominations in our area of Akaoa.  To our Queen, Tinomona Ariki and all your supporters in 

our village  according to  the works that  you  are doing.  Also,  I  greet  all the business people in 

Puaikura, may our God richly bless as you run your businesses above all our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to the Appropriation, I have heard the Ministerial Statement from the Prime Minister 

yesterday telling us in details that the Minimum Wage has been raised from $8 to $8.50.  This is 

good news for our people, but when I look at this very closely and especially with the increase of 

$8.50, when you compare it with the things that we are buying, I would say there is no balance in 

between.  I have workers and I pay them over $11 an hour.  When I look at that payment, it is not 

enough for that household.  I have explained to them that if I have to increase it over $11, I will 

have to increase my charges and that will be a burden on all of us.  Maybe it is appropriated for 

the  Prime  Minister  to  consider  from  the  government  side  how  we  can  balance  all  these  things 

according to the cost of living that we pay in the shops.  I am not complaining about this increase 

but it needs to be considered again. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank the Government for the development of To Tatou Vai and I see that we 

have clean water.  For a long period of time, we have been suffering with dirty water and quite 

recently, we discovered how clean our water is.  But we need to consider how we are going to 

repay for the money expended to improve water.  Our people need to understand that we have 

come through pandemic.  Therefore, there is not enough money generated to help our debts.  So, 

our people need to know that we have to pay for water.  I do not know what the charges are but I 

think it is a good reason to consider contributing something to pay for the loan to improve our 

</span><span>water.  I think it is about time for us to pay water because when I drive around the island, I see a 

</span><span>lot of water wastage.  So, that is what I am asking our people to consider very carefully how we 

can generate the economy in our country to help us pay for our debt. 

</span></div><div><span>Maybe we will generate some money for our government to help with the health of our people 

because I have been told that from last Sunday, a 3-year-old boy from Aitutaki had passed away 

and had pneumonia.  I have had pneumonia where I went up the hospital and was told that it was 

just a flu.  I went home and the following day, I was unwell and I had to go back to the Hospital.  

Again,  I was told that I had the flu.  When I went to see Doctor Uka, he discovered that I had 

</span><span>pneumonia.  I do not blame the doctors up the Hospital but there is a need to look at the area which 

</span><span>is quite weak.  We do not have enough Doctors up the Hospital.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>When we look at Doctor Deacon, he is the only Surgeon available and yes, I know that he is a son 

from Pukapuka.  I know that he had overworked because of the shift he is on which is 24/7 on-

call.  So, I know for sure that if only the Government can look for another Doctor, preferably a 

Surgeon, to help out with Doctor Deacon in the work that he does.  

</span></div><div><span>Two weeks  ago,  I had a friend over, who is  a Doctor from  the United States.   I met with  Bob 

Williams from the Ministry of Health, together with this Doctor.  This Doctor wanted to come and 

help out with our situation after explaining our situation to him.  He is available to come and help 

us.  He was trained from the United States and I know we have left this in the hands of the Secretary 

of Health. 

</span></div><div><span>Listening to our Budget and the expenses, I sympathise my people of Puaikura.  For so many years, 

I have asked several times if our road can be improved.  ICI came and took some photos and left 

and still, they have not returned.  As mentioned by the Honourable Member for Ruaau, there are 

eggs  hatching  in  Puaikura  because  we  know  the  resorts  that  are  based  in  Puaikura,  hence  his 

reference of money generated out of eggs. 

</span></div><div><span>We know that there is a General Election around the corner and I am not sure whether the roads 

of Puaikura will be worked on.  But do not worry, once the Democratic comes into power, we will 

start on it straight away. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Honourable Minister George Angene for always helping me out every 

time I ask him for help.  Maybe when he becomes our Prime Minister, it will be easier for me to 

ask him for help.  Therefore, I thank you for everything you have done for Akaoa. 

</span></div><div><span>In terms of our Appropriation, I can see that there is not much amendment to the Budget compared 

to the past Budgets.  Therefore, I give my support for this Budget.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Nooroa  Baker.    I  now  see  the  Honourable  Minister 

Patrick Arioka; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. ARIOKA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and Kia Orana to all of us in the Name of our Lord.  

Kia Orana to all our people listening in from the North and Southern Group, as well as our people 

</span><span>watching us on livestream Facebook from New Zealand and Australia, Kia Orana to you all.  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, staff of Parliament and our Interpreters, good morning to you all.  Kia Orana to every 

individual  Members  of  Parliament,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    To  everyone  who  is  present  in  this 

Honourable House, who is here for this special Sitting, in the Name of our Lord, I greet you all on 

this very beautiful day. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, if  I can be allowed to  greet  the people of my Constituency.  Firstly, to  Tinomana 

Ariki, traditional Leaders, Kia Orana to you all.  The different Denominations in our village, Kia 

Orana to you all.  To the different suburbs from Ruaau, Akaoa and Murienua, Kia Orana to you 

</span><span>all.  Kia Orana to my colleagues who is here to represent Ruaau and Akaoa, Kia Orana to you two.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to unify all of us together in recognising the work that we have done for 

our people since the beginning.  Even with some deficiencies in some of the areas of our work, I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>believe that the unity that we have in working together to accomplish some of those tasks, it is 

completed.  Let us not forget the struggle we went through with COVID in which we have managed 

to defeat this virus.  Therefore Mr Speaker, on behalf of the three of us, I would like to convey our 

thanks  to  all  our  traditional  Leaders  and  Churches  for  their  wonderful  work  and  for  their 

encouragement.    Our  aim  is  for  us  three  to  continue  working  together,  not  for  ourselves 

individually, but for the benefit of all our people.  As some of us are used with working on our 

own to benefit ourselves, we need to put that aside and concentrate in working together for the 

benefit of our people, in terms of unity.   

</span></div><div><span>A  unity  that  is  very  much  critical  at  this  time  particularly  when  we  come  to  this  Budget 

Appropriation that has been presented for this Honourable House. 

</span></div><div><span>I congratulate the Prime Minister for the wonderful speech yesterday and had all the ingredients 

that  is  necessary  to  make  the  right  strike  to  deal  with  real  matters  that  matters  to  our  lives 

individually and also to the household of our people and therefore congratulations also to Garth 

Henderson  and  his  team  at  MFEM  for  putting  together  a  well  balanced  Budget  but  more 

importantly critical rules that we need to abide by in ensuring that we have a sustainable Budget 

throughout the years to come. 

</span></div><div><span>I think the three Speakers earlier on, the Honourable Member for Matavera and the Honourable 

Member for Ngatangiia, they have missed the point on their argument on the fiscal responsibility 

of  this  government.    This  is  to  do  with  the  three  keys  areas  that  we  need  to  realise  in  this 

Honourable House and I am so impressed with the quote of this Budget, which focuses in </span><span>Keeping 

the Faith.</span><span>  Mr Speaker, there is a reason for that and that is because, we do not look at the Budget 

for being balanced and the purpose of the Budget, but rather a responsible Budget to ensure that it 

saves us from being looped into trouble especially with what we have come through.  It is so easy 

for the two Members concerned for mistakenly highlighting invalid percentage ratios for different 

aspects of the Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Government ensures that we remain below the 50 percent mark.  We have retained 

our debt ratio to remain at 32 percent.  If I have to emphasize to the two Members of Parliament, 

they  can  refer  to  page  16  of  Book  1,  they  will  note  in  that  particular  page  the  Net  Debt  and 

Investment Rule that the Government and MFEM has presented to this Honourable House and that 

</span><span>we should not exceed a cap of 55 percent, even to exceed a hard cap of 65 percent of GDP. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we need to be mindful when quoting these figures, we need to keep an open mind of 

how, where and when to apply them because the hard work of the many people that had worked 

on it will be wasted. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister took us back to three years with our three COVID cases in 2020 

to getting our country back into action in 2021.  As we went through that whole preparation, Mr 

Speaker, from mid 2021 to this year, we were going through some tough times.  Mr Speaker, I do 

</span><span>not believe that we are short memory at this moment to not realise how our individual lives are 

</span><span>disrupted.  Business struggled a lot and they have begged the Government to ensure that we had 

their support so they could continue with their businesses.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there are two aspects that I can see quite clearly in this Budget.  The first and foremost 

as the Honourable Member had mentioned, “tourism, tourism, tourism”.  He had forgotten though 

how  much  tourism  had  impacted  the  people  that  are  selling  coconuts  on  the  side  of  the  road.  

Therefore Mr Speaker, I am concerned because it seems like as if we are here making things up 

without realising the importance of tourism.  Mr Speaker, tourism is an industry that will speed 

our recovery and hopefully, in the next two years, everything will be as it used to be.  No doubt, 

the Government will support diversification in the near future, as it will help boost the economy 

and this is where we would need our country to put their faith in, so that we may be able to generate 

capitals and hope for everything to be back to normal. 

</span></div><div><span>The second aspect of this Budget Mr Speaker is the impact on inflation.  As we know, with the 

impact that this pandemic have caused worldwide and now, we have the war that is in Ukraine, 

this has caused a major impact to the demand and supply of products to our country. 

</span></div><div><span>It is also fair to say Mr Speaker that this Budget have also been prepared to tackle some unexpected 

disaster that we may encounter and we hope that this will not eventuate in this financial year.  Its 

purpose will reduce the burden that it may cause our people and the Outer Islands from the inflation 

costs that we currently have. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Government will look for new opportunities to take us up and to help us deal with 

impacts of inflation.  In concluding Mr Speaker, I want to share a famous quote, </span><span>“ask not what 

your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.”</span></div><div><span>I believe that the theme for our Budget, ‘Keeping the Faith’, fits our purpose as leaders of this 

country, which will allow us to reunite our people, to work hard in reviving our country back to 

its normal state for the years to come.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister, Patrick Arioka.  I see the Honourable Minister, 

George Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I stand before this House to give my thoughts on 

the appropriation before the House.  But before I do so, may I seek permission from the Chair for 

me to address my Constituency.  Also, because you have given me 20 minutes, I believe there will 

</span><span>be 10 minutes for me and 10 minutes for the Interpreter.  So, if we go accordingly to 20 minutes 

</span><span>of my speaking time, I should be granted with 40 minutes in total.  That is a matter for you to think 

about and decide for our future Meetings. 

</span></div><div><span>To my Constituency of Tupapa Tapere-O-Au, Kia Orana and thank you to you all.  To our Chief, 

Vakatini Ariki, your traditional supporters, greetings to you.  To the seven traditional Leaders and 

the additional Leaders of three, which brings it to a total of 10, greetings to you all.  I would also 

like to acknowledge our newly appointed Teava Mataiapo, greetings to you.  I was not there to 

witness your investiture, however, I know that you have accepted my gifts for  the occassion of 

</span><span>your  investiture,  congratulations  and  thank  you.    To  our  young  sports  members  in  my 

</span><span>Constituency, greetings to you all.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>To my right hand man, the President of our sports association, Tupapa Sports Association, Mr Tere 

Strickland, Kia Orana to you.  My other right hand man, Maru Isaiah for your leading part in the 

rugby  league  and  union,  greetings  to  you.    To  all  my  young  people  in  my  Constituency  who 

supports me and wants me to remain in Parliament, greetings and thank you to you all.  To the 

President of our Netball Club, Marama Anguna and your team, greetings to you all.  You have 

witnessed all the good work that we have done within our Constituency, I will leave that to you 

for consideration for the upcoming days. 

</span></div><div><span>To  our  disabled  and  destitute,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    Our  elderly  pensioners  who  have  been 

collecting the Old Age Pension since 1965, Kia Orana to  you all.  To all our children who are 

collecting the Child Benefits, I used to collect the Child Benefit back in the days, however, I am 

now collecting the Old Age Pension.  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister for supporting us 

Pensioners and those within this Honourable House who have reached the age of 60, you did not 

reduce our pensions, however, you increased it.  Therefore, thank you so much. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Government have supported us with so many things and have blessed our people 

in so many ways.  To inform you all, I am the type of person who will easily object to anything 

that I do not support.  I have objected to many things when I first entered this House, today I am 

supporting whatever comes.  I want the Opposition to know and to understand that there are things 

the Government can provide and things that the Government cannot provide.  This is similar to a 

light switch when we switch a light on, it will come on, and then when we switch it off, it will go 

off. 

</span></div><div><span>When you ask for something, sometimes you will not get it straight away.  But I will ask that you 

patiently wait because there are moments for everything.  This can be found in Ecclesiastes 3:1.  

If you still cannot find it, then I would suggest that you look into John 5:39, which says, </span><span>“Study 

the Scriptures…”</span></div><div><span>Our aim is for us to live in peace and for us to be surrounded by the eternal love of our Lord Jesus.  

We must stop judging, mocking and be of jealousy.  We must learn how </span><span>“seek peace and pursue 

it”</span><span>.  I am not here as a Pastor, but I am like a farmer who goes out to sow with what I have learnt 

from the word of God.  The Bible said, </span><span>“…that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that 

repenteth…”  </span><span>I know that I am a sinner and I have committed a lot of crimes in this world.   

</span></div><div><span>Today, God have found me to be a father to those who have been prosecuted and for me to guide 

them.  Philippines 3:12 states, </span><span>“Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived 

at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that…”  </span></div><div><span>Therefore Mr Speaker, these are some of the things that I would like to strive for in my life.  I hear 

these terminologies being spoken, ‘Faith, Hope and  Love’.  What  we can see today with  these 

words that I am hearing, I have chosen the following words, ‘Judging, Mocking and Jealousy’.  I 

will say that these groups of words do not align with each other in peace.  If you claim to pose the 

</span><span>following words onto George Maggie, ‘Faith, Hope and Love’, I tell you that what you are saying 

</span><span>will  not  work.    The  purpose  of  my  life  is  to  live  in  peace.    I  have  lived  a  life  of  sin  and 

unrighteousness and my life never improved.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>On 18 June 1992, I accepted our Lord Jesus Christ.  </span><span>“And now these three remain: faith, hope and 

love. But the greatest of these is love”.  </span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker, Honourable Members, as I have said, let us all live in peace.   “</span><span>Be very 

careful, then, how you live, not as unwise but as wise”</span><span>, and be prepared for the worse.   

</span></div><div><span>I was listening to my colleague, the Honourable Nooroa Baker, stating  that  I can be the Prime 

Minister.  My friend, I would refuse to become the Prime Minister as our allocation would be the 

first be used and we will all go home without pay.   

</span></div><div><span>I wanted to inform everyone in this Honourable House that I fully support our Prime Minister with 

his Appropriation Bill for this year 2022.  I believe that we are all aware that the Prime Minister 

and I are related and I will not let anything to cause any problems between us and our Party. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  give  my  100%  support  for  our  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers  and  for  the 

Government of today in leading our country.  Therefore, I give my full support for the purpose of 

the Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this could be my last time before the House, I, the Honourable Member of Parliament 

for  Tupapa  would  like  to  convey  my  regards  to  you  all,  Honourable  Members,  I  love  you  all, 

Amen. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister, George Angene.  I am understand that you and 

the Prime Minister are related to the Honourable Member Tamaiva Tuavera.  I see the Honourable 

Minister Vaine Mokoroa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. MOKOROA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker and good afternoon to all of us in this Honourable 

House.  I rise to commend and give my support to the Appropriation Bill tabled before us today.  

At  the  outset  let  me  commend  and  congratulate  the  Prime  Minister  as well  as  to  the  Financial 

Secretary Garth Henderson and all his Budget staff at MFEM for putting together a document that 

I believe is one of the most complicated and one of the worst time that we have come through. Mr 

Speaker, we have seen two years of harm that the COVID has affected our country.  

</span></div><div><span>This is unprecedented and I think our generation today would note that this is one of the worst 

</span><span>pandemic to hit us.  For many countries, they are burying their families, their brothers, their sisters, 

their parents as the result of COVID.  We should thank the good Lord who have looked after us 

very well in the two years we have come through during the COVID process.  The period that we 

have come through was one of the best thing our Prime Minister has led us through.  I suppose the 

best is not the right word but I would say most challenging and the outcome we see today has been 

widely praised regularly and globally.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to take this time to thank the Minister of Health, the Honourable Minister 

</span><span>Rose Toki-Brown, together with the Head of Ministry, Mr Bob Williams and the staff of MOH 

</span><span>who have been working hard in the past two years.  The past two years has tested the ability, the 

strength and the power of the staff of MOH and to this day, they continue to carry out the good 

work that they are doing during COVID here in Rarotonga and the Outer Islands.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>For us here in Rarotonga, I would like thank all the Punas that have worked hard to assist MOH, 

all  the  volunteers  and  all  Public  Servants  who  have  the  Punas  in  the  past  two  years.  

</span></div><div><span>On behalf of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health, let me pass on our deepest thanks for 

the effort and time and the dedication that you have put through, to assist Te Marae Ora to handle 

COVID-19 through the past two years.  Not forgetting all the Members of Parliament that is present 

in this House, your participation and your active role in supporting Te Marae Ora in combating 

COVID in your own particular Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>The economic impact of COVID in the Cook Islands and in the countries surrounding us, I am not 

sure  how  other  countries  are  preparing  their  Budget  to  combat  COVID-19  and  to  recover 

economically. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before us is a document that has been put together by the Ministry of Finance and the 

Heads of Ministries to present to us for the next 12 months.   I noted that the Honourable Member 

Tamaiva Tuavera and Honourable Member Nooroa Baker both stated that this is the same Budget 

as the last year when in reality and in practicality the Budget should have been slashed by several 

percent.  Public servants should have been sent home because of the unavailability of funding to 

pay  for  our  public  servants.    Members  of  Parliament  should  have  been  sacked  and  sent  home 

because  of  the  unavailability  of  funding  but  we  should  thank  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the 

Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister because the Budget of this year have not been slashed.  

We have retained all of our public servants. 

</span></div><div><span>Within Budget Book 1, Page 78 spells out some of the significant expenditure initiatives that this 

Government will be appropriating.  In the time of economical impact we are able to increase the 

minimum wage.  In the time of economic impact we are able to increase our welfare payment for 

our elderly.  In the time of economic impact we are able to spend 1.34 million to remunerate our 

teachers over the next four years.  At the same time we would like to improve connectivity between 

Rarotonga  and  the  Outer  Islands  and  throughout  the  world  in  terms  of  improving  our 

telecommunications. 

</span></div><div><span>This Budget is based on the theme of ‘Keeping the Faith’ and as the Minister Rose and the Minister 

</span><span>Maggie had stated, it is serve our people we all need to be working together to build our Nation 

</span><span>that we are able to come out of this economic crisis.  On those few words, I support the Budget 

wholeheartedly.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  I now see the Honourable Member Terepai 

Maoate; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker and greetings to you and your staff who is carrying 

out their duties in this Honourable House, greetings to you all.  To our people listening in over the 

</span><span>radio, from within the Cook Islands and those overseas, greetings to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  may  I  have  a  short  time  to  address  my  people  of  Amuri/Ureia?    To  the  different 

Denominations,  especially  our  Seventh  Day  Adventist  Church  and  the  Free  Church  within  our

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>village,  greetings  to  you  all.    To  the  Island  Council  Members,  Chairman  and  both  villages, 

greetings in the Name of our Lord.  To our people of Amuri/Ureia especially those who supported 

us during the time of COVID, greetings to  you all.  Kia Orana to my committee members and 

Chairman, thank you for the work you do and may you continue strive for our community.  To the 

people of Aitutaki, Island Council Members, EO and your staff, greetings to you all.  Traditional 

Leaders, the different Denominations on the island of Aitutaki and the people of Aitutaki, greetings 

to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I wanted to thank you all for what you have done during COVID until today.  We have worked 

together  peacefully  and  I  ask  that  we  continue  our  peaceful  relationship,  especially  with  the 

upcoming General Election.   

</span></div><div><span>I  now  would  like  to  share  my  thoughts  on  the  Appropriation  Bill  2022.    As  stated  by  the 

Honourable Prime Minister, this is a Budget of “Faith”.  In my own interpretation, it is a Strong 

Faith.   I wanted to  inform  everybody that this “Faith” in  discussion have had my faith for this 

Government from last year.  For example, we were given the time to review the Book when it was 

distributed.  Today, we have been given this Book and is expected to be done by the end of the 

week.    This  is  not  a  good  start  for  the  term  ‘Faith’;  it  seems  that  we  had  problems  with  the 

commencement of this Budget.  However, I wanted to thank the Government for their outstanding 

work during COVID.  To the Minister of Health and your staff, the work you did here in Rarotonga 

and over in the Outer Islands, thank you for your good work.  Thank you to the Government for 

the support that you have provided for the people with food parcels, support for the Private Sectors 

and the initiative that was implemented in helping our employees, retaining them here in the Cook 

Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>I also wanted to thank our major companies such as Land Holdings Ltd for the projects you have 

been tasked to do through Infrastructure investment because, our people had gone back to being 

paid at the Minimum Wage, however, some of the companies have managed to pay their staff at a 

considerate rate.  I wanted to say that a lot of these companies wanted to partake in this and have 

asked  the  Government  for  help,  which  our  Government  have  allocated  some  funding  to  help 

support these major companies.  We were also able to save some money in the Bank for our needs 

in  case  we  go  through  another  catastrophic  event.    Last  year,  New  Zealand  provided  us  some 

support by giving us $60 million.  

</span></div><div><span>I want to take us back to the pre-COVID period.  When we closed our borders to international 

travellers, we planned to keep our borders closed for about three to six months.  Instead, it went 

for 18 months.  We know that the money used for paying our employees was loaned from the bank.  

This is why I said that the title ‘Faith’ do not fit the purpose of what was planned and the prediction 

that was set by the Government for the borders to close for three to six months, for it has eventually 

exceeded for two years.  ‘Faith’ is not the right term to describe this Budget.   

</span></div><div><span>I  wanted  to  share  the  purpose  of  this  Appropriation.    In  Personnel  for  2021/22  under  the 

</span><span>Expenditure, $67.7 million was expended on employees.  For this financial year 2022/23, it was 

</span><span>estimated that $69.7 million was used, with an increase difference of $7.2 million compared to last 

year’s Budget.  I understand that this is to accommodate some of the labour force for the Ministry 

of Health.  But my question would be based on the fairness, for example, for Governance Officers 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>in the Outer Islands, they get paid $35 thousand per annum.  I am not sure whether the number of 

people  have  increased  in  the  Outer  Islands,  for  I  have  not  checked  our  Census.    I  can  see  the 

shortage of staff in the Outer Islands, for Aitutaki, we do not have a qualified Dentist.  A lot of our 

elderly people are wanting to have their dentals checked, even our Dentist, Dr. Alfronze, he came 

over to do his part but was only there for a short period of time.   

</span></div><div><span>There are other things that needs to be looked at, such as Island Council Members, I believe it is 

time for their salary to be raised as they are currently sitting on $4,000 per annum.  We will just 

wait and see when the Government will implement the increase of our Minimum Wage from $8 

to $8.50 per hour. 

</span></div><div><span>As stated by the Member for Akaoa, people are finding it difficult to afford anything from the 

shops with the current Minimum Wage.  Our Minimum Wage should be set at $10 an hour.  I know 

that businesses are paying their employees from $11 to $15 per hour.  But we will need to look at 

this  carefully  because  for  some  of  the  businesses,  some  may  struggle,  as  it  all  depends  on  the 

revenue generated.  In the Outer Islands, especially Aitutaki, we have always wanted to retain our 

people on the island, we tried  to  increase our pay  rates  and  I  can confirm  that the pay  rates in 

Aitutaki is much higher than here in Rarotonga.  This is one of the Policy for the Democratic Party, 

increasing the Minimum Wage, therefore, this would be something to consider for your votes.   

</span></div><div><span>Payroll for us Members of Parliament, the Honourable Minister have said that if he becomes the 

Prime Minister, he will slice our pay.  I want to give you the Prime Minister portfolio when the 

upcoming Election is over.  We need to think about our people who are struggling in their homes.  

We are probably on a payroll that requires a cut of 20 to 30 percent.  The Democratic Party is ready 

for this caucus, even with employees whose pay is above $60 to $70 thousand, to consider sharing 

their pay for our vulnerables.   

</span></div><div><span>Let us talk about the debt that we owe today.  We have debts with no money in the bank.  We owe 

$208 million.  If we were to be raided with another catastrophe, we will not have any money to 

strive through it, even if a cyclone strikes us.  Our job is to prepare ourselves for such event so that 

we do not enter into debts again. 

</span></div><div><span>Reading this Appropriation, it says that we can borrow an extra $85 million on top of what we 

</span><span>have in debt.    I  cannot  see  any plans in  place that  will help  with  the payment of our debt and 

</span><span>spending, it is as if we have no debts at all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I stand to seek permission and to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>That an extension of speaking time be given to the Honourable Member Terepai Maoate 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER</span><span>:  Can I call for a Seconder? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Selina Napa 

</span></div><div><a>Page 24</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Honourable Terepai Maote, you may continue. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker  and  those  of  us  who  granted  me  the  extension 

especially those of you from the government side as I look deeper into the Budget of ‘Faith’.  As 

I have said, I do know our Government is looking for possibilities to assist our people.  However, 

I do feel that we should put a plan together and what we should do in the future. 

</span></div><div><span>I am not sure whether you have seen on the News, maybe some of  you have, it seems that the 

pattern of cyclones have changed and is not like how it was before where cyclones will hit in 5 or 

sometimes 20 years.  This is happening every year and we are so fortunate that God has protected 

us  throughout  this  time,  apart  from  COVID.    As  mentioned  by  the  Honourable  Member  of 

Ngatangiia, we need to seek assistance from elsewhere because we rely on tourists when something 

bad happens to our nation.   

</span></div><div><span>We do have supports for our people, especially for our vulnerable ones, our elderly with the Old 

Age Pension and the Destitute Allowances that is given to them by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  

For that, I would like to thank the Government and the Minister of Internal Affairs 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  acknowledged  enough  for  the  Government,  I  would  like  to  share  with  every  one  of  the 

problem with our Avarua Cable.  I recall when we were told about this Cable to connect Rarotonga 

and Aitutaki, there is no limit under the sky to the potential of what this can do to the people of 

Aitutaki and of Rarotonga.  I have forgotten the year that came about and that is how long it has 

been. 

</span></div><div><span>I cannot recall any improvement but when I ring on my phone there is a robotic voice on the other 

end.  A significant amount of fund has been invested in this area and yet there is no improvement 

in our services in the outer islands.  My plea to the area of government that is handing this please 

</span><span>do not waste out time and money.  

</span></div><div><span>I have often commented and asked questions of water especially for us in Aitutaki.  Often in the 

past I have made request in this House to look at our water storage in the outer islands because our 

water is ground fed. Today, the water in Arenikau is still not running.  Sometimes it reaches to two 

weeks without water.  

</span></div><div><span>There is a project progressing in Aitutaki regarding the dredging of the harbour.  This is a good 

work that is being carried out but I am asking whether this is a priority or the water for the people.  

</span><span>This is a work the government is carrying out not only for Aitutaki but the other islands as well.  

</span><span>If you cannot do this, then we the Democratic will come in as Government and will complete the 

water work.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span> Thank you Honourable Member and now I see the Honourable Tetangi Matapo; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS. T. MATAPO</span><span>:  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you and greetings to all of us in this 

Honourable House this afternoon.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker if I may say greetings to my Constituency if they are listening by radio or watching 

by  Facebook.    The  three  Pillars  that  we  commonly  greet  in  our  lives,  the  Churches,  Land  and 

Government.  To Numangatini Ariki, the six Punas and all the people on the island.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give you my thoughts on the Appropriation before the House.  The word of God says, 

</span><span>“Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy”. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we should be happy for the things put before the House, although we came through 

some problems but today, we find there is still funding in our economy for the future.  So, I give 

my thanks to all the Ministers because in this Appropriation and in the past, I have stood before 

the Ministers’ doors and they showed mercy for our people through the Appropriation that we see 

today.  Even there are some difficulties, we thank God for the strength and knowledge that these 

people  were  able  to  put  together  this  allocation.    I  will  not  be  talking  about  the  whole 

Appropriation, but I will bring in some for us to consider.  I would like to bring some points for 

me to stand before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly, I would like to speak on about the Ministry of Health because we all know that they have 

taken upon themselves the burden to bring our country through and we thank God for this and I 

stand to tell you, COVID has not arrived on Mangaia yet.  Maybe I could be the one responsible 

for carrying it there and then get chased out.  We would like to thank the Minister and all the staff 

of the Ministry of Health.   

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank our staff at the Ministry of Health in Mangaia and all the volunteers that 

had helped out because, before our borders opened, the Mangaia Ministry of Health and volunteers 

worked hard to what we think is appropriate for Mangaia. We have heard of the Punas here in 

Rarotonga and I do believe there were support given by the Government.  Unlike us in Mangaia, 

we went out to find ways to support ourselves even with our volunteers in each Puna, we worked 

</span><span>closely together with our traditional leaders and our Island Government who were there supporting 

</span><span>our people through this pandemic.  

</span></div><div><span>I  believe  the  Government  had  allocated  some  money  in  case  someone  is  tested  positive  for 

COVID-19, but there are criterions to qualify for this support.  To date, no one qualifies for this 

because no one has been infected.  So, to the Minister of Health, maybe a slight change can be 

done to the clauses in the Policy where it can be amended to include Mangaia because looking at 

the Appropriation for your Ministry, I give my support. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  Ministry  of  Education.  It  is  so  good  to  hear  that  an 

</span><span>allocation has been given to support our teachers.  When I look at some of the teachers, some of 

them have reached the half way age of 100.  This is good that we are looking at our teachers but 

</span></div><div><a>Page 26</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>their ages have crossed the half point of 100 so we need to look for new teachers to take on the 

challenge and to grow in this role.   

</span></div><div><span>I can see the support being given to by the Government that is stated here in this Appropriation. 

So, this is good news for the committee of the school in Mangaia and I would also like to thank 

the School Committees for their strong support on this. 

</span></div><div><span>My third topic that I would like to touch base on is Telecommunications.  It was also mentioned 

by the Member from Aitutaki.  I am the type of person as called by Mangaians, </span><span>koriri</span><span>,</span><span>meaning, 

jealous.  When this service was taken away, I am unsure whether Mangaia have sowed this service.  

Therefore Honourable Prime Minister, people have been complaining in the last two weeks about 

the telecommunication services in Mangaia.  I can see that there is an appropriation designated for 

this area.  My request to you Honourable Prime Minister, some people from overseas are wanting 

to return to Mangaia to live, but because of their employment, this could be a useful resource for 

Mangaia where their Office can be based there, especially the Mangaian people within your Office.  

Even though these people work for you, but this is a great idea in increasing the Census of Mangaia.   

</span></div><div><span>This is a solution that I believe will bring our people back because our youth of today, for them to 

return back to Mangaia, they want a faster internet connection.  I am just quoting what some have 

said from overseas, a Mangaian wanting to come back.  This is what our youth would like in order 

for them to return because as we know it, this is an IT generation.  Therefore, to the Leaders of 

this country, these are important factors that I believe are important factors to be raised and I can 

see that the funding allocated for these types of work is still being included in this Budget Book.  

I also believe that this type of assistance will come through this because it has started with the 

Ministry of Health.  A disc has been installed for the Ministry of Health.  Therefore, this is needed 

for Mangaia, especially for the different villages.  When we say for something to be installed for 

Oneroa, it is for Oneroa only because Tamarua and Ivirua are quite far.   

</span></div><div><span>So, when you say to people who are watching us on television from Mangaia, you are referring to 

people  from  Oneroa  and  not  Mangaia.    This  is  the  reason  why  I  want  to  encourage  the 

Telecommunication services in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there are other items that can be discussed in reference to the Budget Book, but I think 

</span><span>I will end my speech here in case the Ministers forget what I have said. 

</span></div><div><span>When I stood up to talk, I only greeted the Government side and I totally forgot about my side.  

Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Kia Orana to you today.  I am not sure whether you are listening 

or not, but to everyone here today. 

</span></div><div><span>To conclude my speech, there goes a Mangaian quote that is being engraved into a concrete, if you 

to go to Mangaia, you will find it at the School where it is engraved into the concrete.  It says, </span><span>“A 

Maori can achieve anything, the Papaa can, but to do this, we must work, work, work”.  </span><span>Thank 

</span><span>you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  When you were greeting your Deputy Leader, 

I thought you were referring to the Member next to you.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 27</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Member, I will have to interrupt you as it is now time for our afternoon break.  When 

we come back, you will be the first person to take the Floor.   

</span></div><div><span>Sitting is now suspended and will resume at 3.00 p.m.</span></div><div><span>Sitting suspended at 2.25 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>Sitting resumed at 2.58 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  All be seated.  When we suspended Parliament, the Honourable Member for 

Vaipeka/Vaipae/Tautu was going to speak.  I will give you the Floor to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  M.  KITAI:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Mr  Speaker,  may  I  request  for  time  to  convey  my 

greetings to my Constituency.   

</span></div><div><span>If you are listening over the radio, Kia Orana to you my family and the people of my Constituency.  

To all our Church Ministers and your wives, Kia Orana to you all.  To our Island Council Members 

and your wives, Kia Orana to you all.  To my Chief Manārangi, Kia Orana to you in the name of 

our Lord.  To those who holds a title and to those who do not, Kia Orana to you all and may God 

blesses you all.  To my wife, Kia Orana to you in the Name of our Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I want to talk on the Appropriation.  Looking at this Appropriation, I really like what 

the Prime Minister have said that this is the </span><span>“Budget of Faith”</span><span>.  To me, we should only believe in 

God and not humans.  But having heard what the Prime Minister have said, never mind, that is his 

own interpretation.  We will not blame him, we will honour him. 

</span></div><div><span>When I look at the Minimum Wage, it is $8.50.  The price of a corned beef is $9 is more than the 

Minimum Wage.  We cannot afford to buy a corned beef on that Minimum Wage of $8.50 with 

that price of $9.  The prices of everything inside the shops have gone up.  If only the Minimum 

Wage was raised at $9, we can then afford a tin of corned beef.  Hopefully, the Prime Minister will 

consider this sometimes this week before Parliament adjourns.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my next concern is the succession of lands.  When I go to succeed my own land, I 

</span><span>will have to pay $250 for five sections.  If I put in an application for one section, I will have to pay 

$250.  I do not understand how this works, it looks funny.  Can the Minister for Justice look into 

this?  A number of people have approached me for me to bring this issue to Parliament.   Some 

people could not afford to pay for their application fee of $250, especially if the application is for 

one section.  We should consider reducing the fee for one section to $50, which is more affordable 

for our people.  This is just a thought that I wanted to raise.   

</span></div><div><span>I would now like to talk about the Ministry of Education.  There is not enough teachers in the 

</span><span>Ministry of Education.  I know because my wife is a retired teacher and she has been asked if she 

</span><span>could return to teach again.  The children of today are very stubborn and hard.  They are stubborn 

in many ways because they talk back to the teachers as if they are the teacher.  I believe the Member 

from Tamarua will agree to what I am saying because she was a former teacher.  With teachers 

</span></div><div><a>Page 28</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>today, they are not allowed to discipline or to hit the children.  In the past, teachers were able to, 

but only for disciplining the children.  But we cannot do anything now for the law has been passed.  

Therefore, let us all obey the law.  Teachers who hit their students are advised not to. 

</span></div><div><span>My next item is water, as mentioned by my colleague.  I support their proposition.  When the water 

system  shuts  in  some  parts  of  our  village,  it  takes  from  one  to  two  weeks  for  it  to  start  again.  

Sometimes, Infrastructural Officials will deliver water to the homes of our people.  The problem 

though is, the lifting of a 6,000 Litres tank onto the truck before it gets filled up.  When the truck 

delivers the water, the driver will have to drive slowly to prevent water from spilling out.  By the 

time the tank is delivered, the water level in the tank is at a half level.  Therefore, I would like to 

request if we can get a water truck for the purpose of transporting water to our homes, an actual 

water truck where water will not spill if the driver speeds.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, my last item that I would like to speak about refers to us, Members of Parliament in 

this Honourable House.  If possible, for us all to work together.  This is the only where we can 

progress.  Trust in God, hold hands together and we will reach our goal.   

</span></div><div><span>Isaiah 40:31 says, “</span><span>But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount 

up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint”.</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much  Honourable  Member.    Now,  I  see  the  Honourable 

Member from Are-Nikau; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. MAKI-KAVANA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker for giving this opportunity to speak in this 

Honourable  House.    Mr  Speaker,  to  your  staff,  thank  you  for  arranging  a  Youth  Parliament 

programme in training our young ones to be effective Members of Parliament in the future.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to greet all the Members of Parliament in this Honourable House and the Honourable 

Prime Minister for guiding us through the toughest times that we can see.  As I can see that the 

two Members of Parliament from our island have stood up, I believe it is right that I stand as well 

to avoid public accusations for not representing them in this House, as we approach the General 

</span><span>Election period.   

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to all our Aitutaki people listening in, watching us on livestream from all over the world.  

This  is  me,  your  son,  Member  of  Parliament  for  Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara,  Tereapii  Maki 

Kavana.  I would like to extend my greetings to the people of Constituency.   

</span></div><div><span>I  know  that  my  Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara  people  are  watching  me  from  all  over  the  world.  

Thank you for honoring me as your Member of Parliament from 2018 until today.  To the different 

title holders in our Constituency, those in higher roles down to our children, Kia Orana to you all 

</span><span>in the Name of our Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to give my support to the Appropriation Bill that is presented to this House, namely the 

</span><span>‘Budget  of  Faith’.</span><span>    The  talented  and  skillful  people  that  are  responsible  for  putting  this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 29</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Appropriation together, I believe they are a descendants of Abraham, a man of ‘Faith’.  This is his 

people and I therefore would like to thank them, the descendants of Abraham; thank you so much.   

</span></div><div><span>This is a very powerful term found in the Bible, which covers Love and Kindness.  This is how 

strong the faith that this Government has, the faith they have in God and how faithful they are 

towards each other, working together to achieve the achievements of being here today.  Therefore, 

Praise the Lord.   

</span></div><div><span>In Aitutaki today, I would like to acknowledge the work that is happening right now and the work 

that was there before.  There is this project on the island of Aitutaki, contracted by the Oronga 

Centre, a project to upgrade our wharf as prescribed in our Budget Book.  We have been given 

$500 thousand in support of this project  for this year.  This  project  is  near completion and the 

contractors are waiting for the release of this fund so that they may complete this project.   

</span></div><div><span>I have noticed that $11 million has been appropriated for the island of Aitutaki, which will cover 

the Government Agencies, salaries all the way to the Old Age Pensions.  This is what I mean when 

I say that $11 million has been appropriated for Aitutaki, regardless of what our situation is, you 

will never find anybody who may have been laid off or being transitioned during COVID. 

</span></div><div><span>I support what the other two Members of Parliament are saying with what the Government has 

done in supporting our small businesses on Aitutaki with subsidies until it was ceased.  The theme 

of  this  Budget,  the  ‘Budget  of  Faith’,  reserves  its  purpose  because  we  faithfully  believe  in 

ourselves and in God.   

</span></div><div><span>I  wanted  to  thank  the  Island  Administration  for  the  wonderful  work  they  do  on  our  island, 

regardless of the negativity that exist, but is one area that we should not focus on wholeheartedly, 

but rather the positive side of not laying off employees.  When this COVID stroke, I was very 

worried that 1996 might reoccur.  Nevertheless, it never happened.  It is because of the faith that 

we have for each other the reason why we got through this successfully.   

</span></div><div><span>I also wanted to acknowledge our former Prime Minister, Henry Puna, for leading us from the 

beginning right through to our current Prime Minister.  The Government has done a lot for Aitutaki 

and if I list them all, it will take me one hour. 

</span></div><div><span>I also wanted to thank the Minister Responsible for the Ministry of Health, along with the Head of 

Ministry,  Mr  Bob  Williams,  and  the  entire  staff  and  crew  of  the  Ministry  of  Health.    I  am  so 

thankful towards the Minister of Health because we have scored a new ambulance, a new pick up 

truck and the honour was bestowed upon me in presenting these new vehicles to the Ministry of 

Health in Aitutaki.  They were not worried about purchasing airline tickets to travel across, they 

believed and trusted me to present these vehicles on their behalf.  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>These vehicles were then used to help support our people during COVID, delivering food parcels 

</span><span>to households that were isolated and none of the households ever experienced hunger.  They were 

</span><span>well looked after by the Government.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 30</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>In Aitutaki today, we are still in isolation and it is still active.  The count on positive cases have 

reduced.  Our thinking is to maintain the isolation until there is zero infection on the island.  

</span></div><div><span>I heard the Member for Amuri, the Honourable Member Junior Maoate, stating the condition of 

our water situation in Aitutaki.  Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  I wanted to inform 

you, not sure if you are listening, there was a time when you questioned the Government in this 

Honourable House of an update to the 200 water tanks for Aituaki.  I would like to inform this 

Honourable House that a funding has been made available for the provision of these water tanks.  

Last week, I went to see Odie at ICI in which he confirmed that the money has been received for 

the water tanks.  I am announcing this in this Honourable House to avoid you asking me or the 

Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister had permitted me to respond to your question.  I believe that 

you have been made aware of the situation on our island and that our people are in the hands of 

the  Island  Council  Members,  trying  to  figure  out  with  them  to  how  many  water  tanks  will  be 

distributed out.   

</span></div><div><span>It is correct that my Constituency always struggle with water shortage for one to two weeks.  But 

we had faith in God and here it is, it is here.  I believe that this problem about water shortage is 

not in Aitutaki only, but it is everywhere.  Let me inform you all, for Aitutaki, when these water 

tanks arrives, each households will be able to take away two to three water tanks each, to store 

their drinking water.  In terms of water, this is not a problem.  We have survived from drinking 

water collected from above and not from below like the water you drink in Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would like to thank our people for not relying on what the Government can do to help.  

Instead, they went and purchased their own water tanks, especially with those who can afford to 

purchase one.   

</span></div><div><span>Listening to what is being said about proposals for the Private sectors and businesses to put aside 

some cash reserves for your own use should this pandemic strikes again.  I will tell you the truth, 

all these businesses are  well prepared with  their cash  reserves  and the  good thing  about  it, the 

Government  never  approached  all  these  businesses  to  dig  into  their  savings.    Instead,  the 

Government provided support to help their businesses proceed with no problems.   

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, if you want another trustworthy Government, we have the General Election around the 

</span><span>corner and I urge our people to bring those same people back so that the Government can reserve 

</span><span>another bag of cash reserves for another four to five years.   

</span></div><div><span>For now, I would like to thank the people of my Constituency, Arutanga/Reureu/Nikaupara, for 

the faith that you have placed in me to represent you.  You have witnessed my generosity and the 

generosity of our Government and the time of war has come.  Therefore, may God blesses you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to raise one point on the Manatua Cable as mentioned earlier by my colleague.  I want 

you to know that the reception in Aitutaki is really good.  I do not know what my colleague is 

</span><span>talking  about,  unless  your  phone  is  flat  with  aliens  trying  to  communicate  through  to  you.    I 

</span><span>sympathise our friends in the Outer Islands because this Cable has been installed in Aitutaki and 

all I could say is be patient.  Sometimes, I try contacting my friends in the Outer Islands and you 

will find that there is no connection.  Sometimes, the connection works and sometimes, it will just 

</span></div><div><a>Page 31</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>drop.  But for us in Aitutaki, our connection is 100 percent operational.  I will find a way to help 

you with your connection.  But if you bring this Government back into this House, I guarantee you 

that your connection issues in the Outer Islands will be dealt with 

</span></div><div><span>Before I take my seat, I just wanted to thank you my Constituency again and to tell them that I 

love you all.  Thank you very much and God bless us all. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  That just proves that Aitutaki has problems 

in realising their phones being flat.  I see the Honourable Member Agnes Armstrong; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS A. ARMSTRONG:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia orana to the House and everybody here.  

If I may, just a few words of greetings to my people.  To my two Kavana in Ivirua, Kia Orana, 

</span><span>tangi ke, tangi ke, tangi ke rava</span><span>.  To all the elders and all the people in Ivirua from one end to the 

other, our children, tangi ke rava.  Greetings also to Numangatini and all the Aronga Mana around 

Mangaia.  All our Church leaders and all denominations and all our people on Mangaia and from 

Mangaia, tangi ke, tangi ke rava in the love our our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>As with previous Budgets the Opposition has supported the government in moving forward and so 

with this Budget the Opposition I am sure will support as you have heard from previous speakers 

because we cannot object.  My learned friend here my colleague from Tamarua has spoken about 

issues that are affecting our island so I will not talk about those issues.   

</span></div><div><span>I will cover a few brief issues that I would like to highlight in this debate today and reserve my 

views on other individual vote items when we come to that.  I briefly wanted to touch on projects 

that we have supposedly had come our way in Mangaia.  We get something started but it is never 

completed due to lack of materials or maybe lack of funding.  I find that hard because projects 

usually you have a Quantity Survey done and so all materials, et cetera, should be covered and 

brought across to Mangaia to complete the job.  So I find it hard that we have a project that is 

sitting not completed for the last couple of months and I did ask people working on it and it’s the 

lack of materials and this is for our hospital and I think that’s a disgrace.  But we won’t go into 

details as I am sure someone will look into it for us. 

</span></div><div><span>There are other projects around water which have not been completed properly in which we were 

</span><span>assured that there was Budget there and one area has not covered or we have not seen anything 

happen and unfortunately this is in my constituency of Ivirua.  But we are a patient people, very, 

very patient but I thank my people for their patience and through that we will get there eventually. 

</span></div><div><span>The other issue that I would like to touch on is the Minimum Wage.  I know $8.50 is not much for 

people here in Rarotonga or maybe Aitutaki as well but 50 cents go a long way in the Pa Enua.  It 

would be nice to have more but my people are grateful for what they can get and we as MPs on 

the island we try to help our people wherever we can. 

</span></div><div><span>The other issue that I would like to touch on is the benefits for Caregivers.  I had mentioned that 

in the previous Budget, it would be nice also to have an increase for those looking after our sick, 

the old people, it would be nice to have an increase there. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 32</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Lastly, I would like to comment on the Old Age Pension increase of $20.  As I have previously 

stated, we are grateful for that and if I was the Leader as you alluded, Mr Speaker I would cut taxes 

on old age pensioners and in saying that Mr Speaker, I conclude with my support of the Budget.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  If there is no other Members who wishes to 

speak, I will call upon the Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member Selina Napa; you 

have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:  </span><span>Kia Orana to us all in this Honourable House.  Honourable Prime Minister and 

your Members of Parliament on your side, as well as Members on our side, Kia Orana.  To the 

staff of Parliament, Mr Speaker, Clerk of Parliament and all your staff, Kia Orana to you all in the 

Name of our Lord.  To the people of my Constituency, Titikaveka, Kia Orana to  you all in the 

Name  of  our  Lord.    As  we  are  faced  with  some  challenges  and  work  being  carried  out  in  our 

village, I just wanted to assure you that no matter what, I ask that we all work together in order for 

us to move forward.   

</span></div><div><span>I also wanted to greet all our women of the Cook Islands, Kia Orana to you all in the Name of our 

Lord.  There goes a song, </span><span>‘Kia aruru te enua katoa, i te akameitaki ia Iehova’, ‘For the earth to 

tremble, in praising God’. 

</span></div><div><span>I wanted to thank the Minister of Heath, the Head of Ministry, Mr Bob Williams and all your staff.  

I  also  wanted  to  thank  the  staff  in  our  Emergency  Operation  Centre  of  Titikaveka,  Alistair 

MacQuarrie and his team, Papa Sonny Williams, Wally and all the others, the nurses working in 

the  Clinic,  as  well  as  our  volunteers  that  gave  up  their  free  time  to  support  our  pandemic 

programme in our village, may God bless you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the Cook Islands Red Cross Society for their support in assisting 

the Ministry of Health. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the managers and staff of Prime Foods Ltd as well as CITC for 

</span><span>their sponsorship that went through Government for the food parcels that were delivered to those 

</span><span>in isolation during COVID.   

</span></div><div><span>I recall two years ago when we started preparing ourselves for this virus, our whole village got 

together and worked along with the Government through the Ministry of Health for the process of 

putting  a  plan  together  in  preparedness  for  COVID.    Even  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in 

encouraging our families to plant crops for their own support.   

</span></div><div><span>When COVID arrived, I was amazed at the food parcels that were distributed to those in isolation.  

</span><span>They had New Zealand food such as fruits like apples, pears, grapes, vegetables.  The question is, 

</span><span>where is our local food in these parcels?  Therefore, this is an area that needs attention for us not 

to focus on a short term goal in terms of food, but rather a long term plan that will help support 

our agricultural plans in planting crops for our country.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 33</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>My second issue is, I have always enjoyed watching the Minister Rose Toki-Brown on television 

in  communicating  to  the  people  of  the  Cook  Islands,  reminding  our  people  of  our  laws  that  is 

implemented by the Ministry of Health.  I would say that she was the face of MOH and was the 

face of COVID in the past year.  When COVID arrived, the Prime Minister took over the television 

show  instead  of  the  Minister  Responsible  for  Health.    Although  I  missed  seeing  her  face  on 

television, perhaps she is busy with her other responsibilities. 

</span></div><div><span>Back to our Appropriation Bill, I was shocked with how we got summoned for our Parliament to 

sit and to debate on this Bill.  We were not ready for the Bill.  Since I entered this Parliament, we 

always get guillotined for this Appropriation Bill, always, guillotine, guillotine, guillotine.   

</span></div><div><span>It  has  improved  the  last  two  years  that  we  have  come  through  because  we  have  followed  the 

procedures stipulated in our Standing Orders.  Today, we have been forced to rush through the 

Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  provisions  in  this  Bill  that  I  always  support,  the  provisions  under  the  National 

Environment Services.  I did not see this in the Prime Minister’s Ministerial Statement, neither in 

our Books.  I believe that we should allocate some fundings to our Outer Islands to help with the 

sortation of white wear, e-wastes, scrap metals, abandoned vehicles that are lying around.  When 

can we allocate an appropriation to help clean these rubbish in our country?  This is a serious issue 

for us here in Rarotonga and also for some of the Outer Islands.  Last year, there were groups who 

have applied for some fundings with GEF help them remove these wastes.  Their application was 

approved but nothing came through to them to help them with this project of theirs.  I can also see 

that a new application has been advertised in our local papers by GEF, and yet, GEF have not paid 

all the approved applications from last year.   

</span></div><div><span>Under  Output  2  for  the  National  Environment  Services,  $40  thousand  were  allocated  to  help 

monitor our environment, to help support our environmental projects.  There was also a $150k 

allocated  for  EIA  processes.    I  know  that  under  our  Rarotonga  Environment  Authority,  the 

National Environment Services always approaches us Members of Parliament to help support their 

Appropriation allocations for the work they do.   

</span></div><div><span>Also, looking at this Appropriation Bill, I could not see any fundings that has been allocated for 

</span><span>Muri Lagoon, our pilot projects in Takitumu for our septic tanks, which is a major disaster for 

Takitumu.    The  $40  thousand  that  is  being  put  aside  for  these  projects  will  not  cater  for  these 

projects of Takitumu.   

</span></div><div><span>My last point that I would like to talk about, the Rarotonga Cyclone Shelters Remediation, $400 

thousand was allocated to help upgrade the Cyclone Centres here in Rarotonga.  I would like to 

ask the Honourable Prime Minister if he can allocate part of this funding to help with the upgrade 

of our Sunday School Hall in Titikaveka.  We are currently in the process of renovating this Hall, 

</span><span>anticipating for the 200 Years Celebration for the Bicentennial.  The Sunday School Hall is also 

</span><span>used as a Cyclone Shelter because we do not have one for Titikaveka.  Not only that, you Members 

of  Parliament  need  to  remember  that  you  also  utilise  this  house  for  Government  meetings, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 34</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Parliament and Select Committee meetings, it is in this Sunday School Hall where these meetings 

are held.   

</span></div><div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  staff  from  MFEM  who  were  responsible  for  putting  this 

Appropriation together because honestly, this is not an easy task.  Therefore, I want to thank them 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>For this Appropriation Bill, I would like to give my support in line with my colleagues in this side.  

I believe that this Appropriation Bill will serve to support our people, Government employees, our 

elderlies, our children and so forth. 

</span></div><div><span>Philippians  4:4-5  says,  </span><span>“Rejoice  in  the  Lord  always.  I  will  say  it  again:  Rejoice! </span><span>5 </span><span>Let  your 

gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near</span><span>”.  

</span></div><div><span>I also support what the Minister George Angene had said earlier for us all to </span><span>“live in peace and to be very careful with 

</span><span>how we live”. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you and all the best to everyone.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Deputy Speaker, the 

Honourable Tingika Elikana; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:</span><span>  First of all, Kia Orana to everyone who is here today in the Name of our 

Lord.  I would like to thank Him for allowing this moment for us all to debate on the Appropriation 

Bill for our country.  Mr Speaker, staff of Parliament, greetings to you all in the Name of our Lord.  

The  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Members  of 

Parliament  on  the  Government  side,  greetings  to  you  all  in  the  Name  of  our  Lord.    To  the 

Opposition side, to your Leader who is not here today, hopefully she will join us sometimes this 

week, may the Lord be with you all and may He give you the skills and knowledge for the work 

you do in your individual Constituencies.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before I make my comments on the Merits of the Budget, I would like to add my 

congratulations to the Ministry of Health, the Minister, the Secretary and all who works within the 

Ministry of Health for the work they have done, which enabled us to reach the stage where we are 

now in terms of this pandemic.  Also further thanks to those both in the private sector and the 

public sector who also contributed as mentioned by earlier speakers in us reaching the stage where 

we are now in terms of this response to COVID-19.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, we heard the Prime Minister announced this is a Budget of keeping the Faith. We 

have come through two previous Budget cycles where we started with a Budget of Blessing and 

rightly so because at that time we counted our blessings because we put aside sufficient funds for 

us to weather the storm at the start of this COVID-19 pandemic. I am sure all of us will recall in 

the 2020 Budget that was presented in this House that the majority of the funding for that came 

</span><span>from  our  reserves  which  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  as  Minister  of  Finance  has  put  aside 

</span><span>previously to enable us to face rainy days then.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 35</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>In  this  cycle  that  we  are  going  through  we  went  from  a  Budget  of  Blessings  to  a  Budget  of 

Recovery and if I recall the Honourable Prime Minister as Minister of Finance clearly saying we 

are going through unpredictable times and requires an unpredictable response.  As a result we have 

to look elsewhere for support from our development partners. I think we owe to our development 

partners for their support to enable us to weather the storm that we are going through. And in that 

respect we should say thanks to the one that has always been with us which is the Government of 

New Zealand and we should always provide them with preferential treatment in our country. So, 

Mr Speaker and I think it is timely to acknowledge the role that New Zealand has played in our 

recovery and continue to provide them with that preferential treatment if they ever decided to come 

on our shores. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, in the Budget that is currently before the House because of the good work that we have done 

and the good support that we have received from our development partners, now we are being 

asked to keep the faith and continue on the path towards recovery.  That Mr Speaker is the role of 

a government, of a Minister of Finance who knows what he is doing and he will lead us to recovery, 

to  the Promised  Land if  I may use those terms.    As  you would recall those of us who  had the 

opportunity to attend the Budget Breakfast for the launch of this Budget during this current Budget 

that we are going through which we are just about to reach the end of the cycle we can see the light 

at the end of the tunnel.   

</span></div><div><span>With the new Budget starting on the 1</span><span>st</span><span> of July we are coming out of that tunnel and can see the 

Promised  Land  and  I  urge  the  Members  of  the  Opposition  to  read  the  Budget  carefully  and  in 

particular  the  Revenue  Predictions  that  will  be  coming  in  to  helps  us  in  our  recovery  and  in 

response to the comments about time the timing of this Budget and the need for it to be passed 

before we go into the Elections is necessary because when we get into Elections and when we 

come back into government under the Cook Islands Party we do not want to be slowed down by 

Election Petitions so we have to wait for 6 months.  

</span></div><div><span>That is the reason why we need to pass the Budget we go into Elections so once we get back into 

office we hit the floor running. So, that is why we timed the Budget to have it passed before we 

go in the silly season. I have heard the comments made by previous speakers in regards the Budget 

especially the challenges that we face as a result of COVID-19 and the options available to us and 

one of those is  which  was more less promoted by  commentators in  the public arena  and some 

</span><span>political aspirants and some from the other side of the aisles that is for us to cut spending. 

</span></div><div><span>I think Mr Speaker we all can recall what happened in 1996. This government has learnt from that 

so it is not an option.  As you can see today that’s why we are asking our people to keep the faith 

in a government that is very responsible and will lead us out of this crisis that we are currently 

facing.  The other option is to do nothing.  Again that is not something your government is going 

to do.  The third option which is the more favoured option by this government is to do something 

and do it well.  We have kept our work force, we have in this Budget add a little bit to the minimum 

wage, we add a little bit extra for our old age pensioners and I must say because this government 

</span><span>focused on affordability which others has come up with some big ideas of how we should spend 

</span><span>government’s money, this government looked at affordability and the Budget reflects that what we 

have got into our Budget is based on what we can afford. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 36</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>I am pleased with the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition, newly crowned as you 

have alluded to Mr Speaker, who highlighted the difficulty if we are going to increase the minimum 

wage that  people in  the  Outer  Islands will face especially those with  businesses who pay their 

workers anything more than the sum suggested of $12 and $15, and that is how thankful our people 

are in the Outer Islands, the Old Age Pension with the extra money they will get in their pension.  

My only comments to you is you are sitting on the wrong side.  I think, like-minded people like 

yourself should sit together so we can drive this beautiful country of ours to the promised land. 

</span></div><div><span>I think we also need to be looking at the returns what we can get from our Budget.  Much has been 

talked  about  the  developments  in  the  Outer  Islands  particularly  in  the  Northern  Group  islands.  

Questions were raised in the Public arena about development on Penrhyn with the Centres, their 

new  hospital  for  Tetautua  and  then  the  development  for  Manihiki,  the  new  Administration 

Government buildings and also Pukapuka’s hospital and the harbor for Nassau.  Unfortunately, a 

lot  also  made  comments  about  diversification  from  tourism  because  that  is  just  that,  words.    I 

haven’t heard any Member from the Opposition or even with these commentators in the public 

arena providing how we should diversify, where we should diversify and what we need to diversify 

from. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Tingika Elikana.  I see the Honourable Albert Nicholas; 

you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>I stand to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>That the speaking time for the Honourable Member Tingika Elikana,  

be extended 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Tereapii Maki-Kavana</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Member, I think you have five minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. ELIKANA:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I was just talking about development in the Northern Group 

islands in particular.  I will not talk about all of them just focus on very important development 

that will have an impact on our economy.  You will recall, Mr Speaker and I think most of us will 

recall when the Prime Minister at the Budget breakfast raised the issue of development on Manihiki 

</span><span>airport and also the Penrhyn airport.   

</span></div><div><span>Coupled with that is his successful trip to Tahiti for discussions on potential air links.  Those air 

links if established, Mr Speaker will enable visitors to our paradise to have the opportunity either

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>to fly to Rarotonga or fly directly to the Northern Group and that could provide job opportunities 

for people on those islands of Manihiki and Penrhyn if that eventuate and that will increase the 

market available for our tourism and surely, Mr Speaker I am sure everyone can follow.  It will 

have an impact on our revenue.  Not only that, it provide economic opportunities for the people in 

the Northern Group and Mr Speaker, I look  forward to that time because I will be sending the 

Nassau Ferry from Pukapuka to take taro, fish to help with the tourist accommodations on Manihiki 

and Penrhyn.  That again will improve Pukapuka with the export of taro and fish opportunities to 

these two other islands. 

</span></div><div><span>So we do not, Mr Speaker have to look at the big picture items we have to look within what we 

can do in our country and Mr Speaker, it saddens me that connectivity has become an issue and 

some Members particularly those of the Opposite side of the isles seem to be pointing the finger 

at  government.    Fortunately,  for  the  islands  of  Pukapuka  and  Nassau  they  have  a  Member  of 

Parliament who thinks well ahead of his time because I do not have those problems when I go to 

Pukapuka.  You see me zoom into Parliament, you see me zoom into Cabinet because it’s available 

on Pukapuka and there is no lag time.  We have Kuki Net providers, we have Vodafone and soon 

to have Star Link but I have some issues with Star Link.  So Mr Speaker, connectivity depends on 

us Members of Parliament to look at the opportunities out there and try to connect between your 

island and Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>Because of time, Mr Speaker I would like to touch on something very important in terms of the 

Budget which some of the Members had mentioned it in passing that is our ability to respond if 

we are faced with some shocks or some issues, disasters in the next couple of months.  As I said 

earlier on, we have a very responsible, diligent, meticulous Finance Minister who went out of his 

way to make sure if such an event is to occur then we will be able to respond. 

</span></div><div><span>That Mr Speaker is the Contingency Fund available to us through ADB which is not added into 

our debts but can be drawn if the need arises.   

</span></div><div><span>That Mr Speaker is the sign of a Finance Minister, leader of a nation that you can put your trust in 

and keep the faith.  That comes only from years of experience of handling public funds for all 

those years.  That is why I have issues if the purse of this country is handed to those on the other 

side of the House.  I urge the people listening in to Parliament this afternoon to keep the faith and 

</span><span>maintain it until such time we reach the promise land.  Kia Orana and thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member, now I see the Honourable Minister Robert 

Tapaitau; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  First of all greetings to you Mr Speaker, Clerk and staff of Parliament, 

Kia Orana in the Name of our Lord.  Please, if I could be allowed some time to greet my people. 

</span></div><div><span>To the people of Tongareva, Mayor, Council Members, Kia Orana.  To our Church Ministers, the 

</span><span>different Denominations, Kia Orana.  To the Executive and Government staff, Kia Orana.  To our 

</span><span>Land Holdings staff who is building our Hospital in Tetautua, Kia Orana.  To our CICC Church in 

Omoka, who is building our Reverend’s residential house, Kia Orana in the Name of our Lord.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to comment on the Appropriation Bill, the </span><span>“Keeping the Faith” </span><span>Budget.  Just earlier, I heard 

one of the Members saying for us not to trust in men.  I believe that this Appropriation Bill, God 

has given the skills and knowledge to those responsible in putting it together.   

</span></div><div><span>As I was reading the newspaper earlier, one of the Members said that “this Budget is a joke”.  This 

kind of comments should not be used to criticise our own people for putting this Budget together.  

It was our own people who works at MFEM that had prepared for this Budget, informing our Prime 

Minister at the same time the structural breakdowns of the Budget. These are the same people that 

brought us through the last two years with previous Budgets.  To me, I praise God for this because 

we had no interruptions to the Old Age Pensions, to the salaries of our employees, these are the 

things that we need to look at. 

</span></div><div><span>The to-be-Leader of the Opposition was saying earlier that the 50cents increase in the Minimum 

Wage is huge for us in the Outer Islands.  Therefore, let us not talk about this.  One of the Members 

was saying earlier for us to work together.  Is this what  mean about working together?  This is 

nowhere near working together.  As the Member of Pukapuka/Nassau had said earlier on our behalf 

of the Northern Group islands, “work together!”  But then, you the Opposition went on the radio 

and said  that these allocations for these projects  for the Northern Groups islands is a complete 

waste  of  money.    This  includes  the  Hospital  for  Penrhyn,  the  runway  for  Manihiki,  the 

Administration building for Manihiki, the wharf in Pukapuka, all these things, he said, it is a waste 

of money.  To our Northern Group people, these are the things that they are saying about you and 

I know that you all heard them.  Are you not people of this country?  Are you not Cook Islanders 

for these people to criticise you?  If they truly mean for us to work together, then by all means, 

come and speak to us. 

</span></div><div><span>This Appropriation Bill truly is about FAITH. 

</span></div><div><span>We believed that God was the one who led us through this pandemic.  We also believed that God 

will release us from this pandemic.  I do not know about the Opposition side, but the Government, 

I know that our side is committed in our work.  Faith without work is dead.  It goes hand in hand.  

That is what it is for today.  When we say for us to work together, let us work together.  I hardly 

criticise you in Public and I do not want to criticise you because we are one.  We are all the same 

in this House.  You are trying your best in your own Constituency I am doing the same as well.  It 

</span><span>is of no use for you to go on the radio, let us communicate to each other.  On the radio, you will 

</span><span>only get animosity.  When I look at this Appropriation Bill, it is a good one because our wishes 

are being granted.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Minister of Health, her Secretariat, staff of Ministry of Health, may God 

bless you all. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to acknowledge our Prime Minister.  I will not repeat everything because the 

Honourable Tingika Elikana had said it all. 

</span></div><div><span>All I can say is, praise the Lord for granting our Prime Minister the wisdom in leading our country.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 39</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>I also give thanks to God for what I am going through right now.  To the Government, thank you 

what you do.   

</span></div><div><span>Earlier today, one of the Members said that we have a lot of debts.  Hold on, are you concerned 

more about the debts we owe than the lives of our people?  All I could see is Government looking 

after our people.  To all of us in this House, we have spoken about team work, let us work together 

as a team.  Like you said, we have come hand in hand walking through this pandemic, let us keep 

it going.  I wanted to make it clear that the benefits of all of this is for our people, not for ourselves.  

This is what we strive for. 

</span></div><div><span>I think I will finish here because my time is up.  May the grace of God be with you all, Kia Orana 

and all the best. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Prime Minister.  Sorry, 

I see the Honourable Member William Heather; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. HEATHER:  </span><span>Thank you very much Mr Speaker and greetings to all Members in this 

Honourable  House.    Firstly,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Prime  Minister  of  New  Zealand,  the 

government and the people of New Zealand who is listening to our broadcast today, for the $50 

million that they have given us to help our nation during this pandemic. 

</span></div><div><span>On behalf of our Leader, I would like to thank the people and the Government of Australian, for 

their generosity in providing us with KUKUPA II that will help serve the people of our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I would also like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister for the support that he had given to the 

people of my Constituency, Ruaau.  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in this moment, I would like to ask you if I can be spared a time to greet my people 

of Ruaau.  Kia Orana to the Kaumaiti and to the different sectors of our suburb.  Kia Orana to our 

Church Ministers and the different Denominations within our Constituency. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I was enjoying listening to the Member of Parliament from Pukapuka/Nassau.  It was 

very interesting to his speech, it seemed that he had memorized his speech.  I also wanted to greet 

</span><span>our  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the  Honourable  Member  for  Tongareva.    Mr  Speaker,  both  these 

</span><span>Honourable Members forgot what they did to me back in 2018 in reference to a Bill that was passed 

in  this  Honourable  House.    We  looked  at  tar-sealing  our  road,  it  is  here  where  these  eggs  are 

hatching and I believe that it is our responsibility to care these hens laying their eggs.  Mr Speaker, 

I am not sure what happened to the $3 million that was allocated for this project.  If their intention 

is for us to work together, yes that is what we aim to do, for us all to work together.  However, 

there will always be disagreement if we do not work together in this House.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when we look at some of the Ministries, they have failed.  Agriculture, the Ministry 

</span><span>of Health and Infrastructure, they have all failed.  This is because we do not work together.  If we 

</span><span>refer  back  to  our  last  Budget,  our  Outer  Islands  were  diversified.    We  need  to  put  a  proposal 

together in helping our Outer Islands as well, not just Rarotonga.  I find this very disappointing.  

When I spoke on that day, there was a Point of Order and I had to cease my speech.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 40</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, Mr Speaker and all Honourable Members of this House, I am a very peaceful person 

but if we do not work together, something else will burst out me. 

</span></div><div><span>Our shipping services today, we can see that there are no ships at all, except for the barge.  All the 

other ships are on dock.  What can we do to help our people from the Northern Group?  Do you 

expect us not to say anything?   

</span></div><div><span>In reference to  why  I  said  that the Ministry of  Agriculture have  failed,  in  the past,  we used to 

export.  Today, we do not export anymore.  This could be the result of COVID, but it cannot be 

because this happened before COVID, this resulted with Agriculture going down.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Honourable Member, I will have to interrupt you as our time is up.  You can 

continue tomorrow when we return to our Parliament Sitting.  We now have come to the end of 

our business for today and I call upon the Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MS T. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  I move that: 

</span></div><div><span>Standing Order 54 (2) and 54 (3) be suspended and that Parliament do now adjourn until 

10.00 a.m. tomorrow, Wednesday 25</span><span>th</span><span> with a break at 11.30 a.m. to 12.00 p.m. and resume 

until 2.30 p.m. with a break from 2.30 p.m. to 3.00 p.m. and continue until 5.00 p.m.  These 

Sitting times also apply for Thursday, 26</span><span>th</span><span> and Friday, 27 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>I call for a Seconder to the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable William Heather 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Members for your hard work today.   Now that we have 

come  to  the  end  of  our  business  for  today,  may  I  please  ask  the  Honourable  Member  William 

Heather to close our Sitting with a Closing Prayer?
