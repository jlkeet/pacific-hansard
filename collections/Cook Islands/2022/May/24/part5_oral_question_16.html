<h3>Oral Question 16</h3>
<div><span>HON.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  everybody.    Thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  of 

Titikaveka for the good question.  Today, we struggle in recruiting dentists for our dental clinics.  

However, I am excited to inform everybody that we were able to recruit a dentist who is a Specialist 

as well.  We have also discovered that his partner is also a dentist from overseas.  They will be 

</span><span>able to assist our dental department, not only for Rarotonga, but for the Outer Islands as well.  Our 

</span><span>plan for the dental clinic in your Constituency Honourable Member, we will look into utilising that 

clinic as the money used to renovate the clinic is from the Government.
