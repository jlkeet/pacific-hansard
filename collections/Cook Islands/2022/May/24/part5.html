<div><span>QUESTION TIME 

</span></div><div><span>The last person speaking yesterday was the Honourable Albert Nicholas; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR A. NICHOLAS:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker and a beautiful morning to you.  To the Clerk, your 

Deputy and your staff and all Members in this House greetings to you all.  To our people listening 

over  the  radio  and  other  means  of  hearing  this  sitting,  to  the  breadth,  the  length  and  to  the 

encirclement of our country, greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  like  what  I  had  mentioned  yesterday,  ICI  in  partnership  with  Waste  Management 

Cook Islands, Mr Speaker have considered a number of incinerator models, considered a number 

of suppliers who could potentially supply us with the necessary equipment to deal with our waste.  

Suppliers such as Asher Model, a company out of Malaysia, Mr Speaker, Intherma Industries, Mr 

Speaker a company out of Germany and Incinerate, a company that supplies incinerators out of 

UK. 

</span></div><div><span>This is just a few of the companies and suppliers that the Agency has been in talks with over the 

</span><span>last few months.  ICI is currently putting together the terms of reference for seeking expressions 

of  interest  from  companies  both  foreign  and  domestic  who  may  be  interested  in  providing  the 

appropriate equipment for us to deal with waste.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>A call for EOI submissions will open on 1 June this year, Mr Speaker.  This will open on the 1</span><span>st</span><span>

June and will close by 27 July 2022, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>Following that process, Mr Speaker requests for tender will be issued by 30 September 2022 and 

tender submissions will close on 25 November 2022. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member from Ruaau had queried the funding of this particular programme.  I can 

confirm to the Honourable Member and this House and our people listening to this programme 

this  morning,  Mr  Speaker  that  this  programme  concerning  the  incinerator  for  our  waste 

programme,  this  programme  will  be  funded  through  the  ITF  fund  or  the  New  Zealand 

Infrastructure Trust Fund.  So Mr Speaker, I hope the information that I have laid before the House 

satisfies the Honourable Memberâ€™s query.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member and now I see the Honourable Member Vaitoti 

Tupa; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR V. TUPA:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  My question is more of a request because I am not the 

type of person who is shy to ask for help.  When I saw the Honourable Minister George Angene 

in his uniform, therefore my question will be directed to him.  I can see he is wearing a green and 

gold uniform.  My question to you Honourable Minister is, I heard that you will be putting up a 

dome  and  you  have  received  a  dome.    I  heard  that  this  dome  will  be  established  in 

Tupapa/Maraerenga.    Therefore,  my  question  is,  is  it  possible  to  get  one  for  Matavera?    Mr 

Speaker, if you look at Matavera, it is just a small village.  But the thing I like about this village is 

the six different Denominations in it.  This is what I wanted to ask, if a dome can be established in 

the village of Matavera.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  George 

Angene; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. G. ANGENE:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  The question posed is if it is possible!  This is not 

a question, it is a request.  The request is, to build a dome for Matavera.  Your request Honourable 

Member Vaitoti Tupa, it will be granted.  It is now my turn to ask you for a favour.  I ask that you 

</span><span>move over to this side of the House, I will guarantee you that you will get your dome next week.  

</span><span>In regards to this request, I did thought about it for all Members of Parliament.  In 2012, I requested 

a bobcat, a digger and a weight lifting truck.  Instead, my request was denied.  However, I believe 

that what the Member of Parliament have requested, because we have a strong relationship with 

the people of China.  I believe, I can get one for each one of us.  We need to work together and be 

surrounded with the unity of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable Member, we will have a chat about your request, not just for you, but for all of us.  

Amen. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  see  the  Honourable  Member  William 

Heather; I am sure he is going to ask for one for Ruaau.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR W. HEATHER:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Good morning to  you and all Members of this 

House and the staff of Parliament, including all of our people listening in on our radio.  I want to 

direct my question to the Prime Minister because he is the leader of our country and he is also the 

Minister Responsible for Finace. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is, in the past few days, we all know that there are eggs hatching in Arorangi from 

around  Edgewater  and  from  Blackrock  to  the  school  in  Arorangi  with  eggs  along  the  beaches.  

With eggs hatching in this area, even around restaurants and on the side of the main road, what 

can be done to sort this problem out because Ruaau have raised some concerns about this problem?  

That is my question Honourable Prime Minister, I will await for your favorable response.  Thank 

you.  

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  see  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 

Honourable Mark Brown. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. M. BROWN:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker, I pity this request from Puaikura.  I think when we 

look at the Appropriation for this year, there is an allocation for our road development, nearly $7 

million.  At the moment, there is work on the road leading to the Avatiu valley.  This is one of the 

worst roads on our islands and it needs to be improved.   

</span></div><div><span>When that is finished, we will begin from Turangi to the Church in Aroko.  This project will finish 

in Titikaveka, an area where this project has not started yet and we will work our way towards 

Vaimaanga.    After  Titikaveka,  we  will  make  our  way  into  Arorangi.    The  aim  here  is,  the 

companies that are conducting this work, they want the job done and they do not want to sit around, 

in fact, they want push this work forward. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore,  this  is  a  priority  for  the  Government.    When  the  work  on  one  side  of  the  road  is 

completed, we will begin straight away with Puaikura.  We know that Puaikura is a place where 

eggs are hatched for the country.   Sometimes, there are bad eggs but sometimes, you good get 

good eggs.  So, that is my reply to your question Honourable Member.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Prime Minister, I see the Honourable Member Tamaiva 

</span><span>Tuavera; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TUAVERA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Firstly, I would like to thank the Minister George 

Angene because the eastern stars of Ngatangiia is coming up, the star is rising.  The house you 

were talking about earlier, we would need it in Ngatangiia.   

</span></div><div><span>Looking at  the  Budget  book, there is  funding and we have borrowed $130 million  to  fund our 

response to COVID. 

</span></div><div><span>My question is directed to the Minister of Health.  In this instant, our main focus is COVID.  With 

</span><span>the Health system, do they also cover the dental within the Health system?  I have been to the 

dental clinic in Tupapa and what I saw have shocked me.  The hygiene level is not as high as it 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>49</span><span>th</span><span> Session 

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>used to be.  When I had an x-ray for my teeth, the tube of the x-ray was not clean.  If you want to 

find out yourself, so to the dental clinic and check for yourselves.   

</span></div><div><span>My question is, is dental included in this COVID fund because the hygienic level is very poor.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Tamaiva Tuavera.  I see the Honourable Minister Rose 

Toki-Brown; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you.  Kia Orana Mr Speaker, Clerk and staff of Parliament, 

our Interpreters and our people listening in on our radio.  Thank you to the Honourable Member 

of Ngatangiia for the question.  Yes, the expenditure of the Ministry of Health (MOH) does not 

disregard the different parts that is controlled by MOH.  I wanted to confirm to everybody today 

that  we  have  received  new  equipment  for  our  Hospital  within  the  dental  department.    Before 

COVID arrived, we did some inspection in our dental clinics.  But due to COVID, this work was 

postponed.   

</span></div><div><span>In reference to your query about the hygiene of this clinic, I wanted to inform you all that we have 

staff  members  allocated  to  clean  our  Hospital  including  Managers  whose  responsibility  is  to 

monitor their work.  I am quite disappointed with your query but I will investigate this myself in 

rectifying this problem.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Selina Napa; you have 

the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  I have a Supplementary Question to the Minister of Health.  To the Honourable 

Minister, I am aware that MOH has expended quite a sum of money during COVID on our dental 

clinic in Titikaveka, the only problem is that there is no dentist on our side. 

</span></div><div><span>The purpose of this clinic is to allow our people residing in this area of Takitumu, including Rutaki, 

to  visit  this  clinic  for  dental  treatment.    If  this  facility  is  not  being  used,  this  property  will 

deteriorate and all its equipment inside of it.   

</span></div><div><span>My  question  to  the  Honourable  Minister  is,  will  there  be  a  dentist  employed  for  this  clinic  of 

</span><span>Takitumu and will MOH consider in utilizing this clinic in Titikaveka? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I see the Honourable Minister; you have the 

Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  R.  TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  everybody.    Thank  you  to  the  Honourable  Member  of 

Titikaveka for the good question.  Today, we struggle in recruiting dentists for our dental clinics.  

However, I am excited to inform everybody that we were able to recruit a dentist who is a Specialist 

as well.  We have also discovered that his partner is also a dentist from overseas.  They will be 

</span><span>able to assist our dental department, not only for Rarotonga, but for the Outer Islands as well.  Our 

</span><span>plan for the dental clinic in your Constituency Honourable Member, we will look into utilising that 

clinic as the money used to renovate the clinic is from the Government.

</span></div><div><span>Tuesday, 24 May 2022 

</span></div><div><span>Volume 14 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you very much Honourable Minister.  I see the Honourable Member, 

Tetangi Matapo; you have the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Good morning to everyone.  I appreciate the answers from the Ministers.  I 

rise on behalf of Outer Islands, especially the island of Mangaia.  When I heard the discussion 

about the dental equipment in Titikaveka, it is a bit different for Mangaia because we have nothing.  

Honourable Minister, you were saying that you will carry out an investigation in this area, I just 

wanted to let you know that our dentist followed us to Rarotonga and if you can have the dental 

equipment checked.  Last week, I went to the dental clinic and the machine they were using was 

leaking.  As the Minister have mentioned about hygienic, this is different.  The dental equipment 

works but is leaking onto patients.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER</span><span>:  Honourable Member, can you ask your question? 

</span></div><div><span>MRS T. MATAPO:</span><span>  My question and my request is for the Minister to check this out herself. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  I will ask the Honourable Minister to take 

your seat to allow time to prepare an answer for tomorrow. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Honourable Members, we have come to the end of Question Time.
