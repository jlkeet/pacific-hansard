<h3>Oral Question 14</h3>
<div><span>MRS S. NAPA:</span><span>  I have a Supplementary Question to the Minister of Health.  To the Honourable 

Minister, I am aware that MOH has expended quite a sum of money during COVID on our dental 

clinic in Titikaveka, the only problem is that there is no dentist on our side. 

</span></div>
<div><span>The purpose of this clinic is to allow our people residing in this area of Takitumu, including Rutaki, 

to  visit  this  clinic  for  dental  treatment.    If  this  facility  is  not  being  used,  this  property  will 

deteriorate and all its equipment inside of it.   

</span></div>
<div><span>My  question  to  the  Honourable  Minister  is,  will  there  be  a  dentist  employed  for  this  clinic  of 

</span><span>Takitumu and will MOH consider in utilizing this clinic in Titikaveka? 

</span></div>
