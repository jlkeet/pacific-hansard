<h3>Oral Question 12</h3>
<div><span>HON. R. TOKI-BROWN:</span><span>  Thank you.  Kia Orana Mr Speaker, Clerk and staff of Parliament, 

our Interpreters and our people listening in on our radio.  Thank you to the Honourable Member 

of Ngatangiia for the question.  Yes, the expenditure of the Ministry of Health (MOH) does not 

disregard the different parts that is controlled by MOH.  I wanted to confirm to everybody today 

that  we  have  received  new  equipment  for  our  Hospital  within  the  dental  department.    Before 

COVID arrived, we did some inspection in our dental clinics.  But due to COVID, this work was 

postponed.   

</span></div>
<div><span>In reference to your query about the hygiene of this clinic, I wanted to inform you all that we have 

staff  members  allocated  to  clean  our  Hospital  including  Managers  whose  responsibility  is  to 

monitor their work.  I am quite disappointed with your query but I will investigate this myself in 

rectifying this problem.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div>
