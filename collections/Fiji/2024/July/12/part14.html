<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, please kindly note that there will be five Committees Reports for tabling today. Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Agriculture 2019-2022 Annual Reports HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Malo e lelei tamasi! As Chair of Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I am pleased to present the Committee’s Consolidated Report on the three Annual Reports from the Ministry of Forestry that covered the periods from 2019 to 2022. Through these Annual Reports, we gained invaluable insights into the various activities and achievements of the Ministry during the review period. The Committee has noted with concern the overreliance on imported forest products and the decreasing export of such forest products. Amidst global concern about climate change and environment degradation, Fiji has continued to demonstrate its commitment to responsible forest management and conservation. The Ministry of Forestry has been at the forefront of these efforts, implementing policies and initiatives aimed at preserving our rich biodiversity, mitigating climate change and fostering socio-economic development.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>1360</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 In the face of evolving threats, it is essential that the Ministry remains vigilant and proactive in its efforts to safeguard our natural resources for future generations. It is imperative that we acknowledge the work that lies ahead. The sustainability of our forests is not merely a goal, but a shared responsibility that requires ongoing commitment and innovation. The Committee noted the importance of collaboration and partnerships, both domestically and internationally, in addressing the complex challenges facing our forests that cannot be understated. From reforestation, sustainable logging practices and community engagement to capacity building, the Reports provide a comprehensive overview of the Ministry's multifaceted approach in forest management. The Committee acknowledges the staff of the Ministry of Forestry and stakeholders for their dedication and support during the site visit. I take this opportunity to thank honourable Jone Usamate (Deputy Chairperson); honourable Isikeli Tuiwailevu; honourable Iliesa Vanawalu and honourable Joseph Nand, for the compilation of this bipartisan Report. (Report handed to Secretary-General) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Orders 121(5), I hereby move a motion without notice: That a debate on the contents of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited 2020-2023 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA.- The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. The Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited (FSC) was incorporated in Fiji by an Act of Parliament in 1972, to take over the milling activities with effect from 1 st April, 1973. It is the successor to South Pacific Sugar Mill Limited and Colonial Sugar Refining Limited. The Sugar Industry is crucial to Fiji’s economy, contributing approximately 0.9 percent of the GDP, and generating about 5.7 percent of domestic exports in 2022, according to the provisional data from the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Over the four years under review, the Committee noted a significant decline in cane production from 2020 to 2021, followed by a 16 percent increase from 2021 to 2022. Despite this improvement, cane production remains below the desired level of 2.5 million tonnes and continues to show a declining trend. The Committee identified several factors contributing to the decline in sugar production. These include the: • lack of interest by the farmers who perceive cane farming as unprofitable;</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1361 • • • • inconsistent cane supply to the mill, resulting in underutilization of mill capacity; decline in cane quality; non-existence of KPIs; and non-renewal and absence of strategic plans to forecast the Corporation’s future targets and outputs. The Committee noted FSC's reliance on Government grants for its operation, given its debt levels and recurring losses. However, the Committee strongly suggest that the Corporation develops proper KPIs for all sugar related sectors to ensure the economic viability of the sector. At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Members who were part of the team that produced this Report: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Honourable Sashi Kiran - Deputy Chairperson; - Member; Honourable Premila Kumar Honourable Tomasi Tunabuna - Member; Honourable Semi Koroilavesau - Member; and Honourable Aliki Bia Member. - On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend this Review Report to Parliament and request all Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report. MR. SPEAKER.-Please, hand the report to the Secretary-General. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a motion, without notice: That a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p>Question put Motion agreed to. Consolidated Review Report - Sugar Cane Growers Council 2019-2021 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Council 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports. The Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) is the only grower representative organisation that is committed to provide service delivery, representation and leadership, to ensure a long term viability of growers in the industry. The Committee was made aware that in 2021, SCGC recorded 18 percent reduction in cane production, compared to 2020 season. The decline in production was mainly due to the destruction by Tropical Cyclone Yasa in December 2020, which affected farms to progress in subsequent harvesting season. In 2021, SCGC introduced Fiji’s Micro Insurance Product for our cane growers in assisting the growers to recover quickly following a disaster. Such initiative was deemed a game changer for</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>1362</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 most vulnerable farmers. Therefore, it is vital to identify important policy and practical measures to reform the sugar industry in Fiji to boost farmer’s confidence and motivation as critical ingredients for increasing sugarcane crop cultivation, production, yield, and farmers to continue in sugarcane farming business. At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members, who were part of the team that produced this Report: (1) (2) (3) (4) Honourable Sashi Kiran Honourable Premila Kumar Honourable Tomasi Tunabuna - Member; and Honourable Semi Koroilavesau - Member. - Deputy Chairperson; - Member; On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend this Review Report to Parliament and request all Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Please, hand the report to the Secretary-General. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a motion, without notice: That a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of the children of Vuda District School and some of their teachers, not forgetting the former Member of Parliament, Ms. Tanya Waqanika, sitting in the gallery, I suppose Ms. Savu, who has just graduated from the Law School. If you do not mind, I will just speak in the vernacular to the children. Vinaka vakalevu na gade mai nikua ragone.

Vinaka vakalevu ragone. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to table once more one of his Reports. Consolidated Review Report – Sugar Industry Tribunal 2016-2020 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA.–Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Industry Tribunal’s 2016, 2017,</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1363 2018, 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports. The Sugar Industry Tribunal was established under the Sugar Industry Act (Cap 206) in 1984. The functions of the Tribunal and its Accountant and Industrial Commissioner are described in sections 21, 22 and 26 of the Act. The Sugar Industry Tribunal serves several crucial purposes within the Fiji Sugar Industry. These include, dispute resolution, setting standards, efficiency promotion and conciliation. Some of the pertinent findings emanating from the scrutiny of the Sugar Industry Tribunal’s 2016-2020 Annual Reports are as follows: • • • • • Failure to submit Annual Report on time. The Master Award is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. The absence of centralised database accessible to all institutions within the Sugar Sector is creating confusion. Currently, each institution is maintaining its own database. Establishing a single database would streamline data management, enhance collaboration and improve sector performance. Non-compliance with accounting standards has led to the issuance of qualified opinion by the Auditor-General, highlighting issues with financial reporting. The Sugar Industry Tribunal is a remnant of the colonial era, established before other institutions were in place. Appointment of the Tribunal can be carried out by the Ministry of Sugar so that the Tribunal can remain an effective body for arbitration. At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team that produced the Report: (1) (2) (3) (4) Honourable Sashi Kiran Honourable Premila Kumar Honourable Tomasi Tunabuna - Member; and Honourable Semi Koroilavesau - Member. - Deputy Chairperson; - Member; On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend this Review Report to Parliament and request all Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report. MR. SPEAKER.– Vinaka. Please, hand the Report to the Secretary-General. HON. S. TUBUNA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a motion, without notice: That a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU. - Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. Review Report – Sugar Research Institute of Fiji 2016-2021 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Research Institute of</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>1364</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 Fiji 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports. The Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) was established in 2006 as the premier provider of research, development and extension services in the sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, SRIF has the national mandate for the development and dissemination of technology and information needed for increased productivity, profitability and sustainability of the sugar industry in Fiji. During the scrutiny of the Annual Reports, extensive communication was made with the Officials from SRIF through public hearing and site visit. This Review Report highlights some of the pertinent findings emanating from the scrutiny of the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji 2016-2021 Annual Reports, as follows: • • • • • absence of KPIs and Strategic Plan; unapproved sugarcane species which are widely used by farmers; SRIF has not been fully engaged with the farmers in crop diversification; aged cane varieties and ratoons that are less productive and susceptible to diseases; and overlapping of roles carried out by SRIF and FSC regarding the extension services. At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Member who were part of the team that produced this Report: - Deputy Chairperson; (1) Honourable Sashi Kiran (2) Honourable Premila Kumar - Member; (3) Honourable Tomasi Tunabuna - Member; (4) Honourable Semi Koroilavesau - Member; and (5) Honourable Aliki Bia - Alternate Member. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend this Review Report to Parliament and request all Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report.
